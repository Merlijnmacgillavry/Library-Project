The project took a positive design approach to see how it could contribute to the community well-being of a disadvantaged neighbourhood, specifically the teenage boys in that neighbourhood. Theory on community well-being was used to evaluate how this was present in Feijenoord, a neighbourhood in Rotterdam South that challenges with poverty, crime but also the stigmatisation of a ‘bad neighbourhood’. When exploring Feijenoord and its people, inspiration came from how the teenagers were often mentioned as the cause of nuisance, litter and crime on the streets, making other residents feel less safe in their own neighbourhood. Instead of designing something against these teenagers, the aim was to design for them: why are their activities on the street meaningful to them, what do they value and how do they feel about how they are perceived by others? How could design contribute to their well-being and, through that, the community well-being of the neighbourhood? This was done by creating a toolkit and workshops for youth workers to guide teenagers in discovering their talents.","community well-being; teenagers; talents; disadvantaged neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, G. (mentor); Van Wingerden, J.W. (mentor)","2016","In order for wind energy to become a well established source of alternative energy that is able to compete with the traditional forms of energy production, the costs of (offshore) wind energy should be lowered. This can be achieved by either increasing the energy output of a turbine or by reducing its production and maintenance costs. Current research on lowering the costs of energy of wind energy is conducted by multiple fields of engineering. In the field of structural engineering great effort is put into creating more accurate structural models of the turbine and the surrounding environment, such as the soil-structure interaction. Having more accurate models of the turbine potentially lowers the turbines costs by using a less conservative design when optimizing the system or by extending the lifetime by better understanding the applied loads to the system. In the field of control engineering there is a focus on control techniques which increase the energy output of the turbine or actively reduce the forces which act on the turbine. Integrating the controller and structural design into a single optimization routine is a heavily investigated area in other, less conservative, fields of engineering. Currently, little research focuses on applying this principle to wind turbine design. This research was partly conducted in collaboration with the SIEMENS wind power Centre of Competence in The Hague, to provide a framework for simultaneously redesigning the controller and structural parameters of their state of the art, multi-megawatt, offshore wind turbine and to define the key limitations of this framework. In order to meet this goal a framework has been presented that allows for simultaneously varying both structural and controller parameters of the wind turbine design. The framework allows one to find an combination of the controller and structural design parameters which optimize the overall performance of the turbine. This is achieved by evaluating the overall system performance in the frequency domain, while simultaneously optimizing over all tunable parameters. The capabilities of the method have been demonstrated on two design cases. In the first case a simple academic problem was optimized an the performance of the framework was analysed. The framework of simultaneously varying the structural and controller parameters is also applied to a commercial, state of the art, multi-megawatt, offshore wind turbine. The integrated design framework allows for varying physical properties of the structural model, in this case the wall thickness of the support structure. The derivatives of the mass and stiffness matrices of the turbine’s equations of motion are computed. Thereby obtaining a sensitivity description of the structural dynamics to the wall thickness. These derivatives are used to relate a change in wall thickness of tower elements to a change in the structural properties, and thereby the dynamical behaviour, of the entire wind turbine model. With the number of in- and output channels in the framework being linearly dependent to the number of states of the turbine model, the full turbine model description complicates the application of the integrated design framework. Therefore, the overall model of the wind turbine is reduced to capture only the relevant structural dynamics of the system. By using the reduced basis of the original system the derivative matrices are reduced, while keeping the dependency to the change in wall thickness parameters. This makes it possible to change the system dynamics, through wall thickness changes, while using a reduced number of in- and outputs in the framework. The integrated framework is used to design the rotor-speed controller parameters of the system, which is limited by the dynamics of the structural turbine model. The structural dynamics limited the overall performance of the system in two ways. First, a further increase in the frequency peak of the sensitivity function describing the closed loop system, is bounded by the designed performance weight. Second, due to the presence of right half plane zeros in the transfer function of the pitch angle to rotor-speed. A further increase of the system bandwidth is not possible due to controller limitations. Using the integrated design framework it is possible to minimize the net wall thickness of the tower elements in the turbine model and thereby changing the location of both the resonance frequency and the right half plane zeros. It can thus be concluded that the integrated wind turbine design, using the framework as shown in this work, allows one to optimize the structural and controller parameters simultaneously. Fundamental limitations in the controller design are analysed and used for redesigning the system for an increased overall performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Knowledge workers are “part of institutions that determine and shape the work that is done” and within such institutions, leadership, working environment, organizational culture and job design should create conditions that facilitate knowledge workers to perform (Megill, 2013; Antikainen et al., 2006.) Essential to the success of a knowledge intensive-organization are not only the knowledge reserves of the workers, but also what an organization is able to do with the latter (Drucker, 1999.) Wall et al. (1992) explain that a worker’s performance is equal to ability * opportunity * motivation, where if one of the factors is equal to zero, performance will be zero. Contrasting to the industrial age, organizational wealth and growth no longer relies on abundant raw materials but on knowledge workers’ performance, which can be the greatest determinant of the worth of their companies (Brocke & Rosemann, 2010.) However, despite the need for attention, knowledge work is yet to have had a researcher in the like of Frederik Taylor or Henry Ford to radically improve knowledge worker performance. Knowledge work is not easily observable or measurable (Matson & Prusak, 2010,) tasks are not fixed, and in contrast to manual work, there are no standard production time where tasks are performed differently among workers. A brain’s performance cannot be measured based on brain cells devoted per tasks, or creativity and there is no direct correlation between units of labor and units of output (Ramírez & Nembhard, 2005.) This means that rather than applying the common theme found in the Taylor- and economic productivity- approach which use universal performance measures to improve performance, knowledge worker performance is considered too difficult to measure, where up to today, there are no well-known universal effective and practical methods to measure knowledge worker productivity (Davenport, 2014; Hammer, et al., 2004; Ramírez & Nembhard , 2004; Davenport et al., 2002; Paradi, et al., 2002; Drucker, 1999.) The challenge in improving knowledge worker performance lies in a necessary shift in management mindset where despite differences to manual workers, knowledge workers “are still being managed with methods that were developed in the industrial age” (Davenport, 1996.) According to Megill (2013) this is the biggest problem who states that one cannot make knowledge using industrial modes of management and production, “it just does not work.” Therefore, more research was required concerning how an organization can create conditions that facilitate knowledge workers to perform.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Van Soest, A.J. (mentor)","2016","There are still important knowledge gaps regarding stability and safety of bicycle riding. Every year around 60,000 people need hospital treatment for single sided accidents in the Netherlands alone. Supporting the need for understanding lateral bicycle dynamics. One of the prominent disturbances on lateral bicycle and rider behaviour is pedalling. However, although there is a good understanding of the determinants effecting the forward or propulsive behaviour of the bicycle associated with pedalling, the effect on the lateral bicycle and rider behaviour is still poorly understood. This study focusses on determining what the effect of pedalling is on the lateral behaviour of the bicycle-rider system. This determination is three fold. First the nature of the pedalling disturbance and parameters influencing it is ascertained. This is used to develop a pedalling disturbance model which can be easily applied to any dynamical bicycle-rider model, by applying harmonic external torques on the steering and roll of the bicycle. Secondly the direct response of this pedalling disturbance of the bicycle-rider system is ascertained for a variety of models and cycling conditions. This is achieved by applying the pedalling disturbance to multiple bicycle-rider models for multiple cycling conditions. Methods, with various model complexity and solution approaches, are evaluated. Based on this evaluation we propose a simple and effective method of analytically obtaining a periodic solution based on a linearised time-invariant bicycle-rider system. This periodic solution represents the open loop lateral bicycle response corresponding to the periodic pedalling disturbance. Thirdly the overall effect of pedalling, the closed loop response, is ascertained using experimental data. Specific cycling conditions are chosen to validate the open loop response of the model, since these cycling conditions should be only minimally effected by control. The experimental data corresponding to other cycling conditions are explored for parameter dependence and influence of control and upper body motions. The nature of the pedalling disturbance is now understood. The pedalling disturbance is determined by vertical and the forward acceleration of the left and right leg centre of mass, the leg mass, the hip width and the cadence. This motion of mass promotes roll and yaw disturbances, where the yaw disturbance can be translated to a steering disturbance by bicycle parameters defining yaw-steering coupling. The direct lateral response and the overall lateral bicycle-rider behaviour due to pedalling are explored. This uncovered parameter dependencies of the bicycle-rider system, differences due to rider upper body movements, rider control and cycling conditions such as forward speed and cadence. We developed and validated a simple method of ascertaining the direct effect of a pedalling disturbance on the lateral behaviour of a bicycle-rider system. This is done by applying harmonic steering and roll toques to an easily obtained time-invariant linearised bicycle model. Some bicycle-rider combinations exhibit resonance behaviour due to pedalling within the normal cycling range, this model could be used to slightly change bicycle design parameters such that this dangerous behaviour is avoided.","bicycle; dynamics; pedalling; disturbance; rider; model; lateral; cycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Splicing technology is used to create fuselage panels due to the maximum width of the aluminium sheets of 60 inches as a result of the production process. A set of designing rules is required for the design of a spliced Glare fuselage resulting in a significant increase in complexity. Friction stir welding of the thin aluminium sheets in Glare results in larger Glare panels where the maximum dimensions are limited by the size of the autoclave. FSW Glare could result in reduced weight and production cost, and perhaps as well as having enhanced mechanical properties. But welding defects could occur which will compromise fatigue properties. Fatigue and damage tolerant properties of FSW Glare with welding defects are investigated, and recommendations are given in this thesis. Friction stir welding generally does not produce defects that are common to conventional welding technologies, such as warping and porosity. Instead unique defects can occur, such as the zig zag curve or lazy S defect, where the oxide particles of the aluminium are present in a concentrated form. Another typical form of defect is the tunnel defect, also know as the channel, cavity, or void defect. A physical channel is present in the cross section of the weld, which is not visible looking at the surface of the welded sheet. A similar defect is the groove defect where the absence of material is at the surface which makes it visible and tangible. Nevertheless, friction stir welding is a robust process where a wide range of welding parameters result in a defect free weld. Friction stir welding results in much more favourable fatigue properties compared to conventional welding methods, and S-N data lie well above the FAT40 design curve. Welding parameters, such as welding speed and tool pressure, as well as tool geometry play an important role in fatigue properties. Defects as a result of improper welding parameters have a large impact on fatigue properties. Surface properties of the weld also impact fatigue properties; post machining the rough surface results in improvements. Static properties are also favourable with friction stir welding. Two sets of FSW sheets with a welding defect are available for testing both in single sheet and FML form. Artificially damaged sheets are produced to model a welding defect and tested in both single sheet and FML form. This data is compared to standard 2024-T3 in single sheet form, and standard Glare in FML form. Both fatigue and static tests are performed. The Ccg and ncg coefficients derived from the single sheet 2024-T3 specimens deviate quite a lot from the Ccg and ncg coefficients derived from the Forman equation. Using the latter would have resulted in inaccurate comparisons of other single sheet FSW and Artificial Defect specimens. The single sheet FSW 0.3 – 0.4 mm specimens have a kissing bond defect, which resulted in degradation of fatigue performance. This defect was present, even though the welds on the sheets looked flawless. The single sheet FSW defect specimens show a significant drop in fatigue properties, but that is primarily due to the reduced cross section thickness of the weld. Correcting this data to the real thickness, or real stress, results in a substantial improvement, where some specimens even have the same fatigue properties as that of standard single sheet 2024-T3. The results are surprisingly favourable considering the visual state of the FSW sheets. The single sheet Artificial Defect groove specimens show the most reduction in fatigue properties. Standard Glare has a shorter crack initiation life than single sheet 2024-T3, but a much longer crack growth life resulting in an approximate doubled fatigue life. The worst case scenario is tested with the FML Artificial Defect severed weld specimens. Fatigue life is comparable to single sheet 2024-T3 at high stress amplitude, but fatigue properties are comparable to standard Glare at low stress amplitude. All other FML types perform between these two types of FMLs. The biggest degradation in fatigue occurs at high stress amplitude, whereas fatigue performance is comparable to standard Glare at low stress amplitude. The exception is FML 0.3 – 0.4 mm, which even performs slightly better than standard Glare. The reason is that the cross section of the centre FSW sheet was 0.35 millimetres, whereas it is considered as if it were only 0.3 mm. Fatigue properties of different types of material is much smaller in FML form than in single sheet form. The FMLgrow model predicts the fatigue life most accurately at low stress amplitude with a fatigue life that is 70% of the measured value. The least accurate prediction is at high stress amplitude with a fatigue life that is about 25% compared to the tested specimen. Crack initiation in the centre layer of the FML occurred only faster than in the outer aluminium layers with the Artificial Defect groove specimens, where the groove acts as a stress riser. The centre fatigue crack in this case is not longer than the fatigue crack in the outer aluminium layers when the latter reaches its final value of 2a = 50 millimetres. This is visible in the C-scan result where the delamination pattern doesn’t exceed the final crack length value in the outer layer. The outer crack, after initiation, catches up with the centre crack, and then all cracks continue to grow at the same rate. Crack growth rate in FML reduces after initiation to reach a minimum value before increasing again. Crack bridging is less efficient when cracks are small, and the discontinuity due to the notch are the reasons for this initial high crack growth rate before reducing to a minimum value. Exponential growth as a function of half crack length was observed in the FML specimens, resulting in the following expression: da/dN=C_exp·a Cexp is an intrinsic fatigue property of an FML as are the Ccg and ncg coefficients for single sheet. Different basic fatigue calculations can be performed. Modeling and understanding of crack growth in Glare can be facilitated knowing this relation, since exponential growth is an intrinsic fatigue property in an FML. Plotting the logarithmic Cexp as a function of linear Sa yields a relation similar to the S-N relation. Exploration of the FMLgrow model to account for the differences between its predictions and measured data resulted in the understanding that the Alderliesten model is flawed due to interdependency of the aluminium layer with the glass fibre in the (W-2a) region, resulting in an incorrect Kfarfield. Ktip?Kfarfield+Kbridging Glare is considered as a structure where the primary load is carried solely by the aluminium sheets. Hence the feasibility of FSW Glare is based on the fatigue properties of FSW single sheet. Single sheet FSW with a defect shows more degradation in fatigue performance than the FML variant. Therefore using single sheet performance to evaluate feasibility of FSW Glare result in a stricter selection of what defects can and cannot be tolerated. At the same time will the stricter selection not result in a heavier structure; only damage tolerance will benefit. 90% of the initiation and crack growth life of 2024-T3 is chosen as an arbitrary value for the requirements of the FSW sheets. This means that 90% of the fatigue life of 2024-T3 is required. None of the tested specimens fulfill this requirement. Zero defects are not feasible in reality; an example is the presence of air inclusions in Glare. Defects in FSW are continuous and occur only as a result of incorrect welding parameters. Therefore there is no validation in the discussion what type of FSW defect can or cannot be tolerated; FSW sheets should not have any welding defects at all for Glare application.","FSW; friction stir welding; damage tolerance; Glare; FML; fibre metal laminate; fiber metal laminate; fatigue; crack growth; splicing; aluminium; 2024-T3","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Design","","Engineering Design","",""

(mentor); Bouwer, L. (mentor); Giardino, A. (mentor); Van Rooijen, A. (mentor); Van Vuren, S. (mentor); Vousdoukas, M. (mentor)","2016","During the last years, flood risk assessments at continental and global scales are emerging as useful tools for risk hotspot identification, support for international policy-making and harmonization of strategies for climate change adaptation. The emergence of these models comes to cover the growing demand for integrated, large-scale risk assessments in fluvial and coastal settings, requested by actors such as international organizations and insurance companies. These stakeholders are alarmed by the increasing prospects of flood risk, driven by climatic and social variability. Despite their eminent usefulness and promising nature, these large-scale models are strongly limited by high levels of simplification in terms of process detail, hazard and inundation methodologies and outcome detail. This aspect of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty due to lack of knowledge and modeling abstraction) in the flood risk assessment chain remains largely unaccounted for in continental and global scales. Uncertainty quantification is, therefore, needed at the large scale, as a means to communicate risk more effectively and increase model validity. In light of this, this study aims at providing insight on the underlying epistemic uncertainty of a continental-scale coastal flood risk model. Having LISCOAST, an integrated, coastal flood risk assessment framework for Europe currently in development at JRC, as a basis and following the definition of flood risk as a product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, this thesis develops an analysis framework that examines multiple sources of epistemic uncertainty in the risk assessment chain. The developed algorithms examine four main sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely the inundation algorithms, the interaction of different hazard components, the way flood defenses are modeled and the assumptions behind the use of depth-damage functions. The impact of these sources to the modeled Expected Annual Damage (EAD), for present and future scenarios, is evaluated in a case study that expands upon two scales: a regional application in Faro, Algarve, Portugal and an international application in the Iberian Peninsula, covering the coastline of Portugal and Spain. The developed analysis framework is broad and readily able to be generalized in the native model scale, i.e. in the European coasts. The quantitative results of such an analysis serve a twofold purpose: not only can they lead to major improvements in future versions of LISCOAST, but they can also give general recommendations for improving the design approach of large-scale coastal flood risk models and communicate their potential and limitations more effectively. At the same time, they act as a point of departure to spark discussion in the risk modeling community on the large uncertainties that underpin large-scale flood risk assessments.","coastal flood risk; uncertainty; sensitivity analysis; risk assessment; direct damage; Europe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In order to deal with issues related to the fundamental quantities of a power grid system (frequency, voltage and current), smart grid systems have been introduced to ensure that specific parts of a network are not overused against others. A smart grid system includes a series of communication technologies for every step between the generation and the consumption domains. Different smart grid mechanisms have already been tried and tested within the energy market. In this study, a co-simulation platform for smart grids (ValueFlex) was developed and tested, combining a demand-side management (DSM) tool and a load flow analysis (LFA) tool with the scope of regulating voltage levels in low voltage (LV) networks. The overall goal of the ValueFlex platform is to enable users to manipulate the available flexibility of smart devices in a power system in order to address issues related to its topological characteristics. In this project, a small LV network with households (HH), heat pumps (HP) and cold storage (CS) devices powered by photovoltaic (PV) and combined heat and power (CHP) units is being tested under a series of configuration scenarios. The main conclusion drawn from this study was that a co-simulation platform can assist voltage control currently being done by transformers and generators. In addition, this study focuses on the development of a model within ValueFlex for a CS device with the purpose of using it in simulation scenarios and approximating the functioning of a real-world device in a smart grid system.","power grid; cold storage; device modelling; flexibility; voltage regulation; load flow; demand-side management; smart grid; distributed generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Ertsen, M.W. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis is an attempt to contribute to the understanding of urban water systems through the use of the urban metabolism (UM) framework. By developing steady-state models with STAN, a software used for material flow analysis (MFA), the urban water flows are quantified and analyzed as they enter the system boundary and are transformed by anthropogenic processes. Such a model has been applied to a specific urban water system in the town of Palomino, Colombia, to research the main barriers and opportunities for a sustainable urban water system. The area under study corresponds to a system boundary of 4.83 km2, and the analysis was performed for the year 2015. A detailed examination of Palomino’s water system was established based on primary data collection through survey processes, mapping, and semi-structured interviews. Based on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the water system, a conceptual urban water metabolism (UWM) model was created to identify the critical flows of the water system through a monthly (31-day) analysis based on fourteen scenarios, each including four variables: Touristic season, Hours without electricity per month, Percentage of water losses due to pipelines leaks, and Percentage of water losses due to user’s behavior. Subsequently, a definition of sustainable urban water management system (SUWMS) was generated based on a literature review and an industrial ecology perspective, wherein the system is analyzed using a holistic, system thinking approach. Guided by the SUWMS definition and the local conditions of Palomino’s urban water system, various sustainable water technologies and initiatives are introduced as a set of potential solutions to shift the current water system towards a SUWMS. Finally, the potential of the sustainable water supply technique of rainwater harvesting to influence the current UWM of Palomino was assessed by identifying changes in the UWM for three key years: 1969, a year of extreme rainfall; 1997, a year of El Niño phenomenon characterized by extreme drought, and 1987, a year of ‘standard’ precipitation. The analysis was based on a critical scenario with the highest water losses and water demand. The rainwater harvesting collection capacity was determined by a storage capacity of 2000 L per household, while taking into account water consumption (water demand) per household between rain events on a monthly basis analysis. This condition implied that, even though the analysis was based on steady-state modeling, a semi-dynamic analysis was performed based on the variations of the stored rainwater volume (∆V) between the time intervals determined by the rain events per month (∆t). One of the most significant results is that the applied methodology proved to be successful in terms of understanding water systems—not by the traditional approach of modeling based on average values, but rather by using scenarios that explain the variations and dynamics in the water systems. The changes in the UWM are then understood by the use of signals (e.g. positive and negative values) to determine the metabolic changes and water needs of the urban systems. This methodology could be applied in a larger context, especially in developing countries that have limited data to undertake a statistical analysis.","Industrial Ecology; Urban metabolism (UM); Urban water metabolism (UWM); Material flow analysis (MFA); Sustainable urban water management systems (SUWMS); Rainwater harvesting; Data poor locations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","","11.24, -73.56"

(mentor)","2016","Atherosclerosis (from Greek – athera means gruel, scerlosis means hardening) is a desease that causes many cardiovascular diseases. It’s a complex biological proces evolving over the course of a few decades. In the endothelium (the surface of cells covering the blood vessel wall) of large and medium-sized arteries changes appear, which cause an inflammatory reaction leading to the growth of a plaque, narrowing the artery. Finally a piece of the plaque breaks off and blocks an artery downstream, or the plaque breaks open, causing a blood clot which blocks the artery. Downstream of the blockade the tissue starts to die. The phase of plaque growth is studied, where geometries of the plaque and it’s effect on blood flow are being examined specifically. A direct coupling with the exchange of blood parts is not considered. The effect of shear stress however is incorporated, being a major influence in the development of the disease. A differential equation is used, which describes the rate of change of the artery radius as a cosine, decreasing exponentially in time. With rough estimations of the Navier-Stokes equations, describing the flow of fluids, a parabolic flow velocity profile is found being valid only for mild plaque growth. An expression for the wall shear stress is found as well. The differential equation is expanded by adding a coupling between the shear stress and plaque growth. It is given that high values of the wall shear stress give almost no plaque growth, where as low values result in more plaque growth. After basing the parameters on available data about the aorta and plaque growth, different differential equations are being solved numerically with the fourth-order method of Runge-Kutta. By varying the influence of shear stress, using other functions than the cosine and exponential growth in time, a model is found describing a asymmetrical plaque which – in accordance with reality – grows slowly in the beginning, but speeds up in growth during time. Unrealistic still is amongst others the parabolic and always positive flow velocity profile and – related – only high values of wall shear stress. In order to describe the plaque growth more realistically, the flow velocity profile is presented as a piecewise fourth-order polynomial, resulting in high values of shear stress in the converging section of the plaque and low values in the diverging section. An integral equation, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, is combined with the flow velocity profile, resulting in a differential equation for the flow velocity in the centerline of the blood vessel. The numerical solution of this equation is combined with the earlier described cosine form of the plaque, delivering information about seperation of flow and the shear stress. The latter has high values in the converging section and values around zero directly after the highest point of the stenosis. However, these low values appear only from a critical value of the Reynolds number. With these values a part of the flow seperates, leading to a recirculation area. To add growth in time, the static model is combined with the differential equation used in the beginning of the study. In the chosen environment of the aorta no seperation evolves, which raises questions about the validity of the chosen parameters and the model. Further investigion is essential, with the need of more complex models, to be able to say more about the form and growth of the plaque and the influence of shear stress.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Chandarr, A. (mentor)","2016","The life expectancy of humans increases due to better medical care, food quality and personal hygiene. The demand for domestic robots performing (simple) household chores will increase as consequence to this trend. An important task of these robots is recognizing objects within an environment. Object models are constructed using multiple views from various viewpoints in order to increase the recognition robustness and reduce the influence of noise such as variation in illumination. The objective of this thesis is the construction of a novel viewpoint dependent model for multi-view object recognition. A benchmark is created in order to evaluate novel object recognition models for multi-view object recognition. The acquisition of object data is replaced by a scientific captured object dataset, which reduces the influence of external noise (i.e. illumination) and unequal view distributions. Edges, corners, shape, color and texture features are extracted, which describe the object data mathematically. Artificial noise is added for the construction of query objects, which are classified via the Euclidean distance measure. Based on sequence alignment, a novel viewpoint dependent object model is proposed and evaluated. Each view in a viewpoint dependent object is represented by a single value based on the location of that view in a kd-tree. The proposed sequence alignment algorithm matches objects via the optimal alignment of view sequences. The benchmark results show that multi-view sequence alignment has a higher object recognition rate compared to single-view object recognition. Novel object data is captured by moving a hand held Kinect camera around an object. A visual odometry method is implemented, which estimates the camera egomotion from registered depth and color. The ground plane is extracted from the depth data for the initial camera alignment and object segmentation. A viewpoint dependent object is constructed from the estimated egomotion and segmented object data. For object recognition each object is captured twice, where object variation occurs by changes in lighting and unequal distributed views. The scientific object datasets are replaced by the novel captured object datasets for evaluation of the object recognition performance. The benchmark results show an increased object recognition rate for the sequence alignment algorithm, despite the influence of external noise factors.","object recognition; sequence alignment; viewpoint dependency; visual odometry; egomotion; plane segmentation; object model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Robotics Institute","",""

This thesis report describes the state of the art in maintenance- and related reliability engineering that is used to obtain a step-by-step method for ’in house’ Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP) alterations. A summary of the proposed method in a single figure can be found in fig. 5-1. The method first contains a business part where organizational alterations and regulations are mirrored against some common Maintenance Steering Group (MSG) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) approaches to combine into a Maintenance Review Board (MRB)-cycle that can be applied to the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF). Secondly, a reliability analysis part that uses RNLAF life data from all 8 types of aircraft is designed with use of Weibull and Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) theory. This combines into a 11-step model that closely follows aviation regulations and that should give the associated reliability engineers within the RNLAF the necessary tools to start assessing the AMP of aircraft that fall under their responsibility. Finally, the model is tested with two cases. The 125hrs lead-lag link inspection of the AH-64 Apache and the hydraulic pumps of the CH-47 Chinook proved to be sufficient examples to apply and verify the method. Life data is analyzed and all the steps of the model are performed, which has resulted in advice to change the 125hrs interval to 250hrs and to apply an inspection/replacement interval to the hydraulic pumps in order to proactively monitor the wear and preventively replace the pumps to reduce corrective downtime.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Allseas Group S.A. has made a name for itself in the field of offshore pipelaying and subsea construction by staying innovative. The company has six specialized vessels operating worldwide and the biggest vessel in the world is almost ready for operations. One of the company vessels is the Solitaire and lays pipe using the S-lay installation method. This method allows fast installation together with the applicability to lay pipe in a wide range of water depths. A stinger, a space frame structure consisting of welded circular hollow sections, is designed to prevent excessive bending of the pipeline while laying. This structure is attached to the vessel and after the pipe joints are welded on board they leave the vessel horizontally guided by the stinger. A known failure mode of the stinger structure is fatigue. Fatigue can be characterized as a mechanism whereby cracks initiate and grow in a material due to fluctuating stresses. For the stinger these fluctuating stresses originate from environmental loads, mainly waves. Although Allseas has already developed an inhouse fatigue assessment procedure for the stinger structures to calculate fatigue life, there is an interest in gaining a more fundamental understanding of multiaxial fatigue phenomena with respect to stinger joints. This leads to the following research goal: “The goal of this research is to gain a more fundamental understanding of the multiaxial stress field for a stinger structure and in the end improve the fatigue assessment.” Allseas has performed real time strain measurements on a tubular joint of the Solitaire stinger and already used the data for validating their fatigue assessment (Korakidou, 2013) and evaluating the Stress Concentration Factors (Zhao, 2010). In this study the nominal strain data of two braces were decomposed into three load components: axial forces, in-plane bending moments and out-of-plane bending moments. Their time histories are used as load input for a 4-noded shell finite element model of the stinger joint under investigation. The change of principal stress direction during loading around the braces-to-chord connections was researched, for this is an indication of the stress state multiaxiality variation which could lead to multiaxial fatigue. The saddle and in-between locations showed variations of 20 degrees or more, which is seen as a threshold, for two boundary condition sets analysed: all fixed ends and a combination of pin-rollers. Furthermore, the chord saddle location showed an 18 percent higher Hot Spot Stress for axial loading when principal stresses were used for extrapolation compared to primary stresses perpendicular to the weld toe. The hypothesis that this difference is due to a deviation in principal stress directions between extrapolation locations has been investigated. In order to achieve this, 13 simple T/Y-joint configurations with varying joint parameters were analysed in Femap through its application programming interface. The focus was only on the chord saddle location with axial loading and the chord ends were fixed. Although it was found that joint parameters β, τ and θ have an effect on the difference of principal stress directions between extrapolation locations A and B, no noticeable difference was found between the Stress Concentration Factors of the two extrapolation methods, leading to the conclusion that other factors cause the difference in Hot Spot Stress. Lastly the ratio of Stress Concentration Factor(SCF) to Strain Concentration Factor(SNCF) has been investigated for the same 13 T/Y-joint configurations. This ratio showed to be dependent on the individual joint parameters with values varying from 1.17 to 1.30. Based on the results it can be concluded that the in-between locations around the welded connection showed to be most prone to multiaxial fatigue based on the change in principal stress directions during loading. The difference in Hot Spot Stress between extrapolating principal stresses and primary stresses perpendicular to the weld toe cannot be explained by a difference in principal stress directions, so further research should be done in order to find the actual cause. Nevertheless, based on the results it can be considered conservative to use the principal stresses. Lastly, when converting strains to stresses by using a standard value of 1.20 for the SCF/SNCF-ratio this can lead to a too conservative fatigue life estimation in case the real ratio is lower and vice versa.","multiaxial fatigue; principal stress direction; Hot Spot Stress; Stress Concentration Factor; snf-ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this work, topology optimization is used to obtain optimal designs with minimal compliance as the objective. The checkerboard problem, refers to a resulting optimal topology where the material is distributed in regions of alternating solid and void elements. It has been shown that these regions emerge due to higher stiffness of the checkerboard patterns compared to the stiffness of uniformly distributed material. In this work a study is performed on the feasibility of non-traditional finite element formulations to deal with the checkerboard problem. Two alternative finite element formulations were studied in this work. The main focus is given to the p-version of the finite element method, also referred to as p-FEM. In addition, the mixed-enhanced formulation of Kasper and Taylor is discussed briefly. These finite element formulations will be compared to the formulation commonly used. In this thesis the main research question is: Can the use of alternative finite element formulations in topology optimization be used to solve the checkerboard-problem? In this thesis is is shown that the p-FEM does prevent checkerboards when elements with polynomial order p greater equal to 2 are used. When even higher-order elements are used the final designs do not change significantly compared to p=2. It was found that computational time increases significantly with the element order, without an increase in the design resolution. The mixed-enhanced formulation does not alleviate the checkerboard problem. Although small changes in design are found compared to standard Q4, checkerboards are still observed. Finally it has been shown that local p-refinement can be employed to locally alleviate checkerboards. Two strategies have been introduced, which based on the element densities, are able to locally change the element orders. Checkerboard-free designs are obtained using the minimum number of higher-order elements as possible. Although the concept of local p-refinement was proven, the presented methods are not yet optimal. An increase in computation time is observed and user specified tolerances were used. Hence, there is still room for improvement.","Topology optimization; checkerboards; p-FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","PME","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

As a result, long periods of absenteeism can cause a great effect on society, since The Netherlands is largely dependent of service work. Since this it is an organisational problem the Frame Creation Process offers an appropriate structure to this project, as the intention of this process is to find new approaches (new thinking frames) to today’s problems organisations encounter. The main goal of this project is to give service workers an opportunity to cope with stress in the work environment with an enduring effect, in order for them to enjoy daily life and have an restful work-life balance. In order to apply the Frame Creation Process, the organisation a.s.r. insurances is used for a case study. Insights in the problem of burnout was mostly gained by focussing on the experiences with stress of employees. By doing observations, interviews and a generative session I discovered that underlying values of employees are ‘freedom’ and ‘appreciation’ and that the existing interventions a.s.r. offers to cope with stress, do not meet these values. In fact, the organisation implemented a ‘standard package’ of interventions to improve employee’s well-being. Since every employee experiences stress in a different way, they are mostly not stimulated to use any intervention. The underlying factors of the problem could be translated into possible new thinking frames. For each frame an ideation process was done where I gained insights from people in my environment. The frame and corresponding concept which had the most potential to meet the values ‘freedom’ and ‘appreciation’ was chosen for evaluation. Frame: if it is a problem of feeling free to express yourself, then the work environment should provide a mediator to share what employees have on their minds and to strengthen bonds between them. The concept to evaluate this frame is called ‘2link’, a digital screen where employees can draw and write on. This intervention aims to stimulate employees to express themselves freely, by providing a set of figures and colours. For example by sharing thoughts, playing games, surprising others, employees will know what is going on among co-workers. A model was used to perform a test in the work environment of a.s.r., with the duration of one work week. The main goal of this test was to find out if employees felt free to express themselves by using the model and if it helped them to cope with stress with an enduring effect. Markers and stamps of symbols were included with the model. To stimulate employees to use the model the text ‘What is on your mind? Write is down or draw it.’ was placed on the top of the model. Also, to stimulate employees, they had to see that it would be appreciated if they express positive and negative messages, so emoticons were included with both positive and negative facial expressions. The use of the board was considered most valuable. Interviews and a questionnaire was used to reflect on the use of the model. The test results showed that in general, employees felt free to express both negative and positive messages which were all were accompanied by emoticons. From the interviews is became evident that not all employees were stimulated to express themselves through the model, because it did not fit their personal preference to do so. Besides, employees did not see a connection between the use of the model and coping with stress. This also became clear from the results of the questionnaire. With this said, the goal of the frame is only partially accomplished. In order to find out if the intervention could help employees to cope with stress with an enduring effect, the test period should be significantly longer than a week. In the future, more iterations are needed to improve the concept. It should be further tested how to stimulate more employees to express themselves. Also, it should be tested if a digital prototype of the concept would have the same effect as the model. It should be explored what the possibilities are to incorporate a function for HR to process what employees put on the screen in order to detect conflicts in the work environment and to respond to those. With this project I hope that organisations will get inspired to be open to new approaches this process can provide, to solve the complex problems of today.","stress; work environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The system is composed of two bands connecting the HCP and the patient, a patch for monitoring and a processing component called Abacus. Companion uses multivariate input, SpO2, RR, HR, acceleration, movement and location to look for several cues and redundant evidence of events such as falls and heart attacks, the patient might experience. The system automatically informs the specific HCP responsible of the patient when the latter is experiencing one of these events. The events are categorized as low and high Degree of Need of Assistance (DoNA) depending on their severity and urgency. By sending the warning to the HCP instead of triggering an audio warning in the facilities of the hospital and informing beforehand of the severity of the event (low/high DoNA event), the HCP is subjected to less mental fatigue (American Nurses Asso¬ciation, 2002; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2007). During a low/high DoNA event, the patient’s and HCP’s bands generate visual, audio and haptic stimuli to trigger different emotions and actions to each of them. On one side it comforts and reassures the patient during the incident, on the other, it provides precise information needed to assist the patient to the HCP. Knowing the HCP will accurately and immediately respond in case of DoNA event, allows the patient to feel more secure, therefore more motivated to move and do activities by himself, enhancing the relation between HCP and patient and a better outcome after hospitalization. The collected and processed data used for monitoring the safety of the patient can be used to monitor mobility and health. The data is available on demand by the HCP and can give feedback about the progress of the patient as well as to create new tasks such as tracking medicine intake and locating the patient.

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor); Vreugdenhil, H. (mentor)","2016","Emergence: In April, 2016, DoorMeal celebrated its first-year anniversary. It all started when Hannah Vreugdenhil drastically changed her unhealthy lifestyle, trading it in for a mindful and healthy lifestyle with a focus on fitness and nutrition. She shared her experiences on Instagram and people showed interest in what she was eating. Consequently, she decided to share her passion for delicious and healthy food, and DoorMeal B.V. was born. Since its inception, DoorMeal B.V. is part of Changing Life, a mother brand of various other brands that support living a fit lifestyle. Since then, DoorMeal has grown in employees, delivery area, meal variants and online followers (24.5K on Instagram and 8,000 likes on Facebook). DoorMeal uses mainly Instagram as its promotion channel to interact with its customers and prospects. Challenge: So far, the DoorMeal’ brand awareness has been driven by the power of Instagram. So, if someone is not actively involved on Instagram, that person will not likely know DoorMeal. That is why DoorMeal wants to explore the possibilities of using other channels to gain more brand awareness. While doing so, it is important to build a strong brand for DoorMeal to enhance its competitive advantage. Therefore, DoorMeal’s brand values need to be made explicit and further developed to be relevant to a larger target audience. Finally, it is important to have a shared mental model within the company to communicate a coherent message. This coherent communication will create a favourable impression and motivate DoorMeal’s customer segments to purchase a DoorMeal. Assignment: DoorMeal wants to know whether it should focus on the customers in the Netherlands or Amsterdam for market expansion. Therefore DoorMeal’s prospects should be fully understood in order to create a relevant value proposition. Branding guidelines are needed to translate these values and build a strong brand, distinguishing itself from its competition. Finally DoorMeal will receive a roadmap of actions to boost their brand awareness and branding guidelines for further development of the brand. Accordingly, the challenge can be stated as follows: “How can a strong brand be created for DoorMeal to foster competitive advantage and generate sustainable growth?” Process & results: First, the company was researched through participatory research in the preparation and delivery process and daily conversations with the founder and CEO of the company. In that way, the processes, strengths and weakness of the company were identified. Second, several studies were done to understand and analyse the external environment of the relevant users, competitors, trends, and developments to identify opportunities and threats for the company. This contextual analysis resulted in an explicitly modified brand strategy with branding guidelines, new positioning and the identification of customer segments. Finally, an action plan based on two detailed concepts was set out to create a stronger brand for DoorMeal, with a greater competitive advantage and steps to grow the company in a sustainable way.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","Embedded Software appears in a variaty of systems and products. The software for these systems have special requirements. Firstly, embedded software needs to be very robust as it is usually deeply tucked away and not very visible to the user. Secondly, embedded systems have dedicated hardware the software has to work on, and finally embedded systems can have real-time contraints. The C programming language is the most popular programming language for these kinds of systems and meets the requirements. Two disadvantages of C are that it is hard to create higher-level abstractions to solve the problem at hand of the programmer, and it is easier to create bugs compared to more modern languages. To solve these disadvantages we propose the MetaC language, which extends the C language with domain specific extensions tailored for embedded systems. The MetaC compiler compiles MetaC code, including the C language and the extensions, to C code. What extensions can be designed to be helpful for embedded software developers? MetaC implements the C language and adds the following extensions: 1) A bit-fields extension for declaring a bit-fields layout with names and use those names to manipulate the bits instead of using logical operators. 2) State machines to encode the state behavior of a system with new syntax and semantics. That makes it possible to generate state machine diagrams. 3) A concurrency extension for communication between concurrent processes with channels using CSP-style semantics. The extension can generate a model for the PAT model checker. 4) An error handling extension adding error handling constructs that are missing in the C language. Functions can return a new type that indicates the function can return an error. The type system forces programmers to handle the errors of those functions. The MetaC compiler is implemented using the Spoofax Language Workbench, which also provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with common IDE features. The design goals are to implement the extensions in a modular way, to allow separate development of extensions, and to integrate into C as much as possible to give a C feel to the extensions. A BaseC module implements the C compiler while separate modules implement the extensions. The modules are composed into the final MetaC compiler. What are problems implementing MetaC with Spoofax? To reach the design goals several issues had to be solved implementing MetaC with Spoofax. These issues include determining the precedence of new expression operators, composition of scoping rules for new language constructs, and reusing existing name binding rules for new extensions.","Spoofax; C programming language; extensions; domain specific languages; embedded software","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","","",""

A deluge of systems and applications now support the daily activities of employees and managers alike, thus increasing the amount, value, and sensibleness of available data. This abundance of data provides new opportunities for applications development, where more and more data is shared and reused to enable new functionalities, to unlock novel insights about the enterprise or its personnel, or to improve on aspects such as employee engagement, productivity or sociability. At the same time, data sharing poses new challenges. Data is often used for purposes that are different from the original design, and there is a pervasive need to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and third party policies. What is more, employees might find the increased use of personal data undesirable, and therefore demand proper transparency and control over their personal data. This works tackles the technical challenges that come with the sharing and usage of personal data by enterprise-class applications, and provides a framework for privacy aware data sharing. In a literature survey we investigate several disciplines related to privacy, access control management, and provenance in computer systems, to determine the current state of the art and practice. The study provides the conceptual underpinning for a novel data model that facilitates a privacy aware way for applications to share data while still providing transparency, simplicity and control to users. The model is then implemented in a new enterprise-class platform, a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider that centralises privacy and consent management related functionalities. The model and framework are then validated through interviews with IBM employees having different roles within the organisation. The quality of the resulting implementation is validated by means of a set of scalability tests, with the goal of demonstrating the actual suitability of the proposed solution in a realistic enterprise context.","privacy; access control; authorization; infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Computer Science","",""

Whereas a product innovating company needs to be proficient in all phases of innovation, the front-end has a great importance on the overall innovation performance (Khurana & Rosenthal, 1998). Current models that help to structure this phase follow a linear approach. The author argues that these do not capture real-world practices well and to increase research and development productivity, an alternative solution is needed. Therefore a design science research methodology is applied to design an innovation support framework based on the Cyclic Innovation Model (Berkhout et al., 2006) in this paper. Moreover, a research gap is addressed by combining Technology Readiness Level (TRL) definitions with an innovation model. The operationalized innovation support framework helps practitioners in the activity of maturing an idea to a compelling business proposition. It helps turning implicit decisions about the product concept into explicit choices.

(mentor)","2016","At the Space Engineering (SpE) department of the Delft University of Technology performance testing of micropropulsion systems is done using the Delft Aerospace Rocket Thrust Stand (DARTS) facility. The DARTS facility has a need for a new improved test stand which can measure the thrust performance of the in-house developed micro-thrusters. The work presented in this Master thesis report addresses this need. This report shows the validation process of a test stand capable of steady-state thrust measurements in a range of 0.1 to 15[mN]. The AE-TB-5m thrust bench is selected to provide these measurement capabilities. The AE-TB-5m test stand has been re-assembled, improved and discrepancies in its measurement characteristics have been successfully identified and solved. A new calibration process for the test stand has been developed to provide full automation in order to mitigate any inconsistencies due to human influence. Furthermore, the measurement accuracies are determined and are found to be below 0.036[mN], which fully complies with the target requirement of 0.1[mN]. The test stand measurement capabilities have been successfully demonstrated in both an atmospheric and vacuum environment using the heritage T3 Micro Propulsion System (T3μPS) thruster test model originating from the Delfi-n3Xt CubeSat mission. Moreover, an empirical relation for the estimation of a loss factor on the thrust coefficient due to viscous effects in low Reynolds number nozzles has been evaluated. The results of this analysis shows improved correlation with experimental data in vacuum conditions and for Reynolds numbers between 5500 and 10000 when compared with ideal rocket theory. The feasibility of an experimental bell-shaped micro nozzle produced using a novel microprecision additive manufacturing technique has been evaluated. The nozzle shape showed a nearly perfect correlation between the designed bell curve and the manufactured product. An axially symmetric bell nozzle of this micron scale is considered a unique engineering accomplishment. The nozzle throat shows incompatibility with a high vacuum environment resulting from inspection with an electron-microscope. Despite a collapsed throat, a leak path trough the throat is successfully identified using the AE-TB-5m, again demonstrating its operational capabilities. The test stand is considered fully operational and ready to enable thrust measurements of other micropropulsion systems at the DARTS facility.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Mugge, R. (mentor)","2016","Mobile phones are undoubtedly an important part of our daily lives and activities. With the avid use and rapid upgrade patterns of mobile phones in current consumer lifestyle comes a wasteful disposal process. The high speed at which mobile phones are left for obsolescent makes the electronic waste problem that they bring with them a target of high concern. There is a strong need for solutions that elicit a shift from linear production and consumption processes to circular systems. The concept of circular economy aims to work towards an industrial and economic system that is restorative by nature, designing out waste to function in a regenerative and closed-loop consumption system. Circular economy is a burgeoning concept within businesses, and subsequently Vodafone Netherlands sought out to explore its opportunities for user-centred design solutions within the circular economy way of thinking. The main challenge of this thesis project concerns stimulating consumers to display more circular behaviour through Vodafone’s design strategy. Circular behaviour in this context revolves around driving users to engage in consumption behaviour that falls in line with guidelines of circular economy theory, while still catering to the needs and desires of users regarding mobile phone use. This report documents the complete design project in how this central challenge was tackled. The project consists of three main phases: analysis, synthesis and the final design strategy. During analysis, the current problem context was critically analysed to see where growth opportunities lie. Key insights derived from this analysis showed that users are becoming more price conscious, open to lower-end devices and most importantly, desire flexibility in a rapidly changing industry. Moreover, product-service-systems are key for circular economy propositions. The most relevant circular interventions that can take place on a business model level focus on facilitating repair & circling longer, and providing access to a service rather than a product itself. The final phase of analysis saw the creation of a conceptual framework built around circular intent and behaviour. This showed that circular intent is formed by internal, social and external factors but are halted by inhibiting factors. The external and inhibiting factors showed where growth opportunities lie for Vodafone in their circular services. In the synthesis phase, the input from analysis was translated into meaningful design directions. By looking at the input from analysis through the eyes of two polar opposite type of users, six design challenges were formulated. These were then converged into three directions for concepts using validation from an internal stakeholder co-creation session at Vodafone. Subsequently, a first roadmap towards circular behaviour containing two short-term concepts and one long-term vision was created, wherein the short term visions are necessary gradual steps in shifting consumption behaviour patterns towards circularity. The two shorter term solutions were tested for user feedback through two surveys that were sent out to Vodafone post-paid consumers, receiving 2.954 responses in total. The results from these surveys were analyzed using SPSS, and the insights gained were used as input to redesign these two concepts into iterated versions. The final design strategy of this project describes a high-level roadmap towards circular behaviour for Vodafone. The first concept, Inruildeals 2.0, focuses on redesigning Vodafone’s retention service to help close the consumption loop. The second concept is titled Phone Boost, and functions as a service check-up for users to make use of their devices longer and focuses on encouraging circling longer in the consumption loop. For these first two concepts, service design blueprints have been graphically elaborated upon to show how the services practically take shape. The final vision, Always Connected, is a future vision wherein current linear user contracts are restructured into an all-encompassing circular customer journey. The final outcome of the roadmap gives short- and long-term advice to Vodafone’s Strategy department in what high level actions need to be taken to implement these three concepts to stimulate users to engage in circular behaviour through Vodafone’s design strategy.","circular economy; circular behaviour; design strategy; service design; Vodafone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

In this study the limits and most promising configurations for the feed-in of solar heat from consumers have been investigated. The results have been evaluated in terms of total annual solar gain, solar gain per collector area, solar fraction, CO2 reduction and costs. To make sure the results are applicable to more than one network, several Dutch district heating networks and building types have been used to design a network model in Matlab and Simulink. In order to reach high solar fractions, the integration of storage is analysed as well. Three test networks have been used to show the influence of different building types. They contain 50 to 150 consumers which can all be adapted for different years of construction. These test networks have been chosen in such a way that their absolute heat losses are similar. However, the total demand varies due to the different types and amount of consumers. The simulations show that the economically best scenario is found for 400 m2 collector area placed at one apartment building and a 50 m3 buffer. In this scenario 22% of the annual heat demand of 150 consumers is replaced by solar heat. Based on the current consumer heat price the pay back time of the solar system is 14 years which seems promising. More importantly it can be avoided that 500 GJ of heat is produced in fossil fuelled kettles, especially when combined with smart buffering.","district heating; solar collectors; heat storage; decentralized energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Guedon, A.C.P. (mentor)","2016","With the provision of essential surgical care millions of lives can be saved and this realization has reached the international agenda. There are however many obstacles that make it hard to provide safe, qualitative, affordable and accessible surgical care to the more than 4.8 billion people for whom this is currently out of reach. One of the obstacles is the lack of medical equipment that is suitable for use in the harsh environment found at the district hospitals. Problems that could be expected at the district hospital are the shortage of consumables, the lack of spare parts, the lack of a steady electricity network, financing problems and a shortage of qualified surgeons and technicians. The goal of this project is to: design a user-friendly, robust and easy to maintain electrosurgical unit that can safely be used by surgeons and clinical officers at the district hospitals in low- and middle-income countries The electrosurgical unit (ESU) is a device that can be used during many surgical procedures and it would be a welcome addition to the operating rooms (ORs) in these district hospitals. The ESU is however accompanied with its own set of problems. A problem with electrosurgery is that the underlying principles of electrosurgery are not widely known, even though it is a very common surgical technique. In addition to the lack of knowledge, there is the problem that the existing devices are very complex due to the lack of standardization in user-interface, the brand specific names for power and waveform outputs and the wide range of available instruments. To aid personnel in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) that have limited training possibilities, the focus has been on reducing the complexity of the ESU by only providing the necessary functions on the interface. The minimum set of requirements necessary for an ESU to be safe and effective is unknown. However, data from surgeries performed at Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis (RdGG) and Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) made it possible to get some insight in how the power settings and modes are used during surgery. It showed that surgeons are free to use the instrument, mode and power setting they prefer. No rules or strict guidelines exist on its use. At LUMC different settings were used for similar surgeries performed at RdGG, so the assumption can be made that the preference for certain power settings is hospital specific. To simplify the interface it was chosen to introduce pre-set power settings. In the new design only four different power settings can be selected that do not show its corresponding value in Watt, but an intensity level. The interface also provides the option to connect a monopolar instrument, a dispersive electrode, a bipolar instrument, a foot pedal and a choice between two coagulation modes. A questionnaire was used to determine if the users would trust the new interface design, if they perceive it as safe and to find out whether the interface has been simplified too much. Two surgeons, one resident and 13 OR assistants have filled out the questionnaire. It could be concluded that staff from RdGG had trouble trusting the new design due to the inability to set precise values. Whether this is because of the limited power settings or because they do not like to see a device they are used to change was not clear. More research is needed to identify the functions that are truly indispensable on the ESU and which ones could be eliminated in order to reduce the complexity of the ESU. To get meaningful feedback from the intended users it would be best to speak to them directly and on scene. During this project it was decided to focus on only one component of the ESU. To make the ESU more suitable for use in LMIC there should be done more research for each component separately. It should also be noted that the differences in resources and such between LMIC are enormous. If the challenges in designing an appropriate ESU have been overcome, there are still problems to expect. To be successful local support and training is needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BioMedical Engineering, MIMS","",""

(mentor)","2016","Pigs (pipeline inspection gauges) are free moving piston-like devices, that are used for inspecting or cleaning pipelines in for example the oil and gas industry. Here they are used for onshore and offshore pipelines, where they are propelled by the production fluids. A better control of the velocity of the pig in the pipeline can be achieved by using so-called bypass pigs, which have an opening (bypass) that allows that some fluid passes by which reduces the pig velocity. A new development is a by-pass pig with speed control, in which the bypass area is adjusted when the pig moves through the pipeline to obtain a constant preset pig velocity. The goal of this research was to accurately describe the forces on a pig, with special emphasis on the friction between the pig and the pipe wall. Such a wall friction model can be used in pipeline simulation tools, that are used to prepare a pigging operation. The friction force is divided into two parts: (1) the normal force that the pig imposes on the pipeline wall (F_wall), and (2) the coefficient of friction (?) which converts F_wall to a friction force. F_wall is calculated by a non-linear finite element model for a 12"" sealing disk for a range of oversizes. A uniaxial tensile lab test was performed to fit the material coefficients used in the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin material model. It was shown that the results could be matched by a linear elastic analytical model with a correction factor Cor = 1.45. An experiment was designed to measure both ? and F_wall for a range of pig disk oversizes. These values were measured for sealing disks with different thicknesses and made of different materials. The models were able to accurately describe the experiment results. Due to lubrication the coefficient of friction can drop by orders of magnitude. Lubrication can be described by the Reynolds equation for the fluid pressure of thin fluid films. The material of a pig that makes contact with the pipeline wall is deformed by this fluid pressure which can be described by soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. To couple the linear elastic material of the sealing disk to the non-linear Reynolds equation, two numerical approaches were followed. Firstly, the linear elastic contact was described by a row of closely spaced linear springs. Secondly a lubrication model was made in which the linear elastic contact was described by the boundary element method. It was shown that these models give a good qualitative description of the lubrication behaviour. The model validation is left for future work. In addition, pressure drop measurements were performed in a flow loop for a model of the bypass pig. These measurements were compared with correlations from the literature.","bem; pig; friction; winkler; bypass; greenwood-wiliamson; ehl; pipeline; lubrication; experimental; numerical; analytical; fem; flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The CSD650 is the largest cutter suction dredger produced by Damen Dredging Equipment (DDE) in Nijkerk. To provide for a wider range of clients, the CSD will be used in more coastal conditions. Therefore, it is important to study the behaviour of a cutter suction dredger in waves. In this context the following research question is formulated: ’What are the operational limits of a CSD650 in waves and, how do harsh environmental conditions affect the important structural parts of a CSD650 over time?’ To be able to answer these research questions, the possible failure mechanisms are stated. Secondly, a linear frequency domain model is build that incorporates all forces acting on the CSD. A twelve degree of freedom model is built in MATLAB and uses DELFRAC potential software to calculate the frequency dependent added mass, damping and wave forces. All the other forces on the CSD are stated as linearized inertia, damping or reaction forces. The ladder of the CSD is treated as a Morison element to calculate the wave forces on the ladder as for the hydrodynamic forces. When the whole equation of the system is known, the equation of motion can be solved to get the Response Amplitude Operators of the system. Using transformation matrices the RAOs of the centre of gravity of the barge can be transformed to the RAOs of the spud cage. When the mechanical properties of the spud pole and soil interaction are known, the relation between spud motions and stresses can be determined. This relation allows for calculating a stress RAO for the spud pole. In combination with any given wave spectra, so called stress spectra can be determined. Using the statistical characteristics of these stress spectra, important statistical quantities for the stress response can be derived. Firstly, the probability that a stress cycle amplitude exceeds the yield stress which leads to plastic deformation of the spud pole. With the help of fatigue curves and the Miner rule the fatigue damage, caused by different combinations of significant wave height and peak period, can be calculated with this spectral method. However the model seems to overestimate the values of the fatigue damage and yield stress exceedance probability. It is therefore advised to validate the model with real life measurements.","cutter suction dredger; frequency domain; fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Hydromechanics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) took the final investment decision to develop the Prelude gas field using the world’s first Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility. FLNG poses some new technical challenges. For example, as the vessel is moored to the seabed, it is subject to movements induced by waves, winds and tides. Therefore, flexible instead of rigid risers are used to bring the gas from the seabed to the surface. However, these risers are limited in diameter. For Prelude each flowline is connected to a single riser. In new future projects it might be beneficial to have a single (larger diameter) subsea flowline at the sea floor which is split into two or more flexible risers. This flow split is complicated as gas wells produce a multiphase mixture of gas, hydrocarbon condensates and/or water. There thus is a need to understand how the different phases will distribute over the multiple risers, and how this will influence the whole operation. In previous lab experiments [1], a horizontal symmetric impacting T-junction was used to divide the multiphase mixture from the horizontal flowline into two vertical risers. It was found that at low gas flow rates, for which the flow regime in the risers is hydrodynamic slug flow, non-symmetric distributions in the phase split are the rule rather than the exception. These maldistributions exhibit transient behaviour, and exhibit hysteresis. However, in gas production from dry fields with low Liquid to Gas Ratios (LGR), the gas flow rates generally are higher and the flow regime in the vertical risers is annular flow. In this flow pattern, liquids flow in the upward direction and no liquid buildup occurs at the riser base. As annular flow is more stable in time, it is expected that for these conditions the phase splits are evenly distributed over the two risers and no transient behaviour is present. The main aim of the present study was to verify the hypothesis that if the gas flow rate is sufficiently high to sustain annular flow in both risers the phases will distribute evenly. Thereto experiments were performed in the Severe Slugging Loop (SSL) at the Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam. The loop consists of a 100 [m] horizontal flowline connected via an impacting T-junction to two 1.25 [in] diameter vertical risers of 16.8 [m] height. The facility is operated with an air-water mixture at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. As the SSL is not equipped with flow meters to measure the phase flow in the risers, a new method is developed to identify maldistribution in the phase split. In two phase flow in a vertical riser, the flow rates in the pipe are not uniquely determined by the pressure drop. However, in the current dual riser experiments the total flow rate in the setup is known. It is found that, with the use of single riser benchmark data and visual inspection, one can distinguish between an equal and an unequal phase split. Experiments are performed to test the stability of the phase split, and the effect of hysteresis for various gas and liquid flow rate combinations. It is observed that five different states exist for the flow split in the single flowline dual riser geometry. Out of these, only two are stable, which occur on opposite sides of a certain gas flow rate transition point. This point is identified as the minimum in the pressure gradient curve for a single vertical riser. This minimum can be linked to the transition from churn flow to annular flow. In addition to the experiments, a computational model is proposed to predict the phase split. In this model, the Shell Flow Correlations (SFC) for multiphase pipe flow are used to propagate the boundary conditions of the system from the riser tops to the corresponding outlets of the splitter at the base of the risers. Next, all possible phase splits which satisfy the extended Bernoulli equation and the conservation of momentum in the splitter are identified. The model conserves mass implicitly. The extended Bernoulli equation is implemented as the Advanced Double Stream Model (ADSM) [2], the control volume approach is used for the conservation of momentum. All three sub-models assume 1D steady state fully developed flow in the different parts of the geometry. By imposing different back pressures on the risers, for a constant gas and liquid flow, the model can generate phase split curves. These are compared to experimental data available in the literature and experimental results by Van de Gronden. It is found that the write-up of the derivations in the original ADSM paper [2] contains typos or errors. Therefore we have derived new relations, but they do not exhibit the same behaviour as the modelling results presented in the paper. From the comparison with the experimental results, it is concluded that the proposed computational model, which assumes 1D steady state fully developed flow, predicts a much too symmetric phase split. The modelling effort has not yet resulted in a reliable for the phase split prediction model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","","",""

This causes an increasing demand for healthy and protein-rich food, putting pressure on food producers to increase their volumes. Sometimes this goes at costs of quality, or even safety. As a result more food safety incidents occur. Therefore the control of food and feed safety and quality is very important. This makes it possible to discover (potential) safety hazards earlier, so measures can be taken. RIKILT is a research institute that controls food and feed safety and quality in order to ensure safe and healthy food for European citizens. Additionally they conduct fundamental research to improve the control of food and feed safety. RIKILT is also a European and national reference institute for different fields of expertise. This gives them a leading role for these subjects within the Netherlands and Europe. RIKILT also contributes to food and feed safety and quality by assisting other analytical laboratories to improve. This is done by their Laboratory Quality Service (LQS). The LQS was established in 2010 to generate a new source of income after the income from governmental projects was decreasing. The services of the LQS consist of organising proficiency tests, selling reference materials, providing inspiring and interactive trainings for professionals and giving advice to other laboratories. The LQS has a wide variety of customers, coming from over the whole world with different roles within the laboratories they work for, but the number of returning customers is rather low, thus the LQS wants to improve the customer loyalty. This can be done by becoming more customer-oriented. The LQS should improve on expectations management to get a better understanding of the customer. As a result the LQS will be able to fulfil the needs and wishes of the customer, leading to a higher customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. To get a better understanding of the customer a service is designed for the LQS. The service consists of a tool, a laboratory assessment and the introduction of a quality label. A laboratory assessment will be done online to get a good description of the current situation and knowledge level of the customer’s laboratory. The focus of the assessment will be on one field of expertise at the time. In this way the LQS can discover the real needs and wishes of the customer. The results of the assessment will be submitted in the tool. A visual storyboard will be created that describes the current situation. The tool will calculate a quality label when all items of the assessment are added. This will be used to set up an action plan. The tool will give suggestions which items need improvement to achieve a higher quality label. This will be done by comparing the scores of the customer with the predefined minimum scores per quality label. When the customer completes the whole action plan the customer will receive the new quality label as a certification of accomplishment. The service design will help the LQS to increase customer loyalty. The tool enables the LQS to communicate in an inspiring way. The storyboards contribute to the customer relationship, since they show the customer they are going through the process of improvement together with and guided by the LQS. The real needs and wishes of the customer will be addressed, since the LQS knows what the current situation of the customer is and knows what needs improvement in order to reach a higher quality level. The LQS offers a personalised solution as a set of actions, making use of the services from the LQS and measures that need to be taken by the customer itself. The needs and wishes of the customer are addressed, which will lead to a higher customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The quality label motivates the customer to improve. The customer will be able to achieve a higher label, even when they are not ready to apply for an official accreditation. A higher label can be achieved by completing the action plan developed by the LQS. As a tangible result the customer will receive a tile representing the new quality label as a certification of accomplishment. RIKILT LQS is dedicated to ensure safe and high quality food and feed by guiding analytical laboratories with personalised solutions through the use of proficiency tests, reference materials and inspiring and interactive trainings for professionals. RIKILT and the LQS are internationally oriented, they have a lot of expertise on different laboratory-related subjects and by using the proposed service design they will be able to understand and address the needs of the customer. This will make the LQS the perfect partner for analytical laboratories when they want to improve their quality level.","Laboratory; Quality; Service; Design; Customer-oriented; Customer loyalty; Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Özcan Vieira, E. (mentor); Lammersen, R. (mentor)","2016","Two years ago, ATAG developed the Fusion Vulcano wok burner for stir-frying on gas. With this product, ATAG presents itself as cooking brand with a focus on cooking experience. ATAG wanted a similar product for stir-frying on induction, since there is no comparable solution for stir-frying on induction yet. ATAGs current induction wok hob lacks the appearance and experience they are looking for and have reached with the Fusion Vulcano. On top of that, their current induction wok hob is being phased out, so there is a strong need for a new way of induction stir-frying. Nowadays consumers often buy a combination hob that combines the Fusion Vulcano wok burner with induction cooking zones. Because of this, they still (partly) use gas for cooking. Besides this being a less energy-efficient way of cooking, more and more new houses do not have a gas supply available anymore in the kitchen (e.g. the so-called All-Electric houses[1]). This problem asks for a new solution for induction-based stir-frying. Since induction stir-frying is quite different than stir-frying on gas, research is done to identify the desired emotional experience and aesthetic quality of the product and to make sure the meaning of the product is communicated correctly. Next to that, the solution needs to be technically sound. The design brief is therefore formulated as follows: “Investigate, design and engineer a qualitative and distinctive solution for stir-frying on induction, that is unparalleled in the current market and increases the cooking experience, where the ATAG Fusion Vulcano burner is the benchmark.” Extensive user research showed that induction stir-frying comes with some limitations when comparing it to gas stir-frying. There are three main issues: the lack of feedback, the clinical feeling of induction and the fact that stir-frying on induction asks for a somewhat different approach than stir-frying on gas. The lack of feedback results in a decreased cooking experience. There is no flame that you can hear rushing, can see the size of and/or can feel the heat from. On top of that, the controls on induction hobs often make the user feel out of control and are perceived as quite abstract. This causes feelings of doubt, frustration and nervousness and makes the interaction feel slow, mediated and gentle, which is the opposite of what you want to achieve with stir-frying. Also, the glass plate is perceived as fragile which limits some users in using their wok in a dynamic way. For induction stir-frying it is also unbeneficial to lift the wok, since this results in a temperature drop caused by a temporary loss of the magnetic field. Induction cooking actually has a lot of advantages over gas. It is therefore chosen to design with the qualities of induction cooking, instead of trying to decrease its limitations when comparing it to gas stir-frying. And in this way, creating a way of stir-frying that is unique for induction, but also fits the general concept of induction cooking. By doing this, the design is more likely to become an integrated whole instead of being a gas-oriented product which is compromised to also work on induction. The analysis and ideation phase led to the development of the ATAG Caldera. The ATAG Caldera is a combination of a wok and adjusted induction hob to deliver the envisioned stir-fry experience on induction. It consists of a wok zone that is designed to fit the core of a round-bottomed wok. Since only the core of the wok falls into the wok zone, a magnet is placed underneath the coil to give the wok extra stability and to provide a more controlled movement of the wok. The envisioned interaction with the wok is described as ‘active static’; being able to actively move the wok in the wok zone without lifting the wok. Lifting the wok would result in a temperature drop within the wok, which can be disastrous for the end result of your stir-fry. Since the magnet is continuously pulling the wok downwards, this should subconsciously demotivate the user to lift the wok. The wok zone provides some extra functionalities for the user. At first, it offers the possibility to stir-fry based on a set temperature instead of on a power level. The temperature sensor in the wok zone is always pressed to the bottom of the wok by a spring, sensing the temperature of the wok and comparing this to the desired temperature. The hob will continuously alter the power to keep a constant temperature within the wok, which makes it easier for the user to reach a successful stir-fry result. A second extra functionality is the possibility to transform the wok zone into a regular induction zone. By placing a conductive disk into the wok zone, the hob can also be used with large flat-bottomed frying pans, making the hob more flexible. The design is evaluated with a non-functional, realistic prototype to evaluate the user experience. The product was received very well, especially on the terms surprising, inviting and unique. Improvement points are the experience of safety and reliability, mainly caused by the interface and the conductive disk. The improvement points are mentioned in the recommendations, as well as other possible directions for further development.","stir-frying; induction; user experience; wok","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2016","The FinancialServices(FS) industry of advisory is inter- ested in the agile methodology and its practices. There are two reasons for this interest: first of all their clients, banks, are interested in these methods for their process management. Second, in order to keep up with the competition they need be up to date with new methods and knowledge. The assignment was to look for inter- esting applications of the agile philosophy within FS advi- sory. Advisory X has two main activities: client projects and internal projects. Through an interaction analysis of interviews is found that internal projects are not agile at all. The internal project interactions show that there is a lack of cross competency collaboration, lack of transparent commu- nication from partners to consultants, an individual mindset and a lack of overview. Moreover there is little attention for internal projects, because of the strong focus on direct profitability of client projects. This focus on client work is enforced by the current evaluation system, where mainly is looked at the percentage that consultants spent working for a client. A look into the working hours of FS consultants showed that 46% of their time was spent on client projects, leaving 54% for other activities than client work (from July-December 2015, for FS advisory). The 46% spent on client projects does not come near the aimed goal that consultants spent 70% of their time working for a client. There is no insight or overview on the activities performed in this other 54%. This shows a large opportunity for agile management of internal projects, as time in between client projects is short and tasks need to be done in small sprints. A transparent overview will contribute to insight and grip on these hours. Furthermore cross competency collab- oration and working in dedicated teams will benefit the productivity and quality of hours spent on internal projects. To create insight in these activities, this project has first defined an ideal future scenario. After this a tool was designed to facilitate agile management of internal projects. The future scenario relies on the creation of an internal scoring system with so called “internal project points”. These points can be earned when finishing internal projects within a small team of consultants. These points can be exchanged for learning and development train- ings. This facilitates a dedicated team environment, where consultants work cross competency, where communi- cation between partners and consultants is transparent and where there is an overview on internal projects. The tool facilitates the future scenario and is partly based on existing agile tools, as encountered in the liter- ature review and interviews. It exists out of two parts: an internal project board and a virtual team board. The first is a physical board that provides an overview of all internal projects in FS advisory. The latter is a virtual team board, a team app, that provides overview of ongoing activities and connects team members any place, any time. These tools are openly available for any FS consultant to stimulate transparent communication. Furthermore there is a plan proposed for the implemen- tation and recommendations are made for the tool. The tool is prototyped in the form of a whiteboard including instructions for the use of the board. Moreover there was a pilot set up with consultants involved in the current block chain initiatives to take the first step in using the internal project board. The concept of internal project points will be continued with the advice of testing in small steps, in order to iterate quickly. The goal of this tool is to provide a stepping stone for agile management of internal projects. Another goal is that the tool facilitates and sparks the discussion about the value of internal projects within FS advisory X. The concept of internal project points helps to create insight into the lost 54% of consultants time. It manages consultants time more effectively by providing a stimu- lating team environment, where there is a clear focus, even across competency. The consultants are being valued and noticed for all their hard work at advisory X, including internal projects.","agile; advisory; design; tool; internal projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Borota, D. (mentor); De Vet, C.P.M. (mentor); Noordstrand, A.M. (mentor)","2016","Localization is vital for a ship’s hull maintenance robot such as the Fleet Cleaner robot. Not only is it key for automation of the robot, but it is also required to guarantee coverage and to produce inspection reports. Previous work on the position determination focussed on the under water localization and left the above water section as a partially open problem. For above water localization, standard techniques will not suffice due to the strict environmental and operational constraints and requirements. Hence the main goal of this thesis is: ""design an above water position determination system for a ship’s hull maintenance robot"". This goal is approached in three steps: conceptual design of the absolute above water setup, development of the proposed solution for the absolute above water localization, and development of the relative localization. In the conceptual design phase the optimal sensing principles are identified. Utilizing the constraints and requirements a solution is proposed: radio based time-of-flight measurements. The most decisive factors were the robustness to adverse weather and the low complexity. Sensors will be placed on beacons that will be used for underwater localization. A simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm is proposed to track the robot, allowing calibration of the beacons, which serve as position references, to be performed online. This is advantageous for meeting operational time constraints. For the proof of concept, further theoretical and experimental analysis is conducted. The main sources of error in range measurements are found: clock drift, dependency on received signal level, antenna performance and temperature offset. A two way timing policy, a correction based on the estimated power level, guidelines for antenna placement and a temperature based compensation are found to reduce these errors. Localization experiments using these methods on a 0-7 m range resulted in a maximum error of 0.3 m and on a 0-30 m range in a maximum error of 1 m. The experiments provide a proof of concept for tracking of the robot and online calibration of beacons. Relative sensors are applied to increase accuracy. The available systems are: a wheel encoder, an inertial measurement unit and the control signals. A mathematical model for movement on a flat surface, applicable to both wheel encoder and input model, is presented. Uncertainty in the vessel’s geometry makes formulation of a mathematical solution for the movement on curved surfaces a key problem for future development. The most important requirement for the future development is identified: the execution of experiments that resemble maintenance operation on full scale. Combining this with a mathematically formalized comparison of algorithms will lead to better estimation. The recommendations form a roadmap to the realization of a position determination system on operational scale.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","This graduation project aims to develop an orthosis for patients suffering from a reduced Range of Motion (RoM) of the ankle joint. The reduced RoM is in dorsiflexion direction, the patient lacks the ability to turn the foot in the direction of the knee. This gait pattern is known as drop foot gait. This results in a low walking speed, increased energy cost and risk of falling. The approach for the Negative Stiffness Orthosis is to compensate the increased passive stiffness of the ankle with a negative stiffness. The Negative Stiffness Orthosis(NSO) was designed, build and evaluated. The novel orthosis is tested for its physical properties, the measurement of the torque-angle relation, weight and size. To test the walkability, a case study was performed on a healthy test subject. This study suggests that this NSO potentially benefit patients with increased passive stiffness in the ankle joint during walking.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Visser, H.G. (mentor)","2016","Runway capacity of a complex runways system can be limited by several factors. Currently, the runway usage at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is described by a preference list established by multiple stakeholders. It makes an important trade-off between minimizing noise exposure to the environment and maximizing capacity. The existing model does not take into account fuel burn and the ensued emissions for the current and future demand in flights. This study tries to address this issue. A model has been developed using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) by which flights can be allocated to runways, while optimizing for fuel and noise. The research has the following research question: Can fuel burn be significantly reduced for aircraft operating at Amsterdam Airport by utilizing a novel flexible arrival and departure runway allocation model, using a predefined set of variables and rules, accounting for noise annoyance, runway capacity and the current and future demand of flights? The runway allocation model developed for this study is able to assign aircraft to runways based upon an optimization trade-off between fuel usage and noise exposure to the environment. Selecting a shorter flight- or taxi route may result in lower fuel burn and emissions, while separation- and noise regulations are maintained. A multitude of scenarios is simulated using the allocation model. Different runway configurations are tested. Additionally, different peak moments varying during the day are compared to see when flexible allocation is feasible and most profitable. A set of Pareto optimal solutions can be evaluated in order to determine the most optimal runway allocation distribution. The conclusion that can be drawn from this research is that flexible allocation can have significant impact on both fuel usage and emissions, while adhering to the current regulations. Depending on the flexibility of available runways, mainly restricted by separation- and noise regulations, runway demand, local conditions and maintenance, savings are possible. For scenarios where there is room for flexibility, savings are evident. For restricted scenarios, due to wind- or visibility conditions, potential savings exist, although to a lesser extend. The level of runway demand plays a role, as most flexibility and potential savings are obtainable during off-peaks. Annual savings can amount to significant fuel and emission reduction. The described runway allocation tool has the generic abilities of being scalable to wide variety of airports and their characteristics. Other airports, a larger set of aircraft and aircraft types, different arrival and departure operations can all be added to the model due to the generic characteristics. This aids further research and eventual application of flexible arrival and departure runway allocation in the aviation industry.","runway; allocation; capacity; MILP; linear programming; Schiphol; airport; scheduling; optimization; fuel; noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Transport & Operations","",""

(mentor)","2016","A novel intelligent controller selection method for quadrotor attitude and altitude control is presented that maintains performance in different regimes of the flight envelope. Conventional quadrotor controllers can behave insufficiently during aggressive manoeuvring, in extreme angles the quadrotor is unable to maintain height which may result in loss of performance. By implementing several controllers designed specifically for these more extreme manoeuvres it is possible to maintain performance while expanding the flight envelope beyond conventional limitations. The method proposed uses Q-Learning to learn which controller performs best in different scenarios. The controllers that can be used consist of a low angle Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) controller and a specialised high angle NDI controller that tries to prevent actuator saturation by controlling height through the pitch and roll angles. The algorithm is split into 2 parts. During the off-line training phase the quadrotor learns a baseline policy that can be used on-line to skip the initial exploration phase. The resulting policy is a clear representation of controller selection throughout the flight envelope. The success of on-line implementation is highly dependent on the quality of the simulation model. In the on-line phase the policy is mostly exploited and learning is done at a much lower rate. Finally it is shown that reinforcement learning is a very effective way to tune complex systems. The complex system dynamics do not need to be known, only important performance parameters need to be correctly formulated in a reward function.","reinforcement learning; q-learning; quadcopter; adaptive control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Kober, J. (mentor)","2016","In control, the objective is to find a mapping from states to actions that steer a system to a desired reference. A controller can be designed by an engineer, typically using some model of the system or it can be learned by an algorithm. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one such algorithm. In RL, the controller is an agent that interacts with the system, with the aim of maximizing the rewards received over time. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully used as function approximators in RL algorithms. One particular algorithm, that is used to learn various continuous control tasks, is the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The DDPG learns two DNNs, an actor network that maps states to actions and a critic network that is used to find the policy gradient. The policy gradient is subsequently used to update the actor, in the direction that maximizes the rewards over time. A disadvantage of using a DNN as function approximator is the amount of data that is necessary to train such a network. Data, which is not always available or can be expensive to obtain. An advantage of DNNs is that they can cope with high-dimensional state and actions spaces, something other (local) function approx- imators are less suitable for. State Representation Learning (SRL) is a technique that is typically used to lower the dimensionality of the state space. Instead of learning from the raw observations of the system, SRL is used to map a high- dimensional observation to a low-dimensional state, before learning the RL task. The main idea is that the learning algorithm first learns how to extract the relevant information from the system, before it learns to control it. In this thesis two algorithms are designed, the Robotic Prior Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RP- DDPG) and the Model Learning Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ML-DDPG) that both combine SRL with the DDPG algorithm, with the aim of improving the data-efficiency and/or performance of the original algo- rithm. The two algorithms differ in the type of SRL method that is used. The RP-DDPG uses a concept known as the Robotic Priors, which describes a desirable structure of the state such that it is consistent with physics. The ML-DDPG learns a model of the system. The algorithms are compared on three different benchmark problems. For each benchmark, various ob- servation vectors are “designed”, to simulate different ways of how the information about the state of the system is communicated to the agent. In our experiments, the RP-DDPG is unable to learn two out of three benchmarks problems and requires 4 times more data on the third problem. The ML-DDPG is more success- ful, it outperforms the original DDPG on one benchmark and performs similarly on the other two. In general, the DDPG and the ML-DDPG do not learn state-of-the-art policies. When the task is to track a certain reference signal, the controlled system has a steady-state error and/or significant overshoot for some of the reference positions. It does, however, learn reasonable policies under very difficult circumstances. It can learn (to some degree) to ignore irrelevant inputs, deal with a reference position that is given in a dif- ferent coordinate system than the configuration of its body and learn from high-dimensional observations. Most importantly, it does so, without the need to specifically design or alter the algorithm to deal with these challenges. In a final experiment, the ability of a DNN to generalize what it has learned to examples that differ sub- stantially from examples that it has seen during training is investigated. This ability is what sets a DNN apart from other function approximators and is believed to be the reason why DNN can cope with high- dimensional observations. In the experiment, it is shown that the actor can generalize its policy, i.e., it can produce a control action for observations that differ substantially from observations it has seen during train- ing. Furthermore, the experiment support the claim that a DNN is able to generalize, by learning individual factors that each contribute to the control action independently.","Deep Learning; Reinforcement Learning; State Representation Learning; Optimal Control; Artificial Intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","As smaller satellites hold many advantages over their larger counterparts, such as reduced production, testing and launch costs, the cubesat standard of very small satellites has become increasingly popular over the last decade. For these cubesats (1 to 3 kg) the race for an adequate yet simple propulsion system is on, as traditional exothermic rocket engines cannot be easily scaled down to appropriate sizes. Vaporizing liquid micro-thrusters (VLM) are a promising solution to provide reliable thrusters, as the principle combines the tried and proven inert-gas thruster systems with the dense and compact storage of liquids. The liquids are evaporated using an external heating source, and the consequently created vapour is accelerated through a nozzle structure to provide thrust. However, in the design of VLM systems little two-phase fluid-flow modelling has been performed so far. Multi-phase fluid flow is a challenging area in the field of fluid dynamics. The analytic evaporation models published so far focus on high mass-flux (> 100[kgm−2 s−1]) cooling of integrated circuits, and are restricted to low vapour fraction (< 0.2) operation to maximise the silicon-cooling potential of the fluid flow. By contrast, VLM systems require all of the fluid to be evaporated for optimal performance, resulting in unity vapour mass fractions. To ensure full evaporation, low mass-flux (< 30[kgm−2 s−1]) systems are generally used. This mismatch ensures that evaporation models cannot be freely exchanged. It is the goal of this thesis to further the knowledge in modelling of evaporative two-phase flows in microstructures, to be able to improve the design methods of VLM’s. This thesis therefore presents two methods of investigating two-phase fluid flow behaviour, novel to VLM design-studies. They will be implemented on the current state of art VLM design by the TU Delft, both as a test case for the methods, and to investigate possible design improvements. Firstly an analytical modelling approach is presented, correlated using visual data available in published literature. Secondly a first-principle modelling approach is presented, using a newly-developed adaptation of the Reynolds equation, with a reintroduction of both inertia terms and viscous friction terms of in-plane fluid motion. The analytical approach is shown to provide insight in design improvement options, and is expected to be a valuable tool in the future design methodology of VLMs, allowing for the identification of minimal wall temperatures, efficiency values and performance values of VLM designs. The first-principle approach, solved using numerical means, shows promise, as it reduces the computation time of two-phase fluid flow systems drastically compared to the reference of the phase-field method. Future work on the stabilisation of the numerical algorithms is still required. This thesis will conclude with a set of recommendations based on the performed simulations, enabling designers to improve current VLM design strategies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystem Engineering (PME)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Fatigue is one of the common failure mechanisms occurring in asphalt pavements. To better understand the underlying principles of these fatigue mechanisms, a procedure is developed to construct fatigue curves based on tests in uni-axial tension on asphalt mortar, leading to defining fatigue life using a variety of methods. The uni-axial tension loading mode is chosen to increase the insight of material behavior. To examine discontinuous fatigue mechanisms, tests are performed to assess the healing behavior of asphalt mortar. Fatigue in asphalt mortar has not yet been investigated to a comprehensive extent so far. In mortar, it is expected that the behavior of the binder component is more pronounced when compared to asphalt mixtures. Mortar is a mixture of bitumen, filler, and fine sand with the ratio of 37.5 : 34.1 : 28.4. The bitumen used has pen grade 70/100, the used filler is Wigro 60K, and the sand is Norwegian sand sieved between 0.063 mm and 0.5 mm. Initially, a test procedure is formulated to determine a fatigue curve of mortar columns tested in uniaxial tension. Cylindrical specimen with a height of 63 mm and a diameter of 16.5 mm are tested in a pneumatic 5 kN UTM (Universal Testing Machine). Both the frequency and temperature are fixed at respectively 10 Hz and 5ºC for all these tests. The fatigue tests are performed in tension only, since this results in a relatively simple stress state in the cross-section. The tests are conducted using unaged specimens and four aged mortar specimens with varying ageing degrees. The ageing method used is temperature aged for 1, 2, 6, and 9 days in an oven at 85ºC. Every fatigue test is executed six times to account for relatively large variations of fatigue tests. After determining the fatigue curves, four different methods are applied to the fatigue test results in order to define the fatigue life of asphalt mortar. The classical method in pavement engineering is applied first, which defines the fatigue life when reaching 50% of the initial stiffness. Secondly, the fatigue life is defined at the transition point between Phase II and Phase III. This point is the maximum of the stiffness multiplied by the number of load cycles plotted against the number of load cycles. This is a mathematical approach instead of looking into the material behavior of asphalt mortar. The third method is based on the dissipated energy of each load cycle during a fatigue test using the formula Van Dijk postulated, an analytical approach in which the area of the stress-strain curve is defined as the dissipated energy. The fourth and final method is using the monotonic tensile test results as a failure envelope to the fatigue results, normally applied to linear elastic materials and is not commonly applied in pavement engineering. The transition point approach shows results close to the actual fracture of the specimens. The definition of the fatigue life based on the dissipated energy results in a relatively low number of load cycles until fatigue failure occurs, but this is thought to be due to the available data and the applied data analysis. Overall, it can be concluded that using the transition point is the best method to define the fatigue life based on the experimental data found. The 2 days aged mortar specimens show the highest number of load cycles, which is not in line with the expectations. The fatigue life was expected to decrease as the ageing period increased, which can be seen in the 2, 6, and 9 days aged mortar specimens. It is believed that performing fatigue tests on unaged mortar is not useful, since the material is too soft. To assess healing behavior, discontinuous tests are performed using the same test set-up and parameters as in the cyclic fatigue tests. In the rest periods between the load cycles, the asphalt mortar has an opportunity to heal. Various loading patterns are applied to see their effect on the fatigue life and to determine the healing factor. The healing factor was found to be relatively low, but for a test temperature of 5ºC it is thought to be a realistic value. It is found that the duration of the rest period does not increase the healing factor as expected.","fatigue; healing; asphalt; mortar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Pavement Engineering / Road and Railroad Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bakker, M. (mentor); Van de Giesen, N.C. (mentor); Onencan, A. (mentor)","2016","Since the 1990th Sasol, a local Non-Governmental-Organization (NGO), builds sand storage dams, to mitigate the consequences of droughts in the semi-arid county of Kitui, Kenya. Sand storage dams are dams constructed in ephemeral rivers which increase the storage capacity of the riverbeds. The water stored by sand storage dams enables local people to generate income through irrigated agriculture and brick making. By exploiting the stored water people also influence the groundwater flows and tables through water extraction and evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration through the cultivation of land. This two way feedback between society and water system is further influenced by local circumstances like water quality, slopes and local initiatives. In this study the long term effects of sand storage dams on hydrology and water use were assessed in the Kiindu catchment near Kitui town. It combines observed human agency and simulated effects of sand storage dams on groundwater levels to depicture what is called in socio-hydrology the coevolution of society and water system after the construction of sans storage dams. During a fieldtrip the study area, the local circumstances and the exploitation of water sources were assessed by means of trans-sectional walks and semi-structured interviews. The results show the interaction of local circumstances, society and water system led to different local developments even in a small catchment like the Kiindu catchment. How water is extracted and used depends on catchment properties. If the riverbanks are broad and lots of water from the riverbed can be extracted like in the downstream of the study area, people do irrigated agriculture on the riverbanks. But in such areas it is hard to find locations where sand dams can be founded on rock. Therefore sand dams are endangered by erosion of the riverbanks. In areas with steeper slopes and narrow and thin riverbeds, irrigated agriculture cannot be applied in the vicinity. Here people need to invest in equipment to utilize the water stored by the sand dams. But in these areas there are more locations where sand dams can be founded on rocks. Therefore the sand dams are more robust. Other factors that influence the utilization of water from the catchment are water quality and the availability of alternative water sources. To investigate how the effects of the sand storage dams on the groundwater tables may influence the availability of water and therefore the water use, a groundwater model was developed. With the ‘pmwin’ groundwater model, which is based on the finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW, the influence of local catchment properties on the performance of the sand dams were assessed and changes in flow directions around sand dams analysed. The simulations show that the slopes of the stream and the thickness of the riverbed have a major impact on the amount of water stored by the sand dams. Because the sand dams which store the largest amount of water lie in the area where most of the irrigated fields are located, the modelling results give a possible explanation for the observed development. The study shows that the sand dams in general lead to larger amounts of water available in the catchment. Therefore they improve living conditions of the local communities. However the effects of the sand dams differ between the areas. In some areas they only help the communities to satisfy their domestic water demand, while in other areas people have sufficient water to generate income through irrigated agriculture. But sand storage dams may also fail and their effect abate afterwards. Thus the study shows that there is not ‘The Effect’ of the sand storage dams on the development of a catchment. To understand why sand storage dams have a certain effect it is important to take the local circumstances into account by assessing their effects. One should also be cautious and choose a flexible implementation and operation approach that takes the local circumstances into account if the experience with sand storage dams is transferred from one area to another. Finally, if there is not ‘The Effect’ of sand storage dams, how do developments of catchments look like after the construction of sand storage dams? Based on the information obtained in the field, hypothetical socio-hydrological narratives for small sub areas in catchment, which need to be proved in further research, are formulated to show how these sub-catchments may have developed.","sand storage dams; aquifer recharge; socio-hydrology; drought","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

Therefore, it was investigated what the provided reliability is, compared to what is should be. Within this report, the focus is solely on fatigue induced by bending moments on reinforced concrete sections. Determination of reliabilities is done by creating a fictitious design, exactly satisfying the Eurocode. Then, this design is used as input for a probabilistic analysis, where the load models are replaced by measured traffic, and other uncertainties were quantified. The target reliability for the fatigue limit state proved to be vague in the Eurocode. However, the target reliability for ultimate limit states can be adopted as an upper bound, which was used in this report. The reliability was shown to be below this target, caused by, among others, a partial factor which is equal to 1 for fatigue loads according to the Eurocode. The idea was that variations in loads will converge due to the vast number of appliances. However, here it is argued that correlations between variations, which systematically affect each load its effect, invalidate this assumption. Also, reliabilities were shown to depend heavily on the span lengths (remarkably lower for spans of 1-10 m. It was demonstrated that such behavior results by lack of variety in the load model axle distances and loads, compared to measured traffic. Recommendations are, apart from further research, to increase the partial factor for fatigue loading. Also, a novel load model should be created with comparable variation in axle distances and loads as measured traffic.","fatigue; load model; railway structures; reinforced concrete; reinforcement steel; probabilistic design; reliability; partial factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

However, to evaluate security and validate behaviour we are interested in analysis such software. In this thesis, we give an overview of available obfuscation techniques as well as methods to undo this effort through reverse engineering and deobfuscation. We research active learning, which can be used to automatically learn state machine models of obfuscated software. These state machine models give insight into the behaviour of the program. We identify opportunities to improve the quality of existing active learning algorithms through the use of fuzzing to generate test cases. We utilise the AFL fuzzer, which uses a genetic algorithm in combination with test case mutation to create test cases for a target program. By using insight into the program's execution for each test case, it can create more relevant test cases compared to implementations that do not use this information. We use the generated test cases to find counterexamples for learned state machine models; these counterexamples can then be used by the learning algorithm to significantly improve the quality of the learned model. Compared to active learning with the W-method for test case generation, our combination of learning and fuzzing learns models of obfuscated programs with up to 343x more states, and consequently incorporates more of the program's behaviour into the learned state machine model.","active learning; fuzzing; deobfuscation; reverse engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems, Cyber Security Group","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","Robots are becoming more and more involved in our daily life. In order to increase the acceptance of modern robotics in society even further, quite some improvements in human-robot interaction have to be made. Non-verbal communication is one such way of conveying information between robots and humans. In spite of its great potential, the current state of research is fairly limited. The goal of this research is to create a control framework that could generate movements with the flexibility to convey information by adapting the movement trajectories. Other studies have mainly researched non-verbal interaction using an optimized feedforward controller. Humans are however able to move without learning all movement sequences in advance, which is the motivation to solely focus on feedback controlled motions in current research. Considering the motion metrics traveled path, electrical power, gravitational torque and end-effector jerk, the proportional-derivative controller in the workspace proves to be best capable of producing the most human-like motions. The control framework for communicating non-verbally consists of an Operational Space Control hierarchy, combining the aforementioned controller and a novel method minimizing the gravitational torque during movement. Furthermore, human-likeness is even further increased by imposing joint limits based on the human extremes. These limits cause potential local minima, which prevent the controller from reaching the desired final position. Introducing an extra, unusual coordinate helps overcoming these minima taking into consideration the angle between current and final position. With these components included, the framework is able to reach any desired location taking into consideration human-likeness and maximum joint angle constraints. The Labanotation is used to describe the different motions to be conducted, the same way as is done with human dancing motions. Combining this representation with the Laban Time, Space and Weight Effort, it is now possible to conduct different movements. Professional dancers were asked to participate in an experiment, resulting in the relation between the end-effector trajectories and the Laban Basic Efforts: dab, flick, float and glide. These trajectories were used to optimize the gains within the control framework. The procedure was run for different initial and final desired positions, resulting in four sets of control gains corresponding to each of the four Efforts. Different motions are obtained using the four different control sets. Simulation shows that direct and flexible motions (Space Effort) are distinguishable by the shortest trajectories opposed to longer traveling distances respectively. High gravitational torque gains and low spring and damping gains result in more flexible motions. Furthermore, sustained and sudden motions (Time Effort) differ by the time the end-effector needs to reach the desired position. Sudden motions show to have higher spring-damping ratios with respect to sustained motions. In summary, the general control framework proposed by this thesis has the flexibility to generate motions either using the dabbing, flicking, floating or gliding Effort and therefore contributes to the acceptance of robots in society.","convey information; non-verbal communcation; Laban Efforts; Operational Space Control; human-likeness; gravitational torque; robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor)","2016","This masker thesis describes the design process of the basketball backstop of the future. A basketball backstop is the piece of equipment with a ring, on which the players score during a game of basketball. The game of basketball is changing; fans want a more engaging game experience and sports marketing becomes increasingly important. Schelde Sports is global market leader of basketball backstops. Even though the game of basketball is changing, the basketball backstops have not changed years. The changes around the game of basketball also has an impact on the stakeholder relations of Schelde Sports. Schelde Sports currently has strong relations (through their dealers) with the venue managers, who buy the basketball equipment. The increasing importance and potential of sports marketing will direct these relations more towards the sports marketeers. Research, conducted for this project has shown that the basketball backstop is visible over 50% of the broadcasting time of a basketball game. The visibility of the backstop and the focus of fans on the backstop gives it a lot of marketing potential. Integrating features focussing on the exposure of marketing messages gives the basketball backstop a significant added value and provides a high revenue potential. For the design of the concept multiple stakeholders had to be taken into account. For the sports marketeers, the exposure areas should be maximized placed at high focus locations. The basketball game should not be affected by the added features and the players should be protected from injury in the case of impact with the backstop. The fans want to have an enriched game experience, but more important, their view on the game should not be blocked by the basketball backstop. The design integrates two features in the basketball backstop: LED displays and backboard projection. The displays are located high, behind the backboard and lower, behind the front padding. The shape of the displays maximizes the exposure area, without blocking the game view of the fans, located behind the backstop. The projection screen at the backside of the backboard is transparent and will only be used for advertisement after a score. This prevents distraction for the players and limits the impact on the game view for the fans. The custom shaped LED displays are built up out of small rectangular modules of 40 x 160 mm. These modules are arranged seamless in the configuration of the desired shape. The modules at the angled edges are covered to give the display a straight border. The backboard projection makes use of a high luminance short throw projector, creating a bright image from a short distance behind the backboard. The projection screen, the image is projected on is a transparent foil, capturing the projected content, while maintaining its transparency.","Basketball; Backstop; Design; Sports; LED Displays","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

A small number of vessels is equipped with expensive gas springs. Of the vessels that have been equipped with rubber isolators, a number is experiencing large vibrations caused by what is assumed resonance between the OC and the vessel. This research focuses on the development of an economically feasible solution to reduce vibrations for deck-mounted superstructures in CSDs. In the first part of the thesis the focus was placed on investigating the driving frequencies in CSDs and the natural frequencies of the coupled OC-vessel system. For this purpose, a model was developed and it was found that the large amplitude motions were in fact caused by resonance of the system in one of the driving frequencies. To solve this problem several solutions were studied. The initial investigation resulted in the proposal of a low-frequency vibration isolation using a load bearing spring combined with a Negative Stiffness Mechanism (NSM) The NSM was modelled to verify the behaviour of the NSM and the OC – vessel system and the design parameters were obtained. To validate the proposed concept, a prototype was constructed (Figure 3). The prototype shows that during the detailed design stage the influence of friction and the influence of tolerances have to be minimised. The next steps in the development of the NSM as a product will need to centre around a 6DOF prototype set up and the detailed design of the internal mechanism of the NSM. This includes material selection, profile selection and design of the hinge points.

(mentor)","2016","Fribo is a product-system that aims at reducing the food waste in the households. The design is a consequence of an iterative process that had started from researching the main causes for food waste in private kitchens, proceeded with the user involvement and ended with a technological solution. The graduation process that led to the creation was run by Giulia Carletto, with the supervision of David Keyson and Sacha Silvester and at Invivo, design agency in Berlin. The communication, over the distance, between the student and the supervisors was anyway smooth and clear. A summary of the process will follow. The research phase gave precise and stable insights, statistics data were analyzed in order to give a first direction. Since the goal of the project was to help the user change or reduce the habit of throwing away food, the customer journey was used to deeply understand where the difficult tasks for the user lay. Current products were observed so that the different approaches could be analyzed and new possibilities discovered. Interviews were used to understand the reasons behind the unsustainable behaviors. The results were afterwards grouped into three main categories: storing, portioning and FF2. A reflection on these categories followed and a decision was made, to proceed with FF2. This category is represented by those foods that are purchased, partially used and stored in the fridge for their remaining part. FF2 are often wasted because they are forgotten, undervalued or considered spoiled before they actually are. Different behavioral reasons explain this habits and the following task was to find a solution that would tackle all of them. The idea generation phase started and different methods were user: user observation, brainstorming, analogies, workshops and interviews. Every tool gave meaningful insights that helped the student to proceed with a clear goal in mind. One direction was initially chosen: teach the user how to flexibly use those FF2 in order to stop wasting them. The draft of a smartphone app was outlined, paired by a physical product that would help the user combine the needed activities. The informative solution was soon found to be out of track for the designer skills and lacking of feasibility in a short time development.It is believed that this step was also very valuable to the designing process and that it actually led the designer to proceed with the right path. In fact the physical product that was initially matched with the app, was chosen as a final design. This product is Fribo. Fribo is a product-system composed by three physical parts and one smartphone app. Its potential lays in the technology, recently developed, that would allow this sensor to keep track of the spoiling process of food. Fribo is the fridge box, the case for the sensor, the app interface and the device that keeps all the actors communicating together. Its functionalities allow the user to get a notification whenever any of the food that he/she stored in the box, is getting bad. In this way the consumer will not forget, undervalue of wrongly estimate the spoiling process of his/her food. During the last phase of the project, many experts were consulted, especially the creator of the technology which Fribo is based on. This steps were fundamental in order to estimate the feasibility of the system and develop its features at its best. The user involvement was also a method that contributed to create a product that can possibly improve consumers lives and contribute to the reduction of pollution that currently affects the planet. The technology is based in the use of an RFID tag that contains carbon nanotubes, chemically modified to answer to the presence of the gases that are produced by food during the spoiling process. Every food category can produce a different gas, In this way the tag communicates with the reader and send the information concerning which food category started the spooling process. The reader sits inside what is called the Router plug. In fact a smart plug containing crafted PCBs is able to detect the tag’s information, translate them and communicate to the user what it has been detected. The user, at the desired time, will daily receive a notification from Fribo that will involve him/her and inform about the status of the food contained in the box. Fribo is designed so that its maintenance and recycling process would not produce undesired waste. Fribo points at being spread in many households and help consumers reduce their unsustainable behavior. If the advantages that Fribo would produce are calculated, the situation can be improved dramatically. The positive results that would affect the environment relate to water consumption, hectares saved from intensive cultivation, CO2 spread in the air and decrease of deforested surface.","food waste; IoT; Berlin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","IDE","","IPD","",""

The contribution to be made by the TU Delft is a software-based Attitude Determination Experiment (ADE) that contains four different algorithms for attitude estimation that are to be tested in-situ for comparative analysis through the telemetry sent down by the satellite. The four algorithms are the Optimal REQUEST, the Additive Quaternion Kalman Filter, the Pseudolinear Quaternion Kalman Filter and the Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter. The Additive Quaternion Kalman Filter has been further adjusted with the incorporation of the Maximum Information Rate Filter, which reduces the measurement matrix into six candidates and selects the one corresponding to the highest information rate for use in the algorithm. Though this filter has the benefit of using reduced matrices, computational efficiency is only really increased if the selection process is as computationally lean as possible as well. Therefore, an analysis was performed of the selection pattern of the Maximum Information Rate filter. This analysis shows that a clear pattern exists for the Earth sensor (based solely on the hemisphere), a more complicated pattern is visible for the Sun sensor, while the magnetometer has no useful pattern to speak of. The ADE has been programmed in the C-language and adjusted for the RTEMS real-time operating system. All operations to be performed by the payload have been verified to operate within the assigned budgets and limitations of the hardware on board the satellite. The payload is capable of running the four algorithms within 100 milliseconds while retaining a code size 24 kB, which is lower than the 35 kB budget and a memory size of 8.8 kB, which is lower than the 10 kB budget. All algorithms have undergone extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to test for stability and sensitivity to the involved parameters. All algorithms manage to retain a steady-state angular estimation error lower than 0.5 degrees under conditions varying by about 30% from the expected parameters.

The water stored by sand storage dams enables local people to generate income through irrigated agriculture and brick making. By exploiting the stored water people also influence the groundwater flows and tables through water extraction and evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration through the cultivation of land. This two way feedback between society and water system is further influenced by local circumstances like water quality, slopes and local initiatives. In this study the long term effects of sand storage dams on hydrology and water use were assessed in the Kiindu catchment near Kitui town. It combines observed human agency and simulated effects of sand storage dams on groundwater levels to depicture what is called in socio-hydrology the coevolution of society and water system after the construction of sans storage dams. During a fieldtrip the study area, the local circumstances and the exploitation of water sources were assessed by means of trans-sectional walks and semi-structured interviews. The results show the interaction of local circumstances, society and water system led to different local developments even in a small catchment like the Kiindu catchment. How water is extracted and used depends on catchment properties. If the riverbanks are broad and lots of water from the riverbed can be extracted like in the downstream of the study area, people do irrigated agriculture on the riverbanks. But in such areas it is hard to find locations where sand dams can be founded on rock. Therefore sand dams are endangered by erosion of the riverbanks. In areas with steeper slopes and narrow and thin riverbeds, irrigated agriculture cannot be applied in the vicinity. Here people need to invest in equipment to utilize the water stored by the sand dams. But in these areas there are more locations where sand dams can be founded on rocks. Therefore the sand dams are more robust. Other factors that influence the utilization of water from the catchment are water quality and the availability of alternative water sources. To investigate how the effects of the sand storage dams on the groundwater tables may influence the availability of water and therefore the water use, a groundwater model was developed. With the ‘pmwin’ groundwater model, which is based on the finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW, the influence of local catchment properties on the performance of the sand dams were assessed and changes in flow directions around sand dams analysed. The simulations show that the slopes of the stream and the thickness of the riverbed have a major impact on the amount of water stored by the sand dams. Because the sand dams which store the largest amount of water lie in the area where most of the irrigated fields are located, the modelling results give a possible explanation for the observed development. The study shows that the sand dams in general lead to larger amounts of water available in the catchment. Therefore they improve living conditions of the local communities. However the effects of the sand dams differ between the areas. In some areas they only help the communities to satisfy their domestic water demand, while in other areas people have sufficient water to generate income through irrigated agriculture. But sand storage dams may also fail and their effect abate afterwards. Thus the study shows that there is not ‘The Effect’ of the sand storage dams on the development of a catchment. To understand why sand storage dams have a certain effect it is important to take the local circumstances into account by assessing their effects. One should also be cautious and choose a flexible implementation and operation approach that takes the local circumstances into account if the experience with sand storage dams is transferred from one area to another. Finally, if there is not ‘The Effect’ of sand storage dams, how do developments of catchments look like after the construction of sand storage dams? Based on the information obtained in the field, hypothetical socio-hydrological narratives for small sub areas in catchment, which need to be proved in further research, are formulated to show how these sub-catchments may have developed.","sand storage dams; aquifer recharge; socio-hydrology; drought","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

Many reefs are however eroding or degraded, leading to a loss of these ecosystem services. Artificial reefs can reverse this negative trend. The artificial reefs in this context are meant to restore or complement rocky reef environments in temperate to sub-tropical coastal waters. Such reefs can be created by 3D printers, providing a variety of possible shapes and local topographies. The design of a successful artificial reef is however not straightforward. The interaction between the complex topography and the flow is an important physical property of a reef, determining the success of habitability for certain species. In this study, we aim to develop tools/guidelines to design the reefs in order to increase the success rate of artificial reefs. A modelling sequence is developed to translate offshore wave data to detailed velocity profiles near the face of the structure, for a given design. Modelling is done in a 2DV environment. MET-ocean wave data is used as input for the SWAN wave model, to translate offshore wave conditions to a near shore wave climate. SWAN output is analysed by means of an extreme value analysis, creating input for large-scale computations with XBeach. In XBeach a first order approximation of location and dimensions of the reef, taking into account wave attenuation. SWASH is used to model the reef setup in detail. The model is calibrated with data collected in an experimental setup The 3D printed structure has been simplified to a steel plating with fixated rock, which resembles the porosity and cavity size of the 3D printed surface. From literature study it was established that velocity profiles over potential habitat is an important physical property of a reef which determines the success of habitability for certain species. An easy to interpret, visual result is obtained, linking ecological habitability to velocity patterns in the vicinity of the structure. The numerical model was able to reproduce detailed hydrodynamic motion with high correlation. Case study results indicate that the method developed is functional with restricted applicability. The tool can be used to design habitat in the cross section of a reef, or used as a decision support tool when existing structures are enhanced with habitat elements.","Artificial Reefs; SWASH; Wave flume; XBeach; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental fluid mechanics","",""

The project is initiated as a pre-research for a future Ecopark, located next to the international airport of Curacao. The Ecopark is an innovative design thought of by Curacao Airport Holding (CAH). The Ecopark will consist of an ocean thermal energy conversion plant (OTEC) and a sea water air-conditioning plant (SWAC). Because of the high costs of air-conditioning and energy on the island, cheap green energy solutions are very welcome. To make sure that the OTEC and SWAC plant perform as expected, a detailed temperature profile over the whole water depth is essential. If the water is too cold at the top layers of the ocean and/or too warm at the seabed, the plant will not reach its full potential. The purpose of the research project is to deliver a design and installation method of an appropriate Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system. This measurement system provides near-real time and high resolution temperature data. The data is obtained by installing a fiber optic cable 7 km offshore at the north coast of Curacao at a depth of 1 km. A focus has been put on the technical, economic and political aspects of installing a DTS system in deep water and on land. With the help of a geographical-, cultural-, stakeholder- and system analysis important background data and information will be considered and processed. The optimal configuration is the configuration with a subsurface buoy, where the computer is located on shore. This configuration has some technical challenges, which are analysed. Several alternatives of the different components are developed. A preliminary design is chosen through a multi criteria analysis. There is chosen for a mooring line in which the fiber optic cable is integrated, this combination of two cables will be called the DTS cable. The DTS cable is suspended in a vertical line spanning over 950m water, with the use of a submerged buoy and dead weight anchor combination. An Ultima-L DTS computer will send a signal from the shore through 7km of the cable to the anchor location and then upward for 950m to the submerged buoy. Along the whole length of the cable the signal will be reflected, which will be analysed by the DTS computer. The data will be saved in an online shared file, enabling the data to be read in the Netherlands. The wind- and wave loads can be considered as rough at the north side of the island. These two components and the current profile are of major importance for the design of the DTS system. The technical challenges of the project depend on the choice of equipment used in the design, the installation procedures and the type of shore landing of the DTS cable. The DTS cable has a limited tensile strength and in combination with the extreme water depth narrow margins have to be implemented to realize the design. This limitation determines the size of the anchor and of the buoy, which will have a profound impact on the quality of the data generated by the DTS system. For the installation procedures a research vessel named the Chapman, a smaller RIB and divers are necessary. The Chapman will install the buoy, the anchor and the DTS cable. With this procedure, the biggest risk in the project arises. The risk during the installation method described in this report is the entanglement of the different cables, which still needs further research. The success of the project depends on the cooperation with the stakeholders. The permit approval of Maritime Authority Curacao (MAC) and the approval of CAH to build on their ground are the most important aspects of the stakeholder analysis. Economic aspects of the design are closely linked to the technical solutions, to the technical challenges, and to the measurement accuracy required by the client Bluerise B.V.. A comparison has been made between the accuracy of the DTS system measurements and the costs. These trade-off result in the definitive design that consists of a subsurface buoy, a dead weight anchor and a computer on land. The result is presented to the client Bluerise B.V.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering, Hydraulic Engineering, Construction Management and Engineering","MP 188","12.102222, -68.931111"

(mentor)","2016","Heerema Marine Contractors operates large crane vessels, which are exploited for installation works in the offshore oil and gas industry. The benchmark power system of these crane vessels is diesel electric meaning that the main engines are driving alternators for generating electric power. But due to spiky power demand and strict redundancy requirement in dynamic positioning mode of the crane vessel diesel engines on board are exposed to dynamic and extremely low load, which implies very high fuel consumption. Therefore, in order to solve the problem, it is envisaged to investigate the feasibility of hybridization of the benchmark power system, which leads to the research objective of this work: “Is it technical and economical feasible and advantageous of considering current electric energy storage (EES) technology for improving and optimizing the Thialf on board power generation and distribution system?” The objective is achieved by making concept design and deriving design criteria for the hybrid power system of the subject vessel by analyzing actual on board measurements. A model of the hybrid power system consists of a battery module, converter module, diesel engine module and control strategy module is created to verify and improve the design, which is used to answer the technical feasibility. An economic analysis is made to quantify fuel saving benefits and capital investment of hybrid system, which is used to answer the economic feasibility. EES serves three functions on board in the hybrid system: 1) Spinning reserve, replacing one running diesel engine in each engine room and secure power supply during diesel engine failure, 2) Typical peak shaving, absorbing load dynamics (spikes and valleys) so that operation of diesel engine is smoothed in typical dynamic positioning mode, 3) Demanding peak shaving, absorbing load dynamics in the most demanding crane operations. Results favor Lithium–Titanate battery, flywheel energy storage and supercapacitors in terms of technical feasibility. However, considering dimension and cost analysis as well, Lithium–Titanate battery is selected as the first priority of the hybrid system. The application of designed 446 kWh Lithium–Titanate battery in each engine room resulted in the following energy savings for the operation of subject vessel: 1) Fuel savings by eliminating diesel engine spinning reserve requirement is about 15% per year, which means an estimated yearly 900 k$ fuel saving, 2) Reduction of running hours of diesel engines is about 14,000 hours yearly, which means a saving on maintenance of approx. 300 k$ per year, 3) Furthermore, a fuel and maintenance saving potential by steadier diesel engine operation is showed, but this could not be verified in the model. Therefore, in terms of economic analysis, a yearly benefit of about 1.2 million $ is achieved and considering capital investment is roughly 6 million $ which means the payback period is about 5 years for the hybrid system. This project revealed some interesting topics for further research. In terms of diesel engine modelling, a model focus on modelling diesel engine dynamic transient operation instead of steady-state performance is of interest. And modelling the diesel engine performance in extremely low loads e.g., 10%-25% is also of interest, although diesel engine is not designed and built to run on such low loads. Recommendations on using a better battery model are also included.","hybrid power system; electric energy storage; crane vessel; Lithium-ion battery; flywheel energy storage; supercapacitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-04-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine Technology","","Design, Production and Operation","",""

(mentor)","2016","Typical for the Dutch landscape are the many polders, which are situated below sea level and below waters directly surrounding the polders. A visual separation between land and water is caused by the flood defences that protect the polders from flooding. In 2005, artist Paul Izeboud came with the idea to make a transparent flood defence, thereby making it possible to experience land and water simultaneously, without standing on top of the dike. In 2011, Eduard Böthlingk worked out this idea in an architectural design of ‘The glass dike’. Böthlingk is planning to realize the glass dike inside a regional flood defence that protects the Duifpolder (in the province of South-Holland) from flooding. Based on the architectural design, an engineering design of the glass dike is made in this thesis. This design should satisfy reliability requirements from the Flood Safety Standard. For the regional flood defence that is surrounding the Duifpolder, this safety standard prescribes a design water level with an exceedance probability of 1 in 100 years. The glass dike should be able to safely withstand this water level. Apart from the Flood Safety Standard, reliability requirements that follow from the Eurocode should be satisfied as well. For conventional parts of the structure (foundation, concrete elements, etcetera), design checks were performed with a semi-probabilistic method. For this, partial factors from Eurocode Reliability Class 2 were applied. For the glass elements, a full probabilistic method was applied to compute the failure probability due to overloading. Furthermore, threats to the glass were identified. The most important threats are impact due to a boat collision, fire and explosions. Measures to prevent these incidents and/or to reduce consequences were proposed. Glass is an unpredictable material with respect to its structural behaviour. Its strength is still subject of many researches. It is recommended to also investigate its resistance against fire. Although glass is a vulnerable structural material, it was found that, in general, realization of a glass flood defence is technically feasible.","glass dike; glass flood defence; probabilistic design; semi-probabilistic design; structural glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Cities are complex systems, a particular dimension largely contributing to the complexity of cities is detected in the multiplicity of the behaviour of people who inhabit. In the urban context, these behaviours can be inferred from human activities. Understanding the distinctions of these activities between cities is crucial. Previous works carry out such studies using surveys, censuses, interviews and onsite observations, which are rather costly, requiring extensive human or other resources. With the development of Internet and information technology, the geo-referenced social media networks which link human activities to specific places have been more and more popular. It, therefore, becomes a good candidate for studying individual human activities in the city. In this work, we explore to what extent can social media data be used for studying differences of individual human activities in an urban environment, considering impacts of three aspects: the choice of social media platforms, the user roles and demographics, and the various of Point of Interests (PoIs). To perform this study, we design an experiment to compare user activities on multiple social media platforms in Rotterdam and Shenzhen. A pipeline for crawling and enriching Weibo data is developed and encapsulated as an extension to the Social-Glass framework. A novel dataset containing data from four platforms (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare and Weibo) in two cities for two weeks is created and analysed at a disaggregate level across several dimensions. Results indicate that, in the context of user activity study, Twitter and Weibo shows distinct differences for resident regarding local, general, and neutral topics particularly for young and mid-age users on Twitter, and for teen and young users on Weibo. While, Instagram shows evident differences for non-residents concerning international, specific, daily and emotional topics, especially for young and mid-age users. In the meantime, various PoIs provide significant differences in user activity.","Social Media; Urban; Cross Cultural; Urban; Cross Culture; Weibo; Twitter; Instagram; Foursquare; Human Behaviour; Activity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-04-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor)","2016","Loyalty programs are mainly implemented to build up the relationship between the company and the customer, i.e. to increase the customer loyalty. This has both social and financial benefits for the customer (e.g. feeling of community, discounts, etc.) as well as for the company (e.g. better relationship with customers, increase share-of-wallet, etc.). BrandLoyalty is the global leader in loyalty programmes for food retailers and their partner IceMobile, the company this master thesis is carried out for, is a mobile service provider for food retailers worldwide. The problem they are dealing with is that customers start late with redeeming or do not redeem at all during the collecting period. Prior research studies of Icemobile and theory show that this is dependant of the motivation of the user. Therefore the goal of this master thesis is to explore how consumers’ motivation in digital loyalty programs can be maintained. This report describes and evaluates the extensive user research and literature studies that are conducted and the range of possible design solutions that were generated based on the results of these studies. First an in depth literature study was conducted to create an understanding of how consumer behaviour in a loyalty program influences the motivation of the user. A conceptual framework was created that included factors that directly and indirectly influence motivation. The four main factors, which influence motivation directly, are commitment, progress, emotions and moods. To examine if the behaviour described in literature is similar to actual behaviour, an extensive user research study was conducted. Other goals of the research were to find out if it is possible to form groups and what emotions these groups experience. This study existed of a self-setup loyalty program via Whatsapp with 30 participants that lasted for 3 weeks and which was setup in such a way that it was as similar as possible to a normal program. Results: direct and indirect influences of the conceptual framework were recognised in the actual behaviour. Also, 6 groups of collectors could be identified based on the level of commitment, progress and emotions. Reversal theory (Apter, 2006) was used to examine what behaviour should be adjusted and how this could be done. This showed that users could be helped to be more playful (i.e. enjoyment in the moment) than serious (i.e. Focus on achievement and future goals). Besides this, reversal theory explaind that the user should experience positive emotions that are not too intense. This leaded to the following design goal: “To help the users, who mainly focus on the achievement/reachability in the loyalty program and experience negative emotions in it, to be more excited and less anxious about collecting stamps by creating enjoyment in the moment. Solutions should be directly applicable on the existing application of IceMobile.” The design goal was the starting point for the concept generation. After exploring all possible solutions, according to idea generation techniques, three concept directions were selected that fitted the design goal best and that were feasible in implementing it in the app of IceMobile. In several iterations these were developed into concepts. The three concepts that were developed are: Swipeshare: Implementing the possibility to share stamps in the application Surpris: guiding the user through the process by revealing special stamps on moments they can use it, but in a way that it feels random to them (trigger desired behaviour). Memo: Making the process of collecting more fun by offering games, that will get harder every time, throughout the process of collecting. By doing quick concept evaluation tests, it was concluded that the concept Surpris had the most potential and would therefore be developed into a final concept. Several iterations followed wherein the content of the concept was developed in detail and the concept was applied on actual transaction data, of loyalty programs that were already finished, until it worked like intended. The final concept is a feature in the application that gives special activities to the user the collecting period. There are four types of activities, namely questions, compliments, games and wheel of fortunes. These activities are given on moments users can use it best, but in a way that receiving the activity still feels like a surprise to them. If the user will receive an activity depends on the amount of collecting moments, sometimes he will receive an activity and sometimes he will not. The feature is communicated by Stampie, a character in the form of a stamp, and he will only be available in the app when an activity is offered to the user, otherwise he disappears. The goal of this feature is to mentally help the user through the collecting process and so motivate him to keep collecting. Besides, activities are offered to the user on specific moments and therefore try to trigger the desired collecting behaviour, e.g. buying BSO’s, immediate redeem, etc. To gain insights about how the concept works in an actual loyalty program, an evaluation study was conducted. This study was as similar as possible to the first Whatsapp loyalty program, but was conducted with 10 participants. From this study three recommendations can be given: Do another evaluation test in the actual app or a test whereby the user experience of the app is as equal as possible. Most important is to test if Stampie will be seen as a bigger help when he is animated (i.e. when he will stand in your screen and wave to attract attention) than when he is a static character. The purpose behind the games can be improved because this was not totally clear yet. Stampie could also communicate about other topics than BSO’s and rewards, like how to convert, the duration of the program, etc. This because people mentioned they liked it that Stampie reminded them about things like the duration of the program. These recommendations show that the final concept should still be further developed before it is actually implemented.","consumer behaviour; loyalty; motivation; interface design; service design; mobile service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

With these samples and within the context of the Marsdiep project it is investigated if Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) can be used as a Site Investigation (SI) technique. In the Marsdiep project the feasibility of a pipeline constructed using HDD between the island Texel and Den Helder is investigated. Marsdiep is the name of the water and tidal gully between Texel and Den Helder. Regular SI techniques are not feasible, due to among others; the length of 4.5km, the depth that is required for a HDD of this length and the tidal gully. The geology of the area is unknown so SI is required. For this purpose pilot drillings, the first part of a regular HDD project, are made at NAP-65m and NAP-85m from both Texel and Den Helder. These pilot drillings are adapted so that additional data are acquired. The rheologic properties are determined for samples taken from the return flow and the formation of the samples is determined after sieving. A range of possible source locations of the samples are calculated, using different scenarios based on the uncertainty with regards to the borehole diameter and the loss of drilling fluid. The results of the scenarios are compared to the results of the initial SIs, which consists of a seismic survey, onshore, vertical drillings and Cone Penetration Tests (CPTs). It is found that the source location of the samples can be calculated as one of the scenarios gave accurate results (scenario 5, drilling fluid loss 7% and a borehole diameter of 0.4m and 0.45m for respectively Texel and Den Helder). A geological cross-section is constructed based on the results of scenario 5 and initial SIs. In addition to the geology the suitability of HDD as a SI technique is investigated. It is found that with minor adaptations to a regular HDD it can be used in combination with other techniques to determine the geology of an area. The other SIs are required to compare the results to and to determine the best scenario. In order for HDD to be of use as a separate SI technique more extensive adaptations are required to minimize the uncertainties that required the use of scenarios in this research.","Horizontal Directional Drilling; Site Investigation; Return Flow; Marsdiep; HDD; SI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","","52.985151, 4.798708"

The goal of this feature is to mentally help the user through the collecting process and so motivate him to keep collecting. Besides, activities are offered to the user on specific moments and therefore try to trigger the desired collecting behaviour, e.g. buying BSO’s, immediate redeem, etc. To gain insights about how the concept works in an actual loyalty program, an evaluation study was conducted. This study was as similar as possible to the first Whatsapp loyalty program, but was conducted with 10 participants. From this study three recommendations can be given: Do another evaluation test in the actual app or a test whereby the user experience of the app is as equal as possible. Most important is to test if Stampie will be seen as a bigger help when he is animated (i.e. when he will stand in your screen and wave to attract attention) than when he is a static character. The purpose behind the games can be improved because this was not totally clear yet. Stampie could also communicate about other topics than BSO’s and rewards, like how to convert, the duration of the program, etc. This because people mentioned they liked it that Stampie reminded them about things like the duration of the program. These recommendations show that the final concept should still be further developed before it is actually implemented.","consumer behaviour; loyalty; motivation; interface design; service design; mobile service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

In the research the via Belgica, a former fundamental development axis, is used as an unifying concept. The principal question for this research is: ‘How to reinterpret the cultural history of the via Belgica, with a focus on the development of the area along the road, with the aim to make the area recognisable and valuable back again using the via as a primary connecting axis.’ The study starts with some theories around ruins. After the theories a palimpsest approach is used to analyse the region, ending up with the superimposition of the different layers of this palimpsest. Finally, a new identity will be formed. This research combines the agricultural character of the Roman period with the industrial character of the mining period to propose an intervention in the research area.","architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Franzen, A.J. (mentor)","2016","This report aims to contribute to what extent temporary use adds value to the urban environment and to prove the long-term benefits of temporary use. It aims to eliminate the gap of knowledge for property owners. Mere, it can also be valuable for other private parties or municipalities as it provides insight in the added value of temporary use in urban areas and offers a start for the use of temporary initiatives in urban planning, ultimately aiming to improve and upgrade areas within the city. Property owners could be stimulated to focus on this new option in the building life cycle instead of leaving a building structural vacant as these owners can benefit from higher property prices. The research and its outcome; the recommendations, can be used by property owners that are coping with (structural) vacant properties. The outcome of the research can facilitate the choice for temporary use as an “interim” option for their portfolio or real estate as it incorporates the creation of property value in the future. Other private parties may also be interested as many parties experience vacancy and search for a beneficial solution. Structural vacancy can be problematic for the urban area. Different scales of problems are associated; socially, this vacancy enhances problems of insecurity and social uncertainty, which again encourages vandalism, break-ins and illegal occupancy and will eventually downgrade the area. Economic problems have direct effect on the owner of a building; a vacant building does not generate income and will only provide for costs (Remoy & Voordt, 2007, p. 1). Indirect effect of the structural vacancy is the deterioration and decay of the urban area that influences the image and attractiveness of the area for residents and businesses. Due to the economic crisis of 2008, public and private parties lack of economic resources while temporary initiatives offer a quick manner and low investment, which unlocks the potential of the site short-term, instead of in the next 10 years and therefore counteracts the disadvantages of structural vacancy (Bishop & Williams, 2012). However, it is unclear to what extent temporary use adds value to the urban environment. Property owners are unaware of the long-term benefits of temporary use. This lack of knowledge creates additional uncertainty and leads to less willingness to choose the option of temporary use. Thus, property owners need insight and confirmation of these benefits to be able to assess the added value in relation with the costs and revenues. The aim of the research is to find the answer to the following main research question: “ How can temporary adaptive re-use of vacant spaces have added value for the urban area and contribute to the property value?” “ How can a strategy be developed that optimises this added value?”","added value urban area; economic and social value; property owners; urban area development; value creation; temporary adaptive re-use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Rocco, R.C. (mentor); Cuperus, Y.J. (mentor)","2016","One of the places where the phenomenon of socio-spatial segregation is most evident and tangible is the city of São Paulo in Brazil, which is also known as “the city of walls.” I developed an architectural concept based on philosopher Elias Canetti’s concept of Verwandlung that relates the social and mental levels of segregation with the spatial dimension of the architectural project. As ‘empathic metamorphosis’, Verwandlung for the human subject implies both an internal transformation and a behavioural exteriorisation, and thus moreover always occurs in relation to the context or environment one finds oneself in. The knowledge from my research that architectural expressions of socio-spatial segregation limit or even inhibit Verwandlung and the assertion that architecture has the ability to encourage human Verwandlung resulted in the idea of architectural Verwandlung as a main theme/aim for my design. Architectural Verwandlung denotes the coincidence of two transformations: a formal architectural one and a social one that is instigated by it and that gives it first meaning. By stirring citizens‘ ability of Verwandlung, architectural Verwandlung helps in building bridges among citizens from different social groups. Counteracting socio-spatial segregation by means of architectural Verwandlung means here to address foremost the mental level through an architecture that is both open and engaging. Particularly the built work of Lina Bo Bardi provided me with inspiring case-studies for the further elaboration and exemplification of the concept of Architectural Verwandlung. Based on the history of socio-spatial segregation in the area of the design plot, the design of my final proposal refers back to the typology of the mansion. In my proposal of a public multi-purpose building that includes various programs, the most important of which is a social centre, the mansion typology is combined with an office tower whereby the complex as a whole embodies the social transformation of the current business district, both architecturally and functionally. Thus at large my project should be understood as the transformation of an ordinary office tower into a mansion and that in turn into a social centre as a shared home for the community. The latter transformation implies not simply a formal typological transformation but truly an Architectural Verwandlung. It involves a change of association but also an evocation of atmosphere until the smallest scale level of the architectural element and creates a social environment which enhances social integration.","Socio-spatial Segregation; Verwandlung; São Paulo; Social Centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","ExploreLab","","23.556182, 46.662950"

(mentor); Godjevac, M. (mentor); Den Haan, J. (mentor); Van der Heiden, K. (mentor)","2016","For offshore installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class heavy lift crane vessels. The objects that need to be installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board heavy lift crane and slewed to the side of the ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the slewing crane, the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static heeling angle. The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static heeling angle could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2.25 to 3.25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1o were used, while the mast crane proved to handle roll angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.","anti-heeling; offshore; heavy lifting; water ballast; Jumbo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

This normative study proposes a model that assesses the extent to which interventions in the built environment are in accordance with a circular economy (CE) and discloses the financials behind reuse. A CE being a state of the global economy that is capable of continuous recursion. This implies infinite material productivity regarding non-regenerative materials, which intends recursive recovery of wastes and an absence of resource extraction. Regenerative material resources and energy are cumulatively confined in their extraction and use by stochastic but stationary consumption limited by the regenerative potential of the earth. Pollution is avoided and additively a multitude of means is employed in an implicit pursuit for market saturation. The model assesses the quantity of flows of materials (kg/year) that are necessary for the delivery of the performance usable floor area (1m2 UFA). The model places a binary verdict on material flows (kg/year). Flows of materials capable or incapable of continuous recursion. Besides an assessment of the required material flows, material flows are considered to be an indicator for environmental impact. Due to the multidimensionality of a CE, the assessment results in a two dimensional figure and is occluded with a target figure. The assessment is supplemented by a financial overview of material and component reuse values, that supports the decision-making processes that can enable a CE from a business perspective.","Circular economy; assessment model; built environment; decision-making model; reuse; components","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the built environment","","","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Van Beek, A. (mentor); Türkmen, Ö. (mentor); Hermans, M.J.M. (mentor)","2016","In the last decades induced earthquakes are taking place more frequently in Groningen. This is due to gas extraction form the soil. Buildings are damaged by the earthquakes and building collapse is possible in the near future. Houses in Groningen are commonly build up out of single leaf masonry cavity walls and are not designed for earthquake loads. Oosterhof Holman and SealteQ Group have designed a masonry reinforcing method that is called Quake-Shield. Quake-Shield is an unique reinforcing method and consists out of a combination of two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures. These two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures are: NSM FRP strips and an EB FRP layer. Carbon strips are placed in vertical grooves in the masonry which are filled with a ductile adhesive to bond the strips to the masonry (NSM FRP strips). A polymer or cementitious base layer with an embedded polymer or carbon mesh is attached to one side of the masonry on the outer surface (EB FRP layer). Both reinforcing measures increase stiffness, strength and ductility of the masonry. These three factors result in an increase in earthquake energy absorption and dissipation of the masonry. Which is important when reinforcing houses and buildings to prevent collapse due to earthquake loads. In this project a FEM model is made based on a three point bend test (out-of-plane bending) performed on Quake-Shield reinforced masonry samples. The FEM model is used to develop knowledge about the effect of combining two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures as used in the Quake-Shield masonry reinforcing method. The FEM model is a 3D model with a simplified micro-model approach for the masonry. The bricks are solid elements, the reinforcing materials are shell elements and the mortar and the ductile adhesive are interface elements. The bond-slip behaviour of the ductile adhesive has a significant contribution in the behaviour of Quake-Shield reinforced masonry. The mechanical properties of the ductile adhesive determines mainly the pre and post peak behaviour of the reinforced masonry. Providing gradually decline in load bearing capacity after the peak load. The EB FRP layer has a significant contribution to the reinforced masonry in the displacement range from the initiation of the first crack in the masonry till the onset of yielding of the EB FRP layer. In this range the EB FRP layer is the dominant reinforcing measure. After yielding of the EB FRP layer the NSM CFRP strip becomes the most dominant of the two. The EB FRP layer also provides cohesion between the individual bricks, keeping the masonry wall together after severe cracking has taken place. The FEM model is also used for a configuration analysis to research different geometrical and material variations of the Quake-Shield masonry reinforcing method. The configuration analysis gives more insight in the behaviour of reinforced masonry. For the configuration analysis two independent seismic reinforcing measures, NSM FRP strips and EB FRP layer, are applied separately to the FEM model. This is done to investigate its individual effect on the behaviour of reinforced masonry. Strip spacing has a significant effect on the load bearing capacity. If an epoxy is used as adhesive, which is much stronger and stiffer than the adhesive used by Quake-Shield, an increase in load bearing capacity is achieved but also sudden failure after the peak load is observed. This is an undesirable failure mode and reduces the total energy that the reinforced masonry can absorb. Results of the different configurations used for the EB layer show that the polymer (PU) base layer has the most significant contribution of the used EB FRP layer materials when considering overall ductility and energy absorption of the reinforced masonry.","Earthquake; Quake-Shield; FRP; FEM; Reinforced masonry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Engineering and Applications","","","",""

Several themes were explored when focusing on this improvement; such as the inclusion of extensive gardens and green spaces, the combination of a care program for severely demented people and other (public) programmatic functions, and the use of small-scale living homes for the ones suffering from dementia. The design location is situated in the southern part of Amsterdam, on the former Havenstraat terrain. This specific plot is surrounded by different spatial and social conditions, as it forms the junction between different residential neighborhoods (the Schinkelbuurt and Plan-Zuid by Berlage) and a former industrial area. On this plot a former prison building, Het Huis van Bewaring II, is situated. Through many years this built structure has given place to multiple types of functional program, including artists’ residences, and currently functions as a refugee shelter. Within this specific graduation project the re-use of this former prison building is of great importance, as it problematizes the relation between a given site, an existing built structure and a specific functional program, the dementia care home.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Garfield Park is a neglected neighborhood in between the city center and the suburbs of Chicago. During the 60s the white middle class moved out to the suburbs to live the “American Dream”. Poor black people moved in and at the same time crime started to rise. Right now the citizens are suffering a live full of poverty and are suppressed by gangs that call the shots and creating a culture of fear. However, despite of the misery, they still have their Afro-American culture, which is the heritage of their ancestors. This culture has three elements, as any other culture; music, dance and art. In the early days it was the Blues and later on Jazz was used as an expression of experiences and even as a way of live. Nowadays it is reflected through HipHop and it is their way of expressing their feelings, which results mostly in a negative sound. Using HipHop to create a new perspective is therefore a logical choice, since this is the language they already speak. According to Hanna Arendt, the public space is the stage on which people perform. So, in order to develop yourself, it is not enough to stay in your basement; you have to meet people and interact with them. Especially as a performer you would like others, the public, to see and hear your work. Their response is essential and a reason to keep developing your sound, your story and your identity. The HipHop center, with the focus on music, is a public space, where it is safe to meet, to practice and to perform. The two large stages, where established rappers can give a concert, make sure that this project is financially viable. Both the Homebase, which is the center of the building and the stages on the outside offer space to develop for the Garfield youth, apart from the gangs.","Chicago; Hiphop; Garfield Park; Complex Projects; Perspective; Identity; Development; Music; Stage; Public; Performer; Artist; Expression; Contrast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Complex Projects","","","",""

It is not just a resource that can be optimised by looking at the hard side or costs. The workplace has the potential to increase important organisational goals, such as creativity through a complex interaction of employee and the workspace in which they operate. My aim of this thesis was to bring some illumination or insight into this complex system by focusing on the knowledge worker and how the physical environment has the potential to nurture creative thinking.

(mentor); Scholten, L. (mentor); Den Besten, J. (mentor); Van de Giesen, N.C. (mentor)","2016","Small leaks in water supply networks often remain undiscovered, resulting in large amounts of lost water. Moreover, small leaks can grow larger over time and may result in pipe bursts, having negative consequences for the surroundings. An automatic leak localization method is required to decrease the search area and hence localize small leaks earlier. In this research, the automatic leak localization method of Quevedo et al. (2011) is validated in DMA Leimuiden (the Netherlands). A prerequisite of the localization method is a detailed consumption distribution of the inflow for the hydraulic model. The goal of this research is to study the need for a detailed consumption distribution model in a DMA with a small MNF compared to the leak size (MNF: 4.5 m3/h, leak size: 5.2 m3/h, 7.5 m3/h and 15 m3/h). The leak localization method was applied to eight artificial leaks that lasted 15 minutes and measurements of one day of a real leak (5.2 m3/h). Leak localization results of the artificial leaks showed that there was no influence of the consumption distribution during the night. The leak localization method performs the same with both consumption models in case of low flow conditions and when leak localization results of the real leak for a whole day are combined. The performance of the leak localization method depends on the location of the leak. For some leak locations more flow in the system is required to create detectable head loss at the sensor locations. Uncertainties in the model cause larger pressure variations with higher flow conditions and a more detailed consumption distribution model must be used when there is more flow (morning peak). Too short measurement periods make the leak localization result sensitive to unexpected consumption inside the DMA. An accumulation of hourly results of a whole day makes the method more robust and gave satisfying performance irrespective of the used consumption models and with only 6 pressure sensors inside the network.","automatic leak localization; DMA; leak detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","","52.222387, 4.672115"

Adaptation to these challenges is needed, using the vulnerability assessment areas that are vulnerable can be identified. Vulnerability is the likelihood a system experiences harm and is the combination of both risks and adaptability. Finding adaptability can be hard and is not straightforward, therefor this thesis aims to operationalize adaptability for the current urban environment, focussing on climate change and the physical indicators related to adaptability. Adaptability simply means the ability there is (within a system, society or city) to adapt. A lot of different definitions for adaptability (or adaptive capacity) can be found in literature, which makes talking about, using and comparing adaptability hard. Different fields of interest use different definitions, frameworks and approaches. Most of the definitions and frameworks found in the literature search of this thesis tend to be meant for assessing social adaptability on regional or country scale. They focus on institutions, economy and (technical) knowledge on larger scales. These assessments come down to, the third world countries have bad adaptability while the first world countries have better adaptability. For decision-making on municipality level assessment on smaller scale is needed. For this thesis a lot of indicators have been gathered (a grand total of 38) by literature research and interviews with experts. Indicators are one of the ways of assessing adaptability, so by selecting and combining indicators it is able to determine a measure for adaptability. The used indicators (9 in total) are grouped in so called determinants. There are indicators saying something about space that is available for climate proofing or the type of climate proofing (blue, green or grey solutions) that can be used (space: percentage buildings, percentage water and percentage greening). Furthermore there are indicators that express the underground conditions in an area (underground: soil type and underground infrastructure). There are indicators stressing opportunities regarding climate proofing that may arise (matching: planned works and estimated end of life cycle). There are also indicators that stress the drive for climate proofing (budgets: urgency). Lastly there are indicators related to specific characteristics of an area (function related demands: historical city centre). The indicators are then combined to construct a rapid assessment tool for the municipality of Dordrecht. This tool can be used to prioritize climate proofing in the Dordrecht area, when used side-by-side with a risk map. Quick wins (high adaptability, high risks) can be identified as well as areas that need further attention, research or innovation (low adaptability, high risks). The resulting maps from the tool, show expected behaviour. The historical city centre of Dordrecht shows lower adaptabilities, while harbour, park and nature areas show higher adaptabilities. Assessing and using adaptability adds data and information to your decision-making process. Climate proofing is needed, for it being the least-social-cost strategy, assessing vulnerability helps making good and funded decisions on climate proofing.","adaptability; vulnerability; adaptive capacity; climate change; urban environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Hausleitner, B. (mentor)","2016","In recent years the concept of mixed-use has emerged as a popular planning tool for urban planners to develop sustainable urban areas. With reason, because a clear positive relationship between function mix and urban sustainability in social, environmental and economic sense can be established from research. In practice however, we see that the physical interpretation of the concept of mixed-use and the urban area development process employed for mixed-use areas, although pursued enthusiastically in projects all over the world, varies greatly from project to project. The effect is that some (re) developed areas are not achieving the full sustainability benefits they aimed at with implementing mixed-use. A problem in practice is indicated that there is uncertainty in the field of urban area development on how to develop sustainable mixed-use urban areas, both in terms of product (what to develop) and process (how to develop it). This is subscribed by, although extensive research is done on both topics, a lack of formulated physical specifics in literature on the sustainable urban form of mixed-use, as well as lack of a clear answer on what development approach is best for developing mixed-use areas from the perspective of sustainabilty of the end-result. To enhance the success of this kind of developments, this paper will formulate a clear answer on the main research question ‘how can long term urban sustainability be achieved in urban area developments’ by determining the product (urban form) and process (development approach)- aspects that are important in the context of achieving sustainable mixed-use urban areas. This will be done by synthesizing the existing, dispersed knowledge on sustainable urbanism and urban area development along a well-substantiated perspective of ‘optimal’ sustainability and by studying two development approaches in practice. From this, a cohesive framework of aligned recommendations on urban form and development approach focused on achieving sustainable mixed-use areas will be made, providing actors in the urban area development process with the possibility to actively steer on these aspects and ensure better sustainable performances of the development result. Based on the findings from theory and empiry, the urban form that offers most potential for achieving long term urban sustainability in urban area developments can be defined as mixed-use neighbourhoods with specific physical features that foster walkability, vibrancy, diversity, freedom for the end-user to shape his own environment, and a sense of identity. Each of these features are substantiated by multiple researches. The concept of mixed-use development is appointed by practice as well as theory as the urban form that offers most potential of achieving long term urban sustainability. Long term urban sustainability is in this research defined as holistic long term economical, environmental and social viability of urban areas. Thorough reflection on the topic by contemporary theories on sustainable urbanism as well as long term successful examples from practice indicate that a high level of function mix is a critical component for urban sustainability, positively impacting urban sustainability in the social field and in the fields of transport, environment, and economy. The ‘optimal’ features from the perspective of long term urban sustainability have been defined as the features that achieve the most sustainable long-term end-user behaviour, since for endurance and viability it is essential for sustainable systems to be utilized and therefore to undertow a sustainable behaviour that will continue to exist. It overarches the different aspects of sustainability and brings them back to their initial driver. To do this, first the maximum sustainable benefits of mixed-use are translated into concrete goals for mixed-use. Theory on mixed-use offers solutions through which mixed-use development can achieve these goals. These solutions all presuppose a certain end-user behaviour. Finally, these end-user behaviours pose certain requirements to the urban form to induce and support this end-user behaviour, which are determined with the help of recommendations from literature, observation of practice and input of experts in the form of relevant physical variables. The exact physical characteristics of the urban form that are significant for the degree of urban sustainability of the area have been summarized in a list of variables, which are supplemented with their desired values from the perspective of urban sustainability. This list can serve as a guideline for achieving sustainability when designing mixed-use urban areas, by using it during the development process to oversee the impact on urban sustainability of proposed interventions and guard sustainable decision-making. To answer the question on the process dimension of which development approach offers most potential for achieving urban sustainability in mixed-use areas, literature on the urban area development process and possible development approaches has been reviewed with sustainable product-aspect of the previous part in mind. Furthermore, the two extremes of the possible development approaches have been studied in detail in practice through case studies of a bottom-up and top-down development approach in the Netherlands, giving a clear insight in the difficulties and threats to sustainability in the development process in practice, verifying and assessing recommendations from theory, and leading to specific recommendations from practice. The development approach determined as offering the most potential for achieving long term urban sustainability in the development result, is a combination of top-down and bottom-up planning in which the municipality sets out and guards a broad strategic course, focused on sustainability, and the developed is led by private parties (including housing associations) who develop the area in plots on own initiative according to their own ideas. In this development approach, private parties should be encouraged to take on responsibilities that go beyond the scale and term of the development of a single building, leading to larger scopes and longer term commitments and engagement in the development of the area as a whole. Plan development in this field is formed through participatory and collaborative decision-making processes in a setting of horizontal inter- actor relationships, in which the actors combine their means and knowledge to come to mutually beneficial, integrated solutions. End-users of the area should get a large influence over the shaping of their own environment, both through close inclusion in the development process or provided opportunities to build their own homes or business spaces through (collective) private commissioning formulas. The role of the public authorities and ultimately the municipality is to facilitate these private development initiatives, while at the same time keeping a strong direction over the process from a long term, wide-scope, public interest-oriented strategic planning basis. For this, an appropriate institutional framework has to be employed that finds a balance between the regulations necessary for the protection of the aims of the development and the qualities of the area, and a maximum degree of freedom for the development of valuable private initiatives. Finally, all of this should happen with a focus of long term urban sustainability in mind. This should be incorporated in the strategic plan and steering of the municipality, but should also be instated in the minds of the private actors participating in the urban area development, and guarded throughout the development process. Development of knowledge on the topic, corresponding actor education and employment of a pragmatic, and a sustainability-oriented working method that provides handles for the inclusion, operationalisation, guarding and monitoring of sustainable principles in the development process, all explained in the recommendations section of this research, should secure the integral consideration of this sustainable dimension in the urban area development process.","sustainability; mixed-use development; urban planning; development approach; bottom-up planning; top-down planning; sustainable urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Urban area development","",""

The position of Capital of Culture (ECOC) that Leeuwarden will fulfil in 2018, brings opportunities to regenerate the blokhuispoort and the direct surroundings. Hitherto, studies exist about the intangible impact of the position of ECoC on a city, but no research has been conducted yet on the tangible impact of such an event. To understand the opportunities and analyse what the right strategies are for the physical interventions of future ECOC cities, I have determined a literature study and a selection of case studies. The literature study examines both the importance of temporary use in city planning and the impact of the Event ECOC. The Case study has been performed to obtain insight in the physical interventions catalysed by ECOC. In this way it is possible to understand which characteristics of the intervention regenerate and leave a lasting legacy in the built environment. This case study covers 75 interventions from different ECOC cities. Moreover, five projects are explored even more detailed to strengthen the conclusions out of the case study research.from the case study can be concluded that ECOC can function as the catalyst for the progress of a city and in particular for a specific site in need of regeneration. The actors of this change need to have a clear vision of the city that they are modifying to understand what a specific intervention can mean for the long-term improvement. There are different ways to intervene in the built environment; firstly, an addition to the building stock (temporary or permanently) and secondly, adaption of an existing complex (either renovation or restoration). Out of these four categories aesthetic, functional, and technical characteristics are determined. The functional characteristics include an approachable, flexible and multi-layered programme. Technical characteristics focus on the visual and direct connections with the surroundings, the physical approachability, the innovative construction, program and appearance of the complex. finally, the aesthetical aspects include the iconic design, the ability to identify the intervention. The accomplishment of reaching the community engagement (both neighbourhood, surrounding city and on a larger scale) by taking these characteristics into account, enables the regeneration of the built environment with a long term improvement. This improvement will contribute to the long-term vision and process of cities to become attractive, innovative and with an own identity.","evenbases interventions; regeneration; gevangenis; Blokhuispoort; 2018; Leeuwarden; ECOC; European Capital of Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","ExploreLab","",""

(mentor); Wang, M. (mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2016","The research field of autonomous vehicle technology has been growing at an accelerated pace. Improved safety, fuel and commuting efficiency are the motivating technical and social factors to develop fully autonomous vehicles. Sensor technology, advanced software and intelligent control are the different modules that work in unison to achieve the desired driving result. The system architecture of autonomous vehicles is explored to establish a hierarchy with the planning and control stages. This allows us to focus on the particular topic of intelligent control for both levels of operation. In this thesis, a hierarchical model predictive control is developed for trajectory generation and tracking of on-road vehicles. The state of the art methods in planning and control are predominantly developed in the robotics domain and the additional challenges of the vehicle such as non-linear dynamics, sampling time and limited computational resources make it a challenging problem. $10$ DOF, six state model, and point mass vehicle dynamics models was evaluated to sufficiently represent the dynamics of the systems and allow for efficient operation in the controller development phase. Model predictive control (MPC) is chosen because of its capability of systematically taking into account non-linearities, future predictions, and operating constraints during the control design stage. In the hierarchical approach, at the high-level, new trajectories are computed on-line, in a receding horizon fashion, based on a simplified point-mass vehicle model in order to avoid the obstacle. The formulation of the collision avoidance constraints to render a quadratic programming (QP) problem from a non-convex optimization problem was crucial in the trajectory generation phase. The parameter values involved in the forward and read collision avoidance constraints defined the feasible driving regions. At the low-level an MPC controller computes the vehicle control inputs steering and acceleration in order to best follow the high level trajectory based on a higher fidelity non-linear vehicle model. The simulation scenarios defined cases for static obstacle avoidance, car following and special overtake manoeuvres. The effectiveness of the controllers were strongly affected by the parameter tuning of the vehicle, design constraints, and collision avoidance terms. The chosen method implemented a hierarchical controller with a higher level deliberative paradigm and lower level tracking controller to achieve the tasks with respect to highly automated driving.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","Mechanical Engineering- Control Engineering","",""

Nevertheless, it seems that few care to understand the complexities and limita- tions of participation. Participation has often been misused for political purpo- ses accepting it as mere feedback from citizens, using voting systems and,exhi- bitions of nished products that did not imply any real and lasting interaction with the will of the public. Many have focused on participation as an “answer” while it should be a process, a continuous question. In my research “Attention city in the making!”, I argue that participation is key to urban regeneration and that public buildings designed with the participation of communities can be a paradigm and the central piece of these processes. Supported by in-depth literature review on issues of participation in planning and design, an experi- mental investigation was undertaken in the deprived neighbourhood of Nazaret in Valencia, Spain, in order to test the hypothesis. This paper aims to rst disen- tangle the democratic role of participation in urban development, which usually implies con ict between the parties – and the potential regenerating power of participatory planning and design processes for urban areas. Second, the expe- riment illustrates the proposed discussion and nally the design translates the theory into a tangible proposal of an elderly house and kindergarten in the heart of the neighbourhood, which we expect will turn into a new gathering point, will help regenerate the block and then, the area.","Participation Urban Regeneration; Public Building; Public Values Right to the City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

Samples with individual layer thicknesses between 7 and 63 nm were nanomechanically tested at room-temperature by micropillar compression and nanoindentation at quasi-static strain-rates. Yield strength, strain-rate sensitivities and activation volumes were obtained from the experiments. First a small scale study was performed to reveal the effects of microstructural variations and pillar taper on the obtained material parameters. The deformed micropillars were then studied under the SEM to link the experimental results to observated deformation behaviour at different thicknesses. Additionally the results obtained from nanoindentation and micropillar compression were compared. Finally, based on the experimental results and observations a deformation mechanism map was proposed for the material as a function of layer thickness. Next, the high-temperature properties of the material were investigated. Micropillar compression experiments were performed in-situ inside an SEM at temperatures of 20, 200 and 400 degrees Celsius. The influence of temperature on the mechanical properties and deformation behaviour at different layer thicknesses was studied by means of the obtained material parameters and SEM observations in pillar deformation. TEM cross-sections were fabricated and analyzed to further investigate and/or confirm some of the deformation-related suspicions. The results and observations were used to draw qualitative conclusions on the high-temperature performance of the material.","multilayer; nanoscale; micropillar compression; deformation mechanisms; high temperature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Novel Aerospace Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Sustainable energy generation through renewable sources is a rapidly expanding industry within the energy sector and as part of that the industry applies floating turbines to convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy. Moreover the maintenance cost of the floating turbine is lower compared to the fixed turbine, although the hydrodynamic interaction is not completely understood. This work, firstly studies the effect of the thrust and power generation of an horizontal axis tidal turbine under imposed surge and pitch motion. Secondly, a 2D numerical model of a floating moored platform with the turbine is used to analyse the influence of the hydrodynamic interaction between the platform and the tidal turbine in time domain. To gain understanding in the coupled dynamic system, it will be subjected to a single harmonic wave and constant current profile. Tidal turbine models are typically used from the quasi-static wind turbine models, which are known as the Actuator Disk Momentum (ADM) Model and Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model. Furthermore the quasi-static models are compared with the reproduced experimental data from existing literature. Both models are analysed at blade pitch angles (θ) of 5o, 7o and 9o. For analysing the dynamic model, the quasi-static BEM model is extended to account for the added mass effects in the axial direction of the blade. As with the most turbine system, a control system regulates the turbine to maintain the desired power output. The quasi-static BEM model as well as the dynamic BEM model is analysed from an optimal operation criteria especially for the fixed rotational speed and control rotational speed. Also the models are analysed at different oscillatory frequencies at θ = 5o, examined under the same hydrodynamic conditions. The results provide an insight into the added mass effect (force) in the axial direction on the blade and will support our understanding with this kind of phenomenon, for a rotor operating in unsteady flow. The outcomes for the thrust and power generation of the floating turbine and fixed turbine are compared at a water depth of 105 m and a single harmonic wave, with an amplitude of 1 m. The results for thrust and power extracted from the floating turbine are higher due to the relative velocity acting on each blade section. However the fixed turbine captures only the incoming wave loading whereas the floating turbine is subjected to the wave loading and the motion of the platform.","2D numerical model; BEM model; floating turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineer","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A telemanipulation system lets a human operator manipulate an environment on distance, using a master and a slave device, which are connected by a bilateral controller that controls the master and the slave device and provides the communication between these devices. The master device is manipulated by the operator and these actions are transferred to the slave device, using the bilateral controller. The interaction forces between the slave device and the remote environment are fed back to the operator, which provides awareness and allows a task to be executed efficiently and safely. Currently, one of the limitations of telemanipulation systems is that interaction forces are typically indirectly transferred to the human operator. Firstly, a commonly used concept to determine the feedback forces, is by coupling the master and slave position, using a proportional controller. Secondly, feedback forces are generally applied on the master device, which then transfers these forces to the operator through its end effector. Because of the dynamics of the master device, these forces are distorted as they are transferred to the operator. This reduction in force feedback quality decreases awareness of the operator and thereby likely reduces his or her task performance. To minimize the distortion of the feedback forces by the dynamics of the master device, often a parallel manipulator is used as master device. Compared to a serial manipulator, a parallel manipulator has the advantage that the moving masses are small, because the actuators are positioned at the base. However, the difficulty of parallel manipulators is the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the device, which is much more complex than the modeling of serial manipulators. The goal of this research is to improve force feedback quality. This is achieved through the design of a local admittance controller for a parallel master device, which will cancel out the dynamics of the parallel master device and allows them to be replaced by desired dynamics (desired mass, damping and stiffness). Using this approach, the feedback quality will not only be of higher quality, but will also enable a more complete and intuitive method to design the force feedback. However, generally an admittance controller requires the external force applied by the operator as input. Force sensors are expensive and fragile. As a more cost-effective solution, in this thesis the external force will be obtained by force estimation using a model based observer. The model based observer only requires the position measurements, and control wrench (combination of force and torque) at the end effector, as input. The admittance controller for the parallel master device, without the use of a force sensor, is configured by combining insights from different fields of robot analysis and control. The control algorithm will be build up by a computed torque controller, the desired dynamics to shape desired acceleration, an observer, an observer based force estimator and methods to derive a kinematic and a dynamic model of a parallel manipulator. The control method is tested on a three degrees of freedom planar parallel device: the Munin. The tests show that the algorithm is able to replace the dynamics of the master device with desired dynamics, such that the device admits a certain motion, with respect to the desired dynamics and the external force applied by the human operator. The limits of the range of desired stiffness, damping and mass, that can be projected on the manipulator’s end effector by the control algorithm, are explored. This range is large enough to conclude that the algorithm is suitable to be used on parallel master devices, to project desired dynamics on the end effector of the device, without the use of a force sensor. The control algorithm is designed to control the master device of a telemanipulation system. This enables a intuitive configuration of force feedback. The desired dynamics can be shaped, which can be beneficial to advanced control concepts, such as haptic shared feedback and model mediated control, on top of the feedback directly available form the measurements at the slave device. Furthermore, the control algorithm could also be beneficial for the safe operation for all kinds of devices that cooperate with a human, because of the force estimation, instead of force measurement on one point of the device, will react to all forces applied anywhere on the device.","parallel manipulator; admittance control; force estimation; haptic feedback; force feedback; telemanipulation; teleoperation; dynamics model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Control engineering","",""

For insurance companies, the valuation of embedded options is an important topic within risk management. This valuation can become too computationally heavy when nested Monte Carlo simulations are used. To overcome this computational drawback, this thesis proposes an alternative method: the construction of an interpolation function based on radial basis functions. An overview of the interpolation method is presented, along with detailed looks into its features, exploring the topics accuracy, numerical stability, calibration of parameters and extrapolation. Furthermore, a new technique to sample data centers is presented. Starting with a small initial data set, new data centers are sampled iteratively. By doing so, in each iteration the current interpolation can be assessed; new data centers are based on this assessment. The use of such a data-dependent bottom-up sampling procedure is motivated by the computational costs related to constructing data centers; the number of data centers is preferably as low as possible.","numerical; interpolation; radial basis function; option pricing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Vuong, H.P. (mentor)","2016","Silicon wafers are getting bigger and bigger in the production line, aiming for faster manufacturing, lower cost and higher yield. The handling/transportation technique is becoming more and more critical during the production. As the wafer is being handled with physical contact there is always risk of damage and contemination coming from the contact surface. Contactless wafer stage utilizes a thin film of pressurized air to support the wafer, provides wafer handling without physical contact, hence reducing the risk of damage and contamination. A special contactless 3DoF wafer stage called ""the Flowerbed"" is developed by H.P.Vuong during his PhD research. This flowerbed has a creative mechanical design to combine the wafer support and driving function, so that the wafer can be supported and driven by pressurized air with 3 degrees of freedom (x-y-theta). The goal of this MSc research is to design an actuation system for the Flowerbed, and design a special pneumatic actuator specific for this application. Two actuation configurations are discussed and the concept of 3-RPR parallel manipulator is chosen. Pneumatic actuator is chosen to be the type of actuator in this research. This pneumatic actuator has to be specially made, because the requirement of the actuators is, that it should have a stroke of 80 micro meters, with a maximum force of higher than 140N, and the required bandwidth is 150Hz. Such pneumatic actuator is rarely seen and is not available. A model is developed for this special pneumatic actuator, and is validated by test setups. Further development is made by a design with piezo buzzer. This piezo buzzer is implemented as a low cost valve with high performance, and the use of piezo buzzer makes it possible to integrate the valve into the actuator housing, hence further reduce the cost and improve the performance. A prototype is made to demonstrate the feasibility of such kind of pneumatic actuator. This prototype meets the requirement of the actuator and has very good performance for small range of stroke. However due to the weakness of the pneumatic actuator, the performance of large stroke must be improved. The knowledge developed in this research is summarised as a design method, and a GUI toolbox is made using MATLAB. This toolbox can be used to assist the design of such actuator, reducing the difficulty and provides assist for further research.","pneumatic; actuator; contactless; wafer; stage; piezo; low cost; RPR; valve; orifice; compressed air","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronic System Design","",""

Therefore, a case study is conducted in order to investigate the current technological abilities within the Netherlands in order to protect itself against possible tornado hazards. In this study the development of an EF1 tornado, reaching wind speed between 138-177 km/h, was detected on 03 November 2013 by the high resolution polarimetric X-band radar IDRA. Results have shown that IDRA was able to detect tornado signatures such as hook echo, V-notch and wind shear, 20 minutes prior touchdown. These observations were verified by multiple systems, located near IDRA site, including radar profiles, C-band radars. Moreover, in-situ measurements were available during the evolution of the tornado storm. From this synergy-based analysis, made possible by the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), it was found that their combined efforts can potentially lead to an effective system for early warning detection of tornadoes.","X-band radar; Weather radar; Tornado detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","","51.9700033, 4.9240553"

A series of case studies have been used to find and identify themes, strategies and design elements that can be used to design restorative spaces. These findings, combined with the theoretical framework form the basis for the themes, strategies and tools detailed in the proposed toolbox.

The high-rise tower combines a public plinth with offices and dwellings extending the public space on the pier into an indoor wetlands. Each of the functions deals with the restorative spaces in a different manner. In order to create a coherent route the spaces are linked to natural environments based on qualities such as connection with water, far sights, or a dominant view towards the sky all depended on the vertical location of the space.

By researching the philosophical theorems of Thomas Hobbes and Jürgen Habermas, the student has taken position as foundation for a redesign of the Dutch seat of parliament: the Binnenhof, located at The Hague. The philosophical framework provided ground for a research of the concept of ‘the Public Sphere’ and its relation with the design of public spaces, regarded from the views of the philosophical, social and urban sciences. The stated position has been expressed in a design, making the project a ‘spatial manifesto’. With this design, a statement for a more public parliament complex is made visible.

(mentor)","2016","Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a 3D-printing method to produce metal parts. In SLM a part is manufactured layer-by-layer by selectively melting a metal powder with a laser. Although SLM is a promising process for the production of high-quality parts, the implementation in high-tech industry is held back by a few barriers. One of the main barriers in the adoption of the process as a new production method are the high residual stresses and large deformations that arise in a part during manufacturing. The residual stresses may limit the load resistance and contribute to the formation of thermal cracks. Furthermore, it is difficult to ensure a constant quality during the build-process, resulting in e.g. varying porosity throughout the part. To obtain a better understanding of the process and predict processing and structural part characteristics prior to production, various modelling techniques have been proposed in literature. The majority of these models attempt to capture the movement of the laser by means of the finite element method (FEM). However, the fine discretization required to capture the steep thermal gradients in the vicinity of the moving laser spot, renders these types of models computationally too expensive to perform a full build-analysis of a component. Moreover, the transient nature of the heat transfer problem also increases the computational requirements. The aim of this research is to develop an efficient and simple, yet reasonably accurate thermal model of the SLM process, that is able to describe the influence of the process parameters on the level of residual stresses and the amount of porosity. To reach this objective, a semi-analytical modelling approach is proposed. The moving laser is represented with a set of point sources for which the closed form analytical solution is known. This solution efficiently captures the transient nature of the heat transfer problem and the steep thermal gradients in the vicinity of the moving laser. Since analytical solutions for a point source are limited to simple problems with specific types of boundary and initial conditions, a complementary correction field is superposed to the analytical solution to prescribe boundary conditions of interest. Predictions of the analytical part of the semi-analytical model are compared to experimental data, and it is found that, for the majority of the data, the predictions are within 10\% of the experimental values. Furthermore, results of the semi-analytical model are compared to an infinite series solution for a simple problem and show good correspondence, indicating that the implementation of the model is correct. A sensitivity analysis of the analytical part of the model to changes in the material properties, process parameters and scanning strategy is performed. It reveals that these factors significantly influence the melt pool dimensions and the maximum spatial thermal gradients that occur over time. It is suspected that the maximum spatial thermal gradient over time is a measure for the residual stresses in the end-product and that the stability of the melt pool influences the amount of porosity. Consequently, it is expected that by controlling the process parameters and scanning strategy, the porosity and residual stresses can be controlled. Single and multi-layer predictions are presented using the semi-analytical model. The simulations demonstrate that the scanning of overlying layers has a significant impact on the thermal history in the layers below, resulting in additional cycles of rapid heating and cooling. Furthermore, it is found that the time between the scanning of subsequent layers is sufficient for the material to cool down to the build-chamber temperature. This means that subsequent layers can be modelled separately. In an initial speed comparison with respect to a FEM-model the semi-analytical model is shown to have the potential to be much faster (up to three orders of magnitude) than a standard FEM-model. Consequently, it is a promising method to investigate e.g. the porosity and the residual stresses throughout several layers, and may potentially be used for the process optimization of small problems. However, in the current implementation the coarse numerical discretization limits the resolution at which the temperature profile can be evaluated. This limits the accuracy with which the melt pool dimensions and the maximum thermal gradient can be predicted. Concluding, the semi-analytical model provides a reasonably accurate thermal description of the SLM process. It is a promising method to investigate the amount of porosity and the level of residual stresses as introduced during the SLM process in a computationally efficient manner. Some recommendations for future research are given.","Selective Laser Melting (SLM); additive manufacturing; thermal modelling; semi-analytical formulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-04-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Damen Twin Axe Fast Crew Supplier (FCS)2610 is an offshore wind farm maintenance vessel that can safely and efficiently transfer mechanics between land and a wind farm. The thesis objective is to research the operational capability of the FCS by gaining insight into the push docking procedure of the transfer process. To keep the vessels bow steady and in position against the wind turbine tower during push docking, a fender is placed on the bow. Currently, it is not clear which phenomena play a role in making the fender stick or slip. This makes the fender a bottleneck in the relatively low operation profile, leaving room for improvement. In the push docking procedure condition, the FCS is pushed against the turbine tower using thrust generated by the drive train. The fender provides friction between the vessel and the tower. Disturbances by the environment, like waves, cause the bow to either slip or stick along the tower. An unexpected or long distance slip makes it unable for the mechanics to transfer from the FCS to the turbine tower. The objective of this research firstly is to gain insight in the interaction between the fender and FCS’s motion behaviour and its influences on the friction performance – the obstruction of the sliding motions between the fender and wind turbine. A second objective is to develop a prediction method to define safe transfer operations based on the fender-vessel friction performance in a yearly described sea – the operability. By use of calculations and simulations – in which boat, fender and environment are represented as real life components – two models are built that provides a description of the sea behaviour of the FCS and simulates the slick/slipping process of the fender against the wind turbine. In both models irregular head waves are described by a Jonswap spectrum. Model 1 merely represents the stick condition by using a frequency domain approach, in which the FCSs bow is ‘hinged’ against the turbine tower by springs in horizontal, (transversal) and vertical direction. Model 2 describes both stick and slip condition, describing the vessel motion interaction in the time domain. The fender is described by separate components, combining a ‘negative deflection’ based reaction force, a linear spring system and a (modified) coulomb friction block simulating the stick/slip phenomenon. Both models were validated in stick condition with results from towing tank tests. To define safe transfer possibilities, a condition check method judges the simulation conditions to be either safe or to be unsafe for transfers. With this the yearly ability to perform maintenance – operability – is determined. Based on the results of the sensitivity study, several influential design parameters can be identified. During stick conditions, in vertical direction a less stiff fender, higher static friction coefficient and increased thrust results in an increased operability. During stick and slip conditions, the thrust force has a major influence, higher thrust means an increasing operability. The dynamic friction coefficient is concluded to have less influence. The non-linear model causes the operability to be non-linear. In addition the operability is highly influenced by the simulation parameters (most important the friction slope) and the safety restrictions of the condition checker. These are both unknown but arbitrary chosen for this thesis. Therefore further investigation into these parameters is required to provide an accurate description of the yearly operability.","slip; operational capability; operability; hydrodynamics; frequency domain; time domain; catamaran; fender; friction; stick","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

From point A to point B, they moves through network of roads and rails. Cities depend on the infrastructures. However the infrastructures have the double contradictory role of maximizing the movement of a selected population — one that uses a vehicle — between the city and its suburb while simultaneously being an obstacle to all movement perpendicular to its own, thus acting as a form of wall dividing the urban carpet. The urban populations, in particular the lowest social classes that do not necessarily own a car, find themselves detached from the the city they live in, trapped by these axes of segregation cutting the urban fabric like canyons. The speed of vehicles, its rigid and cold materials are also contribute to hardness feels of the urban canyons. Therefore, cities are divided physically and mentally by these lines. The Charging Wall project deals with an increasing pressure of the unbalanced growing between the infrastructure and the urban fabric that has been going on in various developing countries including Casablanca, Morocco. Based from the studies of van Eyck and Kahn, the Charging Walls aim to explore more into the capacity of walls in reweaving its urban fabric created by the urban canyon effect in several scales. The in - between city which act as a cushion between hardness of infrastructure and softness of people with the help of three wall typologies; the Bone, Joint and Tendon. Each one has its own scale, form and character which intended to encourage different interaction between people and infrastructure. The Charging Wall is a new city located above the line that not only would help improving the surrounding neighborhoods with its existence but also generate more questions on what extent can a single wall be. The role of a fundamental architectural elements; the wall that is once considered solely as a dividing tool could also take parts in connecting between the two opposite realms. In order to achieve that, the project would focus on the fundamental architectural elements and shapes to perform an active mediating role between different urban grains, degrees of hardness or speed, which will be deliberately designed responding to the differences from its context.","infrastructure; charging walls; weaving city; Casablanca","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Methods and Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2016","The Sand Motor is a unique and dynamic solution for coastal erosion, aimed at distributing the nourished sand along the Delfland coast. Besides enhancing coastal protection, the Sand Motor has been designed to also provide opportunities for recreation and nature development. The contributions of ecosystems to human well-being, that arise from interaction between biotic and abiotic processes, are called ecosystem services. The Sand Motor provides several ecosystem services, such as recreation, coastal protection, a fresh water supply by dune filtration and it provides different types of habitats for species. Typically, ecosystem services are evaluated for one snapshot in time, usually at the initial state of the design. However, due to the dynamics of the Sand Motor, the ecosystem services are likely to change over time and space. To research the ecosystem service dynamics of the Sand Motor in the future, there is a need for an objective and concrete framework that is able to assess the services on a temporal and spatial scale. Predicting the response of a nourishment on the ecosystem services by means of a process-based model could improve the decision-making regarding integrated coastal zone management. The aim of this study is to assess the decadal development of the ecosystem services of the Sand Motor. This research focused on some of the services the mega-nourishment provides, namely coastal protection, recreation and habitat provision. Future morphological behavior of this intervention is being studied by process-based numerical models, which has resulted in morphological predictions, made with Delft3D, up to forty years ahead. There are many factors that are important to the actual use of ecosystem services that are difficult to incorporate into a long-term prediction. Therefore this research focused on the long-term potential of the ecosystem to contribute to human well-being, based on the physical capacity of the ecosystem to provide the service. The ecosystem service potential of the Sand Motor is evaluated on a yearly basis, forty years ahead and on a large spatial scale from Hoek van Holland to Scheveningen. The state-of-the-art Delft3D model was set up to make a long-term forecast of the morphology and, according to literature, has not been used previously in (dynamic) ecosystem service assessments. To verify the model performance regarding the prediction of ecosystem service dynamics, the computed ecosystem service potential was validated using the first four years of observations. The results indicate a robust enhancement regarding coastline maintenance that holds beyond the envisaged lifetime of twenty years. North of the Sand Motor, the coastline orientation is predicted to change, thereby decreasing the sediment transport gradients. Beach width available for recreation is expected to increase drastically along the entire Delfland coast. This may threaten the recreational potential at the beach of Scheveningen South, Kijkduin and Hoek van Holland. Regarding nature development, the diversity of habitats has increased on a spatial scale and will be preserved over time. To compare the effects of changing design parameters on the potential, the ecosystem service dynamics are evaluated for two alternative mega-nourishment designs: an offshore Island and an upscaled traditional foreshore nourishment that is implemented every four years. The research turned out to be a useful exploration of the opportunities of using a morphological model forecast for ecosystem service prediction. Furthermore, a dynamic assessment in which the long-term situation is evaluated annually, on a large spatial scale, has proven to be valuable to Building with Nature solutions. Ecosystem services are not yet explicitly incorporated in the design of Building with Nature projects and this research takes a step towards integrating ecosystem services into the design of future nourishments.","Sand Motor; Ecosystem services; Delft3D; forecast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.05207, 4.18495"

(mentor)","2016","The habitability of exoplanets is determined by their surface properties and atmospheres, spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to characterize these. Numerical models can be used to simulate the polarimetric signals of these exoplanets, but these computed signals have to be compared with observations. The best test-case for such a comparison is the Earth, as the atmospheric and surface properties are well-known and the signal can be computed to a high accuracy. The Lunar Observatory for Unresolved Polarimetry of Earth (LOUPE) shall take measurements of the unresolved Earth being based on the Moon. When observing exoplanets or the Earth, dust in planetary systems acts as a noise source and a source of confusion. This so-called zodiacal dust adds to the polarimetric signal of the planet and in some cases a dust clump might be confused with a planet. The aim of the thesis is to develop a computational tool that allows to analyze the zodiacal dust in order to estimate the noise level and to determine if dust clumps can be distinguished from exoplanets using their polarization signals. The developed computational tool is called ZPEC: the Zodiacal Dust Polarization Evaluation Code. It uses a Monte-Carlo based algorithm in order to track individual photon paths. When photons are scattered their polarization properties are calculated, which are verified using the Adding-Doubling code for flat layers. ZPEC allows to analyze how photon properties change when they are scattered multiple times by a dust particle, whereas classically it is assumed that zodiacal dust disks are optically thin enough to assume photons are scattered only once. The dust model of the COBE/DIRBE mission is used to model the dust in the Solar System, a NASA collisional model was used to model the dust disk surrounding star ? Pictoris. The ZPEC photon property databases are used to generate hypothetical detector views. Using ZPEC it is concluded that the Earth sometimes seems to disappear against the polarization signal of the background dust, while the maximum brightness of the dust to the Earth signal is 0.14%. It is also concluded for the dust disk orbiting ? Pic that ignoring multiple scattering leads to errors in the calculated polarization signal that are estimated to be 4-9% (relative). In addition it is concluded that dust clumps show the same polarization behavior as the surrounding dust, while planets do not. Hence using brightness only the two can be confused, but they can be distinguished based on their polarization behavior.","zodiacal dust; exozodiacal dust; exoplanets; polarimetry; dust disks; Beta Pictoris; multiple scattering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Spaceflight","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor)","2016","Lightweight composite sandwich structures are particularly susceptible to impact damage. Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) is known to affect the short and long term load bearing capacities of composite structures. Active acoustic Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have the potential to detect such damages before they lead to structural failure, and could thus be applied in a condition based maintenance approach for the DragonFly fuselage. This study was aimed at increasing the level of understanding on the propagation of ultrasonic (Lamb) waves through sandwich composite media and its response to the DragonFly fuselage structural integrity. These two aspects were combined to arrive at a theoretical prediction on the influence of BVID on the through-transmitted signal in an active acoustic SHM system with a pitch-catch setup. The propagation mode and impact response were verified experimentally. A Finite Element (FE) model was created to verify the predictive power of the FE modelling technique for the specific application of active acoustic SHM. Two Lamb wave propagation modes were identified both theoretically and experimentally: the Global Lamb Wave mode and the Leaky Lamb Wave mode. Occurrence of these modes was dependent on the central frequency of the transmitted acoustic signal and the bulk wave velocities in the sandwich structure’s core compared to the Lamb wave mode propagation velocity in the structure’s skins. Other modes (True modes and Rayleigh modes) were identified theoretically, but could not be experimentally confirmed. It was expected and shown experimentally that the presence of impact damage on the propagation path of a signal with 120kHz central frequency reduced the time travelled by this signal between two points, while increasing the amount of energy lost. The latter effect was shown to be reversed at 160kHz, which was explained by the propagation of the signal at this frequency as Leaky Lamb Wave. The FE model could predict the overall trend at 120kHz, but not the exact magnitude of the influence of impact damage on the through-transmitted signal.","Structural Health Monitoring; Lamb Waves; Sandwich Composites; Barely Visible Impact Damage; Leaky Lamb Waves; Global Lamb Waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","",""

(mentor); Nijse, R. (mentor); Gard, W.F. (mentor); Knijtijzer, J. (mentor); Van Amerongen, G.J. (mentor)","2016","Introduction The daily life of inhabitants of Hagonoy, the Philippines, is affected by tidal and fluvial floods. Ground subsidence is the main cause of a worsening trend of these floods. Excessive uncontrolled groundwater subtraction creates a ground level decrease up to 5 cm per year. In combination with yearly six to nine typhoons raging over the country, this leads to unliveable conditions. In order to contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the inhabitants, a modular amphibious structure is designed to keep buildings above the water level. Part I -Background In order to design a suitable amphibious foundation for Hagonoy, a research is done into modular, circular building concepts. Hereby a desired translation of the Dutch building concept of Finch Buildings into a Filipino concept can be made. In combination with criteria concluded from research into floating behaviour of structures and from an analysis of the location, a number of criteria is listed, on which the design of the floating modules and the connections is based. Part II – Structural design By analysing and rating several floating construction types and connection types, a concept design for a modular prefabricated amphibious foundation is made. Timber frame, filled with recycled 200L barrels is the basis for a flexible building concept. Three scenarios in which the foundation must give a proper structural performance, are outlined. Due to change in water depth, the structure must be able to function in a dry, a just-floating and a floating position. Since this foundation must be able to carry varying configurations of buildings, multiple load cases can occur. The most unfavourable load cases occur during typhoons, due to high wind pressure and high and long wind generated waves. By creating a parametric visualization and calculation model, a first insight in dimensions, and width and length of the amphibious foundation is determined. This concept design for both foundation modules and connections between modules is elaborated more in detail. A timber structure of 1,20m x 2,40m holds eight 200L barrels in place. Due to brackish water, the timber structural elements must be protected against shipworm attack. In a brief research several possible solutions are described, of which wrapping structural elements with coir is determined to function best, according to previously stated criteria. In this design, barrels can be replaced in case of damages. Prefabricated foundation modules can be connected by a combination of a U-shaped bottom connection, and a relative fast fixable upper connection. By this connection a rigid wide body can be built in order to provide stability for all scenarios. Two case-studies, one being a foundation with a single building and the second being a foundation with a configuration of eight buildings, are tested by means of SCIA Engineer. For the foundation with a single building in floating position, deflections are too high due to extreme wind-generated wave loads. By increasing the width and length, deflections decreases. The largest bending moments and shear forces occur when the foundation with a configuration of eight buildings touches the soil on one side, due to a large heeling moment. These occurring bending moments and shear forces form an input for optimization of both the foundation module and the connection. In order to reduce the demand for groundwater, and thereby to contribute to reduce of ground subsidence, a design is made for making use of rainwater, and store it in the foundation. In addition waste water can be cleaned by integrated helophyte filters. Bamboo mooring piles create horizontal stability. By replanting bamboo, poles can be replaced over years. Part III - Conclusions A design for a prefabricated modular amphibious structure that is applicable in and adjusted to a flood and typhoon prone area, such as Hagonoy is delivered. Concluded from theory of floating behaviour and a rough cost estimation, a foundation for a single building is not recommended. In order to start building the pilot version, knowledge of actual behaviour of wind generated waves, optimization in the field of structural behaviour and costs are recommended.","floating; amphibious; Philippines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-04-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering/Structural Design","","52.0095, 4.3605"

(mentor)","2016","Cost is a design driver in any commercial business, and this is not different in the wind energy industry. The potential of cost savings on wind turbine towers through lightweight composite designs has been shown. However composite grid stiffened and lattice structures, which were shown to lead to significant weight reductions in aerospace applications, have not yet been under investigation for applications in wind turbine towers. In an effort to combine the advantages of composite lattice structures on structural weight with the expected cost savings through lightweight wind turbine towers, and with the observation that potential additional benefits in the airflow transparent nature of a composite lattice structure can be found, a feasibility study on a composite lattice wind turbine tower was proposed. The feasibility of this structure has been determined based on the objectives to: - Design a full scale composite lattice tower structure fulfilling the design requirements obtained from references. - Show manufacturability of representatively scaled samples of the structure. - Evaluate the real life mechanical performance and behaviour of composite lattice geometries under wind turbine typical design loads. - Obtain a relative cost figure for the composite design in comparison to a reference tower, based on the cost related to the process of tower production up to the assembly on-site. To achieve these objectives a literature review was performed on the state of the art in wind turbine design, and on the production and analysis of grid stiffened composites. A reference wind turbine, international regulations and design load references were identified as a good starting point for tower design. Literature on grid stiffened composite structures supports the expected weight saving potential of these structures. Based on the literature found an analytical smeared stiffness method was considered to be a suitable design tool to quickly obtain a preliminary design at the start of the project. Finite element modelling was identified as the design tool to perform more detailed modelling of the structure. Finite element modelling was also identified to be used in combination with a genetic algorithm to perform a weight optimisation on the tower design. Thermal expansion based tooling was identified as a manufacturing method which has effectively been used in the production of grid stiffened composite structures, but is a relatively expensive production method. Dry winding in combination with vacuum infusion at room temperature was identified as a relatively new and low cost out-of-autoclave production method and has therefore been used in this project. The reference turbine chosen to be used in this project is the ""NREL 5MW reference turbine"". This reference turbine is a virtual open source turbine based on properties of real life wind turbines and wind turbine design studies. Since the wind turbine data is open-source, the turbine has already been used as baseline in multiple studies. This was particularly of use as a reference in determining the design loads. The design loads used in this project were based on loads in normal wind turbine operations with a once in 50 year occurrence probability. The design loads used in this project were determined using a load probability distribution for the reference turbine during normal operations. The expected maximum loads the wind turbine tower can face in a 50 year timespan during normal operations were extracted form this distribution and used as design input. An analytical smeared stiffness optimisation method was used to obtain an expected range of composite lattice configurations. The outer bounds of this range, a large and small helical rib angle configuration, were used as input for the design of small scale glass fibre samples with which the vacuum infusion manufacturing method was determined. Through some iterations a manufacturing method was found which left no visual defects in the parts. The presence of visual defects in the parts was furthermore not found to be affected by helical rib angle. For the detailed design the final constraints considered were expanded to capture the natural frequency of the system, a minimum natural frequency constraint of 0.222 Hz has been determined based on the rotor operating frequencies. Modelling the forces generated by the weight of the tower itself was incorporated by implementing the distributed tower mass and a point mass representing the nacelle and rotor weight in combination with a gravity load. Furthermore the material modulus and strength properties required as input for FEM modelling in Abaqus were in detail determined for both glass and carbon fibre reinforced epoxies by using reference material test properties. A tri-hexagonal grid, also know as kagome grid configuration, has been chosen to make sure the node complexity was as simple as possible to reduce the risk of vacuum infusion problems. This risk reduces since only two ribs are crossing each other at nodes instead of three ribs crossing each other in one location for a triangular configuration. The geometry of the tower has been based on the reference tower but an extra base diameter constraint of 4.4m has been implemented to reduce excessive land based transportation costs for the tower sections. The composite lattice structure has been parametrized for effective optimisation based on the dimensional constraints and five rib geometry parameters: - Number of helical rib - Number of hoop ribs - Helical rib width - Hoop rib width - Rib height The ribs have been modelled using shell elements in the length and height direction of the ribs. The loads and nacelle plus rotor mass were introduced at a point in the combined centre of mass of the nacelle and rotor. This point was kinematically connected to the tower top and the tower bottom was clamped. Based on the first modelling results it was found that a glass fibre design could not at the same time be geometrically feasible and stiff enough to comply with the minimum natural frequency constraint when the tower has a base diameter of 4.4m. Using initial designs, a re-evaluation of the effect of the 4.4m base diameter constraint on transport and material cost was made using a carbon fibre design with a base diameter of 4.4m and a glass fibre design with a base diameter of 6m. It turned out that the carbon design was estimated to be 500,000 Euro less expensive. Therefore the carbon fibre alternative with a base diameter of 4.4 meter was favoured. Some model simplifications have been made in the modelling of the tower to reduce computational time. The natural frequency of the system has been accurately fitted to the tower top deflection to omit a separate frequency analysis and rib width tapering, non-linear effects and mesh convergence effects have been accounted for by means of knock-downs. A python genetic algorithm has been used to perform the optimisation. The python script automatically runs a Catia macro to update the design, and an Abaqus script to perform the analysis. The python script uses the Abaqus results on tower weight, max strain failure criterion and tower top deflection to determine the individual's fitness based on structural weight with penalty constraints on the strength factor of safety and tower top deflection. The genetic algorithm has been executed three times, with tighter ranges for the structural parameters in every step based on the results obtained in the former step. This optimisation approach led to a most optimal design found with a tower weight of 134.5 tonnes, a strength factor of safety of 2.41, and a natural frequency of 0.225 Hz. A mechanical test sample has been designed, to perform compression tests on a scaled section of the composite lattice tower. Specific attention has been given to the helical rib intersections since the helical rib width dimension led to large nodes in these locations. The load capability of the test bench was driving in the scaling performed which led to a scaling factor of 9.5 with an additional reduction of the rib height to the dimension of the helical rib width. It is a flat sample featuring three helical rib intersections. The hoop ribs on the outer edges of the samples are potted. The potting serves as a load introduction and sample stabilisation zone. Six samples of similar geometry are tested. The test data shows that the samples behave less stiff and are able to bear lower loads than the initial model predicts. The samples also show out of plane deflection behaviour which was not observed in the initial model. It has been found that the in-plane stiffness deviation was mainly due to smaller test sample rib cross-sectional areas than initially modelled, and slightly different fibre volume fractions in the test sample. And the out of plane deflection in the sample can be explained by the real life fibre distribution and waviness of the fibres in the sample. A rough progressive failure estimation has been performed using the improved model. The failure estimation was based on a maximum strain criterion and removing the element's stiffness when the element passed the maximum allowed axial strain. Using this the correct initial failure location can be estimated. The failure load found is 67 kN, where the test data shows a spread in failure load from 44 kN to 76 kN. The cost of the full scale structure has been determined based on the process of manufacturing tower sections to installing it on-site. This has been done by estimating material, production and possible savings on transport and assembly costs. The material cost has been determined based on the weight of the optimised design, the production cost has been compared with research performed on wind turbine blade production cost, and the transport and assembly savings were based on a wind turbine logistics reference study. It has been found that the material cost dominate the total cost of the composite tower, and that the composite tower is 1.7 million Euro more expensive than the steel tower reference. This cost increase boils down to an increase in cost of off-shore wind energy of 4.6-7.4\% which has to be compensated by the indicated potential additional benefits of the composite lattice tower to make the composite structure economically interesting. Based on the results of this study it has been shown that a geometrically feasible structure can be designed that complies to all design constraints. The manufacturability of small scale samples has been demonstrated, and the real life behaviour of the small samples has been tested in compression. Based on the test results the prediction of stiffness, strength and out-of-plane deflection have been improved. A cost estimation on the process of manufacturing tower sections up to installing the composite lattice tower on-site shows that the cost of off-shore wind energy increases by 4.6-7.4\% in comparison to steel towers. This has to be compensated by the indicated potential additional benefits of the composite lattice structure to make the composite structure economically interesting The final conclusion therefore is that a composite lattice tower for wind turbines shows to be structurally very promising, however further research is required into additional benefits of the structure to determine the final economic potential of the structure.","Fibre Reinforced Polymer; Composites; Lattice; Wind Energy; Wind Turbine Tower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-07","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor); Bergema, C.P.A.M. (mentor)","2016","The mission statement of KLM claims it wants to become the most ‘customer-centric, innovative and efficient European network carrier’, emphasizing the importance of innovation in the corporates’ long-term strategy. Becoming truly innovative requires KLM to unlock all its innovation potential of their employees to secure that all internal potential is fully brought to the benefit of the company. While the KLM executive committee acknowledges the important role of employees to innovation from a bottom-up perspective, there are no embedded operating systems for employees to personally work on their idea for the organization. Therefore the aim of this thesis is to provide employees an opportunity to take ownership of their idea and support them in their innovation processes. The design challenge states; ‘Design an innovation journey for KLM employees that motivates and empowers them to become an innovator by enabling them to act upon their idea and to allocate resources to improve, test, investigate and iterate on their idea until a feasible concept can be presented that will either delight the customer, improve operational efficiency or generate revenue!’ The innovation journey is seen as the complete innovators’ experience of both the innovation toolkit and the innovation program around the toolkit to be designed for this study. Three additional conditions for success state that the innovation journey; (i) needs to be aligned with other KLM business, (ii) should be embedded in the operations of KLM and (iii) requires management support for further continuation of the idea if strategic fit with the organization is determined. Firstly an internal analysis gave insight into the barriers and enablers of innovation within KLM; the barriers present are a (i) culture of traditions, (ii) presence of the not-invented here syndrome and (iii) slow implementation of ideas. While two other insights; (iv) no top-down alignment on innovation and (v) the scale and locations of the organization do not necessarily seem to form barriers but can in fact also reinforce the smaller eco-systems of innovation within departments. Innovation initiatives seem to be scattered around the company, however cooperation on innovation seems to work well both across and within departments nowadays. Followed by a literature review on the topics of (i) organizational culture, (ii) learning orientation and (iii) firm innovativeness the implications for research could be translated into design criteria for the innovation journey. Thirdly a multiple case study was conducted in which six corporates were interviewed on how they organize their innovation efforts within the company, with a strong focus on the initiation phase. The data analysis resulted in eight themes of innovation that were of valuable input to the action research. The eight themes studied are; (i) idea management, (ii) outside-in approach, (iii) innovation funnel, (iv) design and business methods, (v) innovation phases, (vi) organization structure & strategy, (vii) role of the idea owner and (viii) alignment of innovation to running business. Fourthly the action research was the most extensive part of the research; an intervention into the existing organization was conducted by the introduction of 10 innovation toolkits. To study the effects of this innovation toolkit and program, the action researcher was involved in co-defining the problem, co-designing the intervention process, and co-implementing that intervention together with the internal KLM stakeholders. Firstly the toolkit itself was redesigned; the basis for the toolkit was available thanks to the open-source material of the Adobe Kickbox, which was transformed into a KLM concept called the ‘Start-up Box’. This Start-up Box is designed to provide structure for employees to work on their idea during the initiation phase of innovation by offering toolkit resources, workshops and personal support to idea owners. Within the emergent process of the implementation of these toolkits, the effects of the intervention on both the participants and the organization were carefully observed and evaluated. This resulted in redesign recommendations for a future edition and an implementation plan for the Start-up Box within KLM. In the end this study successfully introduced a first edition of Start-up Boxes within KLM, it has proven to empower and motivate KLM employees to work on their innovative idea for the organization by creating an environment in which they are encouraged to innovate. Of the 14 participants 13 would recommend participating in the Start-up Box program to other KLM colleagues. Moreover 6 Start-up Box idea owners received management support to implement their innovation within a period of 10 weeks. The Start-up Box addresses multiple strategic goals of KLM with a minimum of resources; (i) it is a manifestation of the bottom-up approach for innovation opted in the Annual Report by the CEO, (ii) it unlocks the innovation potential of KLM employees for the organization and (iii) it contributes to the eco-system of innovation by its networking effect and intra-organizational knowledge sharing. Additional benefits of the innovation toolkit are the potential of storytelling about innovation - for which the physical artefact is very suitable - and creating awareness for innovation initiatives within the organization. Criteria for successful implementation of the Start-up Box are (i) cross-departmental implementation, (ii) structured follow-up on the Start-up Box program after the final pitches and (iii) management support from senior managers across the organization. Recommendations to improve the Start-up Box innovation journey are to (i) provide a better coaching system for individual support, (ii) emphasize the importance of testing the value proposition for improvement and to (iii) increase employees’ ability to pivot their idea if necessary. An important aspect to keep in mind when executing the Start-up Box program is that it affects employees also on a personal level; therefore coaching on a more individual level should account for the emotional component of the idea owners in their process of innovation. If KLM wants to foster an innovative culture and keep the innovation funnel filled with creative ideas by empowering their own employees to innovate, Start-up Box offers a successful innovation program to achieve this.","innovation; strategy; bottom-up approach; innovativeness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Pisano, F. (mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Van den Berg, K. (mentor); Damen, A. (mentor); Den Ouden, R. (mentor)","2016","Due to the growing offshore wind energy market and the increasing interest of the oil and gas industry, there is a steadily increasing demand for the use of jack-ups all over the world. Particularly, the number of wind turbine installation vessels has increased from 2 in 2005 to 40 currently, with a yearly growth expectation of 30% till 2020. Accident statistics from the Worldwide Offshore Accident Databank show the necessity for safer designs of jack-ups and other mobile offshore platforms. A better understanding of the soil-structure interaction and an accurate determination of the limiting loading conditions can contribute to the reduction of this failure rate. Due to the growing demand of jack-ups and the necessity for safer designs, an integral parametric model is developed to study the jack-up response comprehensively. The jack-up model combines a force resultant soil-spudcan interaction model with a structural model of the jack-up, both with 6 degrees of freedom. An illustration of the jack-up model is presented in Figure i. Environmental loads (wind-, wave- and current loads) are applied to the structural model to determine the load distribution in the jack-up structure and among the spudcans. Inputs for the jack-up model are structural properties, soil-spudcan interaction parameters, environmental conditions and preload forces. As output, the integral jack-up model provides hull and spudcan displacements for 6 degrees of freedom, internal forces and internal moments at the leg-hull connection and forces and moments applied on the soil. Furthermore, the model checks if the spudcan loads, applied to the soil, stay within the yield surface, which means that the soil response is linear elastic and the elastic soil model is valid. To assess the value of the developed integral soil-jack-up model including the chosen soil-spudcan interaction model, a comparison is made with the jack-up model combined with two other widely used soil-spudcan interaction models: a pinned soil-spudcan connection and a rotational spring connection. The comparison showed that the implemented force resultant soil-spudcan interaction model provides highly accurate results, in contradiction to the pinned and rotational spring connection. The rotational stiffness, included in the soil-spudcan interaction model, reduces the bending moment in the jack-up legs significantly. Use of the pinned soil-spudcan interaction model overestimates the bending moment in the leg. The rotational spring however, underestimates the leg bending moment. The developed jack-up model shows clearly a force distribution among the legs by means of the hull, which has a significant influence on the spudcan loads. Therefore, it can be concluded that an integral soil-jack-up model is preferred over a single leg model. A parametric sensitivity study on the soil stiffness factors showed 2 important facts. First, the rotational soil stiffness (k_r ) is the most important soil stiffness factor, since it has the greatest influence on the system response and load distribution among the legs, regardless of the applied load or reviewed spudcan load. Second, the response of the system approaches an asymptote for stiffness factors around the upper boundary values. For variation in the stiffness factor values around the lower boundary values, the system response appears to be much more sensitive. A parametric sensitivity study on structural properties of the jack-up showed the following. Increasing the spudcan radius has 3 major effects: it decreases the spudcan penetration, increases the spudcan displacements and decreases the mobilization of the rotational spudcan capacity. Adding extra legs to the jack-up results also decreases spudcan penetration and increases hull- and spudcan displacements. However, the torsional displacement and torsional moment of the hull and spudcans is reduced when extra legs are added to the jack-up. For a jack-up with one enlarged leg, the horizontal hull displacement is reduced but the torsional rotation is increased significantly. Enlargement of one leg has also a large effect on the torsional displacement of the spudcans. The enlarged leg attracts more loads than the normal legs. Due to its increased diameter, the total jack-up attracts more environmental loads.","Jack-up; Spudcan; Soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-04-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Offshore Engineering","","Bottom founded structures","",""

The most important hazard caused by green water is the direct impact load on deck, threatening equipment, hull structure and personnel. The goal of current green water research is to be able to (better) predict the risks of green water occurrences and the possible damage such an event might cause. Specifically our research has focused on the adequacy of the prevailing method of predicting green water flows, a method that draws on the analogy of the water flows released after a dam breaks (the so called Dam Break theory). Although this model is validated and widely used, we are not able to accurately predict the amount of water on deck, given a certain exceedance of the freeboard. To be able to do predictions for engineering purposes, physical model tests are the only accurate tool to predict green water susceptibility of an FPSO, as the software is limited. Since model tests are expensive, a better understanding of the green water problem is clearly needed. The hypothesis is that Ritter's Dam Break theory does not predict the water on deck accurately because different physical phenomena lead to different types of green water waves, not only the Dam Break type of flow. Instead of modifying the initial Dam Break theory to get to an accurate prediction method, an alternative approach to a better description of water height on deck is chosen, in which some, but very limited research is done. The assumption is that one theory does not cover the physical characterisations of all green water events. By comparing results from earlier tests conducted by SBM in the MARIN basin, we found significant differences between the Dam Break theory predictions and the empirical test results. By comparing information extracted from video footage with sensor measurements made simultaneously, we explored various explanations for these different trends.","Green water; FPSO; Dam Break","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Hydrodynamics","",""

The earth is being depleted of its resources and the changing climate could irreversibly change the planet for the worse. Sustainable buildings are mostly optimised for the use phase but neglect end of life scenarios. Buildings are often demolished and materials are dumped on a landfill. In a world where climate change and resource depletion is a pressing issue this is not acceptable. Buildings should be designed and made in such a fashion that allows for reuse and recycling of materials. Currently there is no suitable method available to design or to assess a building for this aspect. This research presents a method that increases focus on the end of life of buildings: zero-waste designing. The goal of this study is to assess a zero-waste approach on practical application on a design and its process. The main research question of this study is how a building can be designed to generate no waste in all phases of its construction and demolition. This is divided into three sub-questions: What are the principles and functional requirements of a zero-waste building design? What are important factors in realising a zero-waste building design? What is a possible design solution for an industrial building according to zero-waste principles and requirements? These questions are answered using a mixed approach of research and design. The specific demands, requirements and tips of zero-waste are compiled and then applied on a conceptual design. An industrial building is used as an example case to answer the questions from a practical perspective. The research concludes that three main points are important in a zero-waste design. Firstly, no waste may be produced during any phase of the life of the building. Secondly, every material used in the building should remain in its respective material cycle during its life cycle. Third, reuse of materials should be made possible in such a way that invested/embodied energy is maintained as much as possible or can easily be increased. From the industrial building design case the following was concluded: The overall design realises a zero-waste design by using the right materials and by maximising the attractiveness of disassembly at the end of life of the building by appropriate detailing and system choice. The design method as proposed can be difficult to implement fully on every building design. Overall it will be difficult to put a zero-waste approach in practice in the building industry to solve the pressing issues regarding the environment. A change of mind-set is necessary. The implementation of the proposed zero-waste method will also require an infrastructure that is not yet available. Some solutions in the design test case are unproven or uneconomical compared to conventional designs. This may lead to the design not being feasible to construct. It can be concluded that designing buildings to produce zero-waste at the end of life is possible, however more research will be required to also make it feasible and to prove the proposed solutions.","Zero-waste; Sustainability; Disassembly; Industrial building; Resource depletion; Reuse; Deconstruction; Demountability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Building Technology","","52.010332, 4.315898"

(mentor); Lacarbonara, W. (mentor); Arvin, H. (mentor)","2016","Much research has been done in the past couple of decades on the vibrations of rotating structures, such as helicopter and wind turbine blades. This is the consequence of ever increasing standards towards dynamic performance of these systems. Previous investigations have primarily dealt with constant rotational velocity, with a focus on the determination of the linear dynamic response. The rotational speed cannot always be considered constant due to fluctuating external loads or due to specific ramp-up regimes. This non-constant angular velocity brings about terms with time dependent coefficients in the equations of motion which can result in the existence of so-called parametric resonances. These resonance phenomena are quite unknown in this field of application. Nevertheless, they are of major concern to mechanical engineers because it can lead to structural damage due to large amplitude oscillations as a result of parametric resonances. In this thesis a fully geometrically nonlinear beam model is set up to study the fundamental behavior that causes parametric resonances in rotating blades. These equations are solved by means of two numerical approaches, the finite element method and the Galerkin method. The first one is used to obtain the linear modal properties. The Galerkin discretized equations are adopted to examine the linear and non-linear dynamics in time. The linear response is investigated to obtain the regions in which the unstable motions occurs due to parametric excitation. The non-linear response is obtained to show the stable post-critical behavior in these instability regions. Furthermore, it is shown that for specific values of the rotational speed and the parametric excitation frequency, instability occurs in each principal direction.","parametric resonances; non-linear; geometrically exact; rotating blades","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

This Shared Solution Space is an overview of the overlapping and conflicting requirements for the two contexts and gives a “richer” overview of both situations. The shared insights are used as a source for creative tension for ways forward. Create In the final design, there is chosen to create one device for both context scenarios, but with a context dependent interface. For the users in Africa, a new interface is created which helps during an examination with the Baby Viewer. The focus for the created the interface is on clear communication about how to use the Baby Viewer. Each step is explained and a step by step (swipe by swipe) routine is created. The suggestions for the physical device make it more intuitive to hold the Baby Viewer in the right position. The new colour and form give the Baby Viewer a more modern and playful, but still a medical, appearance. For the West, the Baby Viewer Diary is created. The diary is focussed on creating a nice memory of the pregnancy, making use of the ultrasound images made with the Baby Viewer.","Ultrasound Imaging; Echo; Africa; Context Variation by Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Kober, J. (mentor)","2016","Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool to derive controllers for systems where no models are available. Particularly policy search algorithms are suitable for complex systems, to keep learning time manageable and account for continuous state and action spaces. However, these algorithms demand more insight into the system to choose a suitable controller parameterization. This paper investigates a type of policy parameterization for impedance control that allows energy input to be implicitly bounded: Potential fields. In this work, a methodology for generating a potential field-constrained impedance control via approximation of example trajectories, and subsequently improving the control policy using Reinforcement Learning, is presented. The potential field-constrained approximation is used as a policy parameterization for policy search reinforcement learning and is compared to its unconstrained counterpart. Simulations on a simple biped walking model show the learned controllers are able to surpass the potential field of gravity by generating a stable limit-cycle gait on flat ground for both parameterizations. The potential field-constrained controller provides safety with a known energy bound while performing equally well as the unconstrained policy.","reinforcement learning; limit-cycle walking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biorobotics","",""

Governments around the world try to turn this trend around. One of the policies that is expected to influence BMI, is influencing travel behavior by making changes in the built environment. However, a lot is still unknown about the relationship between the built environment, travel behavior and BMI and about the causality of this relationship. For assessing whether implementing adaptions in the built environment is an effective policy, it is needed to further research this relationship. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling the short and long term relationships between the factors are defined and the strength of these relationships is assessed. The study finds that making travel behavior strongly influences BMI, and thus that steering travel behavior is a good approach for counteracting weight gain. For influencing travel behavior the study finds that both by making adaptions to the built environment, and by directly influencing the attitudes towards travel modes travel behavior can be influenced. In order to create effective policies research has to be conducted on the influence of detailed design characteristics of the built environment, on the impact of policies on other health indicators than BMI and on the applicability of the found results for younger and less affluent citizens.","built environment; travel behavior; body mass index; structural equation modeling; causality; longitudinal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Systems Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2016","Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, the occurrence of liver disease has also increased. In the last decade, important improvements have been realised in methods to treat liver disease, especially in the field of image-guided minimally invasive procedures. With the rapidly developing field of minimally invasive procedures, needle-tissue interaction has become a widely studied topic in research. A common way to study needle-tissue interaction is by the use of phantoms (representations of organs or tissues made of tissue mimicking materials). The goal of this master thesis project is to provide insight into the extent to which tissue mimicking materials, that are suitable for phantom production, reflect the behaviour of liver tissue during ultrasound-guided needle interventions, with a focus on axial forces. Building on previous research that was conducted at the TU Delft, we will focus on liver tissue. By reviewing relevant literature, 4 potential tissue mimicking materials are selected based on their mechanical and imaging characteristics that are supposed to determine the behaviour during needle insertions and ultrasound imaging. Materials selected are: gellan gum, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), polyvinylchloride (PVC) and candle gel. Different modalities of the these materials are defined, to be able to study the influence of several variables regarding the composition and manufacturing process of the materials. In order to define what kind of behaviour should be mimicked, (axial) forces in liver tissue are studied. The data on liver tissue used in the current study were gathered in a preliminary study conducted by T. de Jong. By analysis of the axial forces in liver tissue, criteria for the tissue mimicking materials (TMMs) are defined. These criteria are based on the friction slope during retraction of the needle, and the number and height of the peak forces during insertion (caused by encounters with structures within the liver). Subsequently an experiment is conducted in which axial forces are measured during needle interventions in TMMs. The axial forces in TMMs are compared to the axial forces that are observed in liver tissue with the use of the defined criteria. In addition to mechanical evaluation of the TMMs, their imaging characteristics are also assessed. Ultrasound images are obtained and compared to those of liver tissue. Combining the results of the three criteria (mechanical, imaging and practical aspects), we came to the following conclusions: Gellan gum does not cause enough friction to meet the retraction slope criterion. Also imaging of gellan gum phantoms is a problem as the material cannot hold shape without its beaker. Furthermore gellan gum is highly susceptible to fungal growth. PVA meets the mechanical criteria and has a liver like appearance under ultrasound. PVC and candle cause more friction than liver tissue and cannot be visualized by ultrasound imaging. We conclude that PVA has the potential to be a suitable liver TMM according to the criteria that are used in the current study. In addition to insight into the suitability of TMMs to mimic liver tissue in image-guided needle interventions, this thesis presents the influence of specific variables concerning the production or composition of TMMs on both the axial forces measured during needle interventions and imaging characteristics.","liver; phantom; needle; ultrasound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomechatronics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm that deals with optimisation and learns by interacting with its environment. Tabular reinforcement learning methods are popular because of their relative simplicity combined with good guarantees of finding an optimal solution. The downside is that they suffer from an exponentially growing exploration space, which will obstruct the learning of large tasks. Function approximation is the most commonly used alternative to deal with this problem. It involves interpolating of states that have never been encountered before by learning the values of generalising features. This generalising property is helpful in targeting larger problems and allows for faster learning. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to specify proper features that are required to learn a solution, and convergence cannot always be guaranteed. Generalisation at an even higher level is called transfer learning, where priorly acquired knowledge from one or more tasks is reused to aid the learning process of the next task. This thesis proposes a framework that combines tabular reinforcement learning methods with both of these generalising concepts to achieve a convergent learning process with good generalisation properties. To test the viability of the proposed method, it is used to solve discrete path planning problems. Results of these tests show that simultaneous learning with the help of function approximation in a parallel learning process can be leveraged to achieve a significant reduction in steps in both the first and consecutive tasks.","machine learning; reinforcement learning; tabular methods; function approximation; transfer learning; path planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

Such an evaluation method is needed for comparing different methods, but also to determine the operational limits of autonomous systems. This work proposes an evaluation framework which can find such limits. The framework comprises two sets of tests: detection tests and avoidance tests. For each set, environment and performance metrics need to be defined. For detection tests such metrics are well known. For avoidance tests however such metrics are not readily available. Therefore a new set of metrics is proposed. The framework is applied to a UAV that uses stereo vision to detect obstacles and three different algorithms to calculate the avoidance manoeuvre.","Obstacle Avoidance; Evaluation Framework; Complexity Metrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-01","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2016","Additional thesis report - In this research, a theoretical model is proposed to obtain a better understanding of how hydro-climatic change affects societies, and specifically how an increase in water scarcity can affect societies. The way this is done is not to look solely at the direct effects of water scarcity on a society, but also on the indirect effects it may have through changes in technological development and virtual water trade. Starting point of the research is a model of a society suffering from an increase in water scarcity. Pande et al. (2014) presented such a model that was able to replicate patterns of technological, population, production and consumption per capita changes. The model introduced in this paper represents a closed economy with only one good being produced. The aim of this research is to include the trade of water intensive goods, also known as virtual water trade. In previous studies it has been shown that global trade patterns can be influenced by water scarcity and vice-versa. General agreement about the extent to which this relationship holds is still lacking. One of the reasons for this is that there are many areas suffering from water scarcity actually exporting water-intensive goods. This is not very surprising when it’s considered that trade relations are dependent on many things other than water availability. By including the technological development of a society, and the production of more than one good, an attempt is made to design a model where trade can emerge from inherent dynamics. While the objective of the research is to construct such a model for two societies, the scope of this report is confined to the development of a model of one society that produces two goods. One of the goods is more water intensive, while the other good requires more labour. The model looks for the equilibrium situation, where the price of the goods is such that the supply is equal to the demand. This situation is called market equilibrium. Even though this equilibrium is almost never reached in reality, it can be used to display information about the driving dynamics that occur in reality.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Van Santen, R.J. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis was carried out in cooperation with VS-A, a façade engineering office based in Lille, Hong Kong and Seoul. It focuses on the development of an innovative all-glass façade system, which was imagined by Robert-Jan van Santen, founder and co-manager of VS-A. This technology is highly promising as it provides the possibility to remove all the disturbing structural elements that are usually required to support glass façades of significant height. It therefore complies with the recurrent desire of architects to design minimalist building envelopes by putting the emphasis on transparency, whether for aesthetic, practical or commercial reasons. This thesis therefore aimed at providing a thorough study of the feasibility of this new façade technology. To ensure its efficiency, several aspects were tackled. First and foremost, the structural principle behind the façade system was carefully examined, which gave the opportunity to evaluate the possibilities provided by the technology, in terms of reachable span and wind load resistance. Special attention was paid to the needed glass connections, in particular because these are always critical areas of glass structures. This theoretical study was completed by an extensive experimental campaign, which revealed the feasibility of the innovative system. In parallel to these structural considerations, a proposition was made for sealing systems so that the technology could properly be used as an efficient building envelope. Finally, the safety of the façade was analysed. Because glass is brittle and its strength is difficult to predict, a possible failure event must be taken into account, and all the more given that the concerned system should be applicable on façades with considerable heights for which glass breakage could have non-negligible consequences. To this regard, further studies will be carried out in the future, possibly by other students and TU Delft.","façade; structural glass; glass connections; strength","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Peer-to-peer platforms in the sharing economy have the potential to empower citizens and their development possibly leads to economic growth, environmental sustainability and social cohesion in society. However, these platforms put pressure on existing institutions and lead to problems on issues as consumer protection, working conditions and fair competition. Policymakers need to come with a suiting approach to both benefit from the positive effects, but simultaneously mitigate the negative effects. It is however hard to find this best approach and to make a trade-offs between different effectuated values, since it is hard to comprehend the development of these platforms and no theoretical overview of the effects is present in theory. The objective of this study is to compose this theoretical overview of the effects of peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms, in terms of effectuated values, involved actors and possible arrangements to mitigate negative effects. The theoretical overview must be suited for use by policymakers in making trade-offs to determine the best reaction towards these platforms. In order to create this theoretical overview a grounded theory approach was used. In this grounded theory approach a multitude of (semi-)academic sources was coded to find the relevant effectuated values, involved actors and possible arrangements. Categories of the found concepts were combined in a structured conceptual model that was validated using expert interviews and a theoretical comparison. The result of this approach is a substantive theory on the effects of peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms. The model discerns three different levels of effectuated values, depending on the scale and frequency of peer-to-peer transactions on a platform. These different levels of effectuated values are structured on the basis of their relevance for four different types of actors. Besides this five groups of possible policy options are identified. The created model gives a mapping of the effects of peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms and can be used by policymakers to assess the effects of these platforms in specific cases or on a more general level. Future work could focus on the improvement of the model by adding the mechanisms behind and links between the effects on values. Besides this, future studies could focus on specific effects that are mapped in the model or could use the created model as a building block to create a formal theory on the effects of the sharing economy as a whole.","Sharing Economy; Digital platforms; Peer-to-peer exchange; Values; Effects; Grounded Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","SEPAM","",""
