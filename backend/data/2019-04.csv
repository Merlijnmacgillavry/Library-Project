The possibilities of developing spacecraft through standard platforms, commercial of the shelf components and then reduced the costs of development has allowed new organizations to enter the space section. On top of that, traditional businesses have been benefited by these type of new spacecraft, as more technology demonstrations and riskier missions have been able to be developed through this technology. Nevertheless, these spacecraft systems cannot compete with their larger counterparts due to their size limitations. The extra space will allow for larger spacecraft to accommodate more complex and precise instruments and payloads. Therefore, an individual CubeSat will never be able to compete with a larger system. Nevertheless, in the last two decades, the concept of using the combined power of these simple and cheap systems to perform a task only possible with larger spacecraft has been proposed. One of the most interesting possibilities among the use of these distributed space systems is the use of swarming. Swarming is a technique which consists of the combination of a large number of simple elements to allow for the emergence of properties that allow the whole system to act as more than just its parts. The benefits of spacecraft swarming are undeniable, as inherently swarming brings robustness, flexibility, and scalability to the system, all three properties extremely valued in space missions.\\ For the moment spacecraft swarming has been mostly based on generating formation patterns with a large degree of autonomy. Still, only a handful of techniques have been explored. This work aims to further advance the knowledge of spacecraft swarming techniques. To do so, the implementation of a swarming algorithm never tested in space will be studied The advantage of this algorithm is double. First, as all swarming techniques, it presents a certain degree of artificial intelligence that will allow the swarm to cope with unexpected situations. Second, by design, this algorithm requires really little knowledge of the swarm environment. This translates in less need for information processing between spacecraft and within each spacecraft. Since the application is focused on already spacecraft with limited capabilities, this is certainly advantageous. To fully understand the work here presented, it is recommended that the reader possesses graduate-level knowledge on orbital dynamics and control, as well as some undergraduate notions of computer programming and artificial intelligence techniques. If the reader lacks knowledge on any of the mentioned areas, it is recommended to read the associated literature study referenced in the bibliography.","Spacecraft Swarms; GNC; Artificial Intelligence; Space Engineering; Control; Space Robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The automotive industry is continuously developing Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) that partially take over the driver’s workload. This has resulted in an increase in vehicle safety and a decrease in fatal crashes [1]. Full vehicle autonomy has not yet been reached, as the control systems involved are not yet capable of handling every situation. One of these critical situations is when a vehicle enters the unstable motion of drifting. A vehicle is prone to drifting on low-friction surfaces, and also during these generally unstable maneuvers, the autonomous system should be able to remain in control. The performance of an autonomous drifting controller should be exemplified by the experience of rally drivers in how to handle a vehicle and keep control of a vehicle while drifting. The objective of this thesis is to design a control system which is capable of handling a vehicle during a drifting motion and to follow a certain desired path. Vehicle dynamics are modeled as a three-state bicycle model to simplify the complex dynamics of the vehicle and the interaction between tyre and road. The definition of longitudinal wheel slip is reformulated to a smooth alternative to accommodate gradient based solving. With the system dynamics defined, the drifting motion is analyzed and equilibrium points are identified, showing differences between low- and high friction surfaces. Initially, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is applied with the purpose of steering the vehicle to desired drifting equilibria. Hereafter, the control system is extended to provide path following properties and addition of a dynamic velocity controller allows for a larger range of equilibria to be reached. The simulation setup intends to capture the experimental environment in the Network Embedded Robotics DCSC lab (NERDlab) at the Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC) department. Simulating a 1:10 scaled model allows to investigate the challenges that arise when implementing the control strategy on a scaled vehicle. These simulations show that autonomous drift control using the designed MPC strategy is possible, even when accounting for possible uncertainties such as delay, noise, and model mismatch.","optimization; control; autonomous; drifting; vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

One that does not require the addition of any sensors, but relies solely on measurements from the accelerometer and rotor controllers. The detection of obstacles is based on the principle that the airflow around a quadrotor changes when the quadrotor is flying near a surface. A well-known example of this is the ground effect, an increase in lift force close to a ground surface. Similarly, a change in dynamics occurs when a quadrotor is flying close to a wall or ceiling. The proposed method uses a reinforcement learning controller to detect obstacles based on these measurements, and take action to lead the quadrotor back to safety. A proof-of-concept of this method is developed by training a reinforcement learning agent to avoid obstacles beneath a descending quadrotor. This is first done in a simulated environment, where the influence of hyperparameters, the amount of noise in the state signal, and the number of training episodes are investigated. The best performing agent from simulation is evaluated during a flight experiment with the Parrot Bebop 1 drone, where it is able to prevent the quadrotor from hitting the obstacle in 80% of the episodes. Furthermore, it is shown that the same level of performance can be achieved, by learning fully from scratch, in-flight, without prior knowledge or training, during 50 real flight training episodes. An approach for extending this method to the avoidance of walls, ceilings, and smaller obstacles is discussed and the expected performance when doing so on the Parrot Bebop 1 is assessed. Additionally, it is shown that this method can easily be extended to other quadrotors, by demonstrating this on the Parrot Bebop 2 quadrotor.","Reinforcement Learning; quadrotor; quadcopter; Reinforcement Learning (RL); Machine Learning; Q-Learning; Paparazzi; Bebop; ground effect; obstacle-airflow interaction; Autonomous flying; UAV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Relatedness and belonging are two of the thirteen fundamental needs defined by Desmet and Fokkinga (2018). Designing for fundamental needs is one of the eight approaches to emotional design.<br/><b>The project</b>The social function football used to provide was what sociologists call “socialization”: the modification of the child’s behavior as they mature, and their assimilation into a grown-up world through customs, rituals and more (Tempany, 2014). According to Tempany, football has never been safer, better televises or more entertaining. Moreover, it has never been this individual and less about the culture of the people who shaped the football clubs (Tempany, 2014). Sports industry leaders cite the shift in consumer behavior of younger generations as the ‘top threat faced by the industry’ (PwC, 2018).Dutch football clubs are in search of new possibilities to involve and renew the connection with the younger generations of supporters. Vitesse is one of the football clubs that undergo difficulties to connect with younger supporters (age twelve (12) to sixteen (16)). Vitesse wants to play a more prominent role in the life of the younger supporters. In doing so, Vitesse is searching for answers to how they can (re)connect with the younger supporters.<br/><b>Research and design aim</b>During the analysis phase, a user study is done to understand how the younger supporters of Vitesse fulfill their fundamental needs within the context of football. The second objective is to find out whether the fulfillment of their fundamental needs differs from older generations. The study aims to identify elements that affect the fundamental needs defined by Desmet and Fokkingga (2018) to find which needs affect the emotional bond with Vitesse subsequently. The main insight derived from the user study is; the younger supporter of Vitesse supports Vitesse in their own since most of their peers support other football clubs. While the need to support collectively is present. They get in contact with their peers mainly through Fifa and other digital channels; fulfilling their need for belonging and relatedness and creating a more significant distance between them and Vitesse. This led to the aim to design an activity between fellow supporters and peers that allows them to grow social relationships, where the activity is guided and organized by Vitesse and its football players.<br/><b>Vitesse Buiten Spel</b>‘Vitesse Buiten Spel’ is a game platform based on football battles that allow the younger supporters to play football against and with each other at different places throughout Arnhem. The concept lifts playing football outside to a higher level by providing battles that are guided and demonstrated by the team of Vitesse and linked to specific places in Arnhem, aiming to achieve a positive social impact in Arnhem. The game is built-up in four elements that form a connection between the users, Arnhem and Vitesse to create a sense of belonging and relatedness. These elements are; (1) Who - Peers, (2) What - Play &amp; Discover, (3) Where - Arnhem, (4) How - Game. An app is developed to connect the four elements creating a connection between the game platform and the real world.<br/>Although the fulfillment of relatedness and belonging is difficult to assess, the user evaluation with children between the ages of twelve to sixteen years old in Arnhem reveals that ‘Buiten Spel’ helps to connect them to fellow peers and supporters. Moreover, the evaluation shows that the concept allows them to grow social relationships, stimulating them to be more involved with Vitesse while taking playing outside to a higher level.","emotion focused approach; relatedness; belonging; fundamental needs; vitesse; supporters; social value; social impact; involvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

By obtaining the surface pressure information, various inferences can be drawn such as flow separation, local flow velocity etc. Traditionally, the most common method of obtaining pressure has been through direct measurements by incorporating the test model with pressure taps, which makes the model expensive and complicated. However, often there arises a requirement to obtain qualitative information and visualise the aerodynamic features during the test. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) solves provides this qualitative information as well as quantitative information in the form of a flow field. Pressure can be further computed using this velocity field. This technique holds a number of advantages over traditional wind tunnel measurements, especially with reduction in resources for manufacturing, ease of handling and non-intrusiveness. However, the conventional PIV technique came with the disadvantage of only having 2D2C information. Other techniques like stereo PIV and tomographic PIV were developed to tackle these limitations and the most recent development was that of Coaxial Volumetric Velocimetry (CVV). Along with the advent of Helium Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB), this novel technique allows for large scale 3D3C measurements. This research is conducted to assess the feasibility of this promising technique to obtain surface pressure.<br/>The flow field around an inverted wing in ground effect is investigated using CVV by robotic manipulation. Using HFSB as tracer particles, the experiment was carried out in the W-Tunnel of TU Delft. The wing was tested at two angles of attack, α = 5° and α = 8° and three ground clearance configurations<br/>(h/c= 1, 0.6 and 0.3 at α = 5°) at airspeed of 10 m/s. The wing is equipped with a total of 30 surface pressure taps along the chord-wise direction, both on the pressure and suction side. The velocity field is obtained using Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm, Shake-the-Box and time-averaged velocity field is obtained by ensemble averaging of the obtained particle tracks. Static pressure is calculated using Poisson’s equation using the information obtained from velocity field. The pressure thus obtained is then compared with the readings obtained from pressure taps.<br/>Such an assessment not only shows the feasibility of the technique but also highlights the shortcomings and potential improvements. To the best of the author’s knowledge through a literature study, this particular technique has not been used to obtain surface pressure information. Most of the work published in the field of CVV is to study flow features, mostly in the wake. Hence, it is expected that this research and the recommendations help to further development of such a technique in the future.","Robotic Volumetric PIV; CVV; PIV/PTV; Pressure measurements; Poisson equation; HFSB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

The requirements for such roles necessitate unconventional features like twin fuselages (in case of ALO mother ships) and very high aspect ratio wings (for long endurance missions). For conventional aircraft, aside from improving safety, the driving factors for new designs have always been increased efficiency and performance. The prevalent approach has been to reduce weight and induced drag by using higher aspect ratio wings. Consequently, newer designs are lighter, more flexible and closer the failure limit. Therefore, the interaction between flight loads and the airframe, i.e.\ aeroelasticity has become important for a safe design. High aspect ratio wings undergo large magnitude, low-strain deformations. An accurate understanding of their aeroelastic behaviour requires nonlinear analysis methods. This thesis implements a reliable nonlinear aeroelastic analysis method in NASTRAN. The aeroelastic analysis modules in commercial finite-element analysis software are aerodynamically and structurally linear. At the same time, such software often has advanced nonlinear structural analysis capabilities. This thesis modifies and combines two approaches mentioned in literature. NASTRAN's aeroelastic module is used to obtain rigid aerodynamic loads and its nonlinear structural module to obtain structural deformations. For a given angle of attack, altitude and airspeed a wing is analysed iteratively until the rigid air loads and structural deformations for successive iterations converge. The nonlinear structural module is used to obtain pre-stressed structural modes for this converged condition. These modes are then used in flutter analysis. An idealised HARW with arbitrary properties is analysed using this method and using TU Delft's in-house aeroelastic optimisation software: Proteus. Static aeroelastic deformations and flutter analysis results are compared for validation. Following this, the results of the linear and nonlinear aeroelastic analysis are compared. It is shown that linear analysis over-predicts the deformation in flexible wings and that the inclusion of pre-stress changes the damping of critical flutter modes; thereby changing the flutter point for the wing. For the test case analysed in this thesis, the inclusion of geometric nonlinearity and follower force effects resulted in large changes in the flutter speed with change in the angle of attack. In this way, the thesis successfully implements a nonlinear aeroelastic analysis method which can be used to improve aircraft designs during the preliminary stage.","Aeroelasticity; Geometric non-linear; high aspect ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The project aims to find promising ways to fit a technical principle, which is being developed at the TUDelft, in the context of VL. VL endemic regions in Eastern Uganda and North-Western were visited during a two-week field trip to understand the context of VL. VL is a parasitic disease which is endemic in several parts in the world including East Africa. The disease is strongly related to poverty and mainly persists in remote and poor areas where health care services are limited. VL affects the internal organs and is fatal if untreated. There are many barriers complicate access VL diagnostics and treatment, such as the limited number of facilities, large distances, lack of trained staff and low index of suspicion by health care workers. VL is often misdiagnosed as the symptoms of VL are similar to many other diseases. In addition, current diagnostic practices have limitations in their performance (unreliable), especially in East Africa. More reliable diagnostic practices require more advanced tools and skills which are not available in most VL endemic areas. Thus, there is a need for a more reliable diagnostic test for the African VL context. The technical principle can be integrated on a diagnostic test strip to test a patient for VL. Based on a sample, it can separate and amplify the pathogens and detect their DNA with a CRISPR/Cas9 system. The result is a colourimetric read-out which indicates whether or not the patient has VL. This technical principle is based on DNA detection, which enables reliable test results independent of someone’s immune system. Additional advantages of this technical principle are that it is quick and broadly applicable. To understand where the technical principle could be implemented, a session was held with the team of IDE and Applied Sciences (TUDelft). This session resulted in the creation of seven scenarios which represent unique ways to combine the features of the technical principle into a diagnostic test which fits a diagnostic setting in the context of VL and matches a local need. After evaluation with Médecins Sans Frontières, the two most ‘promising’ scenarios are selected based on the feasibility of the technical principle, the contextual fit and the local need. The two selected scenarios are: ‘Screening &amp; Confirming” scenario and the “Test-of-cure” scenario.By detailing the selected scenarios, five variables where identified which clarify that the diagnostic setting influences the features of a diagnostic test. These are: 1) (geographic) location, 2) resource availability, 3) (medical) background of the user, 4) diagnostic moment, 5) patient status. Requirements are composed to see how the diagnostic setting affects the diagnostic test.

However, as the world saw many creative inventions resulting in harmful innovations, as well as creative endeavors resulting in deceptive and even criminal behavior, many researchers started questioning the relationship between creativity and ethics. One research area of emerging necessity, which has been getting continually more attention, is the area of Responsible Research and Innovation, which analyses how the process of creating something new, on the basis of research and innovation, can be done in a more responsible way, reflecting the need and values of society (Owen, Macnaghten, &amp; Stilgoe, 2012). In that way, it is possible to see efforts towards making the creative achievements of certain individuals or groups more ethical, which refers to the discussion between ethics and creativity. For being a considerably new area of research, there is still much left to be done. While most studies currently employ a macro perspective, focusing on how to systematize the development of a Responsible Research and Innovation concept, this work intends to identify individual characteristics of responsible innovators, thus looking at the micro level. This adds a new perspective to the scientific efforts in this area, showing a different way of approaching the same topic. Recognizing how the responsible innovative behavior happens should make it possible to better understand its motivations and how to reinforce them. By incentivizing those behaviors, society will benefit from more ethical efforts in innovation, reducing both intended and unintended harmful consequences for innovation.","Responsible Innovation; creativity; Ethics; behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The simulation of such models are computationally expensive and therefore, in recent years, high-performance computing systems have been identified as a possible solution to accelerate their execution. However, most of those implementations are model-specific and thus non-reusable for other modeling efforts, requiring a completely new development effort per model used. The challenge lies in offering high-performance and scalable libraries (so as to support the construction and simulation of large-scale brain models) while at the same time offering high degrees of modeling flexibility and parameterization. This thesis presents flexHH, a scalable hardware library implementing five accelerated and highly parameterizable instances of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model, one of the most widely used biophysically-meaningful neuron representations. As a result, the user is able to instantiate custom models using flexHH and immediately take advantage of the acceleration without the mediation of the engineer. The five flexHH implementations target the Maxeler Data-Flow Engine(DFE), an FPGA-based acceleration solution, and incrementally support a number of features such as custom ion channels, multiple cell compartments and inter-neuron gap-junction connectivity. Furthermore, for each of the five implementations it is possible to select either the forward-Euler, second, or third-order Runge-Kutta numerical method.

This improvement can be achieved by incorporating stakeholders in the process of port development. Social, environmental and economic development achieved together are defined as sustainable development. <br/>In the prospect of sustainable port development, Ethiopia is an interesting country to study because of its rapid and relatively stable economic growth since 2005 and its low logistics performance. This study is built around a dry port expansion project in Ethiopia, for which a 150 million USD loan from the World Bank recently became available. Modjo Dry Port (MDP) is located close to the capital of Ethiopia and its largest production and consumption areas. Before acting directly, the sustainability of the alternatives according to different stakeholders, should be considered. Incorporating sustainable development in the project in general is a significant challenge. This leads to the formulation of a research question. How to evaluate strategic alternatives for sustainable expansion of Modjo Dry Port? This study describes a method on how to develop a number of distinct alternatives, and proposes a framework for the evaluation of sustainable dry port expansion. Such an evaluation tool for the dry port site specifically, does not yet exist. The framework is tested for MDP in Ethiopia. <br/>For the development of the alternatives of MDP, two overarching themes at the dry port were identified: operations are inefficient with dwell time of 50 to 60 days on average, and no diversification of cargo. Based on these themes three alternatives for MDP are defined. For the sustainable evaluation of Modjo Dry Port the Multi-Criteria-Multi-Actor analysis (MAMCA) is used because it explicitly incorporates stakeholder incentives in a more traditional multi-decision criteria analysis (MCDA). The MAMCA consists of seven steps. <br/>Step 1 and 2: Four stakeholder groups for MDP are defined: internal, community, public policy makers and private companies. For the 3rd and 4th step, a framework for evaluation is constructed, based on literature and stakeholders’ input. The criteria are categorised based on the three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental and economic development. In step 5 the weights for the criteria of the evaluation framework are determined by stakeholders. In the last steps of the MAMCA the proposed alternatives were scored against the current layout of MDP for all criteria in the evaluation framework. The final output is a multi-actor view on scoring the alternatives. <br/>Dry ports closer to Addis Ababa are a suitable alternative for MDP. Stakeholder participation is an important part of the study, however, it proved difficult to integrate a sufficient number of stakeholder responses in the analysis. <br/>For MDP specifically, stakeholder groups showed similar interest, and the preference for different alternatives is equal amongst the groups. Analysis shows that the alternatives improving operation efficiency score markedly higher on sustainability.","Dry port expansion; Alternative selection; Sustainability; Ethiopia; Evaluation framework; Modjo Dry Port","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The variety seen in vegetation, topography, colors and textures, combined with the low demographic density verified in the majority of its territory, consolidates the image of the island as a rich collection of natural scenarios. However, beyond its beauty, the same landscape is also a living reminder of major historical events. From Mesolithic passage tombs to medieval monasteries, from abandoned copper mines to ghost housing estates, from WWII pillboxes to the recently demolished British Towers of the border, the Irish landscape, as the architecture embedded in it, is an ever-changing product of its past and a representation of its culture and its people. In the case of the Northwestern region of Ireland, new border conditions and political frictions may introduce complexities to the current reality. In face of Brexit, the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is reintroduced as a subject of discussion, twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement. At the same time, the prospective implementation of the Atlantic Corridor as part of the Ireland 2040 plan is expected to trigger new transformation processes in terms of economic development of the countryside and densification of the towns along the corridor. If history of landscape is intimately related to political and social trajectories, its relationship with human society is often mediated by architecture. Buildings have the ability of embodying meaning, reflecting through its formal elements the necessities and aspirations of the time. The positioning of an architectural artifact in the landscape – towers, obelisks, gates, temples – was usually the symbol of the human effort in overcoming nature, a metaphor about domination and power. Hence, considering that the binomial architecture-landscape is a representation of a broader context, the importance of its comprehension is not restricted to the reconstitution of a historical line, but also serves as a starting point to reflections about the impact that economic, political and social dynamics have on landscape. Looking to the past as means to address matters of the present and the future, the project aims to discuss the Irish landscape through the lenses of the architectural discipline.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Necessarily XXX",""

Even credible sources are distrusted or no attention is paid to their communications at all. The RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) is looking for new ways to communicate their findings in such a way that people do not only believe it, but also that they take it into account in their behaviour. A new approach is proposed to find new compelling ways to communicate through design. In doing so, a new way to design for behavioural change in general is composed. The idea behind this approach is the following: People understand their world in a certain way. They have models in their mind about how all kinds of phenomena in this world work. These mental models help people to interpret and predict, which is fundamental to making choices on how to act. Therefore, if we could influence those mental models, we get a new handle on guiding behaviour. This project has explored exactly that handle as it investigates the questions: How can we influence people’s mental models through design? And how can those mental models influence behaviour optimally? Many examples of mental models and designs that embody them were analysed thoroughly. This resulted in a wide range of types and dimensions of mental models and designs, which were collected in a framework. The framework offers strategies to compose, evaluate and refine mental models and designs that embody them. The framework, translated into a toolkit format, was tested with students. Although still lacking validation, the framework seems to be a good basis for further steps: -The framework and the initial toolkit as drafted in this project are a good start for developing a more usable toolkit. The initial test results suggest that the many handles that the framework offers for designing mental models and their embodiments are mostly useful. -The framework offers future research a comprehensive palette for analysing mental models and designs that carry them. The mental model approach as explored in this project is relevant not only for the design of specialized behavioural interventions, but also for design in general. It uncovers, and provides handles on, an element of design that is widely applicable since many designs and communications explain (or could explain) a mental model.","Behaviour change; Mental models; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In this project an analysis is presented on how the range of the negative stiffness can be increased by changing the geometry. The addition of longitudinal curvature to the tape spring results in a more gradual negative stiffness for a longer range of motion.

The waiting time is found by using queue theory and analysing runway availability.

In spite of the sheer amount of publications that have proposed so-called neural IR approaches over the past decade, the field has not achieved the kind of progress seen in related fields. Over the past year or so, works have begun to solve the issues that complicate the progress of neural applications in IR. Among those issues we can find the lack of approaches to interpret and analyze neural IR models, which is addressed in this thesis. We propose a novel approach to diagnose retrieval models that is rooted in the axiomatic approach to IR. Axioms encapsulate search heuristics that are expressed as constraints on retrieval functions. Existing axiomatic approaches have provided fruitful analyses of traditional IR models but are no longer viable to study neural IR models. Building forth on these approaches, we propose a novel approach to empirically analyze retrieval functions, suitable for neural models. Based on inspirations from the NLP and Computer Vision communities, we use model-agnostic diagnostic datasets in order to determine what kind of search heuristics models are able to learn. Since the creation of diagnostic datasets does not require a labeled dataset, we can apply the proposed pipeline to almost any dataset containing queries and documents. We have shown for four specific axioms how to extend and relax them, in order to make them fit for obtaining diagnostic datasets. We have applied our diagnostic dataset creation pipeline to the WikiPassageQA and MSMarco corpora and evaluated three traditional baselines and six neural models. Our experiments on the WikiPassageQA dataset show that the proposed approach can indeed diagnose strengths and weaknesses of neural models. However, our experiments on the MSMarco dataset show that an axiomatic analysis based on the four axioms does not always diagnose factors that incur retrieval effectiveness. An interesting direction for future work is therefore to include more axioms in the diagnostic approach. As possible extensions of the work carried out in this thesis, several roads of future work have been proposed. Among them, we can find reproducing experiments on other neural toolkits and employing the methodology on different IR tasks, but also researching the validity of axioms and adopting a specialized metric for axiomatic performance. We furthermore identified various opportunities to use diagnostic datasets beyond diagnosing neural models. Concluding, we believe that the axiomatic approach to diagnosing neural IR models presented in this work is a step forward to gaining valuable insights into the black boxes that deep models are generally considered to be. We hope our work may prove a fruitful resource for analysis in the field of neural IR on the road towards achieving superior performance without losing sight of a better fundamental understanding of IR.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Deketh, Jan Reinout (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This thesis ‘Towards sustainable projects´ will focus on the integration of sustainability aspects in projects in the engineering industry. This research uses the following definition for ‘sustainability’: “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987). This means that in this research ‘sustainability’ is about aspects which ensure that a population’s present and future needs can be met. These are in essence relevant variables within the three ‘topics’ within sustainability: environmental, economic and societal aspects. The integration of sustainability within engineering projects is still limited. Regulation and tools give guidance on integrating sustainability aspects, for example BREEAM and the Sustainable Development Goals, however, these seems to be more of an exception rather than a rule. Even though projects are part of a bigger system, they can influence the part they are involved in. As Robert Swan quotes (2012): ""The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” The role of project managers is to steer their projects. Project manager are the connecting link between the client and the engineers, and from this position they can influence both parties to incorporate sustainability in their projects. It is unclear what influences the incorporation of sustainability in projects, so the following main research question needs to be answered: What influences the integration of sustainability in engineering projects? In order to answer this main research question, three research steps were taken. Firstly, the most relevant sustainability aspects within projects were collected from Sustainable Impact Assessments (SIAs) from literature. Thirty aspects were selected as most important for sustainable projects as these were mentioned most in all SIAs. The thirty aspects consist of: eleven aspects about the environment, for example minimising CO2 emissions or minimise the amount of waste; eleven aspects about society, for example development of human capital or respecting human rights; and eight aspects about economy, for example procurement and business agility. Secondly, a group of 20 Dutch project managers of Royal HaskoningDHV with various types of projects within the engineering industry ranked the thirty sustainability aspects based how difficult it was to integrate the sustainability aspects in their project. It was determined that the aspects about people were most easy to integrate, meaning ‘health &amp; safety’, ‘ethical behaviour’, ‘fair and safe labour’ and ‘human rights’. On the other hand, the most difficult aspects to integrate were the aspects about planet, meaning ‘transport’, ‘CO2 emissions, ‘harmful emissions’ and ‘material efficiency’. Thirdly, the participants were asked to give motivations for ranking the five most easy and most difficult sustainability aspects to integrate in projects, as they have during the second step. It was expected that project characteristics as the type of project, the type of client and the project size would influence the ease of integrating sustainability aspects in projects. Results show that the integration is influenced more by the personal motivation of the client, the project manager or the company strategy and vision, rather than by the project’s characteristics. This is shown in the interviews and because there is no direct link between the sustainability aspects and the project’s characteristics. In order to answer the main research question, the most influencing reasons can be divided into five groups: process, product, supplier, client and society.","sustainability; projects; project management; Q-methodology; Construction Management & Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

From this conventional system, the conversion losses can be substantial when DC generation and DC loads are operated. For which, several (DC/AC – AC/DC) conversion steps are required. These conversion losses can be mitigated by removing the intermediate conversion steps and distributing DC power to the DC loads directly. For which, the main aim of the thesis focuses on the technical and commercial potential of Low Voltage DC (LVDC) grids for buildings in the Netherlands. DC office is a small office building at The Green Village (TGV) in TU Delft where a 350 Vdc LVDC system is installed for experimental purposes. The experiments are carried out using both LVDC and LVAC grids in DC Office project. The obtained experimental data are randomized using Matlab to create a year-long load profile. The results are used for discussing the LVDC technical potential in terms of overall efficiency and energy savings. From these results cost-savings are calculated. Along with this, usage of copper and aluminum as electrical conductor in buildings and its investment cost-savings are discussed. For the commercial potential of LVDC grids for buildings in the Netherlands, the Function of Innovation Systems (FIS) approach is used to identify the corresponding LVDC stakeholders, research, pilot projects, rules and regulations and policies for development. For the technical potential, there are three different cases formulated for analysis. They are ACTube case, DCLED case and ACLED case. In the experiments, tubelights are used in the ACTube case and LEDs are used in the DCLED case, in-order to neglect the energy savings obtained from LED technology, ACLED case is assumed. The overall efficiency of the LVDC grid (DCLED case) is 94.82% and the LVAC grid (ACTube case) is 88.16% and the LVAC grid (ACLED case) is 88.67%. From all these cases, the LVDC grid is around 6.5% more efficient than LVAC grid in small buildings similar to the DC Office. The energy savings obtained by LVDC grid replacing LVAC grid (ACTube) is 2013 kWh/year, and if tubelights in AC are replaced with LEDs in AC, then 1854 kWh/year is estimated to be saved. The cost-savings are calculated from the energy savings obtained by replacing LVAC grid (ACTube case) with LVDC grid (DCLED case). Considering the total lifetime of the LVDC system as 12 years, the cost savings obtained are € 221.43/year achieving payback in 6 years. For the commercial potential, using seven functions of FIS it is identified that there are several stakeholders interested in LVDC projects and are responsible for pilot projects. The government also is implementing the new NPR 9090 as the rules and guidelines for LVDC grid installations in buildings. It is also identified that people have positive acceptance of the LVDC grid in their houses. But the knowledge sharing about LVDC among the society is currently lacking. Moreover, the AC electricity distributors are interested in shifting towards the DC micro grid distribution.","low voltage; Direct Current; Function of Innovation; FIS; LVDC grid; LVDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","DC Office Lab",""

(mentor); Meijer, Maarten (mentor); Polinder, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","AGVs have seen an upward trend in development over the last 60 years. The technology has developed from mechanical bumpers and guided wire navigation to contactless sensors and free navigation technique in the current age. Further, the control on AGVs has moved from central control system to local intelligence which opens up various possibilities with respect to operations as well as applications. The growing trend of AGVs has been due to the sudden growth in digital technology and the ever-increasing demand to reduce human intervention in operations. This has resulted in increased research regarding the implementation of intelligent AGVs in areas of application that have not yet been explored, namely, light metal and forging industry. The major reasons for indulging in autonomous equipment are, increased productivity, reliability and safety since human involvement is either eliminated or largely reduced. However, a major share of the research about intelligent AGVs has been confined to warehouses and port logistics. Therefore, through this research, another area of application is investigated, namely, the light metal and forging industry, and more specifically, the potroom of an aluminium smelter. Hence, the objective of the research is as stated: With the introduction of intelligent AGVs, stochastic behavior needs to be addressed, that is, how would these AGVs react to disturbances created by such random human behaviour and process interference? Therefore, the research focusses on the routing problem in such situations which are dynamic in nature. The research aims to provide a planning approach in terms of dynamic AGV routing under the assistance of a sensor based system that can detect obstacles. The dynamic re-routing of AGVs is addressed using a mathematical formulation as well as a graphical representation. In order to solve the problem at hand, the graphical approach is followed and the objective has been simplified for research purposes. It is simplified as: For instance, if a certain pathway is blocked in the potroom of an aluminium smelter due to such stochastic behavior, how would the AGV find the optimal path? An algorithm is devised in order to answer the above research question and further implemented in Python. Various scenarios of stochastic disturbances is analysed and evaluated accordingly. Therefore, this research develops an algorithm and a subsequent model that is implemented using Python which is used to evaluate the routing of an AGV in the presence of stochastic behavior. It acts as a proof of concept for the problem at hand as it restricts the work to a simplified situation of a single AGV operation. Although this research uses the case of a light metal and forging industry, the same can be applied to industries with similar challenges such as, cement industry, power generation industry, aerospace, construction and so on. Cement, construction and power generation industry deal with environments similar to the light metal and forging industry. Further, in all these application areas, the use of AGVs for material handling would improve productivity and reliability, while improving safety of operations as well. This research focuses on a simplified situation, however, the basis of this work can be further extended to solve a more detailed real world scenario with a fleet of AGVs, and this can be done by the use of advanced heuristics.","AGV; Light metal and forging industry; Aluminum smelter; Collision avoidance; Navigation; Mapping and localization; Dynamic routing; Potroom","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The evaluation results showed that version control for graph database can be done with queries as the delta encoding. However, there are some additional costs of doing version control with this approach. First, the delta object size increases linearly to the number of changes in a version. We also found that using queries as the delta to reconstruct versions can take a significant amount of time if the number of changes is large. While leveraging snapshots can reduce the time to materialize version, it also increases the storage cost for saving the delta objects and snapshot objects. A recommendation for future studies in data versioning is to explore and improve over the delta encoding.","data versioning; graph databases","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The temperatures in the ocean hardly vary between day and night or between the seasons, which ensures a very constant energy production with OTEC. In order for OTEC to compete with the current forms of energy production, optimization is necessary such that costs are reduced to make OTEC power generation economically feasible. In cooperation with the Delft University of Technology, Bluerise B.V. constructed a small scale OTEC-plant to test the performance of the OTEC-cycle and optimize its outputs. The 100 W OTEC demo consists of an organic Rankine cycle using pure ammonia as the working fluid that is downward condensed in a gasketed plate heat exchanger (GPHE).<br/><br/>Plate heat exchangers (PHEs) are known to have a wide range of applications due to their superior performance in relation to favourable heat transfer coefficients (HTCs), compactness, design flexibility and thermal effectiveness. However, the two-phase behaviour inside the PHEs is yet not fully understood, resulting in over- or underestimating by several published heat transfer and pressure drop correlations, which are limited by the range of conditions they cover. Tao et al. (2018) conclude that better predictions of flow patterns and dominant physical phenomena in PHEs will improve the calculation of heat transfer and pressure drop. Therefore, the goal in this research is to identify the flow patterns that occur in the GPHE and gain more knowledge on the dominant physical phenomena that are apparent in the downward condensing ammonia. In the future, this can be used to increase the accuracy of performance calculations of the condenser. Flow visualization experiments are performed on the GPHE to identify the flow patterns and how they relate to the performance of the GPHE. A visualization section is designed in the OTEC demo that allows for flow visualization. The visualization section involves the GPHE, a transparent visualization plate, illumination by a LED-strip and a high speed camera.<br/><br/>The first part of this thesis involves material research on glass and several polymers to produce the visualization plate. The setup requires a plate that is chemically compatible with ammonia and has a mechanical performance that is fit for the operational pressures inside the GPHE. Chemical tests prove that Polystyrene is chemically well resistant to ammonia for four days. The results of a finite element analysis predict that the mechanical performance of PMMA is promising but glass is critical for the GPHE. To ensure a safe setup, a material combination of PS/PMMA is selected. A visualization plate is manufactured from a corrugated PS layer on top of a thick PMMA base plate. The PS layer acts as a chemical resistant barrier between ammonia and the PMMA base, while PMMA ensures the mechanical performance. However, after 7 days of performing the visualization experiments, the plate showed limited durability with respect to ammonia, as cracks in the material emerged and the plate lost its transparency.<br/><br/>The second part of the research in this thesis involves two types of experiments. The first type involves flow visualization experiments on a single-channel configuration. For all conditions, only film flow and partial film flow are observed. A low mass flux shows partial film flow with a smooth film, and a high mass flux corresponds to film flow with rough film characteristics. Partial film flow includes dry-out areas on the plate, and it is concluded that these surface area voids increase with vapor quality and volumetric void fraction. Mass flux contributes to a pressure drop increase and therefore film flow corresponds to a higher pressure drop in the PHE with respect to partial film flow. The HTCs increase with mass flux but mostly with vapor quality. However, there seems to be an optimum for the HTCs with increasing vapor quality when partial film flow is observed. For partial film flow, the surface area voids increase with vapor quality and for large voids the slope of the HTCs decay. It is concluded that surface area voids have a negative influence on the HTCs. Proposed flow patterns maps by previous studies are not in accordance with the observed flow patterns inside the GPHE for the current experimental conditions. For this reason, a flow pattern map for downward condensing ammonia is proposed for this experimental configuration and conditions. The second type of experiments involves multi-channel experiments without visualization to predict the flow patterns for lower mass fluxes. The slope of the HTCs followed the same trend with increasing vapor quality for the observed partial film flow in the visualization experiments. This indicates that for this multi-channel configuration partial film flow occurs in the GPHE.","Flow visualization; Two-phase flow; ammonia; condensation; flow patterns; Plate Heat Exchanger; vertical downward flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-24","","","","","",""

The patients are monitored and supported by medical equipment as well as a team of intensivists, nurses and other medical staff members 24/7. Due to the audible alarms of the devices, but also because of conversing people and other machinery and incidental sounds, the ICU transformed into an acoustically hostile environment. Ironically, the ICU’s excessive amount of sounds threatens both patient safety and clinicians’ wellbeing and work efficiency (Redert, 2018). In light of these sound issues in the ICU, this graduation assignment aimed to capture the ICU nurses’ sound-related values and practices and to develop an understanding of the phenomenon of sound in a sociocultural context – the so-called ‘ICU sound culture’. By understanding the ICU sound culture, the second aim of the assignment was to look for opportunities for silencing down the ICU whilst considering the sound cultures. The first aim, capturing and typifying different ICU sound cultures, was addressed in a field research study with a procedure based on contextmapping. The research findings showed that nurses working in the same Dutch ICU and nurses working in different ICUs share three (sound-related) core values: autonomously working (together), being situationally aware and giving and receiving social support. It seems that the accompanying practices are transmitted through learning and typical for the Dutch ICU (sound) culture. However, nurses from different ICUs but also nurses of one and the same team could differ in their value orientations and practicing these. As a result, the nurses can be divided into three types based on shared customs, beliefs and needs, called ‘personas’. The field research showed that similarities and differences exist due to ICU specific sound cultures and ICU specific group cultures within one and the same team. Though different sound cultures and coping strategies with the sounds exist, there is a commonality regarding the ‘sound problem’ (i.e. the excessive amount of sounds in an ICU): in all ICUs, the sounds, or even issues with them, are sort of accepted to a greater or lesser extent due to nurses not knowing why (by being ignorant or indifferent) or not knowing how to reduce sounds. Additionally, the current sound-reducing efforts that do exist are often taken individually, ad-hoc and they have a short-term impact. When ICUs want to reduce the sounds with a bigger impact in the longer term, ICUs need to create ‘sound-issue awareness’ and motivate every individual nurse to act upon the sound issues. This opportunity for silencing down the ICU whilst considering the sound cultures, which was the second aim of the project, was further translated into a campaign for sound cultural change. The campaign challenges the ICU management team and nurses to establish a ‘collectivistic sound culture’, in which every individual nurse commits to the group effort and goal to create a more peaceful sound environment in the ICU.","Contextmapping; Personas; Culture Sensitive Design; Cultura; Intensive Care Unit; Sound design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a result, the need for more resilient strategies to respond to these trends has become paramount. This research aims on filling the gaps in literature, by developing a strategy roadmap for the Harbourmaster to manage uncertainties in the port-call-process due to digitalisation and automation.

Furthermore, different set-up of methodologies is expected to result in a more valid set of actions. In addition, the impact of autonomous vessels is recommended to be further investigated since this is expected to have a radical impact on the port-call-process.","automation; digitalisation; DAPP; decision-making,; port-call-process; resilience; scenario-analysis; strategy; uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nine out of ten people does not breathe healthy air due to rapid urbanization and human activities that cause increased severe air pollution. Over the years people have had a tendency to comfort themselves with everything they need inside. However, they may not be aware that the amount of dangerous pollutants indoors is often 5 times higher than outside (EPA, 2017). Since we spend 90% of our lifetime indoors, the impact of indoor air pollution (IAP) on our health is relatively high, especially for children. Their bodies and lungs are still developing what makes it very important to breathe safe air. When individuals deal with the risk of being exposed to IAP, they may have various beliefs about the impact it has on their health and the way of keeping indoor air quality (IAQ) levels within an acceptable range. Since people are a valuable asset in buildings, it seems practical to make them able to manage their own air. In the recent years, filtration of air through the use of air cleaners for private use has been an upcoming technological trend. Together with TinyWolf, the startup I am part of, we develop an air purifier to provide various households with clean air where it matters most. For most people air purification introduces new ways of thinking how to improve IAQ. To bridge the research gap of related work in the relationship between IAQ and human behavior, my research aims to understand household members’ perception of air and their related behavior in order to empower and design for their ability to improve the indoor air quality. In order to deal with the complexity of human behavior I used a theory that has found its way from social science into design research. The social practice theory provides a framework to study family and individual life to create an insightful overview of understanding everyday habitual practices that are linked to IAQ. I firstly evaluated the current situation in order to examine the challenges household members face when they want to improve indoor air quality. Findings show the importance of access to information and tools to reduce the exposure to indoor air pollution. Secondly, in the practice-oriented design approach I introduced three households with different versions of TinyWolf’s purifier. The evaluations investigate the influence of the designed products on household members’ perception of the impact of a purifier on the perceived air as well as their ability to adopt the product for use in existing daily practices, in particular the sleeping practice. Findings show that the product alone does not immediately lead to behavior change. It’s meaning and a measure of skill are necessary. Research shows that the empathy between people and product can influence the way they act (Aftab &amp; Rusli, 2007). My project shows a way of how design could be used to empower people’s ability to improve indoor air quality.","Air pollution; Indoor air quality; Human perception; Human behavior; practice theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In order to take the right measures it is important to know with which magnitude and rate the warming of the climate continues in the future. However, climate models currently predict different scenarios. The differing in response of shallow cumulus clouds to a warming climate explains the largest part of the spread of climate sensitivity in these models. It is known that clustered clouds have a different climate feedback than randomly distributed clouds and that we can expect more clustered cloud fields in a warmer climate. It is however unknown how these clouds respond and what the exact difference in climate feedback is. Future research must provide us with more insights and eventually a better understanding of the response of shallow cumulus clouds to warming. However, in order to investigate this an objective measure of the degree of cloud organization is necessary, something that is currently lacking. In this thesis a dimensionless combined organization measure is introduced that can be applied to a large range of cloud field organizations on different field sizes. This is a combined measure, as it makes use of the existing organization index I_org and the size of clouds and clear sky areas in the cloud field. A different approach on calculating I_org was introduced taking into account the sizes of the clouds, resulting in an useful and more realistic values from this parameter. The results of the combined organization measure were compared to a visual inspection of 557 cloud fields with dimensions of 10x10 degree, which showed promising results. Sub-fields of 5x5 degree and 2.5x2.5 degree were also analysed, which showed that the combined organization measure could often be applied on smaller scales as well but yielded some problems when areas contained either no or little clouds or some very large ones. It was concluded that the newly developed method is an improvement of the already existing method, providing scientists with a better and more reliable index to quantify the degree of cloud organization.","Atmoshpere; Remote Sensing; Cloud Organization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

However, the relatively high viscosity compared to the conventional asphalt is the major drawback of the CRMB. The higher mixing and working temperatures are thus required in order to achieve the desired workability of the CRMB. This results in more asphalt fume emission, higher energy consumption, and more harmful working environments for workers. Warm mix asphalt (WMA) technologies have been intentionally developed to lower the manufacturing and working temperatures of the asphalt by reducing the viscosity of the asphalt binder. Many studies suggested that coupling CRMB with WMA additives can promote better working conditions and minimize environmental issues of the CRMB.<br/>In this study, experimental works were carried out to evaluate rheological and performance-based properties of the CRMB containing WMA additives in order to investigate the effect of the crumb rubber modifier (CRM) content and WMA additives (wax-based and chemical-base WMA additives) by using only one dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The performance of the studied binder at high, intermediate, and low road service temperatures were investigated by performing Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery test, Linear Amplitude Sweep test, and 4-mm Dynamic shear rheometer test, respectively. Moreover, the Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy and the storage stability test were also performed to investigate the effects of the CRM dosage and the WMA additives on the aging susceptibility and the high-temperature storage stability of the binders. The results show that the incorporation of crumb rubber modifier can clearly improve the overall performance (rutting, fatigue damage, low-temperature thermal cracking resistances), and aging resistance of the asphalt binder in a bitumen-level. The high-temperature storage stability of the CRMB became more stable at the higher dosage of the CRM. Moreover, it was found that the wax-based WMA additive can only enhance the high-temperature rutting resistance but negatively impacted the fatigue and low-temperature damage resistances of both neat and CRM binders. The effect of the chemical-based additive on the neat and CRM binders are different as it improved the performance over the whole service temperature of the neat but lowered the damage resistances of CRMBs. Additionally, the addition of both WMA additives decreased the high-temperature storage stability of the CRMB.","Crumb rubber modified bitumen; Warm Mix Asphalt; Performance Evaluation; MSCR; LAS; 4-mm DSR; Frequency sweep; FTIR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Slobbe, D.C. (graduation committee); Hanssen, R.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Accurate information on Arctic sea ice thickness has been historically limited both spatially and temporally to spare submarine sonar measurements until the advent of satellite altimeters such as ICEsat (operating from 2002 to 2008) and CryoSat-2 (operating from 2011 to present day). This study aims to use the historical record of normalized radar backscatter measurements from satellite Ku-band and C-band scatterometers (ERS, QuikSCAT and ASCAT), which have been continuously operating since 1992, to homogenize the satellite altimeter record and extend the record of Arctic sea ice thickness measurements backwards in time. This study is structured so as to first derive a set of empirical relationships between normalized backscatter measurements and wintertime sea ice thickness estimates in the Arctic using existing satellite altimeter records as a reference. Two separate scatterometer sea ice thickness models are produced using coincident scatterometer and altimeter observations, one for C-band sea ice thickness estimation using ASCAT and CryoSat-2 collocations, and another for Ku-band sea ice thickness estimation using QuikSCAT and ICESat collocations. Based on the agreement to the altimeter records, the estimation of wintertime sea ice thickness using the C-band and Ku-band scatterometer models is uncertain to within 0.5 m (1-sigma), that is, a precision similar to that of the original altimeter references. The homogenization of the satellite altimeter records cannot be done directly, because the ICESat and CryoSat-2 instruments operate in different periods, but it can be done indirectly by comparing the sea ice thickness estimates obtained from Ku-band (based on ICESat) and C-band (based on CryoSat-2) estimates during the years that the Ku-band and C-band scatterometers operate simultaneously. These overlap years have been used to verify the consistency between the C-band and Ku-band relationships, and to correct for a 0.55 m bias in the CryoSat-2 reference, having considered the earlier ICESat record as absolute standard. After removing this bias from the CryoSat-2 reference, the sea ice thickness estimates from C-band and Ku-band records agree to within 0.15 m (1-sigma). Moreover, the resulting scatterometer sea ice thickness models allow the introduction of new thickness thresholds from a previously existing backscatter-based classification of Arctic sea ice types, providing a thickness threshold of 1.54 m to define first year ice (FYI), and a thickness threshold of 2.25 m to separate second year ice (SYI) from older multiyear ice (old MYI). Ancillary datasets were used to investigate the correlations between backscatter-based sea ice thickness and physical variables, such as snow depth and surface deformation, in order to investigate possible sources of systematic error, which otherwise appear to be bound within 0.30 m (1-sigma). The maps of differences between scatterometer and altimeter sea ice thickness estimates were analysed in terms of collocated sea ice convergence, sea ice shear and snow depth parameters using a multiple regression model. The results show that both the Ku-band and C-band models underestimate ice thickness in areas of high convergence such as the Fram Strait, and overestimate ice thickness in areas with high shear such as the Beaufort Gyre. These correlations may be interpreted as led by increases in backscatter due to surface deformation with (case of convergence) or without (case of shear) associated increases in ice thickness. In addition, the Ku-band model is found sensitive to snow load, with overestimation interpreted as led by an increase in backscatter without associated ice growth, and the C-band model is sensitive to marginal rough ice. An unphysically large dependence on snow depth was found for the C-band estimate, which we conjecture is due to problems with the CryoSat-2 reference. Finally, a reconstruction of Arctic sea ice thickness in the wintertime has been made by combining the Ku-band and C-band sea ice thickness models with the normalized radar backscatter record of ERS, QuikSCAT and ASCAT from 1992 through 2017. These showed a decline average Arctic sea ice thickness of -0.28 m / decade, with a steady decline in second-year ice and high variability in the mean multi-year ice thickness.","Arctic; sea ice thickness; scatterometers; ERS; ASCAT; QuikSCAT; estimation; ICESat; CryoSat-2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

With the advancement of information technology, it is now possible to digitalize the public participation process and carry out the process via the internet. Through the development of an online public participation process, attempts were made to reach a wider audience, to create open communication channels and to involve the public throughout the design process of the project. <br/>This thesis research investigated the development of online public participation process and studied its impact on the project performance of intra-city street redevelopment projects. The research was separated into three stages. The first stage of the research focused on introducing the online interactive public participation process. Literature research was carried out on the principles of public participation, current public participation methods and relevant developments in the field. In the second stage, a comparative case study of four inter-city infrastructure projects was conducted. Two of the projects implemented the online public participation process while the other two projects used traditional public participation methods. The purpose of the case study was to evaluate the online interactive public participation process' influence on project performances. In the third stage of the research, an evaluation process was designed by the researcher to improve the online interactive public participation process. The evaluation process used the House of Quality decision matrix as the theoretical basis and can process the incoming public comments in a structured manner and produce a ranked list with implementation suggestions.<br/>The research concluded that: As a public participation tool with a high level of involvement, the 'online interactive public participation process', when used in intra-city street redevelopment projects, will improve the efficiency in the design process, increase public satisfaction, shorten project time and raise the project cost. Recommendations on the use of the online interactive public participation process and the proposed evaluation process were made based on the findings of the research.

In the Netherlands, skid resistance is measured with either the RWS Skid Resistance Tester -measuring the longitudinal friction coefficient- or the Seitenkraft-Messverfahren (SKM) -measuring the sideway friction coefficient. The latter is nowadays the preferred measurement device by Rijkswaterstaat. Skid resistance depends much on the vehicle speed: the higher the speed, the lower the skid resistance. Furthermore, the texture of the surface influences the speed dependency. Because it is not always possible to measure the skid resistance at target speeds set by Rijkswaterstaat, there is a demand for a speed conversion model for the skid resistance measured with the SKM. The objective of this research is therefore formulated as follows: the development of a speed conversion model for the wet skid resistance, measured with the SKM at different speeds, taking into account the macrotexture of the road surface. The used dataset consists of 718 sections of 100 metre, measured at the Dutch road network. Measurements were performed at 10 different roads with different pavement layers: porous asphalt, concrete pavements, dense pavements and stone mastic asphalt. The mean profile depth of the pavements varies between 0.21 and 1.80 mm. The performed measuring speeds were 40, 60 and 80 km/h, and for few sections 30 km/h. Three regression methods were performed. Firstly, a multiple linear regression was performed. The datapoints consisted of combinations of two measurements at different speeds on identical 100 metre sections. The second method estimated per 100 metre section a zero speed intercept which was used as a reference point. The third method used multilevel modelling and includes a hierarchical structure. Concluded was that the multiple linear regression on speed combinations is inappropriate for the objective of this research, because of two reasons: the datapoints are dependent on each other, and information is lost by splitting the 100 metre sections into datapoints with combinations of two measurements. In the second method, problems arise with estimating the zero speed intercept. The third method is most appropriate for this research and the three-level structure fits best on the dataset. The first level contains the individual measurements on the 100 metre sections, performed at different measuring speeds. The second level consists of the 100 metre sections and the third level consist of the roads on which the measurements took place. The standard error of the model on the training data is 0.032 whereas the average change in skid resistance for two datapoints is 0.053. This average change includes conversions over a speed difference from 10 to 40 km/h. From a sensitivity analysis of the macrotexture it was concluded that if no macrotexture can be measured, it is advised to use a different model in which no macrotexture is included. Recommendations for further research include among others registering more accurately the type and age of the measured pavements and extending the dataset with measurements performed at low measuring speeds and on curved sections. Furthermore, it is recommended to perform a more comprehensive outlier analysis and to optimise the hierarchical structure.","Skid resistance; Conversion model; Speed; SKM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Ferreira, Carlos (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","To increase the total wind farm power output, the wind farm layout needs to be optimized. The power output of a wind turbine depends on the incoming velocity, while the velocity is influenced by the wake of the upstream wind turbines. Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) problems makes use of the so called low fidelity wake models, which predicts the velocity downstream of a turbine. The analytical Jensen wake model with a top hat velocity wake profile is commonly used to perform the WFLO during the preliminary design phase of a wind farm. However a top hat velocity profile is not an accurate depiction<br/>of the actual velocity profile downstream of the turbine wake. To get a more accurate wake profile the model needs to be extended. To improve the wake model, the role of the stability of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) on the development of the turbine wake is analyzed using the software openFOAM and SOWFA. It is noticed that the analytical Jensen-Gaussian wake model is in better agreement with measurement data than the Jensen top hat wake model. It is verified that it is necessary to include the added Turbulence Intensity (T.I) induced by the wind turbine. For the Jensen- Gaussian wake model, the Gao turbulence model gives results that are in good agreement with the experimental data. The Jensen-Gaussian wake model is extended to be used inside a wind farm with multiple wakes. The power output for a row of 10 Vestas V-80 turbines in the Horns rev Wind farm is computed. Using the equivalent velocity by weighted area averaging over a discretized wake turbine-cross section in combination with the power curve, the power output of a turbine can be computed. Using the energy superposition method the equivalent velocity for alligned turbines can be computed. Comparison with measurement data shows that there still is a difference between the results from the wake model and the measurement data. To further improve the Jensen-Gaussian wake model it is important to take into account the effect of the stability of the ABL on the wake. The different stabilities for an offshore ABL are simulated with SOWFA and the turbine wakes are computed. The different wake recovery rates and elliptical shapes due to the stability of the ABL are included in the extended model.<br/>Using the offshore Horns rev wind farm data, the extended Jensen-Gaussian model in combination with the mixed-discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MDPSO), the WFLO is carried out. The WFLO predicts that it is important to take the stability of the different models into account. However it is concluded that the improvement cannot be quantified, due to the uncertainties in the computation in the power output of each wind turbine.","Wind farm layout optimization; Jensen; Wake model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

An Ankle Foot Orthosis is an orthopaedic aid which limits the plantar flexion of the foot, providing a safe walking gait for the patient. Currently, these AFOs are vacuum formed over a machined foam reproduction of the patients leg. The patient specific geometry requirements make it ideal for the one-off production freedom of 3D printing. This master thesis investigated the feasibility of 3D printing a patient specific Ankle Foot Orthosis and explored the possible improvements compared to the current vacuum formed AFOs. The current vacuum formed AFOs provides suboptimal support and increases the energy cost of walking, this was taken into account when deciding the approach for this project. The approach was divided in the creation of an improved walking support and the investigation to other possible improvements of 3D printing. <br/>A new spring system was developed which provided the minimal required support during walking: free dorsiflexion and a constant counter moment during plantar flexion for every ankle. Rigged bending tests which simulated the ankle range of motion showed near perfect support results. However, the improved effect on the patient’s gait could not yet be proven. This was due to an imperfect testing prototype, the required low tolerances of the spring system which could not be met and the fact that the springs were not strong enough. <br/>Several design improvements have been proposed and can be found in the last chapter For COR, the best continuation of this project would be to use the gathered requirements and design improvements to develop a simple ‘plantar flexion stop AFO’. If an orthosis with sufficient support is developed, gradual dynamic improvements can be implemented to allow for more freedom of movement.","AFO; Ankle Foot Orthosis; 3D printed; Orthotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The dominant climates are the Oceanic, the Mediterranean and the Continental ones. The western part of Europe has an oceanic climate, southern Europe has a Mediterranean climate and eastern Europe has a continental climate. Because of such heterogeneities, a vast range of extreme climatic events might occur in different areas. We define extreme climatic events the droughts, floods and heavy snowfall. Those events will be generically referred to in this research as anomalies. The purpose of this study is the identification of these extreme climatic events in the area of Europe, with the use of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data at 37GHz frequency. The data that are used are Brightness Temperature (TB) values. The detection of the events will be achieved with the Polarization Difference Brightness Temperature (PDBT). The PDBT values can be related to changes to surface wetness and the surface geometry. It could be used as an indicator of an anomaly, because the higher the values of PDBT the higher the surface wetness. The methodological steps of the work consist in a statistical analysis of the SSM/I time-series, in the design of a detection algorithm of the anomalies under investigation and on the debate of its performance. The analysis of the temporally long SSM/I data will provide a first understanding of the data sensitivity to events under investigation and of their distribution for the statistical modelling of the Normalized Polarization Difference Brightness Temperature (NPDBT) indicator. The calculation of the NPDBT exploits the same principles as the well-known z-score index. The detection of the anomalies will be then achieved through thresholding the NPDBT index. Further information for the detection of anomalies is provided by the soil moisture time series from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor and the precipitation data from the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMAP). The soil moisture data appear to be more useful for the dry events, whereas the precipitation data for the flooding and the heavy snowfall events.","SSM/I 37GHz; Passive microwave remote sensing; Detection of anomalies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

As a starting point, a preliminary design goal is formulated which links the technology and the user to an early touch point in Transavia’s customer journey: ​“Design a virtual assistant for Transavia that offers added value in helping Generation Z with finding and/or booking flights”. The contexts of four aspects are analysed: business, process, user and technology, which together lay the foundation for the subsequent user studies. The studies show the flight finding and -booking behaviour of Generation Z, as well as their current and preferred interactions with virtual assistants. Based on the outcomes the witty assistant ‘Tracy’ is conceptualised and piloted using the Google Assistant and Lenovo Smart Display. Tracy focuses on the moment right before booking called pre-booking, and recommends Generation Z affordable trips based on their availability. Alongside user tests the prototype goes through three iterations to optimise various aspects of the design: tone-of-voice, product personality, content and conversational flow. The final design is intended to be feasible for a short term release, and proved there lies true potential in using a conversational interface to engage with Generation Z in the pre-booking phase.

The goal of this graduation assignment is to create a method to execute ideation that We Are Builders can use to exploit opportunities when an idea pops to mind. <br/><br/>A startup studios form a new structure of innovating. Startup studios launch multiple startups based on a systematic approach from spark to launch. This research will build on the findings of Kohler and Baumann (2018) explaining the organisational level of a startup studio in a scientific manner for the first time. This research adds to the research on innovation structures by creating a deep insight into the startup studio ideation process. <br/><br/>This graduation assignment used the principles of action research to both work with the company and also executing research. This resulted in me being a design researcher creating a ideation strategy for We Are Builders as well as being a researcher in the team of the new We Are Builders startup simultaneously. This new startup is currently in the ‘ideation’ phase of the startup studio model. This double role allowed me to use the new startup as a test case to explore how design can be of value during the early phases of innovation while researching the topic. <br/><br/>To understand where the current ideation strategy of We Are Builders is overlapping or differing from competing venture builders and the process of design, processes are analysed. Via literature research, the process of design in a business context is analysed. Afterwards, literature on innovation will form the basis to create context understanding to be able to link this project to the broader innovation context. <br/><br/>A multiple and single case study research to the startups launched by the We Are Builders team in history showed that We Are Builders currently lacks a moment of problem definition in the innovation process. Without stating a clear problem definition and validating this, it is unclear if needs and wishes of clients involved later in the process are representative for a broader market. Because a clear problem definition and method to document research findings is missing at We Are Builders, entrepreneurial bias overrules the research outcomes. <br/><br/>This focus on problem framing and exploring opportunities resulted in the design of a framework for explorative research. This explorative research framework combines the explorative and user-centered nature of design with the practical and direct way of entrepreneurial research. This research method can support a group of entrepreneurs to approach research in early phases of innovation in a structured, holistic way. <br/><br/>The solution of this graduation assignment applies design in early stages of innovation, to give startup studios the confidence to execute theses stages in a design led way in the form of IGNITE!.

Therefore it has become more and more important for terminal operators to conduct their work as efficient as possible. Efficient terminal operations are hindered by stochasticity, which is defined as random variation in parameter values. Due to missing information on exact arrival times, requested containers are often stored underneath other containers, which will then need to be reshuffled to reach the requested container. This reshuffling is performed while a hinterland transport mode is waiting for the requested container and therefore increases service times and SC utilisation during peak<br/>hours. This research investigates the relation between stochasticity and terminal stacking performance of import containers with a simulation model. Terminal stacking performance is subdivided into the Key Performance Indicators reshuffles per retrieval, truck service time and maximum straddle carrier utilisation per hour. The results show that implementing housekeeping moves can spare the entire import yard up to 639 764 reshuffles per year, 8 854 hours in truck serving per year and 8 minute per peak hour per SC. Even in the experiments where the level of stochasticity is high, a saving of 120 656 reshuffles per year, 883 hours truck service time and 3 minutes per SC peak hour are observed. The higher the level of stochasticity, the smaller the improvement on the KPIs is. Lastly, it can be concluded that stacking performance also deteriorates when the level of stochasticity becomes higher.","Container terminal; Stacking operations; Stochasticity; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

However, it also contributes significantly to pollution of the natural environment and depletion of natural resources. So far only a small percentage of plastic is recycled and used for the production of new products. Inferior material quality and the inability to make a profit out of plastic recycling has led to little development in the utilization of this material. Umincorp is a company that developed a separation technique called magnetic density separation. With this technology they aim to make a profit from recycling and deliver high purity monostreams that can be used for a wide range of applications. This report describes the process of the development of a showcase product for Umincorp. The product aims to convince designers and producers of injection mould products, that Umincorp’s material can be used as a valuable resource for mass production. The research creates an understanding of what value this high purity material has to offer and what role designers and producers play when trying to increase the demand for this material. Next to injection moulding; rotomoulding, blowmoulding and extrusion are looked into to find opportunities to utilize the recycled flakes directly. Injection moulding was found to be the most accessible production method for processing the recycled flakes. The production of keychains in an existing mould using recycled PP was an important part of this conclusion. The choice for production in a 3d printed mould at the company P3d was made to establish a product design and production within limited time and costs. 3 concept proposals were made for products that could be presented in the context of a business fair. A business cardholder that can also be used as a nametag in multiple ways was chosen as the final product. It gives multiple qualitative examples of injection mould features, aesthetic and mechanical properties. It was produced with 99+% purity recycled PP flakes from household waste with 6 different colour separated batches. P3d noted that the material can be processed without complications. Unfortunately, the cardholder’s geometry was a bigger challenge to produce in the 3d printed mould than was expected. This resulted in an early failure of the mould, leaving only 14 products that are unable to close because of unusable clickfingers. The surface quality of the products do not show much imperfections and 6 different colours were obtained. 4 interviews were conducted with developers of injection moulded products to come to the final conclusions for the results of this project. It shows that the target group is partly convinced about the value of this material. Using the flakes directly for the production seems to surprise people when they see the surface quality of the products. The developed products seem to be a step forward in opening up the conversation about possibilities for recycled plastics from Umincorp. Next to these products, quantitative data should be available in the form of reliable data sheets and test samples in order to take away more insecurities from designers and producers of plastic products.","plastic; recycling; High purity mono streams; PP; Injection Moulding; 3d printed mould","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Zo ook de zogenaamde ‘groene dijk’, welke volledig uit grasbekleding bestaat. Dit dijktraject voldoet niet voor het faalmechanisme Gras Erosie Buitentalud (GEBU), mede door een te hoge hydraulische belasting. Momenteel is Wetterskip Fryslân in de verkenningsfase voor dijkversterking van het traject KL, met een totale lengte van ongeveer 50 km. Door de grote omvang van het project geeft dit een uitdagende opgave voor Wetterskip Fryslân. Voor de groene dijk en omliggende dijkvakken is het voorland ‘Noarderleech’ aanwezig, waarvan in de huidige methodes enkel de verhoogde ligging wordt meegenomen. Uit onderzoek uitgevoerd in de ‘POV Waddenzeedijken: Effectiviteit voorlanden’ is gebleken dat ook de aanwezige vegetatie op voorlanden significante golfdempende werking kan hebben. In dit onderzoek is de opgedane kennis in de POV toegepast voor het voorland Noarderleech. Doordat de hydraulische belasting op de achterliggende dijk wordt gereduceerd, bestaat de kans dat dijkversterking op bepaalde delen kan worden versimpeld of zelfs onnodig blijkt. Dit leidt tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag: “Wat is het effect van de vegetatie op voorlanden op de golfcondities?”. Hierbij wordt specifiek naar het voorland Noarderleech gekeken, met de aanwezige vegetatie tijdens de wintermaanden. Voor het bepalen van het effect van vegetatie is gebruik gemaakt van SWAN versie 41.20AB, waarin een 1D model is opgesteld voor verschillende doorsnedes. Hierbij is de bodemruwheid gevarieerd om de vegetatie te simuleren. Initieel is gekeken naar de gevoeligheid van het model voor de ruwheid. Vervolgens is voor verschillende doorsnedes het profiel opgedeeld in verschillende oppervlaktetypes, waarvoor een representatieve bodemruwheid is bepaald. Hieruit volgt de grootte van de golfhoogte-reductie. Tot slot is met de gereduceerde golfhoogte de benodigde dijkhoogte bepaald voor één locatie en voor de totale groene dijk de klei-erosie voor het faalmechanisme GEBU. Uit de gevoeligheidsanalyse volgt dat het golfdempende effect afvlakt voor hoge ruwheden. Daarnaast zijn de golven over het algemeen diepte-gelimiteerd, waardoor de golfhoogte wordt bepaald door de waterdiepte. De lengte van het voorland is een belangrijke parameter, doordat het bepaald hoelang de golf wordt blootgesteld aan de hogere bodemruwheid. Daarnaast zijn de verlopen voor een kort en lang voorland nagenoeg identiek, waardoor met één profiel een goede inschatting voor de omliggende profielen gemaakt kan worden op basis van de lengte. Voor de groene dijk geldt dat de golfhoogtereductie door vegetatie in de orde van 8% ±2% valt. Een reductie van 8% leidt tot 10 cm minder kleilaagerosie. Ondanks dit voldoet de dijk met de huidige methodiek nog niet aan de normering voor GEBU. Tot slot is ook de op het voorland aanwezige zomerkade in beschouwing genomen. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de golfhoogte bij de achterliggende dijkteen niet meer dan 2% reduceert ten gevolge van de kade. Door de extreme windcondities en een strijklengte van 500-600 m is de golfgroei dusdanig dat het effect van de zomerkade teniet wordt gedaan ter hoogte van de achterliggende dijkteen. Voor een effectieve golfreductie is het dus van belang dat de afstand tot de dijkteen klein is en de kruinhoogte zo groot mogelijk. Volgend uit dit onderzoek wordt aanbevolen om de invloed van vegetatie op voorlanden, in de vorm van bodemruwheid, mee te nemen in de beoordeling in het geval de primaire kering initieel niet voldoet. Voor het toepassen in de ontwerpfase zijn de mogelijkheden en beperkingen vanuit omgeving en beheer essentieel, waarvoor verder onderzoek wordt aangeraden. Daarnaast wordt onderzoek naar het effect van bodemruwheid op de spectrale periode aanbevolen.","Noarderleech; Waddenzee; Voorland; SWAN; Waterveiligheid","nl","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Especially for low flow areas gas production is more easily fostered. To prevent the potential problems caused by gas production from the riverine sediments, this study focuses on magnitude of gas formation and its relation with soil properties. Nine locations of known at Port of Hamburg were sampled; for each location the fresh sediment samples were collected at different depths and on different seasons. Samples were stored and transported to several institutes for various analyses, including analysis on sediment standard properties, and on gas production by incubation.<br/><br/>Being part of the BIOMUD project, this study analyzed data from several research institutes. A strong correlation was found between magnitude of gas production and some of the soil properties including content of TOC, TN, ratio of TOC/P, TOC/S, density fractionation, and content of various types of metal elements. A clear relationship was found between magnitude of short-term and long-term gas production, providing possibilities for estimation work on gas formation in the future. The modified Afvalzorg multi-phase model was applied in analyzing gas production on the timeline, which played a key role in describing and predicting gas production in the long-term. The total gas potential of the river sediments at the Port of Hamburg was then predicted as 105.3 mg C/g TOC on average, relating to 10.5% of the organic matter being degraded. By temperature experiment a Q10 value of 2.06 was determined for assessing the sensitivity of gas production to temperature. Gas composition inside the bottles was also measured after four months’ incubation in the temperature experiment, with the results of CH4/CO2 ratio ranged from 0.92 to 1.86 for different temperature conditions. Parts of the results acquired from the experiments mentioned above were also compared with the results from previous studies made by other researches.","Riverine sediment; Degradation; Gas production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Due to a more rapidly changing market caused by globalization, strategy has become increasingly important. Organizations often struggle to implement strategy successfully caused by difficulties with the transition from the strategy formulation phase into the realization phase. Fully involving the employees in this phase appears to be challenging, they are often not properly informed or do not understand the strategy. The main objective of this thesis was to create a holistic and practical solution which improves the realization of strategy by motivating employees to contribute. The solution was designed to be usable by Strategiemakers (the client) as well as by organizations themselves. In order to design the solution, a theoretical research and empirical research were conducted to create an holistic understanding of the strategic process and triangulate insights. In literature three main phases of the strategic process were identified: Strategy forming – Guiding policies – Realization. These phases were specified by researching the strategic process of four highly varying organizations, which uncovered six challenges in the realization phase. From these challenges was decided to focus on the troublesome activity of triggering the employee to contribute to the strategy, since a solution for this lied in the reach of this master thesis.<br/>Insight into the perspective of the employee on the strategic realization phase provided knowledge on how to improve their motivation for strategy realization. Three parts of this perspective were researched: the influence of the organizational context the employee functions in, the employees' experience of the strategy and general motivators of the employee. With these insights, a holistic and practical solution was designed to facilitate organizations in triggering their employees to adventure in strategy realization. This solution is based on the idea of enhancing the employees' intrinsic motivation by creating a win-win situation for them and the organization. Through six steps the organization is facilitated in linking the personal development of the employee to the strategic objectives which addresses the intrinsic motivation of the employee. In the designed trajectory, the organization is aided in the specification of their strategy by determining which skills and capabilities are needed for the realization. Next, the employees are guided in the discovery of their desired skills and ambitions. Lastly, the canvas kit facilitates the process of making a connection between the employees' desires in development and the skills required for the realization of the strategy.","Strategy; Strategy Realization; Employee Involvement; Employee perspective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the department, two types of patients undergo abdominal surgery: 1) mobile obese patients and, 2) patients with cancer. These types of patients need personal contact and guidance, especially patients with cancer. However, nurses are overwhelmed with work and utilize a great amount of their time to manually measure the vital signs of patients three times a day. These vital signs are heart rate, blood oxygen level, respiration rate, tympanic temperature, and blood pressure. The current method of measuring vital signs is highly inefficient and prone to error. Additionally, there is also a lack of an alarming system that can notify nurses when patients’ health condition deteriorates. Due to this, patient deterioration cannot be detected in time and complications cannot be avoided. When manual measurement of vital signs is digitalized, patients can be continuously monitored. Due to this, small changes in the patient’s health condition can<br/>be detected and nurses can intervene immediately. Current wearable devices in the market do not meet the needs and wishes of the user group. Therefore, the initial goal was to design a wearable device that is able to continuously and noninvasively measure vital signs of patients, taking into account the level of comfort for patients and level of user-friendliness for nurses. After extensive research, conceptualization, and testing, one final proposal is presented: Omnivisi Earable, a compact and lightweight wearable device that can measure all aforementioned vital signs in a continuous and non-invasive way. Due to its small form, it does not limit patients from performing their daily activities. It is also user-friendly for nurses due to the lack of wires and extra modules. This makes it easy for nurses to attach the product on the patient's body.","Master thesis; Wearable; medical devices; Vital signs; Wearable Technology; Continuous Measurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Data was collected from two case studies, through context analysis, participant observations and interviews on behaviour, team interaction and communication.<br/><br/>Findings: This research highlighted the complexity of hospital design project organisations. The case studies address three managers: process manager, design manager and project controller – who each have their own responsibilities and focus. The emphasis of this research is with the process manager, who adapts to what the project team needs in that situation and can apply interpersonal skills by reflecting and ask questions (Why? What? When? Where? How?) to stimulate creative and critical thinking and engage project team members to interact with each other (trigger shared leadership). These skills can be applied to obtain organisational purposes, such as financial goals and to manage information which can contribute to project progress. Stagnation of project progress occurs when topics or problems are attempted to be solved at the wrong organisational level, thus “at the wrong table” (in Dutch: “het probleem wordt op de verkeerde tafel gelegd”). The different strategic levels influence each other, which in turn may alter the communication, and functioning within the team, as well as the project outcome. Furthermore, this research indicated that BIM is often seen as a goal in its own right, thus as a 3D Revit model, rather than a means to support shared understanding or shared mental model, and thus act as a boundary object. Findings indicated the need for a BIM to be dealt with as an information management system. Therefore, the outcomes of the study and it is recommended to involve a BIM coordinator to enact the use of BIM as a boundary object amongst project team members.<br/><br/>Practical implications: This research emphasizes on the importance of interpersonal skills and the importance of information sharing to team functioning.

In industry, stream processing systems are emerging to process events with low latency in a scalable and reliable fashion. As more and more stream processing jobs are processing mission critical events, older jobs are subject to maintenance and have to be upgraded or replaced. These upgrade operations include a snapshot-restore operation, where between the snapshot and restore a non-trivial state conversion has to be performed. Such an operation requires a lot of technical expertise and imposes significant down-time on the job itself and all jobs that depend on it. This thesis proposes a mechanism to align the progress of multiple independent jobs sharing common event sources. The mechanism is an extension of the checkpoint protocol proposed by Carbone et al. Not only does this mechanism simplify maintenance of streaming jobs by allowing hot-swap operations with exactly-once processing semantics, but it can also be used to provide consistency of queryable state. By implementing a proof of concept we show that this so called epoch alignment can be achieved with minimal additional costs over exactly-once processing semantics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","Codefeedr",""

An ageing population, increase in chronic patients and shortage in care professionals result in high burdens on our health care systems. Current health care systems are organized around delivering quantity. When this is continued, health care costs will rise in an unsustainable pace and the quality of care will be affected. The concept of value-based health care proposes a paradigm shift where we move from organizing care based on volume to value. This concept suggests measuring value of health care based on outcomes achieved for the patient instead of volume delivered.<br/><br/>Assignment <br/>Value-based health care (VBHC) is an evidence-based approach and can be used to improve individual and public clinical care. Longitudinal and systematic measuring and sharing of health data is essential to be able to track outcomes and improve clinical care accordingly. <br/><br/>Periodic patient health data can be used by care professionals to provide timely treatment interventions to patients. Additionally, patient health data can be used to build predictive models to support care professionals in providing more personalized treatment. For this, patient self-care supported by eHealth services is becoming increasingly important where the role of the patient shifts from being a ‘care user’ to a ‘care contributor’. <br/><br/>However, patients express concerns regarding the safety of eHealth services and are not thoroughly informed on how patient health data can improve both individual and public clinical care. Based on this, this thesis will answer the following research question:<br/><br/>How can care providers strategically obtain patient health data, in order to improve individual and public clinical care?<br/><br/>To answer this research question, a theoretical ecosystem which envisions a way of strategically obtaining patient health data to improve clinical care is developed and used during user research. <br/><br/>A theoretical ecosystem for the cardiovascular domain<br/>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death globally and the number of people living with chronic cardiovascular disease is increasing daily. Providing preventive care to those cardiovascular patients is key to manage the disease properly. Patient self-care, eHealth services and predictive models can have major implications on how cardiovascular care is managed and provided. Because the potential impact technology can have on improving clinical care for CVD, the theoretical ecosystem was designed for this domain. <br/><br/>The ecosystem is designed using insights from extensive preliminary research. It is a product service system which uses patient-generated health data from the telemonitoring service to better manage care and build predictive models to support cardiologists in providing tailored treatment. This ecosystem allows patients to receive personalized treatment and advice, have easier access to care and enables them to contribute to care easier. <br/><br/>Frisian Health Campus case<br/>The theoretical ecosystem is used during a use case for Frisian Health Campus (FHC), a client of Deloitte. FHC is an initiative that aims to become a pivotal player in developing and supporting care innovations in the northern region of the Netherlands. In order to improve clinical care, they aim to connect various care providers in the region by developing a platform where patient health data is shared for research. Deloitte did extensive research to disclose what FHC is legally allowed to do with patient data on such a platform. However, they did not know what patients and care professionals think of such a platform and what is necessary to let patients share their health data with them. Therefore, the ecosystem that is designed was used to do research on the desirability of FHC’s envisioned data sharing platform.<br/>User research and design challenge<br/>In total 7 cardiovascular patients and 6 cardiologists were interviewed to gain a better understanding of how the theoretical ecosystem addresses drivers and needs of these users. It was found that patients are more than willing to share health data for research if privacy and security are guaranteed. This showed there is not a problem with the willingness to share health. Instead, barriers with keeping up the data flow were identified:<br/><br/>The desire to measure and share health data fades over time because patients find a balance in medication and lifestyle,<br/>Measuring and sharing health data remind people they are a patient, <br/>Patients are unaware of the value of their health data.<br/><br/>Results from user research resulted in the following design challenge:<br/><br/>To increase adherence of measuring and sharing health data, the design should let patients experience the value of health data and trigger personal drivers to periodically measure and share health data. <br/><br/>During user research, various alternative drivers to measure and share health data were found and are used to design behavioural interventions in the final concept. Three main triggers were identified. I would measure and share health data to:<br/><br/>Reassure my family and friends,<br/>Contribute to care of other people,<br/>Support my doctor in providing better care.<br/><br/>DataDonor<br/>The final design, DataDonor, is a digital environment which consists of an informative website regarding the value of health data and a module that can be added to existing telemonitoring services to share health data for research. This way, patients and care professionals can use the initial telemonitoring service. Additionally, the module provides patients with information regarding the impact of their data donations on their care and that of others. To maintain measuring and sharing adherence, DataDonor adapts to personal drivers to measure and share health data over time.<br/>By repositioning the role of a patient from being a ‘care user’ to a ‘care contributor’, patients are not reminded they are a patient when measuring and sharing health data but enable them to be a vital contributor to individual and public care.<br/><br/>Validation<br/>DataDonor has been evaluated with patients, the client and health care experts to assess the concept on both a user and client level. These sessions resulted in relevant feedback and validation and are shared in chapter 7. However, to fully validate the effect of DataDonor, it should be tested over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/>DataDonor is a digital environment supporting care providers to strategically obtain patient health data to improve clinical care. By guaranteeing secure and anonymous use of patient health data and by enabling patients to contribute to their own care and do good at the same time, patients can be triggered to share health data with their care providers. Additionally, by appealing to personal drivers to measure and share health data, DataDonor provides a solution that fit the needs of the patient, business and organization.","Health care; Behavioural design; Digitalization; Machine Learning; eHealth; Value based health care; Cardiovascular disease","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Current solutions for this intervention are associated with inconsistent and unreliable clinical outcomes. This leads to substantial complications, including implant migration and loosening. These complications are, among others, caused by the lack of biological fixation, a non-physiological stress distribution and stress shielding. To encounter these problems a novel concept for an acetabular revision has been presented. The aim of this new design is to plastically deform into massive acetabular bone deficiencies. This will stimulate the surrounding bone and therefore diminishes effect of stress shielding (Wolff’s Law). This study explored whether a porous layer made of pure titanium can achieve this space-filling behaviour. The infill of this porous layer is based on meta-biomaterials. The macro-scale properties of this type of materials are determined by their small-scale architecture. The aim of the first part of this study was therefore to systematically study the topology-property relationship of six topological designs, including the cube, truncated cube, truncated cuboctahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, diamond and body centred cubic. These designs were studied by experimentally determining their mechanical properties, including the Poisson’s ratio using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. Afterwards, three topological designs were selected to be implemented in the novel acetabular component, including the diamond, rhombic dodecahedron and body centred cubic. These unit cells showed the lowest stiffness and the highest positive Poisson’s ratio over the complete range of concerned porosities (80-98%). Besides, they showed bending-dominated deformation without the failure of struts. The results indicated that these unit cells have the highest capacity to plastically deform as well have the potential of space-filling behaviour. The porosity of the porous layer of the implant functionally graded from very porous at the bone-implant interface to very solid at the joint’s articulating surface, which corresponds to bone’s hierarchical structure. These implants were compressed inside a bone-mimicking mould, of which the appearance and mechanics resembled an acetabulum with large bone deficiencies. µCT images revealed that the implant based on the diamond unit cell showed the most promising deformability at the mould-implant interface. Although this deformation was promising, the push-in forces needed to compress the implant into the mould were very high (ranging from 3.33 kN to 14.8 kN). Future work is needed to diminish the need for these high push-in forces by making the porous outer layer even more deformable. This novel implant has the potential to increase the biological fixation, preserve the physiological stress distribution and diminish the effect of stress shielding in the acetabular component of a total hip replacement.","non-auxetic; meta-biomaterials; functionally graded materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-08","","","","","",""

Among other factors that inﬂuence these route choices, the urban environment has been identiﬁed as one in a network, road or aesthetic level. However, how the morphology of the built environment inﬂuences the cyclists remains rather unexplored. Considering that two routes are equally distant and safe, would a cyclist choose the most idyllic route in terms of its spatial openness? This thesis aims to explore the extent that the visible views of the urban environment affect the route choosing of a cyclist while traveling in the center of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It also For this purpose, 127 GPS trajectories of the Fietstelweek dataset of 2015 are compared with alternative routes suggested by OpenStreetMap (OSM) via the OpenRouteService Directions API. The suggested alternatives can be either the fastest routes, the longest routes or those recommended by OSM (in terms of travel distance, travel time or safety. Throughout this MSc thesis a methodology based on the visibility of the cyclistis proposed. The visibility analysisis based on the ray casting algorithm in a 3D environment and gives as an output 3D isovists. The 3D isovists are used in order to measure the spatial openness as the ratio of the amount of visible sky, visible buildings and visible ground, as well as the shape of the 3D isovist itself. Opposite to similar researches that are performing the visibility analysis on the actual GPS routes, this thesis project applies the visibility analysis to a simpliﬁed version of the OSM street network in the centre of Amsterdam. The simpliﬁed OSM street network consists of street segments, the nodes of which represent real road intersections. The output of the visibility analysis per street segment is later mapped to the GPS trajectories and the alternative routes as an aggregated value. Finally, the routes are compared to each other with the ANOVA statistical method (N=127) and the Tukey’s post hoc test, resulting to a quantiﬁcation of the differences of the GPS routes in terms of spatial openness. The results of the statistical analysis indicate the importance of the distance in the cyclists route choices but also the importance of the ratio of buildings and visible sky, the ratio of buildings and ground as well as a signiﬁcant preference of the cyclists towards non-homogeneous routes with variation on the street proﬁles. We consider the methodology as an interesting proposal of measuring attributes that are difﬁcult to be interpreted by using the traditional space syntax methodology and as a new way to provide design guidelines of the city to urban planners and architects when a detailed 3D environment is provided.","Bicycle route; Built Environment; Visibility analysis; 3D Isovists; Spatial Openness; GPS; Fietstelweek; Qualitative analysis; ANOVA analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Santos, Bruno F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This research concerns the problem of scheduling aircraft maintenance tasks, that must be carried in multiple maintenance checks to keep the aircraft airworthy. During this research the allocation of maintenance tasks to their maintenance opportunities is referred to as the task allocation problem. It is a complex combinatorial problem that is solved daily by aircraft operators.We propose a novel two-stage framework capable of solving the task allocation problem, for an entire fleet. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation was developed for both stages of the framework. In the first stage an exact method is used to pre-determine the workforce to allocate per day to each aircraft under maintenance. In the second stage, the task allocation problem is solved in- dependently for each aircraft, allocating task at the work shift level and per workforce skill. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is proposed, using bin packaging problem solution techniques, for both stages of the framework.Both stages were tested and validated using data of 45 aircraft from a European airline. The compu- tational performance of the approximation algorithm is benchmarked using a MILP formulation, solved with a commercial solver. Results indicate that the solution quality of the proposed algorithm remains excellent and runs up to 26 times faster than the exact method.This research is the first to present an optimization model to solve the maintenance task allocation problem, being solved at the work shift level. Furthermore, it presents a bin-packaging approximation algorithm that can be solved within minutes for the 45 aircraft fleet and a planning horizon of 4 years. The framework was validated in practice and the results give insights on the potential benefit of using such framework to solve this daily recurrent problem.","Maintenance; Optimization; Task allocation; Practical; Airline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Transport and Operations","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In December 2017, the municipality of Amsterdam announced the development of a new city in its port: Haven-Stad. The plan comprises a redevelopment strategy to transform port lands towards a mixed use urban area with up to 70.000 dwellings. This announcement caused a conflict between port users and the city. This integration of various stakeholders and interests is key for successful urban area redevelopment, especially in the complex port-city interface. Goal of this thesis is to understand and learn from the presumed conflict between port and city in the case of Amsterdam. Therefore, an actor-centered institutional analysis was conducted of the strategic governance and planning around Haven-Stad. The level of integration between scales, sectors and agencies per outcome of each planning phase was measured and then set against the analysed institutional setting. This research identified various socio-cultural, legal-economic and governance factors in the institutional setting that affect plan making in the port-city interface. Various subjects, such as relaxed environmental regulations, decentralized urban planning and change of the political landscape have contributed to unintegrated planning and conflicts. The municipality has a culture of blueprint strategic urban planning and is focused on integrating different departments and solving an ongoing housing crisis. On the other hand, the fact that the port is fossil fuel based and corporatized -but municipally owned- limited its ability to prevent urban takeover. This thesis recommends the development of a true and joint port-urban vision, the enhancement of cooperation between local, regional and national stakeholders and the involvement of private parties and port users in plan making. In an outlook towards the introduction of the new Environment and Planning Act, this research indicates that decentralized and flexible planning instruments may increase the chance for potential conflicts in industrial and waterfront redevelopment areas.","Amsterdam Haven-Stad; Waterfront redevelopment; Port-city interface; Urban development management; Actor analysis; Institutional analysis; Housing crisis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The rapid developments in technology have made all electronics cheaper and made the Internet of Things possible. The Internet of Things has brought many new products and services to the market and revived the dream of a ""smart home"" for the average person. There seem to be two main types of smart home systems. The first type of smart homes are built using proprietary, subscription-based services and “black box” hardware devices that work exclusively with these services (e.g. Nest and Sonos). This type takes less time to set up, but offers little ability to customize, adapt and control the system. This type also has limited possibilities of combining hardware and services from different vendors, while raising questions about data transparency and privacy. The second type are smart home systems based on open source software (e.g. OpenHAB and Home Assistant), which are typically used by enthusiasts. This type requires a lot of time and specialized knowledge to set up and use, but gives the enthusiasts a lot of control, transparency and full ownership of the system and collected data. While these days enthusiasts have access to a lot more products to build their smart home, they are rarely the sole inhabitants and their co-habitants are not likely to share the same level of enthusiasm for new technologies. Instead of a home making their lives easier, they encounter automated systems that are not tailored to their behavior and that don't react the way they would expect, causing confusion and exclusion. <br/>Neither of the two types of smart home systems offer sufficient support for being used and adapted by multiple users with varying needs and skills (such as different family members or roommates). This project investigates how a smart home may combine the control and flexibility of an open source platform with the convenience of a proprietary service-based system, while inclusively catering to a diverse group of inhabitants.

During my studies I started to get interested in a way of thinking of architecture in reverse, doing the opposite. To do a proposal for preservation and activation of empty space. To recognize empty space as a complex, multi-layered reality. In this graduation project I elaborate on this concept of subtraction. In which creating is still the essence, but instead of creating something out of nothing, something is being created out of the existing. I felt like the act of subtraction within the spatial environment has not been studied extensivelly. There is a relevance to reveal the potential of substraction as an act within our discipline. Therefore I collected relevant reading in this booklet. It started more as a sculptural fascination and exploration, and it developed towards a multilayered study — where I also explored and discovered a meaning of the act, the making, of subtraction.

However, the retail sector is still in a ‘re- inventing phase’. The popularity of e-commerce is increasing and Dutch shopping districts are continuously changing. This affects the profitability of both retailers and retail investors. Considering that the Dutch population is aging, people live longer independently and elderly people like shopping centres as places for spontaneous encounters it seems clear that an increasingly important target group for Dutch neighbourhood shopping centres are the elderly people. If our neighbourhood shopping centres are not tailored towards the wishes of the elderly consumers it can have both a social and financial impact. First of all, the elderly might not be able to buy the goods they need for an autonomous live and they might not like the physical environment of the shopping centre as a social meeting place. Besides this, it can lead to missed financial opportunities for retailers and shopping centre investors. The main aim of this research is to gain insight into solutions / measures that make existing neighbourhood shopping centres future proof in aging societies such as the Netherlands.

(mentor); Bouwmans, I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","De Nederlandse overheid heeft een opendataportaal (data.overheid.nl). Via dit portaal kunnen dataproviders open data beschikbaar maken voor hergebruik door datagebruikers. De datagebruikers kunnen onderverdeeld worden in standaard eindgebruikers en ontwikkelaars. Hierbij analyseren standaard eindgebruikers open data voor inzichten die hen in staat stellen om nieuwe kansen te herkennen, aan de hand van onder andere ontwikkelingen in de maatschappij. Bijvoorbeeld door aan de hand van cijfers die de netto bevolkingstoename weergeven binnen een regio, de behoefte van nieuwkomers tegemoet te zien in de vorm van nieuw aanbod aan producten. Hiervoor dienen namelijk in een vroeg stadium investeringen te zijn gedaan voor winstgevende activiteiten op de langere termijn. De ontwikkelaars zijn erop gericht om applicaties te ontwikkelen voor eindgebruikers met intuïtieve gebruikersinterfaces die een bepaalde hoofdfunctie vervullen. Hiervoor zijn ontwikkelaars geïnteresseerd in applicaties die samenvallen met ontwikkelingen in de praktijk die een onvervulde informatievraag genereren onder standaard eindgebruikers. Ontwikkelaars zijn bijvoorbeeld: applicatieontwikkelaars, data-analisten en databankontwerpers. Dit onderzoek richt zich op het gebruik van open data door standaard eindgebruikers. De gebruiksvriendelijkheid van het portaal is niet optimaal waardoor kansen onbenut blijven voor eindgebruikers.<br/>Dit komt omdat hulpmiddelen ontbreken bij het effectief verwerken van open data. Ook is het lastig om strategische keuzes te maken bij het selecteren en gebruiken van open data, doordat het aanbod niet gestandaardiseerd is. Er is dus geen eenduidige manier waarop open data kunnen worden ingelezen en gebruikt voor de verrijking met andere datasets en informatie. De drempel voor het gebruik van het overheidsportaal is hoog waardoor het gebruik achterblijft bij de mogelijkheden die open data kunnen bieden aan standaard eindgebruikers. <br/>Het overheidsportaal zou kunnen worden verbeterd op twee vlakken; (i) het aanbod van open data, en (ii) de strategieën vanuit eindgebruikers voor het gebruik van open data. Het uiteindelijk doel is daarbij om effectief gebruik van open data te stimuleren en daarmee te zorgen dat data gebruikt worden op een laagdrempelige manier met behulp van de creativiteit van eindgebruikers. Hierbij hoort de volgende hoofdvraag:<br/>‘Wat moeten portaaleigenaren doen om de drempel voor het gebruik van open data te verlagen?’<br/>Om deze hoofdvraag te kunnen beantwoorden, zijn verschillende onderzoeksmethoden toegepast voor het onderbouwen van de problemen en het komen tot aanbevelingen voor specifieke maatregelen. Het probleem is dat er technische functies ontbreken voor het verwerken van open data op het portaal. Hierbij zijn er verschillen in hoe open data is aangeboden op het portaal. Met behulp van technische functies die door alle datagebruikers kunnen worden gebruikt hoeft een gebrek aan vaardigheden en kennis geen belemmering te zijn om gebruik te maken van open data, waarbij open data verwerkt kunnen worden op basis van een vooropgestelde onderzoeksvraag en/of hypothese. De datagebruikers kunnen hiermee worden gestimuleerd om creatief gebruik te maken van open data zonder dat de drempel voor het gebruik ervan te hoog is. <br/>Allereerst is er een literatuuronderzoek ingezet om een aantal aspecten voor het portaal vast te kunnen stellen, namelijk de benoeming van functies waarmee open data kunnen worden verwerkt, de criteria waarmee verschillen in het aanbod van open data kunnen worden benoemd, en wettelijke richtlijnen uit officiële publicatiebladen op Europees niveau ten aanzien van beleid. <br/>Ten tweede is een empirische analyse uitgevoerd op het huidige portaal voor het bepalen van ontbrekende functies die in de literatuur zijn benoemd.<br/>De derde onderzoeksmethode is een experimentele aanzet tot gedefinieerde gebruikerspaden die nog niet op deze manier zijn gedefinieerd als leidraad voor eindgebruikers. Dit is het eerste onderzoek dat gebruikerspaden definieert en gebruikt voor open data. De gebruikerspaden kunnen worden hergebruikt door gebruikers voor data-analyse in verschillende domeinen en voor verschillende gebruikersdoeleinden. <br/> De vierde gebruikte onderzoeksmethode omvat interviews met deskundigen die onderzoek doen aan de Technische Universiteit Delft. Voor dit onderzoek zijn in totaal zes opendatadeskundigen geïnterviewd. Eén opendatadeskundige is voor aanvang van het literatuuronderzoek geïnterviewd om suggesties te krijgen voor geschikte wetenschappelijke literatuur voor het literatuuronderzoek. De andere vijf deskundigen zijn geïnterviewd voor het evalueren van de ontbrekende functies op het portaal en voor evaluatie van en het verkrijgen van feedback op de gebruikerspaden.<br/><br/>De volgorde en samenhang waarin de verschillende onderzoeksmethoden zijn toegepast is als volgt.<br/>In de literatuur zijn vier hoofdcategorieën van criteria gevonden waarin de verschillen in het aanbod van open data en daarmee gebruiksvriendelijkheid van open data kunnen worden uitgedrukt; (i) formaat, (ii) metadata, (iii) toegang, en (iv) kwaliteit (Dawes et al., 2016).<br/>Tevens zijn functies geïdentificeerd die onder andere kunnen worden gebruikt bij het verzamelen, analyseren en visualiseren van open data. Met een empirische analyse van het huidige overheidsportaal is bepaald welke functies uit de literatuur ontbreken. Deze ontbrekende functies zijn vervolgens geëvalueerd na interviews met vijf deskundigen met behulp van enquêtevragen waarmee het belang van elke ontbrekende functie is vastgesteld. Verder zijn er EU-richtlijnen geanalyseerd om maatregelen te formuleren waarmee portaaleigenaren met de wettelijke richtlijnen kunnen omgaan. Deze richtlijnen bepalen de verplichtingen bij het aanbieden van open data op een portaal voor de verantwoordelijke overheden.<br/>Vervolgens zijn op een experimentele manier gebruikerspaden ontworpen met behulp van data-analysetechnieken uit literatuur. Het gebruik van open data kan op een gestructureerde manier beschreven worden doordat strategische keuzes bij het analyseren van open data bepalend zijn voorgestelde doelstellingen. De gebruikerspaden geven een reeks van activiteiten aan om open data te verwerken voor een bepaald doel. De gebruikerspaden zijn gedefinieerd in de vorm van procedures bestaande uit te volgen stappen om vooropgestelde doelen te kunnen bereiken. De manier waarop de gebruikerspaden zijn gedefinieerd is experimenteel doordat ze nog verder moeten worden verbeterd aan de hand van onderzoek naar specifieke gebruikersbehoeften bij het analyseren van open data. Deze behoeften moeten vervolgens ook nog worden vertaald naar taken die vallen binnen een gebruikerspad. De initiële gebruikerspaden zijn, met behulp van enquêtes gericht aan opendatadeskundigen, onderzocht op gebruiksvriendelijkheid en verbeteringsmogelijkheden.<br/><br/>Met de volgende conclusies en aanbevelingen kan het aanbod van open data en het portaal gebruiksvriendelijker worden verbeterd.<br/><br/>Er zijn vier categorieën van criteria gevonden die kunnen worden gebruikt om het aanbod van open data op het portaal te verbeteren:<br/>1. Formaat: verschillende voorwaarden voor het gebruik van open data, bijvoorbeeld waarbij software als gereedschap is benodigd om er toegang tot te krijgen. Voorbeeld: gelinkte en machine-leesbare open dataformats stellen datagebruikers in staat om direct in actie te komen met data-analyses zonder aparte preparatietaken voor het koppelen van datasets<br/>2. Metadata: de exacte beschrijving van databronnen met een gezamenlijke context voor alle datagebruikers, in de vorm van een aparte informatiestructuur en relevante trefwoorden voor de vindbaarheid van datasets.<br/>3. Toegankelijkheid: verschillende bestandsformaten waarin de open data worden aangeboden, inclusief de mogelijkheid om door datasets te navigeren via webpagina’s, zonder de open data eerst te moeten downloaden.<br/>4. Kwaliteit: omgang met kwaliteitsverschillen tussen datasets waarmee ook de kwaliteit van data-analyses wordt beïnvloed indien deze niet worden gecorrigeerd met behulp van beschikbare technieken of door de dataproviders.<br/>De open data worden beschouwd in de vorm van datasets en kunnen hierbij worden onderverdeeld in gestructureerd on ongestructureerd. Voorbeelden van gestructureerde open dataformaten op het huidige portaal zijn: XML, JSON, CSV, en andere dataformaten. Voorbeelden van ongestructureerde open data zijn PDF-documenten, video, audio, foto’s, brieven, beleidsnota’s en andere gegevens die in verschillende dataformaten worden aangeboden. Aangezien het nut in open data gelegen is in de mogelijke koppeling tussen datasets, is er een voorkeur voor gestructureerde machine-leesbare datasets die snel elektronisch verwerkt kunnen worden. Daarmee kunnen datasets namelijk efficiënt gelinkt kunnen worden met andere datasets voor waardevolle data-analyse doeleinden. Bij gestructureerde datasets kunnen op basis van attributen subsets worden gefilterd uit een dataset. Dit kan aan de hand van een querytaal zoals SQL waarbij de datasets in een relationele database worden ingeladen en gekoppeld met andere gegevens. Hiermee kunnen opdrachten worden uitgevoerd met de wiskundige logica die de samenhang tussen gegevens representeert en die tot nieuwe inzichten kan leiden voor eindgebruikers. Oftewel, het analyseren en koppelen van open data is gemakkelijker indien open data gestructureerd worden aangeboden. Het kost meer moeite om ongestructureerde open data te analyseren en te koppelen aan andere gegevens doordat de open data moeten worden afgestemd op dezelfde gegevenstypen. De gebruikte gegevenstypen zijn afhankelijk van de verschillende taken die door datagebruikers worden uitgevoerd voor de gewenste inzichten. De vindbaarheid van datasets kan worden vergroot door aparte informatiestructuurbeschrijvingen toe te voegen, bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van een doelenboom, ter verduidelijking van de inhoudelijke betekenis ten opzichte van andere open data. De toegankelijkheid is hierbij de mogelijkheid om door open data te navigeren zonder het direct te hoeven downloaden naar een applicatie. Bijvoorbeeld door middel van gestandaardiseerde HTML-webpagina’s. Ten slotte is de kwaliteit afhankelijk per situatie waarin gebruik wordt gemaakt van open data en moet er gelegenheid zijn om dit frequent te controleren door eindgebruikers via het portaal. Bijvoorbeeld met behulp van technieken die helpen om de kwaliteit van data te kunnen beoordelen voor het beoogde gebruik ervan.<br/><br/>De dataproviders en portaaleigenaren kunnen de EU-richtlijnen toepassen via open databeleid met behulp van de volgende drie maatregelen:<br/>1. Privacygevoelige gegevens anonimiseren ter bescherming van personen.<br/>2. Kostentoerekening op basis van de hoeveelheid gegevens toepassen via licenties.

With the number of such projects being constantly on the rise each year, its efficient maintenance has become a primary requirement for any asset owner. Among the many techniques available, FMECA is widely used for maintenance planning. In this method, different critical components are identified based on their likelihood of failure and impact on the infrastructure. Based on the inferences obtained, maintenance plans are developed where interventions are prioritized based on a component’s criticality within the system. FMECA uses risk matrices to assess criticalities semi-quantitatively. This lacks the required quantifiable information of a component in a system. A component by design can either be individual or exist as a subsystem comprising several components. To analyze criticalities accurately, quantitative information that can provide insights on a component’s state in the system is required. Hence, this thesis develops a new approach that could eliminate subjective errors in conventional criticality analysis. The new and conventional approach was applied to two infrastructures to observe and discuss the variations in results obtained. The comparative study showcased that the new approach provided better quantitative reasonings for criticalities obtained for each component. Using the unique implementation of the obtained quantitative data as done in the current research, developing realistic and accurate maintenance strategies is possible.","Criticality analysis; Infrastructure maintenance; FMECA; Risk Matrix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The currents impressed by this system onto the seawater find their way to corroding parts of the ship’s hull, and prevent the hull from corroding. The electric field resulting from the currents around the ship is called the electric signature. This signature is a threat in seas with mines, as mines explode when they detect this signature. Therefore controlling the signature is important, especially to naval ships. In order to be able to control the signature the location and size of corrosion damage needs to be known. Today no method exists for corrosion damage estimation on a sailing ship. This study aims to develop a method for corrosion damage estimation using only measurements of an ICCP system. The research question is: To what accuracy and with what measurements can the damage distribution on a ship’s hull be reconstructed? The quality of the damage reconstruction is evaluated by how well the signature is estimated. First an analytical model is used to explore the theoretical limits of damage reconstruction. This shows damage reconstruction is limited by the number of measurement electrodes. Then damage reconstruction by numeric model inversion is attempted, but is shown to be unattainable. The proposed solution is damage reconstruction by repeatedly calculating for different damage configurations, comparing the calculated measurements to the true ones, and iterating until an optimum is found. This method works well on a ship geometry if 140 measurement sensors are used. In order to verify the damage reconstruction algorithm a scale model facility is developed. The produced field sensors show shifting offsets that are not explained, but good linearity with the electric field. Simulations and measurements with a calibration source show good similarity, but a factor of 1.6 difference that is not explained. Test with sacrificial anodes show large variations over time and a large dependency on the sailing speed. The results show that corrosion damage reconstruction using only on-ship measurements can be achieved. The resolution of damage reconstruction is limited by the number of measurement electrodes, at least one hundred are needed for the signature to be resolved. Current ships have between one and eight measurement electrodes; it is recommended future ships will have at least one hundred. These results furthermore indicate that time-dependent effects should be included in the physical model used for the simulations.","Damage Estimation; Corrosion Protection; Signature; Ships; ICCP; Naval mines; Electric Signature; Inverse Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Water stress can lead to conflicts, holds back economic growth and has a major impact on human health. Nowadays, more and more countries that lack fresh water sources are using the saline water from the oceans and desalinate it to produce fresh water. The most common way to do this is by the means of Reverse Osmosis (RO). However, one of the biggest negative aspects of desalination is its high energy consumption, mostly provided by fossil fuels. Therefore, a more sustainable solution using renewable energy sources to power a RO system is necessary. Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) is currently developing a hydraulic drive train wind turbine that converts the aerodynamic power captured from the wind into hydraulic power. With a positive displacement pump, a high pressure water stream is created for centralised electricity production using a spear valve and a Pelton wheel. Using this hydraulic turbine for the purpose of fresh water production with RO can be a well fitted combination. Using wind as an energy source for desalination purposes, however, creates some major challenges, one of which is dealing with the inconsistency of wind. For varying wind speeds, a hydraulic wind turbine is controlled by regulating system pressure hence the pump torque with the spear valve. With a Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) system with ERD, it is researched how to regulate the flows and pressures for a stable operation. In this thesis, the combination of the hydraulic wind turbine with a Reverse Osmosis system with an Pressure Exchanger Energy Recovery Device (ERD) is being analysed in more detail. For this, a numerical model is used to determine the systems' behaviour and an experimental test setup is designed and constructed to validate the model results. The aim of this thesis is to compare the desalination system performance with a stand-alone system without an ERD, to determine the influence of varying ERD settings on the systems' pressure for potential system pressure and torque controllability, and to investigate how the RO system with an ERD affects the wind turbines stability. The analysis shows a large positive influence on the amount of produced permeate when using an ERD in the RO system. In addition, the power consumption of the RO process can be reduced by up to 80%. A varying input provided by the high pressure pump, for example as a results of varying wind speeds, does not seem to (negatively) affect the efficiency of permeate production. By varying the ERDs' rotational speed, the feed pressure at the membranes inlet hence the pressure at the high pressure pump can be slightly influenced. However, this limited influence is not enough to effectively affect and control the high pressure pumps' torque. On top of that, for the wind turbine to operate in a stable operating region, it seems that the use of an ERD affects the system in such a way that water production can only be realised at fairly high wind speeds. To optimally make use of the hydraulic wind turbine and operate at the highest possible aerodynamic efficiency, a combination of electricity production at low wind speeds and water production with an ERD when wind speeds are sufficient, can be interesting. For this, future research is required.","Reverse Osmosis; Wind Turbine; Renewable Energy; Experimental study; Energy Recovery Device; Desalination; SWRO; RO; Hydraulic Wind Turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-17","","","","","",""

For this, reinforcement learning (RL) is a naturally fitting paradigm. A proof-of-principle framework, called SL-ENDA, based on estimation of normal distribution algorithms in combination with reinforcement learning is defined. SL-ENDA uses an RL-agent to decide upon the next population mean while approaching the rest of the algorithm as the environment. A comparison of SL-ENDA to AMaLGaM and CMA-ES on unimodal noiseless functions shows mostly comparable performance and scalability to the broadly used and carefully manually crafted algorithms. This result, in combination with the inherent potential of self-learning model-based evolutionary algorithms with regard to specialization, opens the door to a new research direction with great potential impact on the field of model-based evolutionary algorithms.","Estimation of distribution algorithms; Machine Learning; Reinforcement Learning (RL); Black-box optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Existing ultrasound based techniques allow measurement of muscle architecture parameters, but not the quantification of shear strain. In this study, an algorithm that tracks the shear strain from ultrasound images using a continuum representation of the muscle was developed. Errors in strain tracking may arise due to misalignment of the imaging plane, movement artifacts and non-uniform strain within the muscle. The goal of this study was to develop and validate the newly developed strain tracking algorithm. Various potential sources of error are investigated. A computer model was created consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) synthetic volume, representing the muscle. Virtual ultrasound images were then sampled from the 3D volume by intersecting the synthetic volume under a known angle of the imaging plane. The measurement error was defined as the difference between the known strain that was imposed virtually to the 3D muscle volume and the strain calculated with the tracking algorithm. The measurement error was determined for conditions of combined axial and shear strain, plane misalignment, plane rotation and non-uniform strain. Conditions were simulated between 30 and 100 times, each time with a different synthetic muscle volume.<br/>The developed strain tracking algorithm provided strain measurement of sub-pixel accuracy and precision when the imaging plane was aligned with the fascicles. Rotation of the ultrasound transducer relative to the muscle resulted in invalid measurements. Axial strain was overestimated when the muscle exhibited a non-uniform axial strain pattern. Largest errors (underestimation of strain by up to 65%) were caused by misalignment of the imaging plane with the fascicles. The large effect of misalignment emphasizes the need for careful transducer placement that requires anatomical information about the muscle structure. Strain tracking methods based on three-dimensional avoid the need for alignment, potentially allowing more accurate measurement of strain.","tracking; muscle; ultrasound imaging; speckle; digital image; Correlation; continuum mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Its physical manifestations have a great resonance within our cities and the built environment. Throughout history retail typologies have constantly been adapted and reinvented around major shifts within our society, economics and development of new technologies, allowing for the constant push of retail space. Up to this point retail developments have evolved around the pushing of product sales. Today, however, retail is facing yet another shift within global society. With the emergence of online commerce the sales of physical products is moving out of brick &amp; mortar retail. This increasingly digital shopping does mean however, that brands are losing their opportunity to engage with customers face-to-face, a vital part of the brand to customer relationship. On top of this consumer culture is changing. We are moving away from a product economy and towards an experience and service economy, where the experience or the story behind a brand is sometimes even more important to consumers than the product itself. Retail therefor is slowly moving away from manufacturer “push” and more towards consumer “pull”, where the physical experiences are becoming more extreme, special, remarkable and differentiated. In essence, physical retail is slowly becoming more of an advertisement tool, rather than the point of sales. Big retail centres should move away from the consumerism and product based strategies they have adapted over the last century and start providing both consumers and brands with a new, active, experiential and explorational environment. This new type acts as an attractor towards both travellers and workers, blending retail experiences within food, technology, fashion sports and design with complementary amenities, providing both a canvas for brands to express their colourful message and engage consumers and a three dimensional world for consumers to explore the latest trends and innovations.","Retail; Schiphol; Future Typology; Experience; Consumerism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Projects: AMS MID City",""

While renewables need a lot of space compared to conventional energy sources, and the competition for space is already increasing (food production, housing etc.), leading to higher land costs and opposition. Public resistance to new highly visible windfarms and onshore solar farms is hardening. Large land-based solar farms compete with agricultural use and can have negative effects on the ecosystem, by covering the soil from the solar light. A solution to the stated problems is by placing renewable energy production at sea, among which offshore floating solar energy.<br/>One of the main challenges in offshore floating solar is the continuous wave-induced motion of floaters, and the forces that arise at the most critical points. Dynamically modelling multiple floaters in waves becomes very computationally and time intensive when the number of floaters increases. This research focused on creating and comparing a linear and a non-linear model that calculates motions of multiple floaters under first order wave forces. The aim is to perform these calculations with open-source software only.<br/>The dynamic forces on the floaters are obtained by evaluating the radiation, diffraction and wave excitation potential in the open-source Boundary-Element-Method-Solver NEMOH and showed good resemblance with commercial software packages AQWA and DIFFRAC. The modelling of the motions is performed in time (linear and non-linear RK4-integration-scheme) and frequency domain (linear). The implementation of the dynamic forces in both cases showed to be the most critical for the behavior of the floaters. Especially the determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients: Infinite added mass and retardation function for the time domain simulation are key in getting the same result for the linear time domain and frequency domain. Suppressing non-realistic values of gap resonance between multiple floating bodies increases the efficiency of time-domain simulations. Small differences between the motions of the floaters can cause significant differences in the forcing, therefor it is rather advisable to perform the comparison between the linear and non-linear case in time domain.<br/>A comparison of different wave directions and conditions showed that the results of the linear model are of the same order of magnitude as the non-linear model. For the determination of motions and forcing under first order wave forces this shows that both cases are similar. Nevertheless, other non-linear effects can be added in a follow-up study.","Hydrodynamics; Offshore Solar Energy; Interconnected bodies; Ocean Energy; Floating Solar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-01","","","","","","52.2457048,4.0826998"

These drawbacks make electric go-karts less desired in the rental industry, where turn-around-time is required to be as short as possible; in order to maximize profit.

As of 2014, cardiovascular disease accounted for 27% of all deaths1. The cardiology department of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) has a regional role in treating patients with different cardiovascular diseases, ranging from myocardial infarction, heart failure and infectious cardiac diseases to life support with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in severe heart failure patients. Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects a big proportion of these patients. Forty myocardial infarction (MI) patients are seen on a weekly basis in the outpatient clinic (MISSION!-clinic) at set times after the infarction event; 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or 12 months.<br/><br/>In an attempt to improve patient outcome, provide a better service and reduce the workload at the outpatient clinic, the LUMC launched a novel project called ""the BOX"". The BOX allows patients to self-monitor their vitals after a myocardial infarction (MI) or heart surgery, thus reducing visits to the hospital.<br/><br/>Patients are given a Wi-Fi scale, a watch with a pedometer, a Wi-Fi blood pressure meter (BPM) and a one-lead EKG/ECG monitor. The devices are produced by two different companies (Nokia/Withings and Alivecor) and are connected to the mobile phone of the patients. Patients have to measure their vitals on a daily basis and are instructed to contact a professional in case of emergency. Preliminary results show a good acceptance from the patients and high willingness to self-monitor their disease. This new product-service reduces the number of regular visits to the outpatient clinic by 40%, which are replaced by video conference.<br/><br/>In this context, the cardiology department plans to take the next steps to expand this service and provide effective and quality care using e-Health medical devices. Nevertheless, they are dependent on different stakeholders to do so. On the one hand, the companies that sell the medical devices (like the ones included in the BOX) control the patient data, and grant access to the hospital. A change in their business model can affect patient safety, privacy and the systems that the hospital has to put into place. On the other hand the patient must use the devices. Self-monitoring is an important behaviour for self-management, required for various chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. But, having a plethora of devices and applications is not accessible for all the patients, which is a critical requirement for the LUMC as a part of a public institution that focuses on providing healthcare services to the general population. Moreover, a hospital requires stability for the long-term in order to implement technological solutions that directly affect patients.<br/><br/>The described situation is an interesting opportunity to look at product/services through different lenses (public sector) and design within the institution. Although, it also has the constraint/limitation that doctors are not engineers/producers. In addition, it is a vast problem to tackle, thus the necessity to focus on one area as the research is done.","myocardial infarction; self-monitoring; cardiology; product-service design; healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) is a spectral imaging technique, which enables detection of the spatial distribution of molecules by collecting a mass spectrum for every pixel across a tissue sample. As such, IMS enables the detection of disease-introduced anomalies in tissue samples as well as the gaining of deeper insight on a molecular level into biological processes. The dimensionality of IMS data is high, considering that every bin (or ion) along a mass spectrum represents a separate image and the number of pixels per image is relatively high. Manual analysis of the data suffers from this high dimensionality as visualization becomes increasingly difficult. Furthermore, analysis of such large datasets becomes problematic or infeasible for computational techniques both in time and computational resources. Moreover, the dimensionality of current IMS measurements hampers new applications capturing even more data. Linear dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), seek to reduce these datasets to a set of (principal) components. These components span an underlying feature subspace within the original measurement space. Rank estimation determines the quantity of such components, estimating the number needed to represent the original dataset in a lower-dimensional space while incurring minimal information loss. In the context of IMS, this task is typically performed without the use of domain-specific knowledge. Intensity-aware rank estimation seeks to utilize domain knowledge - in the form of an ion intensity threshold - to help estimate the rank. This threshold emerges naturally from IMS, due to prior knowledge on instrument and ionization process inaccuracies in the low ion intensity region. The ion intensity threshold defines a lower bound for which variations in measurements are reliable. Establishing an intensity-aware version of rank estimation requires the threshold, defined in the original measurement space, to be linked to the abstract feature subspace, defined by NMF or PCA, where the rank estimation takes place. This connection is nontrivial to make and is, therefore, a central topic of this thesis. Furthermore, intensity-aware rank estimation requires the abstract subspace to represent the majority of the information above the threshold in the first set of components, which is not guaranteed in pure NMF and PCA formulations. In this thesis, we demonstrate threshold-aware rank estimation and residual-fraction rank estimation which make rank estimation for PCA intensity-aware. Threshold-aware rank estimation applies a histogram transformation to the intensities in the original measurement space to emphasize threshold-exceeding intensities. Consecutively, we estimate the rank based on the percentage of explained variance. Residual-fraction rank estimation uses untransformed measurements but instead estimates rank based on the ratio of the above- and below-threshold residuals. We demonstrate that both rank estimations are able to find the correct rank in a synthetic dataset. With threshold-aware rank estimation applied to an IMS dataset, we show that the transformation before application of PCA leads to a lower overall estimate of rank based on a percentage of the explained variance. With residual-fraction rank estimation applied to an IMS dataset, we show that we can obtain rank estimates based on the structure of dataset close to cross-validation rank estimates for the same dataset.","Imaging Mass Spectrometry; Dimensionality Reduction; Rank Estimation; Principal Component Analysis; Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Because balance is controlled in a closed loop system with a high level of redundancy, the cause of impaired balance control is often unknown. A balance control model in combination with perturbed balance experiments could be a useful aid to detect the underlying cause of balance impairment, which would allow for better treatment. A disturbance estimation and compensation (DEC) model has a strong neurological basis and is able to describe multiple conditions with one set of parameters. An existing DEC model, containing separate ankle and hip control, was extended by adding visual and mechanical disturbance estimations. The model was fitted to experimental data of elderly subjects maintaining balance in three conditions containing four disturbances simultaneously; visual and ankle proprioceptive perturbations and mechanical perturbations at the hip and shoulder level. To validate the fitting procedure, the model parameters were also fitted to data simulated by the model, and a sensitivity analysis was done.Being fitted to experimental data, the model could reproduce about 60% of the behaviour. Mainly the low frequency behaviour could not fully be tracked. Parameter estimation proved challenging, with some parameters consistently estimated larger or smaller than expected or physiologically plausible. Fitting the model on its own simulated data could reproduce &gt;99.9% of the behaviour, but with some parameters consistently estimated up to a factor 10 too small or too large. Many adaptations and extensions to the existing DEC model were made simultaneously and with the available experimental data it was not possible to investigate the individual influence of each adaptation. If a broader range of experimental data is available, with conditions where only one, two or three perturbations are applied, it is possible to validate each model adaptation separately. This would likely improve the model. With the suggested improvements, the multisegmental DEC model opens up the way towards better treatment for balance impairment.","human balance control; non-linear model; closed-loop identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Recently, a new type of capacitor known as film capacitor or slim capacitor has become popular for use in DC link. This capacitor has a lower value of capacitance and a longer life span than the conventional electrolytic capacitor. A film (slim) capacitor is advantageous over the electrolytic capacitor for use in the DC link because, for a low power motor, it results in a varying DC link voltage. This produces a less distorted grid current thereby improving the power factor. However, drives with slim DC link fed by a soft grid exhibits the tendency to oscillate at higher frequencies. This can be attributed to the LC resonance between the grid inductance and the small DC link capacitance, which results in significant but unwanted voltage ripples on the DC link. The unwanted harmonics affect the performance of the motor and the current drawn from the grid. As a result, the motor drive does not comply with the IEC 61000-3-2 harmonic standard. The objective of this project is to formulate, model and test a control algorithm to suppress the effects of the LC oscillations. This thesis proposes a novel compensation method that estimates the ideal DC link voltage without the unwanted ripples and feed-forwards the reconstructed DC link voltage to the motor drive algorithm, thereby altering the behavior of the motor drive to be more resistive such that the ripple gets damped. By doing so, the current drawn by the motor from the grid will have lesser harmonic content. Therefore, the power factor of the system will improve and the system will adhere to the harmonic standards.","Control system for slim DC link; Embedded control systems for motor drives; Feed-forward control for harmonic reduction; MATLAB model based software development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-17","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

However, in order to completely replace the traditional mineral oil and be considered as a viable insulating fluid for high voltage equipments, these liquids must have comparable responses to mineral oil under DC,AC, lightning impulse as well as switching impulse waveforms. The study of pre-breakdown phenomenon(streamer activity) under different stresses has proven to be crucial in determining the breakdown process taking place in transformer insulations. To study the streamer characteristics in ester (MIDEL 7131) and mineral oil (Shell Diala Transformer oil), both electrical and optical techniques have been used in this thesis. Significant research was conducted in identifying the parameters for the selection of the optical sensor suitable for this application. Various diagnostic techniques were employed for accurate detection of streamers electrically as well as optically. Streamers were initially studied in the highly non uniform needle-plane geometry under DC and lightning impulse stress. This configuration represents the situation of a defect in the transformer. Pressboard was introduced at the needle tip to simulate the effect of triple point as a source of discharge. Experiments conducted in Lodz University of Technology proved to be crucial in understanding the optical detection of streamers under this configuration. The main goal of this thesis was to detect streamers originating from transformer winding. For the first time, electrode arrangements involving transformer windings were tested in ester and mineral oil under lightning impulse for streamer activity. The thesis presents the various streamer signals obtained under different configurations and provides important analysis regarding the characteristics of streamers in transformer insulation. The possible effect of spacers between transformer windings and wooden blocks used in transformer coils in also analyzed. The tests performed in this thesis can contribute to the ultimate goal of understanding the difference in streamer propagation in real life electrode arrangements between ester and mineral oil.","Streamers; Transformer winding; Optical devices; Electrical measurement; Lightning Impulse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-02","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Parcel tankers differentiate form bulk chemical tankers by the additional features that the ships have, such as cargo cooling, cargo heating, many (small) cargo tanks, highest level of chemical resistant materials and notation to carry the most dangerous chemicals. These features make the parcel tanker versatile compared to other tanker types, however this results in a higher cost. In the last twenty years, a shift has taken place in the deep-sea chemical shipping industry, driven by changes in regulations, funding of ships and macroeconomic factors. These changes have made the playing field of deep-sea chemical tankers more equal and commoditised, resulting in more competition by entries of new, privately funded companies with simple chemical tankers. Currently a large part of the parcel tanker fleet is nearing their end of lifetime and are expected to be recycled in the next five years. This creates the need to determine operating needs and requirements for replacements of Stolt Tankers’ ageing parcel tanker fleet. The goal of this study is twofold, first, is to determine the need for parcel tanker features in the market and, secondly, to determine the value that these features add. The findings have been concluded in terms of a priority for the feature in a new parcel tanker specification according to the MoSCoW prioritising technique.Analysis of the features is based on D37 parcel tanker class of Stolt Tankers. This typical parcel tanker class is a candidate for recycling in the next 5 years, and therefore a ideal study object for a replacement study. Four features were identified as giving the highest differentiation of a parcel tanker and are analysed in more detail: cargo cooling, cargo heating with thermal oil heating medium, small cargo tanks, and ship type 1notation. These features are analysed both qualitatively and qualitatively on its operation in the Stolt fleet, market demand and supply, competition and alternatives. The net added value of the features over the life of the ship has been calculated by means of a discounted cash flow analysis for base-,best and worst case scenarios.The cargo cooling feature yields the best added value for a new parcel tanker. The thermal oil cargo heating feature has a negative added net present value for only cargoes with this specific requirement. The study of the ship type notation has a low investment cost, however the loss of revenue by the capacity reduction is far more than potential revenues from thetype 1 cargoes. The number of cargo tanks has a large impact of the capital cost of the ship.Reducing the number of cargo tanks, i.e. the average tank size, yields a relatively large savingfor parcel tanker ship types. Combined with a decrease in the number of small cargoes, makes this a logical development for future parcel tankers. However, more research is required since there is a large discrepancy between the number of small cargoes on different trade routes.Based on the findings from the market and operational review of the D37 features the following priorities are given to the features. The cargo cooling system has been given a’Should Have’priority, the thermal oil cargo heating system has a’Could Have’and the ship type 1 notation a’Won’t Have’. Further research is recommended for the requirement of features of new ships with respect to the total fleet of Stolt Tankers. Secondly, modelling of cargo tank layouts with the statistical trading data is recommended to determine the requirements for the number and sizes ranges of cargo tanks","Parcel Tankers; Shipping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-16","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Many governments, organisations, business and people feel the urgency to act. The United Nations even states in their IPCC 2018 report that in order to keep the climate change contained, unprecedented changes to systems in terms of scale and speed are necessary. A possible change that the system can make is a change towards a circular economy. The circular economy combines business models to environmental principles like reuse, reduce recycle and recover. This report researched the extent to which the principles of the circular economy are applied by housing associations and if these applications are innovative compared to Cradle to Cradle or traditional sustainable applications.<br/>In order to answer this question a case study was carried out. The cases were selected because of the link that was made between the project and the circular economy by the housing associations. Eight cases were studied through ten interviews. The data were analysed using an analytical framework developed in a literature study. The findings of the analyses were discussed in a focus group interview. The result of the research is that the extent of the application of circular economy by housing associations is limited. Four of the eight cases are demolition projects. The recycling and reuse that took place in these projects were no different than the demolition principles that were already common practice. In these cases there also was no circular business model used. There is just one case that applied a circular business model. In this cases however, there is a third party introduced for the execution of the lease model. According to the circular economy theory, these third parties should be avoided.<br/>Although most cases prioritize sustainability over finance, they don’t fit the label Cradle to Cradle. The projects insufficiently focussed on design to avoid waste. Besides, the materials in the projects were not 100% upcycled.<br/>These conclusions do not mean that housing associations do not have sustainable projects and agenda’s. They envision to increase the sustainability of their real estate portfolio. Together the housing associations have a strong market position. They can make a big contribution to sustainability through tenders, collective purchasing of sustainable products and sustainable products as a service.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Current synthetic efforts are largely focussed on functionalizing the perylene core, via either bay- or ortho-substitution. The aim of this research project was to synthesize novel perylene mono-imide di-ester derivates by attaching different substituents at the bay-positions. The first synthetic route that was attempted in this research project was a route via a perylene mono-anhydride mono-imide derivate. The anhydride was attached to this molecule to activate the relevant bay-positions. It was found that the anhydride is not stable enough to withstand the reaction conditions that were used in an attempt to substitute the relevant bay positions. The next synthetic route that was attempted in this research project was a route via a perylene di-ester mono-imide derivate. Reactions were performed to explore whether the di-ester was able to activate the relevant bay-positions. It was found that at the used reaction conditions, phenol exchange takes place on the bay-positions of the perylene core. Due to the challenges that arose, the target compounds of this project have not been synthesized. However, three other new PTCA derivates have been synthesized during this project.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

For the installation of the foundation piles in these cases there is often chosen for screwed displacement piles. These piles can be installed without nuisance for the vicinity, but do induce large soil displacements during installation.

The effects can be minimilized when they are known in advanced. This research looks into the possibility of predicting the installation effects of screwed displacements piles on adjacent structures. This is divided in the prediction of the soil displacement in a finite element analysis and in the effect of the soil displacement on adjacent piles. This is done with two case studies. First data from tests in Shanghai is used to create a finite element model. After this measurements are done in Rotterdam to verify this model for Dutch cases.<br/>Combining all the analysis of the measured and modelled displacements showed that the displacement is depended on the stiffness of the soil layers, the initial displacement at the edge of the pile and the distance from the pile. The soil parameters influence the initial displacements in each soil layers.

A model was created that can describe the soil structure interaction of an SFRUCF including the highly non-linear behaviour of SFRC. The soil structure interaction of the UCF was modelled in Plaxis 2D with a plate element that includes the behaviour of SFRUC by means of an MN-κ diagram. This model was validated with measured data from the Albert Cuyp garage. It was shown that due to the uplift pressure heave occurred in the clay layer underneath the UCF, which increases the load on the UCF by 10%-30% and should be taken into account in the design. Also the heave from the deep Eemclay was considered. This heave had influence on the total deformations but hardly affected the internal forces in the UCF, justifying the fact that this heave is usually not included in the design of a UCF. A fictive E-modulus is often used to describe the cracked behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete. It was shown that using this fictive E-modulus in the building phase leads to an underestimation of the shear forces. <br/>Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was done to show which parameters influence the calculation results, the design and the suitability of a permanent SFRUCF. The suitability of an SFRUCF is determined by the column loads in the final phase and the presence of a stiff raft. It was concluded that an SLS check should be included in the CUR 77 for water tightness, crack width and deformations if an SFRUCF is to be used permanently. The interaction between the raft can be modelled in Plaxis 2D with the plate element that has the behaviour of SFRC. For cases that do not include a stiff raft simpler models can be used such as the Plaxis model with springs or even a beam model with SFRC input.","Steel fibre reinforced concrete; Underwater concrete; soil structure interaction; Albert Cuyp Garage; heave","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

The first generation of these offshore wind turbines has already reached or is approaching their designed lifetime of 20 years. Depending on the legislation and the governmental subsidies, a decision needs to be made about their future. One option is to keep the OWTs in operation after exceeding the design lifetime while the safety levels are not compromised. Operating after the design life, which is called lifetime extension has become more and more interesting in the current market conditions. To find out whether the safety levels, which are determined by the design standards are not compromised when the lifetime is extended, the OWT support structures should be reassessed when the end of design life is insight. Reassessing the support structure can take out the uncertainties of the parameters that are monitored and can make lifetime extension possible. <br/>The objective of this study is to propose a framework for reassessing existing OWT support structures for lifetime extension since there is not a clear detailed methodology describing the assessment and extension which can be applied for OWT support structures. Because of the complexity of the problem and the limited time, only the governing limit state is studied which is the fatigue limit state. The proposed framework consists of two phases. The first phase is the reassessment phase in which the available documentation and measurements of the (operational) history are taken into account to determine the fatigue damage with more certainty from the installation of the OWT till the point when the reassessment takes place. The second phase is the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction phase, which aims at determining the remaining operational lifetime of an OWT without exceeding the safety limits. For both phases, different methods can be used that can be classified in deterministic methods and probabilistic methods. Finally, the suggested framework is demonstrated in a simplified case study. First, the fatigue lifetime of the simplified structure is calculated with wave conditions of the Gemini wind farm; This calculated lifetime resembles the initial design lifetime and serves as a comparative measure for the following reassessment and RUL prediction phases. Then the simplified structure is reassessed with updated data, using a deterministic method. Subsequently, the RUL is predicted by using probabilistic fatigue calculations whereby different uncertainty distributions are taken into account. From this case study, it can be concluded that the proposed framework is applicable for different amounts and types of measurement data as well as assessment methods. The deterministic reassessment shows different outcomes of fatigue life of the structure even with a small change in the input parameters. The probabilistic fatigue calculations used for the RUL are computational more complicated but very promising since site-specific uncertainty distributions replace the generalized partial safety factors. The suggestion is, therefore, to use probabilistic models to achieve a longer lifetime for the OWT support structure without compromising the safety levels.","Wind Turbine; Lifetime extension; Assessment method; Support structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

In<br/>this paper, we make use of invariant manifold theory to assess the conditions - impact location, particle radius, ejection velocity - that cause ejecta particles to get captured in periodic orbits. The analysis is carried out within the dynamical framework of the perturbed Augmented Hill Problem, which takes into account the solar radiation pressure, the effect of eclipses, and the J2 and J4 terms of the asteroid’s gravity potential in its spherical harmonics expansion. We analyze millimeter to centimeter sized particles and captures into three families of periodic orbits that are robust to large values of the solar radiation pressure acceleration – the traditional a and g’ families of the Hill Problem and the southern halo orbits. We go on to find the impact locations for the SCI from where ejecta particles are most likely to be captured into periodic orbits via their stable manifolds. As such, we recover the sets of initial states that lead ejecta to temporary orbital capture and show that solar radiation pressure cannot be neglected in these analyses, identifying locations on the Sun side of the asteroid at medium latitudes as the best impact locations.","Augmented Hill Problem; Astrodynamics; Asteroid Ejecta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The result is that processes tend to work to a local optimum instead of a global optimum. A Transport Logistic Control Tower is a centralized information hub from which integral decisions can be made which could benefit the overall turnaround process at Schiphol airport. There is little knowledge about the effects on the system performance when input parameters are varied. A uniform way of scheduling tasks and making integral decisions is missing. The goal of this research is to determine the integral control scenario that should be used by a Transport Logistic Control Tower in order to optimize the overall performance of KLM's apron processes. The main research question is formulated as: Which integral control scenario should be used by a Transport Logistic Control Tower in order to optimize the overall performance of KLM's apron processes? In the current state analysis the Delft Systems Approach is used in combination with swim lane analyses to analyze the current system. Relations between the different processes, how they interact and the decisions that are made to plan their tasks are analyzed to get a better understanding of the apron processes. To asses the performance of the apron processes, the On Time Start (OTS), On Time Performance (OTP) and the On Time Delivery (OTD) are introduced. The number of flight delays and the corresponding costs are used to combine the process KPIs in order to make a final decision on the best control scenario for KLM. A thorough data analysis is performed by combining the multiple data sources of KLM to get insight in the performance of the system. This showed us that the data quality is not sufficient, and data does not correspond well with the real system. It is therefore recommended to use historical data in combination with the current calculation methods to improve the way the task duration is calculated. This also means that the way data is stored in the HHT should be automated to reduce the amount of measurement errors. A simulation model is designed to assess different control scenarios and the effect they have on the KPIs. The one day run shows significant improvements when dynamic flight priorities are used in combination with a departure oriented control scenario that schedules based on departure time. Compared to the same control scenarios using static priorities, an average improvement of 31,1\% or 1,7 million euros annually could be seen in the delay costs. This control scenario is therefore recommended and shows the necessity to use a uniform way of planning and the potential of the proposed dynamic flight priorities. The recommendations are done based on the analyses and the found results, and used to advice KLM on their future control scenario for their apron processes and improvement levers from which they could benefit in the future.","Optimization; KLM; Apron","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-27","","","","","",""

Circular Economy has in recent years begun to replace the sustainability paradigm as it provides more tangible strategies to achieve the same goals. Civil engineering is a large contributor to environmental impact and waste production therefore reducing this represented the main goal for this thesis; by designing a structure which uses alternative materials and connections to traditional methods the impact was reduced. The design of the structure consisted of the following main aspects; girders, connections, and detailing, these were verified using European norms to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design. Analyses were performed for the key structural aspects of strength, stability, and dynamic response; together with detailing of the components it was demonstrated that implementation of such a bridge is possible in practice. Once the final design was determined it was compared to a set of bridges designed with a traditional civil engineering approach to demonstrate the benefits of circular design in terms of environmental impact. It is concluded that a post-tensioned aluminium girder bridge represents a sufficiently strong and stiff solution for an 18m span and 3m width; the modular design allows for disassembly and modification on site meaning elements can be conveniently reused or replaced. In terms of environmental impact the result is dependent on the LCA method chosen; the Dutch method which allows bonus from reuse and recycling provides an even result while without this detraction the traditional structure is favoured significantly.","Circular Economy; Structural analysis; Life Cycle Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The properties of rubber, being generally soft while showing large inherent damping, makes the material a perfect choice to use in vibration isolators. To minimize vibrations the transfer path from vibrational source to the driver almost always includes a highly damped material like rubber. With the current trend of electrification in the automotive industry, higher order vibrations are becoming more pronounced. Although the produced sound is not of a high octave with respect to traditional combustion engines, they are experienced as unpleasant. Considering a large frequency range, the dynamic characterization of a rubber object is proven to be a difficult topic. In the search of improved rubber characterization new methods arise. The goal of this research is to provide a new approach for extracting material properties from the experimental impact method. Literature research is done on the rubber specific behaviour and how this affects the modelling approach. In the research itself both numerical and experimental characterization is used. Through impact testing the receptance of the rubber object is measured and by applying inverse substructuring the dynamic stiffness is obtained. The Finite Element model is used to directly obtain the dynamic stiffness. The numerical and experimental results are made comparable by applying the virtual point transformation method. With the finite element material model being the optimization variable, the numerical dynamic stiffness is optimized to match the experimental results. The rubber properties are obtained from the optimized material model. The presented inverse approach makes it possible to use the impact method for characterizing rubber material properties. It therefore broadens the abilities of impact testing used for rubber characterization. With the new method the drivingpoint properties can be predicted which do not depend on complex decoupling methods. The obtained material properties are material, but not geometry related. The findings can be used for different geometries of the same rubber. The new approach has the ability to significantly reduce experimental effort because the material properties can be extracted from one single loadcase, whereas the experimental should excite all loadcases to fully characterize the dynamic stiffness.","Rubber; Characterization; Impact testing; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this project we find that the likelihood of Sloterdijk, a place known for its transit node Sloterdijk Station and the nearby A10 ringroad-highway, becoming one of these poli-centers is high. But the A10 ringroad as a connecting factor between multiple new poli-centers will get a new meaning as well. The Western part of the ringroad will likely expand towards the A5, A9, A1 highway to reduce heavy transit within the city of Amsterdam. Could we in this case create a more approachable A10 highway, and what would that need? Looking at presidents of great European ringroads, like the Ringstrasse in Vienna, Boulevard de Marechaux in Paris, Boulevard Ring in Moscow but also the Binnenring of Amsterdam, we find that these places are full of green, approachable for pedestrians and cyclists, and with a great variety of cultural destination. In Amsterdam most of the cultural amenities are clustered within the old inner city. This results in a great pressure on the inner-city with overcrowding as a result. Sloterdijk has a few Cultural amenities on its own near the Sloterdijk station but these will have to relocate due to the envisioned future densification. Because of the need for cultural destinations at a renewed A10 ringroad, the solution became the clustering of these cultural amenities and the formalization of a multifunctional theater; a place for music, drama, pop-podia, movies and other means of performing art. Due to the fact that the project is based in the context of Amsterdam 2050, another question arose; what will the future of theater look like? Currently we can see the birth of new digital technologies that combine digital art with reality; Augmented Reality. Eventually these technologies could mean the addition of another production unit within the theater production team that we know. Digital attributes will become part of the story and the spectacle on the podium.

Coastal cities thrive on the basis of port economy; but also shrink significantly once the dominated industry recessed. Today, under the threat of climate change, port-dominated homogenous development becomes rather vulnerable to disturbances. Den Helder is the Wadden port-city encountering severest shrinking rate. It is particularly sensitive to environmental change and economic shift, regarding to coexistence of tidal ecosystem protection, maritime activities and rising flood risk. To facilitate reciprocal collaboration between ecosystem and economy, the project explores ‘Nature-Based Solutions’ as an integrated coastal zone management approach for interdisciplinary risk adaptation. In design fiction workshop, a catastrophic 2053 flood is fabricated to facilitate local imaginations on a more nature-based future. Qualitative narratives were structured into a prospective Building-with-Nature scenario, challenging the Business-as-Usual projective scenario. Through backcasting, an adaptive pathway for current shrinking Den Helder is proposed, comprising three strategic phases: utilize, guide and oppose according to risk index. The spatial design employs these strategies in two transformation cores: port-front residential and suburban agricultural polders. By reusing existing canal system to deliver tidal ecosystem services, this backbone synergizes a holistic regeneration that aligns to conserve-release-reorganize natural adaptive cycle. An integrated package is proposed, combining technical renovation of houses, de-polders and a PPP insurance model to incentivize participation and to share the risk. The project is concluded with an open-ended scheme in which shrinking is addressed as part of natural secession.

In combination with the price decrease for lithium-ion batteries the potential for storing PV generated energy in batteries has become more beneficial. However, the price for batteries is still a large part of the total investment of a PV system with home battery. Correct sizing of the home battery and PV installation is essential to reduce investment costs and as a result a decrease in payback time. Besides the correct sizing of the home battery and PV installation, these two parameters are also influenced when using an EV in the energy management system of the house. EVs have large batteries (thirty to hundred kWh) to give the EVs an extented driving range. The average EV owner does not use the full capacity of the battery on a regular day. The unused capacity of an EV battery has the potential to reduce the home battery capacity when used as a storage facility. To reduce the impact of the upcoming changes in house consumption, this thesis investigates load shifting in combination with a charged EV as addition to the house with integrated PV and battery. The results show that a charged EV can have a positive contribution to a house on grid energy autonomy, peak shaving capability and electricity cost.

(mentor); Veeneman, Wijnand (graduation committee); Walvius, Minze (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This research provides insight into coping with the appearance of dockless bicycle sharing systems (BSS) in a municipal context. Due to technological developments like GPS integration and smart locks, BSS evolved towards the latest development of dockless shared bicycles. Most BSS companies were from Asian origin and had a disruptive impact on cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the summer of 2017. The introduction of multiple bicycle sharing systems caused nuisance and raised questions about the added value for society of this new innovation in urban mobility. The goal of the study is exploring applicable and tangible governance options for municipalities to cooperate with or regulate operators and implement a BSS in their municipality. Important in this respect is the fit with the values of society to establish city objectives, but also to take into account the functionality of a dockless BSS. Dutch municipalities struggle to cope with BSS. They lack knowledge about the factors of influence in the systems. This is needed for considering regulation or acceptance of BSS by the public in general. Dockless BSS has proven to behave highly disruptive and this causes friction between public values and private interests. Therefore cities need means to evaluate and cope with BSS initiatives. Research concerning BSS and public values in a high-cyclists country context is also lacking, therefore the Netherlands as the geographical scope is an interesting addition to prior literature. Therefore the question that is raised in this research is: How can Dutch municipalities cope with the disruptive innovation of dockless bicycle sharing in order to resolve the conflicts between public and private values?The research method used consists of an extensive literature review. Which provided a theoretical foundation on the themes of sharing platforms, mobility and governance in relation to dockless bicycle sharing. It was found that present sharing schemes have a product-service economy appearance because no peer-to-peer element exists. The free-floating schemes provide more flexibility to the users towards the origin and destination of their trips in comparison to docking systems. In relation to governance, authorities have three main ways to govern: prohibit/enforce, pricing and soft regulation. These are used to develop coping measures in the design phase of governance strategies. Together with findings from subject-related meetings, the initial system overview is constructed, which clarified the causal relations between the pressure on public space in relation to the number of bicycles, utilization rates and a number of operators.These insights resulted in a list of topics to discuss with municipal experts in the field of BSS. Nine experts of municipalities throughout the Netherlands were interviewed. Data of a dockless operator and the private values of operators substantiated the findings of the interviews.Results of trip data indicated that the dockless system was for 85% used by inhabitants and that use during the day was highly similar to foreign BSS usage. From the interviews with municipalities, important public values were identified. Public values are the needs and wishes for the short and long term, pursued by authorities and can be abstract and operational. The conflicts between these public values and the private values are the problems of the municipality to cope with.Four dominant conflicts between public values and private values were identified: Public space (quality, control &amp; no commercialization). The public space (quality, control and no commercialization) is highly valued. Municipalities struggle to control the quality of public space without commercialization of this public space. The impact of BSS on this public domain can conflict quality requirements and enforcement of wrongly parked bicycles. Since operators try to maximize their freedom to use public space, this can provide conflicts.Additional costs for municipalities not be covered by inhabitants if a commercial company uses the public domain as their point of issue for their shared bicycles. If extra costs are made for parking spots or enforcement, it is considered unfair that the municipality covers these costs. Operators currently do not contribute to municipal expenses for enforcement of the wrongly parked bicycles.If a BSS is allowed in a municipality the public desires high quality of bicycles. Since there is limited space for the number of bicycles and operators, the present BSS needs to fulfil the quality requirements of potential users. The first systems introduced in the Dutch cities did not meet the standards of Dutch bicycles and the quality was therefore not sufficient in the eyes of potential users. The bicycle sharing schemes should add value in addition to the current mobility options. It should provide flexibility for the user, but also be useful in relation to public transport. The introduction of BSS is not automatically introduced in relation to public transport. In addition, train stations are often limited in parking space or forbidden for bicycles, therefore operators cannot use this space as a point of issue. The conflict exists in the balance between flexibility for the operator to provide a positive business-case and create a good service for users and become a desired addition to the current mobility options by authorities. The private values identified from an interview with a BSS operator and public hearings were: make a profit, limit company costs, maximize the number of users, maximize the number of bicycles, maximize freedom to use public space, limited openness to competitors and municipality, commercialization of public space and collection of user data. These values do provide conflicts with public values, therefore coping measures should be introduced to regulate the BSS market.Based on these conflicts sets of coping measures are designed per public value.Public space (Quality, control &amp; no commercialization): Determine minimal usage of a bicycle per day, Restrain commercialization of public space through legislation, Require accelerometers in the bicycles to identify fallen bicycles, Introduce a Universal logo for bicycle sharing, Require good behaviour incentives, Enforce geofences, Create incentives to have bicycles moving, Require a communication channel for all complaints, Ensure even spread of the bicycles and Require openness in trip data.Costs for the municipality: Arrange parking facilities for the period the number of bicycles in the city is higher, these costs for extra facilities can be calculated in permit fees or with other forms of contracts. In addition, make handling wrongly parked bicycles at least break even. This means that costs for removing wrongly parked bicycles should be paid by the operators. Quality of the bicycles: Establish quality standards and assessments before introduction, Ensure sustainability of the produced bicycles and monitor the quality performance during use.Mobility (Public transport addition &amp; flexibility): Allocate space for BSS near mobility hubs, for instance near public transport locations. Force integration of BSS with PT offer by making it part of a concession.This results in some recommendations: all issues of concern with respect to dockless BSS must be taken into account. Public values provide a good starting point to explore municipal needs. These objectives for the particular municipality can be defined upfront, so before operators are introduced. To guarantee integration with other modes of transport, postulate conditions for the addition to the present mobility system. To limit municipal costs, transaction costs for individual municipalities can be reduced by execution of certifications or share knowledge about operators and the systems at the national level. In addition, concrete enforcement should be explored. The actual implementation is subject to local context, the measures provided are therefore not one size fits all, but can be used as a set of options for municipalities. The analysis of public values in contrast to private values in order to find conflicts regarding the introduction of BSS proofed to be valuable for research like this. It can provide insights into the contribution to the mobility system in cities and possibly contribute to an alternative that can be offered to currently available personal mobility. The findings of this research are generalizable in the Dutch context. Dutch municipalities of various sizes and regions were interviewed for this study. During interviews, a lot of similar issues were presented by the interviewees, which lead to the saturation of answers. Besides, foreign cities can benefit from the insights if similar public values conflict with private values. Constraints in time and resources limit the number of municipalities that could be taken into account for this research. The researcher was also dependent on experts that are willing to talk about the subject. Further research should conduct on gaining better insight in usability patterns of users, this requires openness of data by the operators.","Product-service economy; Public values; Dockless bicycle sharing systems; Smart mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

The usage of LiDAR allows for the fast collections of massive data sets. The AHN2 point cloud data set, part of Rijkswaterstaats initiative to map the surface of the Netherlands, contains 639 478 217 460 points. For efficient visualization in web viewers, these massive point clouds are stored in an octree data structure. Visualization through this method has the downside of discretely visualizing the point cloud. These discrete artefacts are referred to as density jumps, and are visible where there is a boundary between blocks retrieved from the octree. These blocks contain different densities because they are retrieved from different levels of the octree. This thesis proposes a continuous visualization method for massive point cloud data sets that aims to eliminate these density jumps. While the continuous visualization of vector data sets has been extensively researched, this is a novel field of research for point cloud data sets. This thesis explores the feasibility of a vario-scale visualization method, and aims to implement it in an existing web viewer architecture. Due to the massive nature of the AHN2 data set, cloud computing and distributed computing techniques are used to imrove the workflow. The presented methodology removes the \textit{density jumps} by determining an upper density bound for the point cloud density relative to the camera position. Circle packing theory is used to reinforce the upper bound continuously, thus removing artefacts created by discrete density jumps. A proof-of-concept for this theory is implemented in an existing point cloud web viewer architecture.","point cloud; vario-scale; visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

These can be acquired with use of the Finite Element Method. Previously investigated finite element models of the lumbar intervertebral disc have been designed with the main purpose of understanding the biomechanics of the disc itself, and not necessarily its influence on other spinal elements. A change in disc biomechanics is hypothesised to cause a disruption in the surrounding structures such as the vertebrae which, in turn,<br/>could result in lower back pain. Goal: To create a finite element model of a spinal unit for investigating mechanical influences of the disc onto its adjacent vertebrae. Assessment was performed by examining bone adaptation as a result from simulated disc generation. Methods: A MATLAB script was written to assemble an input file of a parametric model to be used for finite element analyses in Abaqus/CAE. The model was validated with experimental data from literature. A bone adaptation algorithm was used to assess a change in bone material properties before and after simulating disc degeneration by adjusting disc material properties. Results: Finite element analyses showed how a load was transferred by the disc and how bone consequently adapted in response to simulated disc degeneration. The overall trabecular structure was observed to become softer, especially in the vertebral core, while the structure inferior to the anulus became relatively stiffer. Conclusions: Visualisation of bone adaptation after simulating disc degeneration supports the hypothesis that disrupted disc biomechanics indeed affect bone configuration in the adjacent vertebrae.","FEM; intervertebral disc; biomechanics; spine; vertebrae; bone adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms (ML) and its techniques e.g. ‘deep learning’, enable the machine to develop creative content on its own (John, 2016). Meanwhile, in the design domain, people have already begun to consider artificial intelligence as new design material (Holmquist &amp; Erik, 2017). One can consider it an intelligent design material as it can include creativity as individual machine learning models.To understand this new paradigm of using AI in the design process, I created a speculative prototype of a design toolkit called objectResponder (v1.0). A toolkit which enables to design and prototype from the perspective of AI in the ‘wild’(Rogers &amp; Marshall, 2017). I explored this toolkit with six professional designers from various discipline. Initial results suggested that looking at the world from the perspective of the AI may enable designers to balance human and nonhuman biases, enrich a designer’s understanding of the context, and open up unexpected directions for idea generation. The results from the study initiate my graduation project with — identifying what designers need, their concerns and challenges while working with Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning projects. In my thorough investigation with professional designers and design students, I learned that there is a gap in comprehending Artificial intelligence technology in design practice. Such as, designers struggle to incorporate these technologies into their products and services due to the complex nature of it. It was also evident in the literature study that, designers’ need to understand the underpinning principle e.g. limitations of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (Dove, Halskov, Forlizzi, &amp; Zimmerman, 2017). Designers’ currently working with Artificial intelligence technologies mentioned that they are looking for a tool or prototyping toolkit which integrates AI with embodied ideation and rapid prototyping methods.To understand the state-of-the-art of AI, a literature study was conducted with the exploration of various ML technologies and prototyping tools. The purpose of this literature study was to understand the state-of-the-art AI and its current state. In this literature studies, I encountered some initial prototypes of tools that showed the possibilities of Artificial intelligence intervening into the design process. Meanwhile, technology exploration with various AI and ML tools and platforms allowed me to learn some facet of current AI and ML tools and ML platforms and perceive its limitations. From this observation, I designed three varied computer vision enabled experiments. Designers from various expertise have participated in the experiments. They were asked to follow the idea generation process with and without an AI’s Computer Vision technique (Machine perspective). Based on designers’ feedback about the experience of working with a designed speculative prototype, I propose a design toolkit called ‘object responder v2.0’ — with further advancement in it.","Design for Interaction; Human-Computer Interaction; Artificial Intelligence and Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Well-being for all can be achieved through designing with the focus on Consumer Wisdom. Consumer Wisdom is defined as the pursuit of well-being for oneself and for others through mindful management of consumption-related choices and behaviours. The theory gives insights on providing consumers with products or services that enrich life with well-being for all (Luchs &amp; Mick, 2018). The Consumer Wisdom theory was researched from a consumer perspective by Luchs and Mick (2018) and through a literature study the theory was transformed into a design strategy. Various design theories relate to wisdom, although they do not call it wisdom nor mention it. From these theories existing design directions were added to the 6 dimensions of the Consumer Wisdom theory to provide designers with the information to use the theory into practice. To cluster all the theories addressing wisdom into one tool is unique. Study 2 generated proposed design categories for the established design direction to gain insights on how to design for Consumer Wisdom. These 48 design categories were found through a categorisation task done by my supervision team and me with the use of 135 product and service examples. Merging all the information of study 1, 2 and research on existing design tools, developed three design tool concepts. The ideation was done through the use of a brainstorm session on the format of the tool and by using the ‘HOW-TO’ method. The best concept was chosen with the use of the Plus-Minus-Interesting matrix and the C-Box methods.Before evaluating the tool an iterated on the concept was done. A brainstorm session helped to evaluate the design tools visibility and feasibility. The evaluation showed that the provided examples were necessary to understand the theory. The design categories directed the focus on and helped to design easier for a certain design direction. The final tool is the Consumer Wisdom design tool consisting of a card set to design with. The set consists of: an informative card, dimensions cards, design category cards, design purpose cards and an instruction manual. The tool helps designers use and understand Consumer Wisdom in their design process. In the future the final tool should be tested with design students and design professional to validate its usability, feasibility and visibility.","Design Tool; Well-being; Consumer wisdom; Design strategy; Consumer behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Sometimes, they have to wait several months for their next visit. Therefore, patients often turn to online platforms where they can ask questions to other patients or healthcare professionals, namely health-based social networks. These platforms are managed by a small group of volunteers, cardiologists, who seek to inform patients in order to make efficient use of the limited time at the hospital. However, it is expected that the number of cardiac patients on these networks will increase due to overall growth of the number of Dutch cardiac patients and the recent trend of searching health information on the internet. Hence, it remains the question whether health-based social networks can scale up with this development. To investigate the sustainability of health-based social networks, user posts from the Dutch social platform Hart Volgers and American social platform DailyStrength were analysed. The results show that the number of patients on these platforms grows rapidly, and they reveal that users prefer to contact cardiologists instead of fellow patients. These findings suggest that there is an urgent need for new solutions that keep these platforms future-proof. To address this problem, Harthulp is proposed, a smart question-and-answer platform for cardiac patients to provide better and more efficient aftercare. Harthulp introduces a question wizard that enables patients to quickly find information on the platform, so that it is not always necessary to ask a question to a healthcare professional and to wait for a reply. As a core component of the question wizard, a novel search engine has been developed which employs a deep learning model that captures the semantics of words on health-based social networks. In this way, patients can search with short questions and retrieve relevant posts while they may not contain the exact same words. It has been demonstrated that the proposed search engine significantly outperforms traditional search engines when retrieving relevant question-and-answer posts from Hart Volgers. A web interface has been designed to show how all components can be embedded in a single user-centered design. This design has been evaluated together with an experienced cardiologist.","Deep Learning; health-based social networks; cardiovascular disease; Information Retrieval","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-15","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Due to the complex and inhomogeneous nature of the landfill systems modelling is an essential part of understanding the process and predicting the behaviour of the emissions in the future. To model the mass balance an estimate of the precipitation is needed which can be retrieved from two datasets; rain gauges and the precipitation radar. The precipitation radar dataset has a higher resolution and might provide another, and maybe better, estimate for the modelling of the landfills. To see whether this is the case first a comparison for the daily scale is made, second a statistical analysis is performed to determine the difference in distributions between the datasets and third the datasets are compared as a result of the model of the landfills. The results of these comparisons and test show that the radar precipitation data gives a more accurate estimation on a daily basis but the trend in rainfall between the radar precipitation and the automatic rain gauge system is similar.

Like many other countries, the Dutch government also shifted towards ageing in place policies to reduce the costs of institutionalised care settings. Ageing in place is aimed at allowing the elderly to live independently and stay part of the community. Therefore, policies and services are increasingly aimed at supporting the elderly in ‘place’, where ‘place’ consists of the dwelling and its surrounding environment. However, the current ‘place’ may not always be the best option for the elderly to receive care and support in order to age in place. The playing field of housing and care has made a significant transition since the decentralisation of the General Act on Exceptional Medical Expenses. Due to the changes in national policy and legislation, the binary perspective on housing for the elderly, in the conventional market or traditional institutions, has been expanded to include a potential spectrum of housing models to age in place. By disconnecting supportive functions, such as housing, care and welfare, from the traditional institutions, a new playing field has arisen for housing models to age in place between the traditional family home and the traditional institutions. Furthermore, public and individual responsibilities have shifted. The municipality has been given the responsibility to develop a strategy on ageing in place and the elderly have become responsible for choosing a 'suitable' place to age. However, municipalities, elderly and other stakeholders have their own perspective on the definition of a suitable ‘place’ to age, therefore municipalities, elderly and stakeholders have their ‘own language’ with regard to housing models to age in place. This leads to a so-called ‘dialogue of the deaf’ during the process of development and realisation of housing models to age in place. The new playing field of housing and care grants the opportunity to develop new supportive ‘places’. In order to provide supportive ‘place’ for the elderly, municipalities are able to proactively facilitate stakeholders in the development and realisation of housing models to age in place. This study offers an instrument that supports the coordination task of Dutch municipalities in order to develop and realise housing models to age in place.The basic functioning of the framework is as follows. The combination of the residential object and the variables in the inter- and external dimension reflect what a housing model to age in place entails. Within each variable, several options or combination of options are available to define the variable, where the prerequisites can be predefined options that need to be included in the model when developing a new housing model to age in place. The diverse variables are able to ‘build’ a variety of housing models within the new spectrum of ageing in place, therefore the variables are labelled as building blocks. Based on this study, three applications of the framework have been defined in order to support the coordination task of Dutch municipalities in order to develop and realise housing models to age in place.The first application of the framework is focussed on structurally collecting data on preferences of the elderly on local scale in relation to housing models to age in place. The framework can be used as a tool to gather data of the preferences of the elderly in relation to housing models to age in place. Findings based on the data collected on the preferences of the elderly in relation to housing models to age in place can be used to define prerequisites, which can be taken into account when developing a housing model to age in place. By exposing the demand for housing models to age in place through the use of the framework, the municipality is provided with data that can be used for both housing and ageing in place policy. The second application of the framework is aimed at creating a frame of reference for municipalities on housing models to age in place. Currently, the new spectrum of ageing in place is mostly unexplored and therefore municipalities have an incomplete frame of reference on housing models to age in place within their municipality borders. Therefore, the framework can be used to enhance the frame of reference on housing models to age in place by analysing existing housing models within municipality borders. The framework offers a ‘template’ for municipalities to structurally organise information on existing housing models to age in place.The final application of the framework focuses on the guidance of stakeholders in relation to the discussion on what a supportive ‘place’ is for the elderly. The framework provides a starting point for ‘shared language’ on housing models to age in place in order to guide the dialogue between stakeholders involved with the development of housing models to age in place. The framework can be used as a guidance in order to break the ‘dialogue of the deaf’ that frequently occurs between stakeholders during the development of housing models to age in place. This application of the framework can be compared to a structured interview with the same questions asked in the same order each interview. In this case, the same building blocks are discussed in the same order each consultation round between stakeholders. Through repeating the process the occurrence of the ‘dialogue of the deaf’ will decrease. The research presents several recommendations. One of the recommendations is focused on bridging the domains of different stakeholders. It became apparent that stakeholders within the playing field of housing and care think too ‘compartmentalised’. While the framework offers an instrument to bridge the domains, it still requires a cultural change to bridge the domains. This means that the stakeholders have to show ‘entrepreneurship and guts’ to successfully develop new housing models to age in place. The municipality will have to take a proactive and facilitating role in order to stimulate stakeholders to ‘look over their own fence’.","Ageing in place; Housing pathways; Housing models; Framework; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

One of the techniques used for Super Resolution Microscopy is Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). For this method, a sample is labeled using fluorophores (fluorescent proteins or dyes), and each individual fluorophore is imaged individually. The fluorophores can be localized with a precision much higher than the diffraction limit, since the localization precision is only limited by the amount of photons collected. By combining the localizations of all the fluorophores, the complete object can be reconstructed with resolution higher than the diffraction limit. To achieve a high localization precision, a model for the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the microscope is required. The PSF describes how the microscope distorts the image of the fluorophore. This model is used to estimate the fluorophore location in the sample. This means the model needs to be very accurate and unbiased. Furthermore, because an experiment contains hundred of thousands of images and the model needs to be evaluated multiple times per localization, the model also needs to be fast to evaluate. Traditional fitters model the PSF with a Gaussian approximation. However, more recent studies showed the errors introduced by this approximation. More accurate models have been introduced, such as C-Spline based approximations. These C-Splines require over a million spline coefficients, and therefore lots of calibration data. In this research, it is investigated if Simplex B-Splines can be used to better approximate the PSF. Simplex B-Splines consist of multiple B-Splines defined on a triangulation of simplices. This allows for a very flexible model structure and high accuracy using a relatively low number of parameters. Most applications assume the PSF is constant over the field of view. However, due to varying aberrations or refractive index mismatches the PSF actually changes with the fluorophore position in the field of view. If these changes in the PSF are not corrected for, the precision is reduced or a significant bias is introduced. B-splines allow the model to be extended to higher dimensions, and can therefore also model these changes to the PSF. Different metrics are used to compare models. Using a statistical (chi squared) test the model quality can be assessed. Localization precision is verified by implementing the model in a MLE algorithm, and by showing that the standard deviation reaches the theoretical lower bound for precision, the CRLB.<br/>In this research it is shown that the performance of B-Spline models is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but uses 144 times fewer spline coefficients. Furthermore, the B-Splines were also successfully extended to higher dimensions, to reduce the effect of a varying PSF.","PSF; B-Spline; SMLM; Localization Microscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

For this study, 8 riders descended over 6 trials using a ‘sensor bike’. As part of this particular study, a novel brake sensor is developed and validated in practice. The sensor package can be transferred between bicycles, allowing each rider to use his own bicycle. Results of the exploration study indicate that for the chosen descent, braking and cornering skills are not decisive for overall time over the descent. However, significant time differences are found for the corner which is analysed. Time difference reported over this corner are approximately one second. With a shortest cornering time of 10.14 seconds this is a significant difference. The brake behaviour of theWorld Tour cyclists could be split into two distinct braking strategies: • ’stop brake late’ ( where braking is stopped late and well into the turn). • ’stop brake early’ (where braking is stopped before or early in the turn). It was found in this study that the best brake strategy is ’stop brake late’. The peak brake forces measured during the descent are much lower than the maximum brake forces reported in literature. This implies, that performance can still be improved by increasing brake forces at the first part of the braking action, so the braking can start later. The results found in this study can contribute to optimise braking and cornering skills of riders by explaining and showing where improvements can be found. An additional result is that the brake sensor revealed unexpected brake rub at certain parts of the descent, especially when riders are accelerating. Eliminating this brake rub, can improve rider performance. The riders also shows clear signs of learning behaviour as can be observed in the obtained data. For future research it is recommended to add a speed sensor to the sensor package. Recommended small improvements for the brake sensor are identified. Using this improved sensor package, trials could be rehearsed on a steeper descent, such that pedalling actions have less influence, exploring braking and cornering strategies further.","Cycling; Braking; descent; descending; sensor; brake rub; learning behavior; Braking points","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The flexible floating island consists of many smaller identical triangles connected by springs. This design is convenient for installation, disassembly, and diversification of functions. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and analyze the forces acting on and motions of the flexible floating islands due to the interaction with regular waves; a numerical model is an excellent way to complete that mission. The floating islands in waves that are constrained with mooring lines have translational and rotational motions under the combined effect of hydrodynamic, hydrostatic, gravitational and mooring forces. The approach for solving the forces starts with linear potential theory, which means that uncompressed inviscid flow is assumed. After marking out the identical smaller panels on the wetted surfaces of each small triangle, the interface conditions between the triangle and the fluid are satisfied, thereby obtaining the source strength for each panel. With the expressions for the potentials, all the hydrodynamic coefficients including added mass, damping and wave exciting forces can be evaluated. Finally, the response of islands can be evaluated by using the equations of motions of the island in the time domain and converting them to the frequency domain. Two models are created in this thesis, a single island model and a two-island model, the former focuses on learning the methods for solving the hydromechanics coefficients, and the latter focuses on the hydrodynamic interaction between the two islands.","hydromechanics; potential theory; hydrodynamic interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fundamentally, decisions about food consumption rest with the customer, and although they are the largest stakeholder group in the food system, they are not adequately equipped to consider the environmental impact of their choices at the time of purchase. The Water-Energy-Food Nexus is a useful perspective to analyse and communicate emissions along the production system, supply chain and consumption context of food. Through the lens of the Nexus, this study investigates the LCA methodology as a mechanism to provide local consumers with useful information about permanent decrease of upstream water and energy availability and associated impacts of restaurant meals. A simplified ‘farm-to-fork’ LCA assessment was carried out for 12 popular meals that were frequently offered in the Dutch city of Leiden and could be grouped into the four categories red meat-based, poultry-based, fish-based and vegetarian. The ReCiPe and Cumulative Energy Demand impact assessments were applied to identify poultry-based meals with the highest water depletion potential and cumulative energy demand. This surprising result was found to be driven by the large proportion of starch ingredients in the recipes and the absence of significant amounts of starch ingredients in the Red Meat-based meals. The findings revealed a directly proportional relationship between refrigerated storage duration and both assessed impact categories. Normalization of meals per weight significantly reduced the range of impact scores across meals and the normalization of impact categories highlighted the disproportionately large effect of ‘freshwater eutrophication’ cause by beef cultivation. The results of the study provide high-level insight for policy-makers, businesses and consumers. The comprehensive metrics in this study are useful for communicating complex environmental impacts with consumers and supporting their decision-making process in favour of less environmentally impactful option. For businesses, a challenge arises from the disproportionately high impacts associated to inexpensive ingredients such as potatoes. Policy-makers are encouraged to further regulate maximum shelf-life durations and thereby curb energy demand for cold storage. In the context of the Water-Food-Energy Nexus, it was found that the study results support integrated measures that allow consumers to make more informed decisions, businesses to shift to low-impact ingredients without an economic disadvantage and policy-makers to stimulate more rigorous and feasible management of impacts along the food system.","LCA; food supply chain; Nexus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Individuals and organizations are simultaneously becoming more aware and active in this domain of healthy workplaces. To make an actual improvement within the work environment to reduce stress, a stronger knowledge base is required than is currently present. In this research, the relation between the workplace and stress is further investigated. The main research question is: “How can insights in the relation between workplace and activity on employee stress be used to develop a real estate decision-making model?” Research method: By conduction an operational-empirical research, the research questions are investigated. The operations research develops a model that can be used by real estate managers in the process of forming accommodation strategies. The empirical research is needed to form the required input for the operational model. This input is the quantified correlations between stress and the work environment. To obtain the input, a method is developed based on structured observations, using a smart wearable device to get a bio-metric for stress through sensor data.<br/>Goals and objectives: The goal of the research is to help employees reduce their stress within the work environment. To scope the goal, the research will focus on the knowledge base on the correlation between stress and the workplace. The objectives of the research are to provide a tool in the form of an operational model for Real Estate Managers to help reduce stress, by getting a better understanding of the relation between workplace and stress.<br/>Key findings and conclusion: The developed method of using a smart ring in combination with a structured observation design resulted in a feasible method for doing stress measurments in the work environment. The outcomes of the stress measurements can be operationalized into a real estate decision-making model, but the usability of the model output is still to be reaserched. Current findings mainly support existing findings from literature, with a main focus on the importance of privacy and control as a factor in the forming of stress. Due to the non-random nature of employee workplace choices, it is not possible to expect findings on all possible workplace characteristics. Future research with an increased sample size or based on intervention testing with the developed method could improve the creation of insights in the relation of stress in the work environment.","Corporate Real Estate Management; Stress; Workplace; Burn outs; Health; Work Environment; Smart Tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The gas is mainly delivered through pipelines, but is increasingly shipped overseas by liquefying it to LNG at -162 degrees Celcius. Fluids, containing free surfaces inside ships are likely to start sloshing, as ships move on waves. These fluids induce impact loading on the walls of the tanks. These impacts induce amplified motions in the tanks membranes in the order of millimeters to centimeters,resulting in permanent deformation that could exceed acceptable risk levels. In the industry one case of plastic deformation in the corrugated membranes of the LNG tanks was observed (Gavory and de Seze, 2009), but leakage was prevented. A growing desire for understanding sloshing behaviour raised and action was taken under the name of SLOHEL a JIP. Full scale experiments have been carried out. For investigating detailed structural response on the effect of Fluid-Structure Interaction on a prediction of the plastic deformation of a Mark III membrane, subjected to a local wave impact, a numerical application was carried out. In this thesis, the experiments became input for a numerical Fluid-Structure Interaction model, that is strong two-way coupled. The structural response of a local wave impact is analysed using LS Dyna. Two-way|coupled and one-way|uncoupled results are compared. The pressures of the fluid model have been validated after making simplifications and are within a range of ±10% compared to measured results of the SLOSHEL experiments for an wave impact velocity of 7 m/s. In the simulations three high pressure stages are identified on an impact between two corrugations. First, initial impact. Thereafter, lower corrugation impact ending with upper corrugation impact. At stage 3 large deformations were found in the foam layer behind the stainless steel membrane and for higher impact velocities also in the corrugated membrane. Uncoupled simulations, in which the structure is considered as rigid for the fluid solver, but is able to respond flexible in the structural solver, were performed. In coupled simulations, a full interactive model is considered in which pressures update as a result of structural displacements. This results in dry frequencies for uncoupled simulations and wet frequencies for coupled simulations. It was found that pressures in uncoupled simulations are in often higher. Displacements in the foam show for all cases higher displacements (10-25%) for uncoupled simulations. The plastic strains in the corrugated membrane are higher for high impact velocities (50-100%) for uncoupled simulations. The significance of accounting coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction increases when deformations become non-linear. For this specific case, when yield stress of the corrugations in the membrane is exceeded id est when plastic strain occurs, uncoupled simulations are not able to obtain accurate predictions in structural response.","Fluid Structure Interaction; Local wave impact; Sloshing; FEM analysis; CFD model; SLING","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-11","","","","","SLING",""

The assignment was to design a science based methodology for the creation of SRFACE wetsuits. The current design process is still almost entirely based on trial and error. A product designer draws seam lines on a 2D body outline, based on his knowledge about fit, insulation and performance. The production company creates and grades the pattern based on this design. A sample is made and adjusted based on the feedback of customers. This report investigates the opportunities of modern day technologies such as 3D body scanning to generate a new methodology. In the analysis phase the different stakeholders are assessed together with the current methodology. This resulted in a redefinition of the problem. The production company handles the creation and grading of the patterns based on the 2D design of SRFACE. This design is open for interpretation which results in a time and cost consuming optimization phase. Furthermore the anthropometry of the customers is unknown to both SRFACE and the production company. The sizing is therefore based on the sizing of other wetsuit brands. The feedback of the customers is the only input for improving the fit of the different sizes. The analysis phase resulted in the following main goals for the new methodology. It should incorporate:<br/>The creation and grading of wetsuit patterns Design for fit approach with the use of 3D body scans Digital prototyping Research was performed into the anthropometry for the creation of a sizing chart. The 3D body scan database CAESAR has been used as representation of European population. The scans of more than 1800 individuals have been filtered and classified into sizing groups using the height and chest circumference. In this process a new method is proposed for the creation of a new sizing system using the DINED Ellipse tool. This resulted in the creation of digital mannequins that represent average body types for every wetsuit size. These mannequins were then used as basis for the creation and testing of wetsuit patterns. The current SRFACE wetsuit pattern and materials were digitized and simulated in pattern design software Clo3D. The tightness during static and dynamic fit were assessed and used as reference for future wetsuit design. A new workflow is investigated that uses 3D digital pattern drawing with the 3D mannequins as basis. The resulting pattern was optimized using the stress and strain simulations and graded. A prototype is created of the base pattern to validate the design workflow. As a result a new methodology is proposed that incorporates a 3D wetsuit design workflow and digital prototyping. This new methodology gives SRFACE more control in optimization and reduces the amount of physical prototyping. Assessment of the prototype has shown that the new methodology is able to produce feasible pattern designs with a good fit. But further optimization is required. Using this methodology over time will increase its accuracy and build on gained knowledge. Multiple prototypes are still required but will decrease over time.","Wetsuit; 3D scanning; Sizing; Pattern creation; Methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-01","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In order to do so, they not only want to improve their core business but also wants to engage their residents with a more sustainable lifestyle. They adopted the method of ‘De Verborgen Impact’ which includes a train-the-trainer process that trains leading residents, so-called peers, to motivate their fellow residents for a (more) sustainable lifestyle. This led to the key objective for this project: “Design a fitting intervention that peers can use to motivate residents of Wooninc., so that they feel activated to make their lifestyles (more) sustainable.”ApproachBy exploring the design brief and using the designers’ Personal Principles for Good Design the Transition Design method was chosen as the main driver for this design process to understand the project within a broader system context. In addition, the 1:10:100 scheduling technique was applied to allow rapid iterations and to create a concept that is successful and supported by each of the stakeholders. Research &amp; findingsBy conducting four iterative cycles insight in behavioural change was gained from literature and interviews. This resulted in insight in how to reverse internal and external barriers into levers that can be used to support residents in the transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle. This led to the development of the ‘Sustainable Transition’- framework. Which incorporates relevant theories found in literature and maps seven leverage points to inspire for transition towards sustainable behaviour. Based on this framework concept development happened iterative from preliminary vision to the final concept of ‘Onze Verborgen Impact’ Transition Program and Transition Toolkit. The ‘Sustainable Transition’ - framework indicates that to engage residents, as well as peers on their intrinsic motivation all the dimensions of a personal transition should be supported including: motivation and ability, personal values and their position in the process of change. Based on this framework a vision for the final concept was developed: “Making sustainability transparent and accessible (lower the external barriers) by emphasizing the positive side and the advantages of sustainable behaviour (reversing internal barriers). To show that sustainability, in different ways, is accessible for everyone.” The ‘Onze Verborgen Impact’ Transition ProgramTesting prototypes with peers and residents, showed that this concept should not predefine how the peers encounter their fellow residents in their neighborhoods but should enable peers to create their personal approach. This led to the final concept, a transition program called ‘Onze Verborgen Impact’. This program exists out of different elements: - Train: training of the peers by experts- Create: supported by experts peers create their personal approach with which they want to involve residents- Join: residents can participate in the local initiatives set-up by the peers and explore sustainability in their own phase. - Impact: the structure of the program makes it possible to bring new ideas that are generated for improving sustainability at neighborhood level to a higher level - Transition Toolkit: a toolkit with instruments to support the above-mentioned elements such as: three training templates, different recruitment materials and a ‘Mijn Verborgen Impact’ - booklet to support peers and residents in their personal sustainability journey. The final concept taps into the intrinsic motivation of peers by recognizing their personal ideas and creates favourable neighborhood initiatives where residents can experience and discover the benefits of sustainability in their own pace.","Intrinsic transition; Sustainability; Behaviour change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Currently, DP capability plots are used to indicate whether an operation can be performed, but this is based on static calculations and it does not consider the offsets that are found due to motions of the vessel, while the offsets can be critical in case a structure is present or if a certain accuracy of a station keeping operation is necessary. Currently, to determine the offsets of a vessel on DP, the system is modelled using a time domain approach. Multiple simulation runs are carried out to calculate the expected extreme offsets in a given time interval, which is known as the most probable maximum offset (MPM offset). This is a complex and time consuming process and therefore it is not always done in practice before an operation starts. In this research, a method is developed to estimate the surge MPM offsets of a vessel on DP due to the wave drift forces using a frequency domain approach, as this can lead to faster estimates. But two problems are faced: The first is that there is no mathematical model available describing a vessel on DP which can be used to accurately calculate the offsets in the frequency domain. The second problem is that there is no known relation between the offsets and the extreme behaviour, which leads to the MPM offsets. To find the MPM offsets, first of all a one-dimensional time domain model of a vessel on DP is made, considering only the surge degree of freedom. Next, to determine the surge offset response using a frequency domain approach, the differential equations of the system are linearised, which gives the transfer functions from the environmental forces to the surge offsets. This is used to estimate the surge offset response in the frequency domain. The accuracy of this method is determined by comparing the root mean square value (RMS) and the zero up crossing period to that of the time domain results. Then, two alternative methods are developed to calculate the MPM offsets from the surge offset response characteristics directly. The methods use the RMS and zero up crossing period of the surge offsets calculated in the frequency domain, to determine the extreme behaviour statistically without the use of multiple simulation runs. Using the linearised model of the vessel on DP, it is found that the surge offset response can be calculated within an accuracy of 4% of the results generated by the time domain simulations, based on the root mean square value and the zero crossing period. Therefore, an accurate estimate of the surge offsets is found using a frequency domain approach. Both alternative MPM offset calculation methods, using the surge offset results of the linearised model, give MPM offset estimates within approximately 10% of the results of the time domain simulation approach. Taking into account the strong variability found in the MPM offsets calculated by the time domain approach, the estimates from the frequency domain approach are regarded as good estimates. <br/>It is concluded that the methods developed in this research can lead to faster and therefore timely MPM offset estimates to use for the safety and accuracy of operations. This can improve the way of working for many offshore operations where often no use is made of MPM offset estimates due to the disadvantages of the methods currently used in practice. It is recommended to extend the method developed in this research to three degrees of freedom, such that it can be implemented in practice.","Footprint; Dynamic Positioning; Frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Participatory Value Evaluation, PVE, is a method of evaluating citizens preference targeted towards public projects and their budget. For instance, PVE can measure the preference of citizens when allocating alternative infrastructure projects with a set budgetA gap in knowledge is found in the decision-making process of the method. The validity of participatory value evaluation is potentially affected by cognitive bias effects such as framing. The main question of this research is: Is there a measurable difference in outcome of the decision-making process between emphasis-framed alternatives within the participatory value evaluation method? The used method is a between-subject design, laboratory experiment. Three versions of the same basic PVE are constructed. A control version with neutral descriptions of the potential projects, and two framed versions through the structure of one-sided emphasis framing. A convenience sample of 181 participants is used, with each version of the PVE receiving roughly 60 participants. The three versions of the PVE were kept exactly the same with exception of the framed descriptions. A difference between the groups is shown to be significant on a project level in six out of six tested projects. Concluded is that, in general, emphasis-framing has an effect on the decision-making in PVE. The effect of framing is argued to have a limitation. When participants feel strongly about a certain topic, the frame influences the outcome less, this is known as issue importance. Recommendations to further research are made, as a method for mitigating the influence within PVE can be researched. The impact of overall presentation of different projects, in terms of framing with images, or extensive project descriptions, can be researched. Expert interviews were conducted, to gain insight in how the PVE method is perceived by policy-makers. The overall consensus is that PVE is a useful method of involving citizens. The PVE can be used by policy-makers as an advisory tool. Framing within PVE, is unwanted when testing the preferences of the citizens. However, it might be useful to emphasise the importance of certain projects. Therefore, it is argued that the use of framing should be an ethical consideration.","Decision-making; Framing; Participatory Value Evaluation; Emphasis Framing; Participatory Budgeting; Willingness to Pay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To accelerate the adoption of wind energy and thereby the energy transition, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) has to be minimized. Apart from increasing turbine performance, reducing turbine down-time can contribute to lowering the LCOE.Down-time is defined as time during which a windturbine is not able to generate energy due to being put in a parked configuration. This occurs when a windturbine has failed or an alarm has went off and the turbine is awaiting inspection. Gearbox failures are identified as main drivers for down-time.Computer vision is an emerging inspection technique in industry that is able to continuously monitor various processes. It is therefore interesting to investigate the integration of computer vision with windturbine gearbox with the aim of reducing down-time. In this research, quality checks and online condition monitoring of a windturbine gearbox are established as fields that are suitable for computer vision integration. This is narrowed down to gear alignment checks and online pitting detection, respectively. The main contribution of this thesis is two-fold. First, a method based on computer vision is proposed that is able to check and measure gear alignment using a simple 2D camera integrated in the gearbox and thus without 3D range imaging. Furthermore, the method reconstructs a virtual gear tooth and provides a direct comparison with gear alignment simulations. This provides a time-efficient and objective measure, enabling gear alignment checks to be included in quality checks of serial produced gearboxes. Second, a novel method for online pitting detection is proposed based on Deep-Learning. The method is tested on pitting damage generated with a test-rig and it is shown that Deep-Learning based pitting detection has great potential. Moreover, computer vision based condition monitoring would be insensitive to load and speed variation which is the deficiency of current state of the art condition monitoring techniques.","Wind Energy; Wind Turbine; Gearbox; computer vision; Pose estimation; Deep Learning; Object detection; Damage detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The other three approaches are designed using Oracle Spatial and Graph. From the latter three, one approach utilizes linked data stored in a local database while the rest utilize relational data mapped into linked-data. All five approaches are assessed for GeoSPARQL compliance and are compared to a QGIS solution. From the aforementioned approaches, only the two mapping ones have achieved the desired solution.

However, until there is no agreement on what degree of sensor accuracy is acceptable, the sensor data quality should be validated before governmental bodies use it as input for decision-making (Lewis2017).<br/><br/>This research proposes a method to assess and improve the data quality of low-cost air quality sensors measuring Particulate Matter (PM). To answer the research question ""How can accuracy and precision of Particulate Matter measurement results from a low-cost outdoor sensor network be improved by using a correction model, using data from reference sensors and additional sensors measuring inferencing phenomena?"" an experiment setup with sensors operating under real-world conditions is applied. <br/><br/>Two low-cost sensor nodes, both containing a microcontroller, two low-cost PM sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor, are placed at two locations in the city of Rotterdam. At those two locations, they are placed next to a high-quality air quality monitoring station from the environmental agency of Rotterdam. These monitoring stations provide benchmark data for the low-cost sensor nodes. A third data source provides data on air pressure and wind speed for the whole city of Rotterdam.<br/><br/>The data that originates from both sensor nodes and monitoring stations are matched and correlated with each other. Subsequently, the measurements from the low-cost sensor nodes are evaluated. Correlations and cross inferences of PM with other independent variables such as humidity, ambient temperature, wind speed and air pressure are investigated. Thereafter, utilizing the Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression method, various correction models are created that take various combinations of external variables into account. The correction models vary with respect to the amount of included external environmental variables and the polynomial degree. From all those possible correction models, the best correction model per location is selected by evaluating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the corrected dataset.<br/><br/>Consequently, the results of the chosen correction model are validated. It is found that the best performing correction models are those that include only the original PM data and the effect of adding more independent variables is limited. The best correction models for the four low-cost PM sensors are able to decrease the RMSE of the observations: the original normalized RMSE ranged from 0.0918 to 0.1249, while the corrected normalized RMSE range from 0.03110 to 0.03759. So, it is possible to improve the data quality of low-cost PM sensors with the stepwise MLR method and setup as shown in this research. However, including parameters for independent variables humidity, temperature, air pressure or wind speed does not improve the data quality significantly. <br/><br/>Besides, when an extra sensor node is placed in an air quality monitoring network as described in this research, it is necessary to create a correction model for that specific sensor. Like Castell (2017) and Mukherjee (2017) also found, it is necessary to calibrate each individual low-cost sensor before adding it to an air quality measuring network of the type as described in this research. Namely, it is found that for each low-cost PM sensor in the network different correction models are created.","particulate matter; air quality; data quality; low-cost sensors; correction model; multiple linear regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","51.891133, 4.480802"

It applies the field of automatic design generation to a step in Vuyk’s design process to save time and easily explore alternatives. First the general design process at Vuyk and the design of the engine room and other machinery spaces in particular are investigated. This is followed by a review of literature on design of machinery spaces, both in maritime applications in ships and in non-maritime process plant lay-out design, to compare theory and practice at Vuyk and look for new insights. Next to the design process itself, the characteristics of ship concept design tools are investigated in literature, leading to a focus on concept exploration and various methods how to deal multiple objectives. This results in the design requirements for the design tool for machinery space arrangements and a focus on the most relevant requirements to consider in the limited time frame of this thesis, to limit the scope. The best modelling method and resolution approach for the problem are investigated. The Facility Layout Problem and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm are identified as the best options. The model is defined accordingly. The capabilities of the model for the design tool are tested in a concept design of a jackup vessel. Initial runs of the model led to problems for the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, as its gets stuck in local minima while trying to solve the problem. This severely limits the solutions diversity. Several adaptations for the model are developed to overcome this problem. The particle swarm algorithm is adapted with several mutations, allowing it to better escape the local minima thus creating more diverse, better optimized solutions. The model is also improved with an additional grouping constrained and a pathing filter to better account for the identified machinery space design drivers. The resulting tool is applied in a case study on the early concept design phase for a dredge pump room and connected engine room for a trailing suction hopper dredger. The tool is used to evaluate early design choices in space arrangements for a diesel-direct drive of the dredging pump and jet pump, in comparison to alternative diesel-electric solutions with three V16 diesel-generator-sets, four V12 sets or six V8 generator sets. The application of the tool leads to valuable insights for the arrangement options for the machinery spaces. The developed tool is shown to be a useful addition to the early concept design of machiney space arrangement.","Early Stage Ship Design; Engine room; Particle Swarm Optimization; Facility Layout Problem; Machinery Arrangement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The potential growth and broad application of the AI technology has great economic benefits however also severe societal implications. Simultaneously, ethical challenges arise with its development. Questions of values and ethics are becoming urgent, as systems can be negatively biased and the decision processes are often not traceable, while impacting our lives. Abstract concepts such as fairness and values need to find their way into the fast and agile AI development processes. The contemporary (research and practice) fields tackle these challenges by technological feats, ethical AI principles and strategies. However, it are the decisions made by humans today and tomorrow that will shape our future. It is, therefore, alarming the translation of ethics to that day to day work of the AI development team is missing. Hence, the central aim of this thesis is to explore and design support for AI teams with the creation of more ethical AI systems, bridging the gap between ethical AI principles and current practice. By that, design for organizational capacity for the development of fairer AI by using strategic design and critical design approaches. In this thesis, due to the diversity and magnitude of ethical challenges in AI, particular attention is paid to two challenges, fairness and value-alignment, to benefit from a design perspective. Three streams of expertise are brought together to tackle these challenges: AI, applied ethics and design. Ethics bears critique, and this thesis argues that it can benefit from a design perspective, using imagination in the solution space and synthesized thinking for implementable ideas instead of solely discussion. The thesis focuses on ways how design approaches can supplement the ethical ones and thereby stimulate the ethical uptake in the AI field. Instead of defining what fairness is, this thesis takes a novel approach in unraveling ten unfairness sources in the AI development. It is aspired to reduce these sources of unfairness in AI, in project specific fashion. In AI practice, the ways ethics is incorporated and how value tensions are resolved is under-researched. In depth interviews, generative tools and provotypes are conducted and designed to research and critique the contemporary AI field in relation to ethics, both with IBM and their clients. Simultaneously to inquire novel value tensions in its development. Five main value tensions are unraveled in its relation to fairness. All above is consolidated a framework to design for organizational capacity and team support leading to the creation of fairer and value-aligned AI systems. With this framework an organizational role is designed, the ethical coach, to aid the AI team with cocreating fairer and value-aligned AI systems with an accompanying modular toolkit. The modular toolkit is iterated upon multiple times and uses the AI dish metaphor. Finally, two evaluation sessions with IBM and their clients as well as the conversations concerning of the implementation of the toolkit led to recommendations for further development including education and implementation directions.","Strategic Design; Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Critical Design; Fairness; Value tension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

One method of applying this is by using Physical Vapor Deposition, which can be done by using multiple jets. In this process jets next to each other interact. This paper's main aim is to investigate the interaction effect of two rarefied two-dimensional vapor jets in vacuum and how this is influenced by the distance between jets and inlet density. Furthermore, the analytical solution for the collisionless case for a single jet is extended to dual jets. Additionally, the objective is to maximize the processing speed for the use of coating, with a certain uniformity for the parameters researched in this paper and finding an optimal method in doing so. This study is done by using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. <br/>The analytical solution gave the same results as the collisionless DSMC method for both single and dual jets. Simulations with a strong interaction effect resulted in a shock. These behaved similar compared to three-dimensional jets, in the plane of the jets. The shock results in a secondary jet, which has a lower density in the middle. The interaction effect depends primarily on the inlet density. Multiple regimes are observed for different inlet density ranging from small change in properties to a shock wave, with a transitional regime inbetween. The influence of the distance between the jets is found to result in a higher density at the axis of the inlet behind the shock, for bigger distance between jets. However, for very small distances between jets compared to the inlet size the shock is weak. For the optimization, it resulted in the conclusion that the optimal coating in general is applied with the smallest distance between jets. This generally gives a better uniform coating and increased performance. However, this is not always the case when constraining the distance between the jets and sheet, as it only holds if the shock between the jets for this distance. Furthermore, an approximation is found for the optimization, which results in fewer simulations needed.","Vapour deposition; DSMC; OpenFOAM","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Thereby turning the focus on the artificiality of the boulevard instead of on the natural landscape of the beach and the ocean. Multiple methods and instruments were used to conduct this research, such as finding the components that form the boulevard on the larger scale as well as looking at the clubs on an individual level by dissecting each club separately to be able to interpret them as logics of the escapes. Deriving from this research is the position that I have taken where I find it a shame that the focus is put on the artificiality of the boulevard instead of giving the natural landscape of the coastline the leading role. Thereby my aim is to redirect this focus towards the ocean, to open up the borders of the clubs and to tackle the exclusivity of the boulevard, creating a gradual transition from boulevard to the beach that is freely accessible for anyone. This will eventually lead to the creation of an urban park landscape, reappropriated by local governments. To achieve this goal a method is applied that uses existing, mostly vacant, structures of five different clubs and merges them together into a new project, using their architectural characteristics as a quality within the new design. By doing so, I am tackling the issues that I have found right at its core and use them to turn it into the exact opposite. Three design strategies were applied as a tool in creating the new project: using contrasts between the solid geometric architectural implementations versus the unpredictable organic forms of the natural landscape to complement the beauty of one another, creating different experiences and sensations in the way you view the ocean and finally create a journey that takes you through different materiality and compositions of spaces, creating an exciting spatial sequence that keeps you curious about what is to come next. As a result a project is created that alternates indoor and outdoor spaces, open and enclosed spaces, with multiple attraction elements that direct your focus towards the ocean. Developing a flow of experiences within a public park landscape that allows for multiple appropriations and uses, where people interact with the architecture as well as interact with each other.

According to the three pillar of Industrial design engineering the research was divided into the three macro areas of: People, Business and Technology. The people linked with the holter monitor system investigated during several activities including Interviews were 14 elderly patients, one General practitioner, one cardiologist and two nurses. Furthermore, to dive deeper into the experience I underwent a 24 hour holter monitor experience. The magnitude of the cardio healthcare business side was explored by the analysis of the main Healthcare trends. In addition, special attention was given to Cardioline’s past innovations and some guidelines for future innovations were outlined. The technology side was also investigated. The Scope of the technology analysis was to understand the current state of the art of ECG technology and its related evolution over the years. <br/>There was a special focus on the transition from the current situation to the mobile health and to why biosensors are preferred to the standard holter monitor. To close the technological part, a perceptual map was made in order to compare the Cardioline product with its competitors. The perceptual map was also used to decide on the transition from the current product to the future product. All the data collected during the analysis phase was collected in a list of requirements composed of demands (hard requirements) and wishes (soft requirements). Afterwards a brainstorm session was run taking into account some of the main problem revealed.

In European countries, buildings are responsible for 40-45% of energy consumption, leading to significant amounts of CO2 emissions. The implementation of reusable structures lead to less waste and harmful emissions to the environment. The main purpose of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the use of a new type of demountable shear connectors, resin injected bolts, in steel-concrete composite structures through push-out tests. Steel-concrete composite structures are commonly used in flooring systems of offices, car parks and bridge decks throughout the world. The most widely used shear connectors are welded headed studs. Even though they are inexpensive and extended research has been conducted about their application, welded headed studs do not allow for the demountability and reusability of the structural components. An innovative type of shear connector consists of a coupler and a bolt which are embedded in the prefabricated concrete deck. The assembly of the concrete deck with the flange of the steel section which has oversized holes is achieved through resin injected bolts. Resin injected bolts are bolts in which the cavity formed by the clearance between the bolt and the hole is filled up with resin. Large hole clearances allow for fabrication tolerances and lead to a faster execution. Push-out tests were conducted in the laboratory in order to examine resin injected bolts in terms of shear capacity, stiffness and ductility. Two different test configurations were created, one with resin injected bolts and the other one with reinforced resin injected bolts. For each configuration three specimens were tested which were nominally identical, one was loaded until failure using displacement control and the other two were loaded initially in force-controlled load cycles and then until failure. The results obtained from the experiments are compared with the results from researches conducted on other types of demountable shear connectors. FEA models were developed with the same geometry, materials and loading as in experiments using the ABAQUS software and push-out test were performed in order to check the validity of the experimental work. In addition, a parametric study was conducted using FEA in order to evaluate the influence of certain parameters on shear resistance and stiffness. The parameters considered are: the concrete strength class, the bolt diameter, the bolt strength class, the embedded bolt height, the hole diameter of the steel section, the effect of the L-angle profile and the injection material.","Injected bolted connection; Composite structures; Steel; concrete; Demountable structures; Push-out tests; Finite Element Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

However, given the fact that these FWMAVs have been recently developed, their flight dynamics have not yet been fully explained. In this paper we will develop local time-averaged longitudinal grey-box models based on closed-loop system identification techniques, where free-flight experimental data, obtained from the DelFly Nimble, is used to estimate and validate the local grey-box models. With these models we can take the first steps towards fully understanding the flight dynamics of tailless FWMAVs. The consequence of the tailless configuration is inherent instability and therefore tailless FWMAVs are generally more complex, compared to its tailed counterpart, and require a active feedback control system. The active feedback control system introduces additional challenges to the system identification process since it follows that feedback control works against the objectives of system identification. Dynamic effects that play a major role when studying the dynamic behaviour of FWMAVs are the sub-flap and the flap cycle-averaged effects. However, in this paper, we are only interested in modelling the flap cycle-averaged (time-averaged) effects of the DelFly Nimble. Based on this approach, grey-box models were estimated and validated for airspeeds near hover condition 0 m/s, up to 1.0 m/s forward flight.

Concept exploration are hereby required to improve the understanding of the design problem and identify its challenge as well as possible solutions. However, it is always difficult to generate the technically-feasible design solutions while still satisfying multiple and potentially conflicting performance criteria for the polar expedition cruise ship. There are currently two ways of optimizing the concept design: manual optimization and computer-optimization. The computer-based optimization, such as the Packing Approach developed by TU Delft, can semi-/automatically generate a set of design solutions. After the generation of these design solutions which are unknown in many performance behaviors, it is necessary to post-process them and increase the quality of those designs created from both optimization methods. Design rationale is an effective way to serve as qualitative metrics in post-processing the configuration layouts of the concept designs. However, the ambiguity and potential conflicting aspects within the design rationale are difficult to handle by the current post-processing method while fuzzy logic theory can be utilized to cope with the design problems involving subjective and ambiguity. Hence, it is proposed to develop a new methodology to better post-process the concept design of a polar expedition cruise ship.","ship design; fuzzy logic theory; cruise ship; early stage design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Within the existing soda-lime glass recycling industry it is not possible to use recycled borosilicate glass due to its higher melting temperatures and a difference in chemical composition. In fact, borosilicate glass disturbs the recycling process of soda-lime glass, resulting in more unused waste. Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that has favourable properties for application in the built environment, such as high optical qualities and a low thermal expansion coefficient. However, due to its high melting temperature and high energy consumption it is much more expensive to produce compared to the more common soda-lime glass. Nevertheless, in general it is possible to recycle glass waste almost 1:1, therefore, it is a waste to dump such high-quality glass on landfills. Cost and energy consumption issues related to the fabrication of borosilicate glass can be decreased by using recycled crushed glass (cullet) to the melt. Cullet reduces the required melting temperature, resulting in a lower energy consumption and a cheaper production process. However, a fully closed borosilicate glass recycling loop is not possible. The current borosilicate glass product industry has very strict quality control. Recycling glass introduces contaminations in the glass melt, which could generate flaws and cracks in the end product. This means it is not feasible to use recycled glass in these industries. This research proposes a promising approach to tackle the borosilicate glass waste problem and the recycling issues related to contamination: using the collected borosilicate glass waste to produce cast glass components. The bulkiness of such a component allows for a higher amount of impurities without risk of failure and a decrease in quality. In addition, cast glass allows for self-supporting facade systems in many configurations due to their increased cross-section and high-compressive strength capability. To allow disassembly of such a cast glass facade system a dry-interlocking system is proposed. Such a system can ‘close’ the recycling loop of borosilicate glass by feeding in waste glass from traditional borosilicate products into a new cast glass recycling loop. The challenges and opportunities regarding recycling borosilicate glass were researched by conducting experiments. Several mixtures of borosilicate glass with different chemical compositions were cast into small specimens to assess the mixability and corresponding mechanical properties of recycled borosilicate glass. In terms of mixability, good results were observed when the cullet is ground to powder, although there is a risk of contamination during grinding and thus degrading quality. Using fine cullet is also promising, but there is an increased risk of internal stresses. Specimens with a homogeneous chemical composition showed that it is possible to create borosilicate glass components with a lower firing temperature. In addition, these homogeneous specimens illustrated through a three-point bending test that recycled borosilicate glass has comparable mechanical properties to non-recycled borosilicate glass. This indicates that recycled borosilicate glass is suitable for application in cast glass components for use in the built environment. Due to time constraints and the preliminary nature of this research the number of specimens was relatively small. This thesis presents a dry-interlocking cast glass component system applied in a case study. The case study concerning the existing Casa da Música is meant to illustrate the possibilities of applying high-quality glass in an aesthetically pleasing facade system and to showcase the possibilities of recycling borosilicate glass. At the end-of-life of this design the facade can be disassembled. The components can either be directly reused in another building or recycled again. The proposed solution can reduce the growing amount of glass waste.","Borosilicate glass; Cast glass; Dry-interlocking; Recycling; Dry assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

The Eurocode model for the shear capacity of prestressed concrete beams with sufficient shear reinforcement was found to be very conservative for small amounts of transverse reinforcement, which is typical for old bridges. Code provisions based on the modified compression field theory appear to be much more accurate (Bentz, Vecchio, &amp; Collins,2006). On the other hand, these models make no distinction between flexural shear and shear tension failure, while 25% of the bridges consists of T-, I-, or box beams which are sensitive to shear tension failure. The aim of this thesis is to present a more accurate prediction for shear tension failure based on the modified compression field theory (MCFT). The report focuses on both the CSA-model and Response-2000. The CSA-model is a simplification of the MCFT for beams under the assumption that σ_z=0. The CSA-model shear resistance consists of a concrete and steel part. Response-2000 is a cross-sectional analysis program that works as a non-linear finite element analysis and not only takes into account bending but also shear.Response analysis of 32 beams (experiments of Xie (Xie, 2009), Choulli (Choulli, 2005), Hanson (Hanson &amp; Hulbos, 1965) and Leonhardt (Leonhardt, Koch, &amp; Rostasy, 1973)) have been made and compared with the experimental observations. The failure load is predicted with a mean ratio of 1.38 and a COV of 19% compared to the experiments. It was found that for small a/d-ratios predictions are more conservative. Failure mechanisms: rupture of the stirrups, crushing of the web concrete and slipping/major crack opening are found in Response. 87% of the failure mechanisms was predicted correctly compared to the experiments. The critical cross-section compared with the experimentally observed failure zone showed that 60% of the beams was predicted in the failure zone. The shear force in the cross section is resisted by reinforcement steel, aggregate interlock and the uncracked concrete, which were found to take up respectively 1/2, 1/6 and 1/3 of the shear force. The steel part is predicted accurately while the aggregate interlock part is underpredicted due to an over prediction of the crack spacing. The uncracked part is overpredicted for small amounts of reinforcement and underpredicted for larger amounts of reinforcement. The data of the Response analysis have been used to modify the CSA-model to a model solely describing shear tension failure. The comparison showed that the CSA-model underestimates the steel part, overestimates the concrete part, takes a to large cracked height and doesn't take into account the contribution of the uncracked part. From this comparison, modifications for β,θ,V_max,h_crack and ϵ_x are proposed using Response data and proposals from Esfandiari (Esfandiari &amp; Adebar, 2009). The flanges are taken as uncracked and the contribution of the uncracked part is described with a linear elastic shear stress distribution. This has led to a proposal for a model that solely describes shear tension failure, where the most important addition is the contribution of the uncracked height. Calculations show that the model gives conservative predictions compared to the experiments (mean ratio of 1.36 and a COV 22%) and the predictions are almost the same as for Response. The parameters are predicted conservative compared to the Response-2000 predictions.","Shear Failure; Shear Tension Crack; Modified compression field theory; MCFT; Response-2000","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The intermittent nature of the wind power resource calls for novel approaches to supply and demand management, as well as power quality assurance. Energy storage technologies allow for the separation between power generation and power supply to the grid. The energy and power densities, efficiency and response times of secondary batteries make them highly suitable for utility scale application to wind farms. However, a knowledge gap exists on exact configurations of battery energy storage systems for wind farms within the existing power markets. This study proposes a hybrid power plant approach, combining an onshore wind farm with a battery energy storage system. Literature research identifies balance between power obligation and production as a main design criterium, along with the profitability of a configuration and operational strategy. A technical analysis establishes power fluctuation on multiple time scales as relevant wind power characteristics, and maximum depth of discharge, discharge rates and efficiency as important battery parameters. A detailed analysis of the Dutch power market structure identifies three accessible markets for trade: the Day Ahead Market, the primary reserve (FCR) and the secondary reserve (aFRR). For modelling and optimization purposes, FCR is not considered due to excessive uncertainties regarding bid acceptance and bid activation. The design phase of the study is charged with finding the optimal battery capacity for a given wind farm production, while assuring the obligation to the Day Ahead Market is met. A linear optimization model is developed with the objective to maximize the obtained revenue. It is shown that the optimal battery capacity scales with the power capacity of the wind farm. For a 60 MW wind farm, the optimal battery capacity lies within the range of 60 – 80 MWh. An operational model is designed based on the model of the plant established in the design phase, elaborated with a Model Predictive Control approach. Based on wind power generation forecasts, the algorithm is able to adjust the charge/discharge and imbalance settlement strategy continuously based on expected market price series. However, the low level of accuracy of the applied market price approximations lead to unprofitable results in all simulated cases. Market price approximations with increased accuracy, as well as reduction of battery installation costs may lead to profitable operation of a hybrid power plant.","Wind Energy; Batteries; Optimization; Modelling; Wind Farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

This instability might also occur in household connections due to the higher temperature, longer residence time, and the possibility of mixing with contaminated water from the household. However, chlorination is not desired to be applied in the treatment process, especially in the Netherlands. Moreover, the Dutch future heating system will be replaced with a heat pump system where the temperature of the water will be estimated at around 40°C, as it is a comfortable temperature for showering. Whilst, the hot water supply system in current situation heats the water until around 60°C and then is combined with cold water until it reaches the comfortable temperature.

Transforming the mobility sector to zero-emission vehicles that consume renewable and low carbon fuels is necessary to reduce the impacts on climate change. Hydrogen powered electric vehicles, or Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), could make a significant contribution to reduce GHG-emissions and energy use in the transport sector. The current refuelling network for hydrogen vehicles is in its very early stages. The Cogeneration of Hydrogen,<br/>Heat and Power project (CH2P) aims to impact the sector with a more efficient solution for the growing hydrogen infrastructure. It does so by offering very efficient decentralized H2 refuelling stations. The goal of this project is to design a refuelling station that has the ability to refuel hydrogen vehicles and to charge electric vehicles. The onsite CH2P production system is based on SMR and SOFC technology. A thermodynamic model has been designed to size and optimize all the station components. This includes the compression, intercooling, storage, throttling, precooling and dispensing of hydrogen, and the storage and charging of power. Main messages to take away from this analysis are the following: CH2P as a decentralized production method is protable. For higher station utilization the NPV has the potential to increase further by 55 %. Cascade filling of vehicles reduces the total storage and energy demand, and greatly reduces the CAPEX of the station. The optimal configuration consisted only of 950 bar High Pressure Storages. By adding a battery to the station, the system can power five fast-chargers to charge BEVs. However, power production by CH2P is more expensive than grid power and the current electric system is not sufficient for coping with sudden power fluctuations.","SOFC; CH2P; Hydrogen; EV; HRS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (graduation committee); Tieleman, O.C. (graduation committee); Tsouvalas, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The Afsluitdijk will undergo major redevelopment. After more than 80 years, the structure is ready for an upgrade. One of the differences which face the engineers of today compared to the original designers is climate change as well as the strict flood safety standards of the 21st century. Climate change is the lead cause of the sea level rise, which results in several issues at the Afsluitdijk. First, higher water levels result in larger waves causing more damage and secondly the discharge complexes will have difficulty in the natural discharge of the IJsselmeer. These discharge complexes consist of several locks side by side with each two gates; A northern and a southern gate. When the water level is too high in the IJsselmeer the gates will open during low tide and the water naturally drains into the Waddenzee. However, with sea level rise the water level difference is less and the time gap is also shortened creating a shortage in drained volume. The discharge complexes at Den Oever and Kornwerderzand are therefore redesigned with extra locks and pumping stations. The scope of this thesis concerns the new designs of the northern gates at Den Oever in the original discharge sluices. The concrete structure of the sluice will not be altered and is not part of the scope. The flood safety has become a lot more complex in the last 80 years. According to the safety standard, the Afsluitdijk should be able to withstand a storm with a return period of 10.000 years, which is the highest in the country except for a dike segment close to a nuclear power plant. The result is that the gates have to withstand waves of. However, it was found by Hofland (2015) that these largest waves with the highest water levels were not governing. Waves with water levels lower than an overhanging structure were much more violent. This overhanging structure is now redundant, and it is decided to be removed for the new gates. However, it is still interesting how these impulsive forces can be calculated and predicted. In order to find an alternative to model tests when encountering such a problem with an overhanging structure, a numerical method has been developed in this thesis. The method is based on the notion from Wood and Peregrine (1996), which directly calculates pressure impulse field. Their method is analytical and with the numerical alternative given in this thesis it has been made easier to adapt the boundaries and include gaps in the structure. The method is compared to the results of the model test executed by Hofland (2015). A problem arises when these impulsive wave forces impact a relatively thin plated structure such as the gate. The dynamic response of the gate can cause an amplification in the expected displacement and stress. The surrounding fluid creates an extra complexity to the problem. The current engineering practice to analyze the dynamic response in such a situation is based on a simplified quasi-static method by Kolkman (2007). This simplified method is based on a Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) of a single degree of freedom system incorporated with an extra hydrodynamic mass. A semi-analytical method derived by Tieleman (2015), that includes fluid-structure interaction has more potential to find a more realistic solution than the current engineering practice. The semi-analytical method still depends on a homogeneous isotropic thin-plate, but with the coupling of a finite element model (SCIA) the complexity of the design is theoretically limitless. This coupling is developed and numerically compared with the gate at the discharge sluice complex at Den Oever in this thesis. <br/>The semi-analytical method allows for a complete dynamic calculation in a relatively short time. This gives the opportunity to perform multiple calculations back-to-back. This has been exploited in this thesis by the development of a parametric model. This parametric model is based on the gate design in the Afsluitdijk and can find the most optimal designs regarding thickness and placement of the several elements in the structure by utilizing an optimization scheme. The optimization is based on a predefined post-analysis, which in this case concerns equivalent stress and stability. However, the possibilities are endless with possible addition many more failure mechanisms like fatigue. The model itself can be applied in a preliminary design phase where it gives the engineer more options while still incorporating the dynamic effect. It also helps to locate the more governing parameters, which is often difficult in a dynamic problem.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

The integration of data has to deal with: (1) spatio-temporal differences in sampling methodologies, meaning that observed objects are not the same and thus observed processes may stem from different sources; and (2) physical differences in the methodologies leading to different kinds of coordinate reference systems with possibly different datums. This makes integration of data challenging.In this thesis, we address one of the fundamental roots to this integration problem, by developing co-located reference points for multiple geodetic monitoring methods. This will ensure that, for multiple geodetic monitoring methods, one common deformation process is observed. This eliminates interpolation between observations. I show the main requirements for an Integrating Geodetic Reference Station (IGRS), present a design for a fully functional IGRS and describe its performance. Furthermore, the protocols for deployment and operational use are given. Benchmarks for InSAR, GNSS, levelling, LiDAR, and gravimetry are present on the IGRS. From field tests, it is found that presented radar reflectors have a 1-sigma measurement precision of &lt;0.5 mm in the Line-of-Sight of the radar. This includes both the structural stability as the influence due to clutter. Furthermore, it is shown that the GNSS antenna has mm precise performance, similar to standard monitoring GNSS set-ups.The developed IGRS can be deployed to create a local datum connection between datasets. Ideally IGRSs, either the design presented in this thesis or similar, are deployed where integration, validation and calibration of data, especially InSAR data, is needed.","GNSS; InSAR; Integration; IGRS; Integrated; Geodetic; Reference; Station","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The city environment, in this case, is Amsterdam; the dwelling is designed in the Jordaan. The location is chosen because this neighborhood has a low amount of biodiversity and inhabitants have difficult access to surroundings with a high amount of biodiversity. Ecology, a dynamic interaction between environmental factors, organisms, geography, and abiotic factors, is part of the integration of biodiversity in architecture. These subjects change the architecture of the prototype. Abiotic factors such as wind, sun, temperature, can affect the growth of the organism, but also influence the living conditions. The ecological flow and ecological management make influences on the ecology. Organism arrowing on nutrients and sunlight are the main ingredients to reach the purpose of the research. The use of a combination between quick growing and slow growing plants, trees, and mycelium in conjunction with an open construction is the concept of the design. This open construction made of not living natural organism stimulates the growth of the quick and slow growing plants, trees, and mycelium by stimulating the geography, for example, the air temperature and the quality of the nutrients in the ground. Whereas the ecological flow during the time secures the growth of the organism during the lifespan of the use of the construction, the ecological management by the human users is low. The growing organism slowly overtakes the human-made architecture, the surrounded city environment.","Amsterdam; biodiversity; city environment; dwelling; dynamic interaction; ecology; Jordaan; growing; nature; organism; prototype; sunlight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

We use an agent-based model (ABM) to research these problems and policies to alleviate them. We focus on two phenomena, being short-term holiday rentals of homes and a universal basic income. Short-term holiday rentals is a new peer-to-peer concept mostly involving web services such as AirBnb. Lately this has caused controversies among communities in touristic areas, since it contribute to increased housing prices and overall gentrification. We build on an existing ABM towards the city of Amsterdam and call it 'Gentaxelling Amsterdam'. Our model simulates residential migration based on income and house pricing. A municipal basic income experiment, which is sustained by the population, has been added. At the same time we research the effect of short-term holiday rentals by letting tourist agents visit the homes. Although this extra income may temporarily prevent displacement, it has an effect on the housing price. This is one of the first ABMs that has investigated this type of tourism. Empirical analysis has shown tourism has caused considerable changes in housing prices and population development. Basic income did not show any empirical results and asks for further study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

At their facility in Delft, the Netherlands, sustainable design has become increasingly important driven by customer demand. This led to several improvements of their power cables, such as the use of a recyclable plastic. These improvements are technical solutions for a problem in today’s product supply chain. In this thesis research, it is investigated if the sustainable design strategy of Prysmian Group Delft could go beyond these technical product improvements. After all, in order to decouple human consumption from the consumption and pollution of natural resources, we should focus on innovating socio-technical systems, rather than single products. A field of research which aims to support designers to contribute to these system innovations is Transition Design. Different Transition Design frameworks have been developed, but using them in commercial environment proves to be challenging. Therefore, in this research, it is explored how Transition Design theory could be adapted into a design method suitable for Prysmian Group Delft. This method should support the company to change their sustainable design strategy from making incremental improvements on their products to developing product systems that contribute to system innovation.Through an iterative process, in which interviews, creative workshops and design trials were used, insights were gathered on what this design method should look like. The resulting design method, named Product System Design Method (PSDM), integrates the system approach used in Transition Design into the design process of Prysmian Group Delft. In total, six variations to Prysmian’s design process were developed which increasingly address more system elements. Simultaneously, possible designs that follow from the PSDM were developed. Six illustrative designs, each representing one of the design processes, are presented in this research. In order to be of use for Prysmian Group Delft, it was argued that the PSDM should result in designs that do not only contribute to system innovation but also create value for Prysmian Group Delft. Therefore, the six illustrative designs were qualitatively analysed on to what extent the designs meet this requirement. This evaluation shows the designs that included more system elements do create more long-term benefits for Prysmian Group and make a bigger contribution to system innovation. However, their implementation also requires more changes at Prysmian Group Delft. Overall, it was concluded that the PSDM and the developed illustrative product system designs are a first step in the integration of system thinking into the design strategy of Prysmian Group Delft. However, given the current business strategy of Prysmian Group, the implementation of the PSDM and the illustrative product system designs is currently not expected.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

However, most people do not have financial plans. The lack of having such plans decreases the chance of these wishes and goals to be realised.Although the majority starts saving for their retirement above the age of 40, studies show that it is more beneficial to invest earlier in life. According to an analysis by the World Economic Forum (2018), delaying retirement savings by just five years, at age 27 instead of 22, results in a retirement account 18% smaller. Starting with savings later, even in higher amounts, rarely outperforms earlier savings with compounding interest. Encouraging young generations to long-term saving, even if for small amounts, provides opportunities to significantly improve retirement outcomes and anticipate the future of investment behaviour (World Economic Forum, 2017, 2018). The challenge, however, is to effectively engage young people, age 22 or younger, to participate in the first place. The selected target group are late adolescents between the ages of 16 to 18 with a Money Mindset of Controller or Future Planner based on their Financial Behaviour. This target group seems the best likely to adopt saving behaviour that enables young people to be better equipped for the far future before other pressing expenses hijack their willingness to retirement investment. There are currently 624.459 young people of age 16,17 and 18 in the Netherlands (CBS, 2018). According to the percentages above, 156.114 people should have the mindset of a Controller, and 103.035 of Future Planner. Together there will be 259.149 young people to motivate and engage with retirement investing. Based on the findings in this research, young people desire to either retire early at age 55, or fulfil their need for self-actualisation: living to one's full potential. What they need is having support in setting a realistic retirement age and income goals as well as professional, genuine advice from personal experiences. INFINITY is a far future exploration tool with the focus on increasing young people's awareness for the far future through motivation, engagement, reflection and perspective-taking. This is done with retirement experts, whose role are to support users in their needs. INFINITY is deliberately designed as light and playful tool; with a low threshold and game-like elements to trigger young people and make it easy for them to start exploring their far future (Eyal and Hoover, 2014; Fogg, 2009). The tool will gently guide users through several steps, called 'The Journey', based on The Path of Expression (Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012). The Path of Expression is a method that explains how the present (now) connects to the past and the future through memories and dreams. It describes the path as guiding awareness in ""steps of thinking of the present first, then the past, then looking for underlying layers, in order to move towards the future"" (Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012, pp. 55). The Journey triggers users throughout the product flow to perform small tasks and engage in conversation with their retirement expert. The design intends to have users reflect and explore other perspectives regarding retirement, instead of postponing it. The benefits of this showcase is its direct link to users. It includes the advantage for the company of shortcutting the current route, which is for clients to identify opportunities first and then pass it on to Yellowtail. Having a direct link enables the company to respond to user demand and present clients with innovative, user-oriented propositions quickly. This showcase also increase in the company’s knowledge about target groups with a thorough understanding of a new and young target group under the age of 25. The showcase includes users’ values, needs and wishes concerning the far future. It supports the company with developing differentiated, user-oriented value propositions. As for the clients, with this proposal they are able to increase the quality of the financial life of their consumers significantly and to be distinct and ahead of the competition. This user-driven showcase for a generation of savers represents an opportunity for any financial services company to renew and revitalise its brand. INFINITY is designed to motivate and engage young people for far future exploration and investment. It provides clients with the opportunity to connect with users and provide them with additional services and tools that further support their needs and wishes.","user behaviour; Financial services; financial behaviour; reflection; perspectives; money mindset; Chatbots","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is expected to increase the strength, the community and also the kampong as a whole. The project can grow incrementally land inwards if needed and wanted by the community. This is made possible by a modular and simple structure that can be assembled on the spot. Modularity follows the existing mind-set of the way of building in these settlements.

This thesis aims to determine whether it is possible to simulate the phreatic surface in a regional flood defence using a numerical model, which would make it possible to include these factors in the determination of the phreatic surface. Three MODFLOW models were constructed for research cases for which measurements of the phreatic surface were available. Considering the necessary simplifications needed to construct the models, the models simulate the head measurements with sufficient accuracy. However, this sufficient accuracy was only reached after extensive calibration of the model to the measurement set. Using the calibrated models several further analyses were carried out to determine what type of precipitation event causes the largest rise of the phreatic surface. Furthermore, some potential improvements of the schematisation of the phreatic surface were identified.","phreatic surface; regional flood defence; dike; Modflow; precipitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","51.966045396409314, 4.311745388438567"

Poor weather conditions, unscheduled aircraft maintenance and congested air spaces are just a few of the causes that prevent airlines from operating their flight schedules as planned. In the third quarter of 2017 over 20% of all scheduled flights in Europe suffered from delays. Operation Research based decision support systems (DSS) help airlines with their disruption management processes and provide suggestions for recovery options.<br/><br/>For large hub-and-spoke carriers, with an extensive network and a large number of aircraft and flights, the computation time required to find the optimal recovery solution after a disruption increases rapidly. As airlines require fast recovery solutions when disruptions occur, there is an ongoing trade-off between computation time and system sophistication. In the majority of disruption cases, no or a limited number of undisrupted aircraft are required to find the optimal recovery solution. By selecting a limited number of aircraft, flights and airports used to find a recovery solution, the computation time is reduced exponentially. The challenge is determining which aircraft and flights should be selected.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a decision support system for the schedule and aircraft recovery process that is able to present a feasible solution to a disruption in less than 120 seconds. An aircraft recovery model will be developed based on the integer linear programming model that was created by Vink et al. (2019) and Vos et al. (2015). Crew and passenger recovery are not considered. To recover disruptions, the optimization model can delay and cancel flights as well as perform tails swaps, where the flights from two aircraft are switched. The novelty of the work is that machine learning is used to predict which undisrupted aircraft will help recover a disruption. Based on those predictions a sub-network selection algorithm will select the subset of aircraft to be included in the optimization instead of the entire aircraft fleet.<br/><br/>The performance of the system is tested on a case study for the domestic hub-and-spoke network of Delta Airlines. The dataset for the study consists of 2200 daily flights, 147 airports and 827 aircraft in 8 aircraft families. The results of the system are compared with the optimal solution, where no aircraft selections were made. The case study shows that the system is able to make an aircraft selection where 50% of the fleet is discarded, while still finding the optimal solution in 98.9% of the 556 disruptions tested. Furthermore, the system reduces the computation time by 45%, resulting in an average time of 48 seconds. For the disruptions, the computation time varied between 9 and 180 seconds.","airline disruption management; aircraft recovery problem; machine learning; irregular airline operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Zero Emission Fuels is a company that is developing a system to convert carbon dioxide and water from the air into methanol, a liquid hydrocarbon fuel, using photovoltaic energy. The scale of the system is fit for a single solar PV panel. The desired methanol output is 25 grams per hour.<br/>In this work, a new design for the methanol synthesis reactor of the system is developed, built and experimentally characterized. Knowledge from work by Basarkar and Gutierrez on a previous prototype is used as the starting point. The focus of the new design is placed on the heat integration network, the natural circulation effects, and tilting of the reactor. The heat exchanger makes use of heat pipes to transfer heat. Natural circulation is increased by increasing the channel dimensions of the system. This led to an increase in mass flow rate of over 3000%, making the mass flow rate the limiting factor for reactor performance. The mass flow rate is roughly 800% higher than assumed in the design phase; the resulting energy flows are too high for the heat exchanger to work effectively. Nevertheless, the heat exchanger heating duty relative to total heating is 230% higher than Basarkar. Tilting the reactor 20 degrees reduced the mass flow rate by 46% to 0.41 g/s, improving almost all aspects of reactor performance. Productivity increased by 58% to 15.7 g/h; 182% higher than Basarkar, though the space time yield is lower (4.1 vs 6.8 mmol/gcat/h). The energy efficiency of the system is close to Basarkar at 36.5% (vs. 37.5%). It is clear from experimental correlations that reducing mass flow rate will increase productivity, energy efficiency and heat exchanger performance.<br/>By simulating the requirements for an autothermal reactor it is found that the catalyst bed dimensions should be increased in terms of diameter and length to increase to residence time in the catalyst bed. The results agree with the experimental conclusion that the mass flow rate should be reduced. Furthermore, it is recommended to heat the fluid by convection instead of conduction to ensure a more homogeneous temperature profile in the catalyst bed. Also, the heat exchanger should be expanded by adding more heat pipes and increasing the heat transfer surface area.","Methanol synthesis; Energy storage; Reactor design; Power to X","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Macular degeneration affects the macula, a central pit on the retina which is responsible for the highest visual acuity due to the densely packed cone photoreceptors. Symptoms of macular degeneration can vary in the early stage from blurred vision to abnormal dark adaptation (Jager et al., 2008) however in late stage macular degeneration symptoms can be much more invasive including partial and complete loss of the central vision. In order to cope with the loss of central vision patients could prescribe to what is called eccentric viewing. Eccentric viewing is a technique where the peripheral vision is used to see. Using eccentric viewing as a method to cope with macular degeneration requires, for optimal results, practice. This can be done through training. This project was originally aimed at designing a training method for eccentric viewing with the use of motivating game elements. By speaking to experts from Visio and Bartimeus as well as patients throughout the research phase it became apparent that eccentric viewing was not deemed necessary. Instead other problems were addressed which had a higher priority in solving. These problems include the lack of provided information after the official diagnosis, the attitude of the ophthalmologist during the diagnosis and the perceived gap between the diagnosis and the Low-Vision clinics. By creating a patient journey and examining the different problems that occur during that journey a choice was made to focus on a combination of the lack of information after the diagnosis and the gap between the diagnosis and the Low-Vision clinics. Six different topics of information were defined which play part in the lack of information. These six topics are: information about the condition, information about aids, make it easier, information about peer support, training / revalidation support and information about involved instances. Together these six topics cover most of the aspects surrounding macular degeneration. To convey this information to the target group a web-based medium is used. Due to the special target group guidelines have been defined which help in designing a website for visually impaired people. This has resulted in a framework where the necessary information can be placed in. Because of time restrictions one of the six topics which was defined was further developed. That topic is ‘Make it easier’. It resulted in a collection of tips from “experienced” macular degeneration patients on making Activities of Daily Living (ADL) easier to perform. In total 20 different tips were gathered through a brainstorm session, an online survey and telephone contact with Bartimeus. These tips were spread over three different themes: cooking, grocery shopping and public transport. Each tip was accompanied by an image, a descriptive text and a spoken quote. Finally an evaluation test has been conducted with two participants to verify whether the proposed design succeeded. The results from the evaluation show the potential success of the design but are not conclusive. Therefore further testing needs to be done with more participants over a longer period of time.","macular degeneration; information provision; patient journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a result, it is now possible to perform simulations for different magnitudes and directions of magnetic field, which are a handy tool for understanding the behaviour of conductance as a function of VG in real nanowires. The relation between energy and conductance has been researched. The size of helical gap is found to scale linearly with the Zeeman energy EZ, while other features of conductance scale nonlinearly","Electrostatics; Nanowire; Poisson equation; Nonlinear","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Hydrological modifications to the natural flow regime through the regulation of a river threaten the integrity of river ecosystems. In Myanmar, the exponentially growing hydropower sector poses a threat to the ecohydrology of some of the last large free-flowing rivers in the world. This study investigates to what extent the natural flow regime of the Myitnge in Myanmar has been hydrologically altered by the Yeywa dam, which is currently the largest hydropower dam in Myanmar. The study furthermore examines which ecological processes have been or could potentially be most affected by these hydrological modifications. This is done by modelling the natural flow regime of the dammed Myitnge river in Myanmar using the distributed hydrological rainfall-runoff Wflow\_sbm model, which consists of a set of python programs to perform hydrological simulations. The suitability of this model as a tool for environmental flow management in Myanmar is simultaneously investigated. The model uses PCRaster, which in turn makes use of a dynamic modelling language within a GIS framework. It was forced using static and dynamic data which is mostly globally available from different satellites, and derivatives of this, and calibrated and validated on data collected during field visits in 2018 as well as some secondary data sources. The field data collection focused on river bathymetry and soil properties such as infiltration capacity. Furthermore, scenarios were developed and simulated that varied in dam operational capacity (29\% and 80\%), reservoir management (for flood mitigation), and irrigation demand. Using modelled discharge results, multiple environmental flow assessments were carried out, comparing pre- and post-dam scenarios. The results demonstrated that different elements of the flow regime can be altered slightly depending on the Yeywa operational scenario. For the irrigation scenario, the high water uptake to meet the crop demand alters the magnitudes and duration to the largest extent of all the scenarios. According to the results, the dam alone does not alter most of the components of the natural flow regime (and hence presumably the associated ecological factors) to a very large extent, regardless of the capacity it is operated at. This is because the attainable operational capacity is limited by inflow: raising the capacity at which the dam is operated can only be done for a limited amount of time due to the extreme seasonality. For the current operation and in the simulated scenarios, habitat availability for different species of plants and animals, as well as the river's ability to structure the channel morphology are the elements most at risk due to the Yeywa dam. This is mostly because the occurrence of large floods has significantly reduced or completely disappeared from the flow regime, as also demonstrated by a habitat inundation analysis for the Myitnge. There is potential for the optimisation of the operation of the Yeywa reservoir, but it remains limited to the availability of inflows, which in turn is dependent on the natural seasonality and the size of the reservoir. Therefore, one of the main recommendations is to avoid keeping the outflow below the natural inflow in the dry season, and to run the turbines at maximum capacity during the monsoon period. This is advised in order to protect the downstream channel area from dewatering in the dry season, and to maximize the electricity generation during the wet season, while simultaneously keeping the released discharge very close to the natural flow regime.","Ecohydrology; Environmental flows; Hydrology; Ecology; Myanmar; Hydrodams; Hydropower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","21.835730, 96.082532"

Pickup functions are used to predict the amount of sand that can be eroded by a flow with certain parameters. The most common functions that are used have been validated to data in the low velocity regime (θ &lt; 1). However, modern day dredging processes are in the high velocity erosion regime (θ &gt; 1).An example of such a function is the widely used pickup function of Van Rijn (1984). It predicts the pickup of grains well at low flow velocities, but overestimates pickup at high flow velocities.Recently Bisschop (2018) has performed erosion experiments at high flow velocities. In 2015 Boskalis performed experiments in the same velocity regime during a preliminary study, however, a different setup was used. It was found that there is a large (factor 2) discrepancy between the two studies.The present study has performed experiments with a setup similar to that of Van Rijn (1984), however, the flow velocity was not limited to the low velocity regime. Erosion tests were done with bed shear stresses up to 60 Pa (θ&lt;30). The setup in question uses a sediment lift to push a prepared sand bed up into the flow.The determination of the bed shear stress was questionable in preliminary study of Boskalis. Since it is a very important parameter in erosion predictions, it was a focus of the present study to determine the bed shear stress accurately. The bed shear stress was determined with three different methods which all agree within an acceptable range (up to 8%).The erosion velocity is determined by measuring the lift velocity, which is equal to the erosion velocity when the top of the sand bed is level with the floor of the setup. Whether the top of the sand bed is level or not has been determined with the use of a high speed camera.The produced data has been compared to existing data and pickup functions of other studies. From this comparison it is clear that no existing functions match the data of the present study.In the present study an analysis is done to find out why the new data does not match existing functions. Also, based on several existing functions, a new function is presented that has a good fit with the data of the present study.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Feeling connected is still important for people living with dementia. They may suffer from disabilities caused by their disease, losing their memory and ability to make decisions, but there are also things that are not likely to be affected by dementia. A person with dementia stays capable of feeling negative emotions, like fear and pain, and positive emotions, like interest and happiness. Therefore, it is important to contribute to feelings of connectedness, to support emotional well-being. <br/>My framework on connectedness identifies that, based on universal human needs, connectedness can be divided into three types: social, personal and physical connectedness. Fulfilling one or more of the human needs related to a type of connectedness, leads to an increased feeling of being socially, personally or physically connected. People with moderate to severe dementia living in a nursing home, spend of their time in static environments every day. This means that they are surrounded by static objects and non-responsive, apathetic fellow residents. These static environments cause people to become apathetic or restless, which negatively impacts all three types of connectedness and hereby decreases emotional well-being. As the moments where people spend time in static environments happen when care givers are busy with their caring duties, I envision to offer something for these moments that can be used by a resident without the help of care givers and can be used individually, without the need for fellow residents. Therefore, this project focusses on the individual side of connectedness: personal and physical connectedness. The goal is to design a playful product that enables moments of physical and personal connectedness for people in the mid to late stages of dementia, to support emotional well-being in static nursing home environments. To guide the design process, the following interaction vision was created: the interaction should feel like playing with a ladybug: proactive, lively, explorative, enchanting, subtle and open-ended. In an iterative design process, multiple idea directions were explored, and a concept was developed through the creation and evaluation of several prototypes. This resulted in the final concept: Twinkle., Twinkle consists of a sphere, with an interactive dynamic light inside of it. This light can move across the surface of the sphere to proactively try to attract the attention of residents and trigger the curiosity in them to initiate interaction. When an interaction is started, the behavior of the light will change depending on the actions of the user. This way, it allows the user to explore the possibilities of the object. This way, Twinkle provides both cognitive and sensory stimulation to enhance personal and physical connectedness and thereby support emotional well-being for people living with moderate to severe dementia to bring back the twinkle in their eyes.","Dementia; Connectedness; Well-being; Design for connectedness; Quality of Life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The project entailed the design of a temporary community centre in the earthquake-damaged historic town centre of L’Aquila, Italy. The underlying social concept was focused on participation of the local population in the construction of the community centre. The design includes a grid-like timber shell structure, built-up out of a repetition of only two main structural and light-weight elements: the members and the joints.<br/>The load-bearing structure of this architectural design formed the basis for this graduation thesis, which is aimed at its optimisation. The optimisation is carried out focused on many objectives, e.g. its weight, its environmental impact, its structural validity. The goal of this thesis can be summarised by the following research question. Given the architectural design, how can the main load-bearing structure be optimised for seismic contexts using parametric modelling, considering the following objectives: maximal demountability and structural simplicity, minimal material use, structural weight and environmental impact?<br/>An optimisation method has been chosen combining automated and manual processes, as this gives a high sense of control to the designer. Using computational and parametric modelling techniques (Rhino, Grasshopper and Karamba), a database comprising 10 836 different structural configurations has been generated with different geometries and materials. The database contains the generated outcomes to structural and environmental analyses for each of the structural configurations. The database entries have been ranked manually based on structural, architectural and social demands, resulting in a top 28 models. Having defined a ranked set of structural configurations, manual checks and iterations can take place. The first step is checking the global and local stability using proposed joint designs as input. The next step is checking the safety of the structure during seismic events using a response spectrum analysis. As the Top-1 design passed all analyses, no iterations were deemed necessary.<br/>In conclusion, with regard to the design, further structural optimisation could take place by reconsidering the shape of the structure. However, the process of automated database generation followed by manual exclusion, ranking and iterations give a great sense of control compared to automated optimisation alternatives. This optimisation process has proven to be very effective in finding a design that balances all objectives well.<br","Italy; Aquila; Earthquake; Architecture; Post-disaster; Engineering; Structural engineering; Seismic; Design; Community centre; Optimisation; Parametric design; Structural design; Structural optimization; Grasshopper","en","master thesis","","","","","","This is a follow-up thesis to a previous graduation project in 2018 at the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment: Opportunity in Chaos; Triggering revival of the damaged historic town centres of Italy: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:22a26531-6775-47dd-9fdd-de28d3bdcbb0","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","","42.348823452477504,13.39830103299414"

This loss of coast has a negative impact on the environment, local society and ecology. In general, shoreline retreat is caused by sea level rise (SLR) and erosion. The main objective of this research is to determine which factors are causing recession at Tasikoki beach and consequently which solution would be best in terms of mitigating coastline recession and protecting the hinterland from flooding. A Building with Nature (BwN) design philosophy has been considered to utilise natural processes instead of traditional ones, creating benefits for society and nature. Additionally, a model will be created in Unibest to substantiate and test the final solution. <br/>The research first aimed to describe the coastal characteristics, ecosystem and societal system of the Tasikoki coast. This mainly consisted of a desk-study which was based on literature, but also of examining the surroundings and talking to locals. This study revealed amongst others the significant contribution of climate change on the shoreline retreat at Tasikoki beach.. Among the stakeholders, a major blocking power is absent. Nevertheless, an engagement plan is written to explain the local fishermen how they will benefit from the potential solution in order to prevent resistance. After gathering this general information to form a first impression, more location specific data was required to draw conclusions and setup the Unibest model. Every part of the required data has their own measurement method or source, using handmade measuring equipment, sonar GPS, sediment sieves and data retrieved from wind and wave models. <br/>After a thorough analysis on the wave and wind climate and the surroundings of the Tasikoki coast, it could be concluded that the dominant wave direction is coming from a direction of 164˚ north. This determines the dominant sediment direction, which is thus propagating northward along the shore. Next, the direct coastal retreat due to SLR was calculated by using the Bruun-rule. Based on calculations and aerial image analyses, it was concluded that the two tidal inlets present at the Tasikoki coast play an important role in the erosion patternThe four main nearshore (CST) processes impacting the Tasikoki coast are wave impact, long waves, turbulence and avalanching/sliding. During the research, multiple possible solutions have been investigated which could mitigate the coastline recession. Based on a multi-criteria analysis, it was decided that a Biorock-based solution would suit the Tasikoki case best. This is a permeable submerged breakwater with a low current running through a steel frame to dampen waves and enhance nature at the same time.. A submerged breakwater was modelled in Unibest at Tasikoki beach. The result was positive. The structure traps sediment and causes more accretion along the coast than the length of the structure itself; functioning like a ‘sand engine’. At last a detailed implementation and monitoring plan was written, multiple scenarios are considered to make the solution more future-proof.","coastal; protection; erosion; Building with Nature; Sulawesi; Tasikoki","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Project","1.233190, 125.060712"

The need for controlling transportation systems, andspecifically fleets of vehicles, more efficiently is therefore now higher thanever. Few methods exist in the literature which utilise historical data toincrease the efficiency of dynamic fleets of vehicles. This work thereforeproposes a novel anticipatory insertion method which incorporates a set ofpredicted requests to beneficially adjust the routes of a fleet of vehicles, inreal-time. This set of predicted requests is derived, in advance, fromhistorical data by clustering comparable requests and predicting similarrequests when assumed patterns in their occurrence are present. This method iscombined with a developed dynamic vehicle routing solver which makes use of arange of heuristics and adaptive large neighbourhood search. The proposedmethod is evaluated using numerical simulations on a range of real-worldproblem instances with up to 1.655 requests per day. These instances representdynamic multi-depot capacitated pickup and deliver vehicle routing problemswith time windows. The method is compared with several other approaches and inorder to quantify the added value of making use of historical data, the methodis benchmarked against a comparable reactive approach which also makes use ofadaptive large neighbourhood search. It is shown that, by making use of theproposed method, on average, 4,58% less distance is required to be travelled bya fleet vehicles while additionally 3,35% fewer vehicles are required to fulfilthe same set of requests.","vehicle routing; dvrp; stochastic vehicle routing; large neighbourhood search; heuristics; local search; ruin & recreate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""
