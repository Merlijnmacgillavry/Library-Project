(mentor); Harmanny, R.I.A. (mentor)","2014","Dit document beschrijft de ontwikkeling van een detectie en classificatie algoritme voor een sensormodule. Deze sensormodule maakt gebruik van een radarmodule en een video camera. Dit project is uitgevoerd ten behoeve van het Bachelor afstudeerproject Electrical Engineering aan de TU Delft. Deze sensormodule had als doel het detecteren en classificeren van mensen in een spooromgeving, dit om koperdiefstal en suïcidale pogingen tegen te gaan. De algoritmiek is ontwikkeld ten behoeve van een radarmodule, die werkt op Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radar. Deze radar is ingesteld op een Fast-Ramp-FMCW stuursignaal. De inkomende radardata wordt succesvol gesegmenteerd en na verwerking worden hieruit verschillende spectrogrammen gecreëerd ten opzichte van de tijd, de radius en het Doppler domein. Het radius-Doppler spectrogram wordt gebruikt voor de detectie van objecten aan de hand van een vaste drempelmap die uit gaat van een RCS-, ruis- en clutterbijdrage. Deze drempelmap is per module anders en is succesvol geimplementeerd voor de K-MC1 radarmodule van RF Beam. Vanuit de drempeloverschrijdingen wordt er, met behulp van binaire morphologie, filtering gedaan van de gedetecteerde objecten welke geen breed snelheidsspectrogram hebben en dus geen bewegend mens kunnen zijn. Hierna wordt de snelheid en radius bepaald waarop de overgebleven objecten zich bevinden. Op deze radius worden de objecten geclassificeerd met behulp van het Doppler-tijd spectrogram. Deze classificatie gebeurt aan de hand van de snelheid van het object en de herhaalfrequentie van het menselijke patroon in het Doppler-tijd spectrum. Dit werkt succesvol voor mensen die lopen. Verder maakt de sensormodule gebruik van een video camera die beelden schiet als er een mens geclassificeerd is op basis van de radarsensor. Van deze beelden wordt een HOG beschrijving gemaakt en met behulp van een Support Vector Machine, ter verificatie, geclassificeerd als mens of geen mens. Dit werkt afhankelijk van de eigenschappen van het aangeboden beeld, als een mens zich volledig en in het midden van het beeld bevindt zijn de detectie eigenschappen goed. Voor situaties waarin mensen niet volledig of aan de zijkant van het beeld staan zijn er nog verbeteringen mogelijk. Voor het algoritme zijn er nog vele uitbreidingen mogelijk, het algoritme werkt nu op basis van het Fast-Ramp-FMCW stuursignaal en zou nog uitgebreid kunnen worden voor andere type lineaire stuursignalen. Verder kan het algoritme nog uitgebreid worden om ook rennende mensen correct te classificeren en kan er gebruikt gemaakt worden van een adaptieve drempelmap.","FMCW radar; detectie; micro-Doppler; signaalverwerking","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Bachelor Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","In this work, a model derived from Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics, for the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell, was utilized in order to explore the effect of the assumptions and the transport parameters in the consistency of the model; that is, the compliance of the model with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This thesis begins with a short overview of the fuel cells as well as an introduction to Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics. The model utilized is thoroughly depicted, along with all the assumptions made and the parameter set utilized in previous works. In order to numerically evaluate the consistency of the model, the entropy production departure was introduced, which accounts for the difference between the entropy production calculated with Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and the entropy production calculated with the entropy flux at the boundaries of each layer of the fuel cell. An optimization scheme was also introduced, where the transport parameters were varied in order to find the minimal entropy production departures, leading to a better consistency of the model with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It was found that the parameter set utilized by previous publications lead to entropy production departures as high as 80% and, after implementing the optimization scheme, these figures decreased to 22%. A model was introduced to take into account the water transport across the electrodes of the PEMFC. This model was utilized as a replacement for the water equilibrium assumption made in the electrodes, and it was found that the inclusion of this water transport across the electrodes increased the consistency of the PEMFC model with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, calculating entropy departures as low as 8%. Further simulations of the model were carried out, in order to evaluate the effect of the relative humidity of the hydrogen and air streams on the voltage produced by a PEMFC. It was found that low relative humidity of the inlet gases leads to a substantial decrease in the voltage of the fuel cell, with corresponding decreases in the power produced by as much as 67% when operating at high current densities. In this work, a new transport parameter was introduced, namely the electrode water diffusivity, and the optimization scheme was introduced in order to estimate the value of this parameter, in the interval between 2.6x10-3 m/s and 5.8x10-3 m/s.","fuel cell; thermodynamics; renewable energy; hydrogen; energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Engineering Thermodynamics","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Met behulp van de verkregen kracht en hoek van de sensoren wordt het aantal slagen per minuut en het vermogen berekend.

Dit in tegenstelling tot het handjevol smartphones die Ant+ ondersteunen. Om de locatiebepaling zo accuraat mogelijk te maken wordt er gebruik gemaakt van de netwerk provider in combinatie met WIFI en GPS. De locatie wordt twee keer opgevraagd en daarna worden de locaties met elkaar vergeleken. De locatie met de hoogste accuratie wordt gebruikt als locatie voor de afstandsbepaling. Het prototype van de applicatie werkt naar behoren. Er kan een Bluetooth low energy verbinding worden opgezet zodat de data kan worden ontvangen, verwerkt en opgeslagen in de database. Dezelfde kan vervolgens worden uitgelezen en in een grafiek worden gezet. In de toekomst moeten er nog meer functies worden toegevoegd. Zoals split-time, snelheid van de boot ten opzichte van de aarde en het water, en het vergelijken van data met andere roeiers. Wanneer ook Ant+ breed beschikbaar is zal deze mogelijk de Bluetooth low energy moeten vervangen.

(mentor)","2014","In this thesis, Independent Front Wheel Steering (IFWS) is studied. To implement an IFWS system, it is important to understand how dynamics of the front wheel and steering motor work. Furthermore it can be challenging to provide haptic feedback to the driver, especially when an active safety system is constantly adjusting the angle of the front wheel and causing interference. First a model of a front wheel steering system with a variable gear ratio between motor and front wheels is created. At low gear ratios, the simulations show an improvement of the response of the steering system to the tyre forces. A compromise should be made between a small motor and low gear ratio. A low gear ratio is desirable as it improves the accuracy of a direct current measurement (DCM), which is required for providing the driver with haptic feedback with road information. Then a virtual model (VM) based on the bicycle model is created which can estimate the actual tyre forces within a 16 % accuracy. The error in the VM is caused by the approximation of nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The DCM and the VM are compared to their reference tyre forces in a modified double lane change and a steady state corner simulation. A combiner of the DCM and VM (Combiner DCM and VM (CDV)) is proposed which can blend the two feedback sources. At low interference frequencies, the CDV shows good results. At high interference frequencies, presence of the inertia and damping of the steering system become more dominant compared to the tyre forces and causes a phase lead in the DCM. Towards the natural frequency of the steering system, the magnitude of the required motor current decreases. The result is a poor performance of the CDV at high interference frequencies. One of the recommendation for improving the CDV is installing a motor with a high constant torque value. The motor is coupled to the front wheel with a low gear ratio and will lower the inertia and damping of the steering system. This increases the eigenfrequency of the steering system and improves the bandwidth of the DCM. However the space requirements of a bigger motor can cause problems for implementation.","Front Wheel Steering; direct current measurement; Combiner DCM and VM; haptic feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Automotive","",""

(mentor)","2014","Research in vehicle dynamics and vehicle control systems has increased a lot over the last decades due to the focus towards safety, driving comfort and emissions and the opportunities that come with the development of hybrid- and electric powertrains. Modern vehicles are equipped with many automated systems but automation can have disadvantages such as overreliance, complacency, nonvigilance, deskilling and confusing the driver. The goal of this thesis is to prevent loss of control by improving haptic feedback on the steering wheel near the vehicle’s handling limits using wheel load sensing. Predicting when a vehicle starts to over- or understeer is a difficult task since it depends on the road surface and will only be revealed by vehicle states once it is already too late. The aligning moment of the tire drops before the lateral force actually saturates because of a decrease in pneumatic trail caused by tire contact patch deformation. This drop in aligning moment can be felt on the steering wheel and is an indication that a vehicle is close to the limit. However, the large ratio of mechanical to pneumatic trail and the increased power steering in modern vehicles makes the drop in aligning moment difficult to feel. If vehicles become steer-by-wire there is no feedback reaching the driver through the steering wheel at all. The first part of this thesis consists of identification of the lateral force and aligning moment of the tires with Load Sensing Bearings (LSBs) from SKF. Estimating the lateral force has been done before and the results here show that estimation of the aligning moment is also possible. A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to find first order linear models reconstructing the lateral force and aligning moment from measurements with the LSBs. Different models are derived based on measurements of strain gauges and hall effect sensors on the bearing. The second part of this thesis consists of experiments done at the Prodrive test track to investigate the improvement of haptic feedback using LSBs. The work is a follow-up study based on the Haptic Support Near the Limits (HSNL) system developed in a previous research project. The drop in aligning moment is measured with LSBs and amplified on the steering wheel. The results show that with this feedback drivers are indeed better capable of preventing saturation of the front tires but further research is needed on how the system can increase safety. The results show a decrease in control effort and workload with feedback which can increase driving pleasure and comfort for the driver.","mechanical engineering; control engineering; haptic; feedback; steering; steering wheel; wheel load sensing; load sensing bearing; load sensing bearings; opel astra; prodrive; skf; tu delft; HSNL; LSB; NMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Control Engineering - Automotive","",""

(mentor); Vollers, K.J. (mentor); Koorstra, P.A. (mentor)","2014","The creed of Faculty of Architecture in TU Delft is “Design by Research.” The graduation studio of Complex Project is really embodiment of this creed. In Msc 3, we put emphasizes on the research of Chicago City, which our graduation projects located in. We found many interesting facts about this city, which leads to the final master plan of Chicago south works and my own individual project. Indeed, Chicago is the center city of Midwest of U.S., but it is said “Chicago is the capital of nothing”. In the national level, the economy and population share of Midwest in America decreased dramatically in the last few decades. So did the city ranking of Chicago. Chicago, a city without an obvious city brand, cannot compete with other big cities in America, such as L.A., D.C., or New York. The question is not whether Chicago belongs to the highly appreciated jet set of global cities: Chicago is a global city. It has the appropriate combination of human resources, manufacturing businesses and world institutions. It is control point for eleven of the most successful corporations in the world. Nearly 30% of the 104 Fortune 500 companies, which headquartered in the Midwest, are located in the Chicago metropolitan area. These companies generated over $443 billion revenues in 2005. However, Chicago’s lacks critical attributes associated with a true global city: a critical center of a significant industry. Finance in New York, entertainment in Los Angeles, government in Washington, and so on. Perhaps this lack of definition, could very well serve to be its most strategic element. For a city of this size its main vision is to become an “alpha” city, a true global player, one could assume that the overall image of the region and the involved cities, hold Chicago back from its true potential. However, the strategic organization of the region, via transportation and mobility, as well as its strong cultural definition, could provide Chicago the resources and ability to develop a Global Appeal. Therefore, the development of Chicago and its ability to unify the Midwest into a cohesive and functional region, will further define it as the ‘heart of the heat, and allow it to compete with New York and LA. The Lakeside city will be explored, as the site with an ambition to help Chicago achieve its Global ambitions. In order to achieve its ambition, the strength of the Midwest should be unified, which are agriculture, academic research institutions, culture, landscape and fresh water resource in Great Lakes. Therefore, the urban strategy is obvious, to propose an agriculture research center to unify the academic research and agricultural resource in Midwest and to propose a high speed rail station to improve its mobility and accessibility. The methods we applied during the master plan phase are mainly collage. We conducted a lot of research on research center and research facilities, which helps us to propose the agriculture research center for South Works site. During the research of some well-organized research incubators, we research the program ratio of them, which help us to frame our own program bar in the proposed research park. Also, the sites of the research campus are collaged into our site, so that we can get the basic impression of the scale of research facility. The south works site is formerly a steel company. The site is abandoned since 1970s’, because of the shrink of steel industry. But, the south works site located near the Michigan Lake, which means the research center, would have a great view of the lake. The site is split into two parts by one slip river lies in the middle of site and goes from west to east. Therefore, in the north part, we proposed a research park concentrating on biogenetic research of agriculture, which needs a lot of indoor research space. This is an “urban” area. On the contrary, the south side is a “rural” area, which concentrates on agriculture research and asks for a vast land for research field. My own individual project is in the south of the site, which is a high rise agriculture research building. In the master plan, we only proposed sevral buildings with high density. So that it would leave vast land for field. The agriculture research community would rather be a rural land area than an urban area. In addition to that, this area would have clear identity, the vast rural land and high rise agricultural research tower. (fig-01) I split the program volumes into small pieces. The dimensions of these small pieces are based on the typology research of research buildings in those top ranking agricultural research schools and institutions. So, we can draw some simple conclusions of those research buildings. Normally, the research buildings are in ‘U’-shape or ‘L’-shape. The width of a research building is normally 18m, which is suitable for a 3m corridor and two 7.5m wide labs are on both sides. The dimensions of offices and service area are much more similar to research part. The width of it is about 7.5m to 9m.The dimensions of conference hall are much bigger. In my case, the dimensions of conference hall are 24m by 36m, and about 15m high. And so does the reception part. Now that the dimension of each part differs from each other, we can create an interesting volume if we stack those volumes on top of each other. (fig-02) From outside of the building, it is rather a random appearance. But in the sense of architecture design, it should be logical somehow. The entirely random scheme is assembled by small blocks and units. But what if I organize those building blocks in a logical way? What I’m thinking is to apply the organization of burr puzzle, which is a 3D puzzle to assemble some identical blocks into a stiff shape, so that it cannot be easily tear apart. (fig-03) For a high rise building, it should be resistant under two conditions, gravity and wind load. For structural concern, burr puzzle is a flexible system and can be easily withstand gravity and wind load when it is translated into building. For my project, I think the most important aspect is the architectural expression of it. As a kind of abstract metaphor of the burr puzzle, the shape of the building is assembled by many similar two-storey cuboids with refined truss on the facade. The two high-rise towers are connected by a plinth. Some collective functions are contained, such as the auditorium, library and gym. The research programs are mainly in the high tower, while the research offices are mainly in the lower tower. The research part and office part are all in blocks with notches. Half of the blocks are connected to concrete cores, the other half are resting on the first half. The interlocking structure can guarantee the building to be persistent in gravity and wind load. Research helps us to build our own toolbox which consists of all the information we got of the site and context. Although not all of them are directly helpful for the design, it helps to figure out what is needed to be done, especially in architectural design phase. The research we did about spatial condition before P2 helps to sharp the idea of what kind of intervention should be taken and why it should happen in the place we choose. It helps to make the storyline coherent from the urban strategy to an architectural project. And only by these means, after figuring out what should be there, we architects can bring our personal emotion and feelings to the design process. The research can protect the design process from being arrogant and make it more convincing.","Skyscrapper; Research Facility; Complex Project; Chicago","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-31","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Master Programme in Architecture","","41.8357, 87.5342"

People living, people arriving, people just passing by people staying Train stations lead us from a place to another, becoming an important medium not only on an infrastructural level but also on a public and social level. Amsterdam Zuid station positioning is a crucial place of connection to the social tissue of the area. In fact, the station, in-between the two main squares, act as a bridge in a ‘river’ of railways that divide the area in two. Moreover, a new residential area and student housing will soon animate the direct surroundings. So, the project almost anatomically orchestrates the movement that characterize a station but simultaneously it defines a sequence of spaces that accompany those transitional moments that typify the place. The edges define places to move places to stay in relation to the context, the north and south atriums introduce to the interior, the passage rhythm and displace the flow, the platforms guest farewells and arrivals. The sound and light accompany the transition too. From the sound of the open public squares, to the whistling of train rails. From the reflection and transparency of the skyscrapers of the area, to the filtered light underneath the mass of railways structure. The monumentality, mass and at the same time the relatively low height of the project, compared to the high-rises is chosen to enact the experience of the place trying to leaving a collective memory and awareness of the place.","train station; railway; monumentality; transition; public interior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Saaksjarvi, M.C. (mentor)","2014","Project Background This graduation project is related to the EU-funded research project Light.Touch.Matters, or Project LTM for short. This is a consortium of comprising design practitioners, design researchers and materials scientists. Project LTM has as its main goals to develop new smart materials and, in parallel, discover and design applications of those materials that showcase their potential to revolutionize product interface design. Also, its third goal is also to develop a method for doing design-driven materials innovation. Project description Project LTM has been started under the assumption that making products flexible can make products more intuitive and attractive to use. However, this assumption has never been formally put to the test. This is where this graduation project comes in: its aim is to study how making products flexible affects the acceptance of wearable electronic products, validate (or falsify) Project LTM’s basic premise, and find details that add depth to the issue of flexible products. How will flexible product influence the consumer acceptance of products? And how do consumers accept products in general and how does making product flexible influence this process? Technology acceptance model In order to understand the process of consumer acceptance, a technology model has been developed. This model describes the process of the user towards the purchase. The acceptance of a product is a process with awareness and knowledge as the first step, liking and preference as the second step and the conviction and purchase as the final step. This model makes the consumer acceptance measurable and can be used to compare flexible with non-flexible products. Research Question The most important aspect of this project is finding the answer on the main question about flexible products. The main research question is: Does making products flexible increase the acceptance of biofeedback technology in sports? In order to answer this question, the main question is divided into two sub questions: 1. What are the main factors in the technology acceptance model of consumers? 2. How does making products flexible influence the consumer acceptance of biofeedback products? Research method The research was held by means of a questionnaire, which was filled in by participants of the target group. These participants will be divided in 3 groups. Each group has the exact same questions, but a different product: the benchmark product, the product with a curved screen and the product with a flexible screen. The benchmark product has a traditional small flat screen and was redesigned with a flexible screen in order to compare these products. All other aspects, such as the functionality, were not changed. An inflexible curved OLED screen can be seen as the middle way between a flat screen and a flexible screen. The results will be compared with the results of graduate student Jill Lin, who performs the same research within the health sector. Results sub question one ‘What are the main factors in the technology acceptance model of consumers?’ The results of the individual research show that symbolic value influences other aspects the most. The symbolic value influences the using intention, the relative advantage and the compatibility positively. This is confirmed with the combined results, where the symbolic value influences using intention, the relative advantage and the compatibility as well. In addition, the social value also influences the observability positively, looking at the combined results. Another important aspect is the aesthetic value. The individual results show that the aesthetic value influences the relative advantage, the compatibility, and the social knowledge. Combined results show that the aesthetic value also has a positive influence on testability. Other aspects it the individual results show that influence the using intention are the relative advantage, the compatibility, the testability, the social knowledge, the affective motivation, the risk prevention, the considerations, the symbolic value, the familiarity, the word of mouth and the innovation acceptance. Results sub question two ‘How does making products flexible influence the consumer acceptance of biofeedback products?’ Results show that making products flexible increases the consumer acceptance positively. Individual results show a positive influence on two important aspects in sports: the social value and the aesthetic value compared to the benchmark product. The combined results confirm the positive influence on the aesthetic and symbolic value and discovers new influences as well. Flexible products also influence the compatibility and complexity positively. The aesthetic and symbolic values are aspects of the awareness and knowledge phase. The compatibility and complexity are aspects of the liking and preference phase. So, making products flexible does increase the consumer acceptance and also the value of the awareness and knowledge phase, as well as the liking and preference phase. The main conclusion ‘Does making products flexible increase the acceptance of biofeedback technology in sports?’ Yes, making products flexible increases the acceptance of biofeedback technology in sports. Not only in sports, but also in other market segments! Both the individual as the combined results prove that making products flexible has positive influence on the consumer acceptance. The social value and aesthetic value increased significantly by adding making products flexible. Besides, when looking at the correlation results within the TAM model, the social and aesthetic value are the most important factors of towards using intention and consumer acceptance. This combined gives strong proof that adding making products flexible, without adding other features, stimulates the consumer to purchase a product. Conclusions for the LTM project Flexible products are better accepted by the consumer than non-flexible products. This is good news for the LTM project. Within the LTM project the assumption is often made that the flexible products are the future, but the acceptance of consumers was never proven. Now it is! This means that the development of flexible materials and products has a stronger foundation to build on. Besides, the TAM model shows how the consumer accepts the new developed products and which items have the biggest influence on the consumer acceptance, such as the social and aesthetic value, the relative advantage and the compatibility. When this is taken into account when developing and presenting the new products and technology, the success of this product or technology can only increase!","design; consumer acceptance; biofeedback; flexible products","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

The goal of this project was to evaluate the performance and accuracy of LSTRS and TRUSTmu method when the following three different approaches to compute matrix-vector multiplication were used: Fast Monte Carlo Algorithms, GPU computing, and parallel computing. In order to work on the experiments, we developed a MATLAB software implemented the TRUSTmu method and used the LSTRS software from Rojas, Santos and Sorensen, 2008. The TRUSTmu software provided an interface that allows the user to pass the input matrix as an array or as a function for computing matrix-vector products, possibly with parameters.

(mentor); Martin, C.L. (mentor); Van Manen, W. (mentor)","2014","The first part of the Thesis consists of a research on topics related to Solar Energy, PV technologies and Materials used as part of active solar structures (from the active materials to substrates) as well as their integration in the form of custom shapes. The analysis of these topics reveals the potential of new and emerging PV technologies, which combine very lightweight and flexible characteristics, with a very good performance in partial shading and diffuse light conditions, but most importantly a very high price reduction potential due to specific fabrication methods and materials. In a next step a (four phase) Methodology is developed in order to observe how the process of shaping a three dimensional PV structure in order to increase its surface area per facade space can lead to performance advantages compared to conventional flat and rigid PV structures. This part consists of a first phase, where possible light control/shading systems are compared according to specific requirements related to shading efficiency but more importantly to PV integration potential and PV surface increase potential. The second phase is a shape research in terms of Surface Area Potential and a comparison between 3d shapes using parametric tools. Thereby the ability of different shapes with various folding or curvature patterns to increase their surface for predefined total dimensions is evaluated. The results lead to structures which can provide much more active PV area for a given facade area. The third phase is a solar analysis of 56 of the three dimensional shapes tested and compared in phase 2. Thereby the real average solar radiation reaching the surface of various prismatic or corrugated 3d patterns is calculated and graphically presented. Incident Solar Energy values and partial shading percentages within every shape clearly illustrate which 3d shapes have the highest potential for making maximum use of solar radiation. The relation between surface area increase through denser folding or curving patterns and total received solar energy constitutes the most important finding of this phase. In a fourth phase Laboratory tests are performed at the PV-LAB of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering TUDelft. Different 3d shape versions are tested using flexible Thin Film solar panels. The fact that solar cells performance (output) does not decrease linearly proportional to partial shading and total incident solar energy changes makes real Lab Tests an import- ant verification of the solar analysis results. Finally the best performing shapes are used as the basis to create design proposals in the form of a light control/shading device. The PV optimized 3d surface is thereby developed as a facade structure with possible ways of operation and integration into the NEXT FACADE Concept by Alcoa Architectuursystemen. Additionally ways of using the produced energy and creating a complete efficient PV based system are proposed.","Facade; Solar Cells; PV; 3d; Shading; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-30","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Internation Facade Master","",""

Of this price, the rotor corresponds to 22%. To reduce the price of wind energy, it is necessary to investigate wind turbine concepts with scales above 10 MW. The commonly known Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) requires offshore a large support structure. If the turbine is designed to be floating, a deep floater is needed to limit the tilt angle. A possible concept to meet this challenges is the lift-driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT). This thesis aims to optimize the structural design of a VAWT rotor blade and to decrease the mass to area ratio by varying blade shape and structural layout. The choice of mass to rotor area ratio as an optimization function follows from the fact that this area is directly proportional to the energy output while mass drives production and installation costs. The VAWT is defined by an axis perpendicular to the unperturbed flow direction. The rotor geometry is described through a Troposkein shape. It is assumed that the blades carry their own weight leading to a reinforced root region. During operation the blades experience aerodynamic and inertia forces, which are deflecting the blades outwards, leading to an alternation of the aerodynamic loads.The interplay of load alternation and blade deflection could lead to a diverging flutter motion. After a fitting design is obtained, the blade motion has to be inspected for a safe use during operation. The rotor is designed with an adjusted optimizer, originally written by M. Schelbergen [62]. The optimizer uses the Matlab optimization toolbox in combination with Nastran. The modification allows a smooth transition of the thickness of skin, shear web and girder. The airfoil section is varied along the blade. The optimization is based on load cases such as a parked rotor and the maximum up- and downwind forces. These loads are simplified and assumed to vary neither by the motion nor the deflections of the blade. In addition, an aeroelastic model is required to observe the blades’ motion. Through out this<br/>thesis two aeroelastic codes were used. The VAWT AeroElastic Multibody Panel Solver (VÆMPS) was created by coupling Sandia National Laboratories OWENS and the near wake panel solver UMPM. However, its computational performance was not satisfying and it was decided to use HAWC2 coupled with an actuator cylinder model to determine the induction.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The so-called “university” street-one of the major traffic axes of Athens- is currently planned to be transformed into a large pedestrian avenue with public transportation flows. The case study is evaluated in order to understand the “how” and the “what” of the urban proposal: What is the vision that is leading the project of urban transformation and what are the tools that are used to implement the project? Finally, what effect do these interventions have on the urban environment of the city centre? Following this research, the thesis focuses on the construction of alternative ways to intervene in the city through the tool of strategic spatial planning. The aim is to explore the tool, its definition, origin and main principles, and introduce four values that guide the proposal for the area. These are the qualities of a visionary, relational, integrative and action-oriented plan. In such a framework, Panepistimiou becomes the testbed for a coherent and coordinated process of urban regeneration. A new vision for the area is suggested but also a set of actors, processes and institutional provisions is employed. The thesis concludes with a reflection and evaluation of the proposed process. How is it different from the existing project approach and what broader transformation is suggested for the way 21st century urbanists plan and intervene to the city? In the context of the Greek planning system, what institutional provisions are needed to be added for strategic interventions to take place in the future?","Athens; stategic spatial planning; urban regeneration; planning process; streets; planning institutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","EMU, European Post-Master in Urbanism","","37.9667, 23.7167"

(mentor)","2014","The goal of this research project was to develop and test an online, automated taxi movement planning tool, that optimizes the timed taxiing routes of all aircraft on an airport, by minimizing the impact on the environment. Automatic taxi planning tools have been developed before, but the emissions have never been included before as a factor in the optimal taxi planning. Since the tool is to be used in real-time in an operational context, the daily operations of airports have been analyzed and the tool has been tailor-made to meet the operational requirements. In order to cope with perturbations on the taxiway grid, the tool is capable of optimizing a taxi planning within 15 seconds. This way, a new planning can be calculated quickly if there are perturbations on the taxiway grid. The objective function comprises the following criteria:  Minimization of the emissions (normalized and weighted in the objective function)  For departures: minimization of the absolute deviation from the departure slot time  For arrivals: minimization of the taxiing time (normalized in the objective function) The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) methodology has been used to formulate and solve the problem. The formulation in this research project uses binary routing variables and continuous timing variables. This way, the routing and scheduling problem can be solved without the disadvantages of discrete time. The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) are included in the optimization. The developed optimizer minimizes those five emissions, along with fuel burn, delays for departures and taxiing times for arrivals. The environmental variables are modeled using an action-based model, in which the emissions caused by accelerating, idling during a hold, taxiing at constant speed and turning have been modeled. The developed tool has been subjected to a comprehensive test case. The test case simulated a full day of flights on a major European hub: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The output of each emission type increased with only 1 to 2 percent, in comparison to the theoretical optimum (which is a scenario where each flight would be able to travel its optimal, unimpeded route, unhindered by separation constraints). When the emission optimization criteria were switched off (while keeping the objective criteria of arrivals taxiing time and departure slot time deviation), the output of each emission type increased with around 20 to 25 percent, in comparison to emission-enabled optimization. The computational times remained within limits, so the requirement was met of having the ability to do a replanning every 15 seconds. The environmental benefit of using this type of optimizer is estimated to be around 10 to 20 percent per emission type. The reduction can be attributed to the elimination of the buffering and waiting queues in front of runways, the elimination of holds at nodes and the intelligent overall routing, timing, sequencing and scheduling on the taxiway grid. Therefore, this research project proves that a surface movement planning tool, which minimizes the emissions or the total taxiing time, can be valuable for airports that have dense taxiing traffic and stringent environmental requirements.","airport; taxiing; ground surface movement; emission; emissions; optimizer; taxi movement planning tool; movement planning; environment; taxiway; milp; aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport and Operations (ATO)","","","",""

In this manual, Used Without Waste untangles the complexity of the many layers of waste that derive from buildings, in its tangible form and conceptual: in material waste, or simply waste of space. Used Without Waste hopes to inspire designers to look at buildings in time-layered elements and to think beyond the design of solely the building, and expand this horizon to include all the possible ways of continuous flows of resources in order to reduce or reshape the current concept of waste in the built environment.

The positioning accuracy of free floating stages is defined by the disturbances action on it. So, it is of utmost importance to accurately quantify the disturbance forces of these cables. The mathematical model of such a structure must feature geometric nonlinearities. The computational cost of such a model is often prohibitive, therefore nonlinear reduction techniques are needed. This contribution introduces a newly developed reduction technique known as the Generalized Craig Bampton (GCB) method which is an extension of the well-known Craig Bampton reduction technique, applicable to finite deformations. The GCB expressions are integrated using a two stage offline-online integration scheme which achieves near real time simulation during the online stage. The method is compared with both the fully nonlinear model and experimental results and is seen to show a good agreement with both.","nonlinear model order reduction; cable slab; geometric nonlinearity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2014","In order to address the problem of indoor pedestrian tracking, this thesis reports a research on spatial models' ability to reduce tracking error of a WiFi positioning system. There are three main objectives in this research. First, it is to build a suitable spatial model for tracking. Second, it is to develop a tracking algorithm that can make full use of the spatial model. Last, the tracking algorithm should be tested in a live environment. Based on literature study, a grid-based spatial model is chosen to be built because it is easy to design and maintain, has high flexibility, has accurate location data and is powerful for computation. The thesis explores various geometric, topological and semantic features of the grid model and select out the most useful features upon tracking purposes. Among geometric features, coordinate, buffer, orientation vector and Euclidean distance are used. Among semantic features, space, obstacle, and door are employed. Among topological features, the difference between straight-line distance and shortest path distance is chosen. We develop the tracking algorithm combining multiple tracking techniques. In addition to the spatial model and WiFi positioning system, the algorithm also includes magnetometers and grid filters. The former one measures the orientation of a pedestrian. The latter one allows integrating all selected features of the grid model with the measurements from both the WiFi positioning system and the magnetometer to compute the location recursively. To test the algorithm's performance, we built a tracking system with database, web service and mobile client. Several experiments are carried out using the system in a real environment. The experiment results show that the algorithm is able to determine locations at reasonable places (in the correct space, outside obstacles and connected to the previous location) and derive the accurate moving direction of a pedestrian.","spatial model; indoor tracking; grid filter; WiFi positioning system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics  for the built environment","",""

(mentor); Hoftijzer, J.W. (mentor); Volkers, N. (mentor)","2014","Visual Thinking is becoming an increasingly important and popular skill to learn. Yet currently there are relatively few products and methods available to people for learning it. This creates the opportunity to design a new product for learning visual thinking. The design of this product requires and understanding of how visual thinking itself works, and of the users and their context for which the design is done. Literature studies, in-depth-interviews and observations provided insights on the context of the target users who want to learn visual thinking. The understanding of the target users and context is formulated in the user model and the project design goal: “Design a digital interactive product, that facilitates the learning process of visual thinking and enables users to apply it in a company context."" The context and user understanding form the basis for the project’s design phase. Through several iterations concepts were designed, tested and refined until they formed the basis of the final design. The final design is named PaperPlane. It is a digital web-based platform that facilitates people in learning the skill of visual thinking. PaperPlane offers users an new interactive way to learn visual thinking in cycles of four steps: By viewing the content, practicing, applying, and reflecting. Users learn by going through courses made up of small modules. Inside the modules is the learning content in the form of images, videos and other media, or links to external resources. Users practice by doing drawing exercises in every module and directly apply their visual thinking skills in assignments at the end of every course. The platform then lets users reflect on their learning process and drawings individually, and also in the form of a social system of peer reviews. During the learning process the platform guides people, but at the same time provides autonomy and a non-linear learning path, where the learner is in control. Outside of the learning process, PaperPlane provides two tools for enabling users apply visual thinking in their work. One is the Story Tool, which functions as a wizard for visualising stories from users’ work context. The other is the Visual Library; a collection of example drawings, templates and inspiration. These tools can be accessed from anywhere at any time in the platform. The design was evaluated with a final test of user experience and product usability, showing that the design fulfils the design goal.","Visual Thinking; Drawing; Experiential Learning; Graphicacy; Platform; Website","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The research is based on the Maltese archipelago, a collection of islands with no other building material available apart from Globigerina limestone. Importing materials before the industrial revolution was an impractical endeavour which led for the inhabitants of the island to learn and master ways how stone can be used in a variety of ways. This restriction resulted in a cultural landscape made out of one material, hence the material has not only transcended from a building resource to a building system but also became a predominant factor in the cultural identity of the island. Furthermore, stone’s natural and massive qualities arises the sense of firmness and timelessness, qualities which are rarely found in contemporary architecture. Alas, this building tradition is being replaced by modern industrialised materials and building techniques which depend on standardisation and require much less craftsmanship. The knowledge of this art and technique of cutting volumetric stones and assembling it into a building (stereotomy) is becoming less and less of a viable option, hence in risk of becoming stagnant and redundant. This study explores regionalism from a technologic and material point of view. It investigates the combination of traditional building techniques with current emerging technologies in digital fabrication with the goal to understand, reinterpret and also extend the performance of stereotomy as building technique through the use of computer aided craftsmanship. For this reason the starting points of this research were the material characteristics and craftsmanship considerations; more specifically, compression-only structural system and 6-axis industrial robotic arm with an abrasive diamond wire cutter. This ultimately strives for the preservation and contemporary reinterpretation of a cultural identity enrooted in the use of stone. The design case set prior to this research follows a similar trail of thought. The house for Maltese literature ‘s design intent is to give an architectural statement that would show an alternative to what post colonial Maltese society could identify themselves with. Both stone stereotomy and Maltese literature share the idea of transcendence from the mundane into the extraordinary; a narrative which was also the main driving force for the architectural gesture shown in the building’s morphology.","Robotic Fabrication; Stone; CompressionOnly; Form Finding; Computation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","","35.8833, 14.5000"

(mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); Iychettira, K. (mentor)","2014","The strong focus of the European Union towards renewable energy led to an increased share of wind and photovoltaic power in North-West Europe. Both technologies are dependent on the weather causing the need for fossil fuel based backup power plants. Hydropower in Norway and Sweden could be the perfect sustainable alternative for these power plants although it requires extra interconnectors to transfer the electricity. A win-win situation can be created whereby cheap (excess) intermittent power is transferred from Northwest Europe to Scandinavia when the sun shines and the wind blow. This gives the producers of wind and photovoltaic power in Northwest Europe an opportunity to obtain a higher revenue because the electricity price in Scandinavia is expected to be higher. It also allows the hydropower producers in Scandinavia to save their water and use it in later time period to serve as backup capacity when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. The economic viability of these plans is however difficult to estimate. It is dependent on the policies for renewable energy, fuel prices and the demand growth. The current methods to assess the economic viability of extra interconnecion capacity and the benefit for producers of intermittent energy do not capture the long term dynamics of the electricity market. In this thesis agent-based modelling is used to determine if extra interconnection capacity is indeed economic viable. Furthermore it is determined if extra interconnection capacity reduces the amount of thermal backup capacity in Northwest Europe and generates a better business case for intermittent power plants in Northwest Europe. Therefore an agent-based model is created which mimics the power generation portfolios in Norway and Sweden on the one hand and Great-Britain, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands on the other hand. The model is used to determine the effects of interconnector investments and the development of renewable energy on the aforementioned indicators. In each experiment also the uncertainty in fuel prices and demand growth is taken into account. Based on the outcomes of the model it can be stated that a strong development of renewable energy leads to a better business case for more interconnector investments. If the business case is profitable depends to a large extent on the investment costs. The effect of extra interconnection capacity on the negative effects of intermittent renewable energy is however limited. The business case for intermittent technologies in Northwest Europe does not improve and thermal backup capacity is still necessary. The model itself can be substantially improved by increasing the level of detail. This includes the extension of the amount of areas, the inclusion of startup costs and the usage of stochastic data for the generation of wind and photovoltaic power.

(mentor)","2014","There is an everlasting demand for higher cycle efficiencies in gas turbine engines. One way to obtain a higher efficiency is to increase the overall pressure ratio (OPR) of the engine. In order to benefit from the efficiency increase whilst maintaining the same specific gas power, the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) has to increase with it. However, with the extremely high TIT used in modern day gas turbine engines, the melting point of the materials used in nozzle guide vanes (NGV) and high pressure turbine (HPT) blades is already exceeded. Therefore, the vanes and blades rely on active cooling on the in- and outside to prevent it from melting. However, the application of cooling air in the turbine is detrimental to the engine performance and hence is desired to be kept at a minimum. Next to application of a turbine cooling system with high heat transfer coefficients, a lower cooling air massflow can be obtained by using coolant of a lower temperature. The use of cryogenic fuels in hybrid engines currently investigated in for example the AHEAD project, can prove to be useful in that aspect; a heat exchanger can be applied to exchange heat between the coolant and the fuel to reduce the temperature of the cooling air. In this study, a semi-empirical turbine cooling program is developed which is able to calculate the thermal performance of a cooling system configuration and assess the effects of the cooling air on engine performance. For the determination of the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop in the turbine cooling program, semi-empirical correlations from various journal articles are used rather than relying on computational intensive CFD calculations. Also, the tool is able to predict the cooling air requirement for any turbine cooling configuration to a reasonable level of accuracy, enough to be useful during the engine preliminary design phase. This turbine cooling program is used to study the effects of the cooling air on engine performance and research the feasibility of using pre-cooled coolant in a hybrid engine configuration. This main conclusions of this study are that, as expected, cooling air is detrimental to the engine performance. However, the magnitude of the turbine cooling requirements and hence the detrimental effect on the engine performance is commonly underestimated. Therefore, the proper prediction of turbine cooling requirements is important in early design stages, especially for engines operating at higher OPR and TIT. Furthermore, the cooling air requirements decrease if cooling air of a lower temperature is used. Re-using spent cooling air to cool the next row of vanes/blades turns out to have a negative effect on the engine performance. The findings in this report can prove to be important for future engine design where OPR and TIT values are expected to keep rising. Also, the assessment of the effect of coolant pre-cooling and re-use of coolant come in handy for the intended application in the AHEAD hybrid engine.","gas turbine; turbine; cooling; hybrid engine; coolant; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-27","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Weijermars, R. (mentor)","2014","Because of high resource prices for rare earth elements over the last decade, companies and governments are investing in research in finding new deposits and innovations. The purpose of this thesis is to measure the potential of rare earth deposits in the deep-sea environment. This is done by a wide and extensive literature study with a focus on supply and demand, combined with several cash flow analyses. Some research will be on alternatives for deep-sea mining; for example recycling and substitution of rare earth elements. Obstacles like the public opinion and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which can square up the potential, will be discussed as well. This thesis shows that conventional mining methods can answer to the world demand for the next 40 years. Nations with high demand, but without resources, can also be supplied for the upcoming 30 years. On top of this, cash flow analyses show that mining of rare earth deposits in the deep-sea environment will not be economically feasible in the foreseeable future. Also, the ecology of the deep-sea is unique and is already starting a public debate. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to start mining in international waters, as the United Nations Convention of the Law on the Sea prohibits this. Although recycling and substitution developments are in their infancy, nations and mining companies invest in these alternative methods. It is more likely for nations to continue to invest in these technologies rather than deep-sea mining. All-in-all it can be concluded that the potential of rare earth deposits in the deep-sea environment will be extremely low during the upcoming decades.","deep-sea mining; rare earth elements; rare earth deposits","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Motivated by the exciting potential of the new floating offshore wind concepts, this thesis aims to analyze the fatigue behavior of a novel semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine, developed at CeSOS, NTNU, which consists of four cylindrical columns with one central column supporting the 5 MW NREL wind turbine. The geometry was proposed by the author, based on logic, mathematical derivations, as well as information from the literature. The SESAM package provided by DNV was used for this thesis, including GeniE, Sestra, Submod, SESAM Manager and Xtract. The geometry was developed in the FEM software GeniE, which uses Sestra as solver, while the rest of the tools were utilized for the sub-modeling technique. Two different geometries of the column-pontoon connection were designed and their performances under different loads were analyzed and compared. The model which appeared to be more reliable regarding fatigue was further investigated and optimized in order to reduce the SCF, which are of great importance for fatigue predictions. One crucial hot spot underwent a detailed stress analysis, using the sub-modeling technique, i.e. cutting the structure at a specified location and refining the mesh. The stress assessment at the location of interest was performed in Xtract, and for further extrapolation of the stress results in order to compute the hot spot stresses and the SCFs, an Excel spreadsheet was used. Using the load time series from the dynamic analysis of the global model, and combining them with the hot spot stresses, the stress time series were output for a certain sea state. The actual fatigue calculations were performed in Matlab, using the freely available WAFO package. First, the well-established uni-axial fatigue case was performed, utilizing the rainflow counting method, a proper S-N curve and the Miner's rule. A number of 13 sea states with 10 seeds each, with aligned wind and wave were considered. The fatigue assessment was performed for four different sea headings with respect to the pontoon's direction, i.e. 0, 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Next, an approach for considering multi-axial effects in fatigue analysis was proposed, combining two recently developed methods, Equilibrium Equivalent Structural Stress and the Path-Dependent Maximum Range. Considerations on the importance of multi-axial effects on the analyzed structure were further made, followed by conclusions and recommendations for future work.","fatigue; structural design; hot spot; stress analysis; SCF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging","","EWEM European Wind Energy Master - Offshore Engineering track","","63.44, 10.37"

This application downloads a test torrent and measures information such as CPU usage and download speed. Based on this information we have concluded that it is currently not viable to run the anonymous tunnels on an Android smartphone. Creating circuits with several hops that use encryption is very computationally expensive and modern smartphones can hardly keep up.

Writing too becomes a dimension of research, as much as sketching, coding and modelling, which together informs the process in ways that an isolated approach does not. With the hope of achieving greater lucidity, the narration surrenders an intellectual highpoint in favour of exploring an emotionally indulgent manner.

(mentor)","2014","The KTT (‘Khu Tap The’; Dormitory Region) district is a housing district based on the Soviet microrayon (microdistrict). In contrast to other former or current communist countries, the microrayons in Hanoi have transformed greatly. This occurred from 1986 when Vietnam entered a free market economy by setting up its Doi-Moi (reformation) policy. Ever since Vietnam finds itself in a paradoxical situation: “a one party communist regime overseeing a Wild-West style of capitalism” (World Crunch News, 2013). Today the public spaces in between the KTT housing blocks have been filled up with slum-like developments due to overcrowding and lack of buildings regulations. The paradoxical situation of contemporary Vietnam is the starting point for a new type of housing district: the KTT 2.0. This housing district is more flexible and open to the rapid changes in culture, economy and politics that are taking place in Vietnam today. At the same time it partly preserves the ideals with which these microrayons were designed. The new design is worked out from bottom-up in one of the existing KTT districts: The KTT Kim Lien. Based on thorough research and analyses, requirements were set up to create a type of housing block which is able to meet the variable demands of its inhabitants. This housing block replaces the existing ones and is part of three different types of blocks which, together with various street section designs, form the tools to the creation of new types of (smaller) KTT districts.","Soviet; Housing; Microrayon; Hanoi; KTT; Vietnam; Ku Tap The","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Vertical Cities Asia","",""

The interested tenants will be given a “toolbox” that will aid them to decide on their own space in relevance to their needs, the money needed and the available material. Ultimately, our theoretical, “what if” statement will be denatured in a collage of unique spaces, materialized from the ruins of another building, which will fill the steel structure and make as rethink of the Timmerhuis in its essence.","Timmerhuis; Rotterdam; Social Housing; urban recycling; destruction; reuse; community; bartering; money","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Design as Politics","",""

(mentor); Van der Spek, S.C. (mentor)","2014","There are many applications that use maps, and more detailed the maps are, more applications can benefit from the map. Many maps are still manually created and also the underlying attributes are informed in a manual process. This thesis presents a method to automatically derive and update attribute road data by mining and analyzing movement trajectories. The method used for this thesis implemented OpenStreetMap as the underlying map which will be updated. GPS tracks are the movement trajectories that will be used to derive the information for the road attributes. There are attributes that are already conceptually present in OpenStreetMap but are in practice rarely filled. The attributes that will be investigated to derive are: whether the road is a one or two way road, the speed limit of the road, the number of lanes of the road and which vehicles have access to the road. Also, new attributes are introduced in this thesis. These are the average speed of the road, the hours in which the road is congested, the importance of the road and whether the road has a certain geometrical error. Preprocessing is performed before the attributes can be derived. Important are the classification of the transportation mode of the GPS tracks and the map matching of the GPS points to the roads they are on. When the IDs of the roads, where the GPS points are on, are known the attribute extraction algorithms can be applied. These algorithms all have different methods for deriving their attributes. There are attributes that use the speed of the GPS point, the distance from the point to the road or the heading of the point. For some attributes, a hierarchical code list is created to provide different perspectives on the error of the attributes. The code list consists of the values of the attributes and the hierarchy between these lists describes the level of detail and the granularity of the values. While some attributes were classified correctly in almost 100\% of the cases, the extraction of the attributes were not all successful. The number of lanes proved to be too difficult to derive out of the available data and the importance of a road relies on a complete coverage of data which was not the case. Although, the latter is applied in this research. The other attributes had different results, the accuracy of the classification of the speed limit was 69,2\%. However, when taking into account speed limits that are only one step away (e.g. 60 km/h instead of the classified 50 km/h) the classification increases to 95\%. The classification of the roads that allow bicycles was 74\% and the attribute to determine whether a road is a one or two way road has a classification accuracy of 99\%. In the future, the attribute extraction algorithms could be improved or expanded. More detailed levels in the hierarchical code list could be added and constraints could be added to improve the attributes. Also, some techniques might be enhanced for better results. Finally, the ideal application of this method would be deriving and updating the attributes in real-time. This could lead to live maps which would change real-time with the changes on the road.","automatically; deriving; updating; movement; trajectories; openstreetmap; gps; attributes; road","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-26","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","GIS Technology","",""

(mentor); Harteveld, M.G.A.D. (mentor)","2014","Wereldwijd is er een vergrijzing zichtbaar in de bevolking. In 2050 zal het percentage van het aantal ouderen wereldwijd verdubbeld zijn. In Nederland komt dit er op neer dat in 2050 een kwart van de bevolking ouder is dan 65 jaar (Zantinge et al., 2011). In Nederland wordt de groei veroorzaakt door de stijgende levensverwachting en de babyboom die heeft plaatsgevonden. Deze vergrijzing heeft grote gevolgen voor het zorgsysteem in Nederland. Zo nemen de kosten van de zorg ieder jaar met 4.3 procent toe. Dit is drie keer zo veel als de economische groei, wat maakt dat de stijging vele malen te hoog is. Om problemen in de toekomst te beperken neemt de overheid een aantal maatregelen: ouderen moeten langer zelfstandig thuis wonen, zelf financieel bijdragen in de zorg en gebruik maken van mantelzorg die verleend wordt door familie en vrienden. Om dit mogelijk te maken heeft de overheid het beleid veranderd en diverse andere maatregelen genomen. Het enige wat ontbreekt is dat er geen aanpassingen hebben plaatsgevonden in de woonomgeving om deze wijzigingen van de overheid te kunnen voldoen. Deze thesis focust zich dan ook op wat er in de woonomgeving van ouderen moet veranderen. De hoofdvraag die hierbij hoort is: Welke ruimtelijke en stedenbouwkundige interventies zijn nodig om een gepaste en aangename leefomgeving voor ouderen met een zorgbehoefte te creëren? Deze vraag wordt beantwoord met behulp van verschillende onderzoeksmethodes. Er wordt een literatuuronderzoek uitgevoerd, een case study, een mental mapping onderzoek en tot slot is er geïnterviewd. Door middel van deze onderzoeken is bepaald aan welke criteria de woonomgeving van ouderen moet voldoen. Deze criteria zijn opgedeeld in acht thema’s: fysieke veiligheid, sociale veiligheid, stimulatie tot activiteiten buiten de deur, stimulatie mantelzorg, sociale netwerken, gevoelsmatig de route verkorten, mobiliteit (grote schaal) en zelfstandig wonen. Bij elk thema horen meerdere criteria. Pas als aan al deze criteria wordt voldaan wordt het gewenste einddoel bereikt. Echter deze criteria zijn nog niet vertaald naar de context van een ruimtelijk en stedenbouwkundig ontwerp. De volgende stap in het onderzoek was dan ook om een nieuw ruimtelijk en stedenbouwkundig ontwerp te maken voor de wijk Groot-IJsselmonde. Ontwerpend is onderzocht welke interventies er moeten plaatsvinden om aan alle criteria te voldoen. Uiteindelijk heeft dit geleid tot een nieuw stedenbouwkundig ontwerp en de uitwerking van een aantal bouwblokken in dit nieuwe ontwerp. Het resultaat van het onderzoek is bevredigend en er kan worden geconcludeerd dat de hoofdvraag wel degelijk is beantwoord. Er zijn acht thema’s met criteria opgesteld die stedenbouwkundige ontwerpers moeten gaan gebruiken tijdens toekomstige ontwerpen. Tevens kunnen een aantal criteria ook door de gemeente worden opgenomen in de standaard eisen voor woonbuurten. Daarnaast is er aan de hand van de methode onderzoekend ontwerpen voor de casus Groot-IJsselmonde een methode opgesteld die andere woonwijken kan worden toegepast. Als in huidige woonwijken dit stappenplan wordt gevolgd ontstaat er een aangename leefomgeving voor zowel de ouderen als de overige bewoners van de wijk. Deze methoden kan in alle Nederlandse woonwijken worden toegepast om een aangename leefomgeving voor zorg behoevende ouderen te creëren.","vergrijzing; ouderen; mantelzorg; urban design; Groot-IJsselmonde","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-24","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration in the European Context","","52.0066700, 4.3555600"

A better understanding of the operational limits that apply for the installation helps to improve the project execution and thus reduces costs. It is important to analyze in which sea states the installation can be carried out safely. A coupled analysis model consisting of a vessel the jacket and couplings is implemented in SIMO. Time domain simulations of the the lowering and landing process of a jacket substructure are carried out for a jack-up and a floating vessel. Based on operational criteria a workability analysis is performed and the limiting sea states are determined. The jacket substructure needs to be lowered into pre-installed foundation piles and the jacket motions are thus limited to a certain threshold in order for the installation to be successful. The jack-up vessel is fixed and consequently there are no crane tip motions. The jacket is thus only excited by waves and the motions are small enough for the jacket to successfully enter the foundation piles for all investigated sea states. The floating vessel is excited by waves and the vessel motions lead to larger motions in the jacket too. The jacket does therefore not always enter the foundation piles. The success rate depends on the wave period and decreases for larger wave periods, close to the excitation periods of the vessel. While the floating vessel is only suited for operations in small wave periods the jack-up vessel was able to operate in all investigated sea states.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mizgier, K. (mentor)","2014","The losses realized by firms due to the occurrence of an Operational Risk (Op Risk) event, defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, constitute a threat for the firms’ performance. More specifically, the average ratio of the Op Risk losses-to-revenues equals 13.44% while in some cases the same ratio exceeds 100%. Given that, the underlying problem of the materialization of Op Risk losses in the sectors of Financial Services and Manufacturing, which suffer more frequently from them, accepted as the result of the inevitable occurrence of Op Risk events, despite the significant efforts to be reduced, is studied in this project. Given the knowledge gap concerning the investigation of the dependency structures of the Op Risk losses, this project contributes to the Op Risk literature by studying the relationship between the Op Risk losses and the state of the US economy, and exploiting the identified relationships for the purpose of the coverage of the Op Risk losses, taking into account the different perspectives of the actors involved in the problem. Therefore, the following research question has been set up: What is the relationship between Op Risk losses and the state of the US economy and, if any, how can it be exploited with respect to the coverage of the Op Risk losses? In order for the research question to be answered, the multi-actor system of Firms in Financial Services, Firms in Manufacturing, Regulators in Financial Services, and Government, concerning the management of the Op Risk losses, is analyzed. The system is analyzed at two levels; the operational and the institutional. At the operational level, the interdependencies between the Op Risk losses in the two investigated sectors and the state of the economy are identified and modeled by statistical and econometric tools. The dependencies between the institutions that represent the involved actors are analyzed at the institutional level. The results of the analysis at the operational level reveal that the Op Risk losses in both the investigated sectors are influenced by the state of the economy with a time lag. Furthermore, there is a bidirectional relationship between the Op Risk losses in the two sectors. At the institutional level, Regulators in Financial Services have the authority to impose the regulatory framework concerning Op Risk losses on Firms in Financial Services. In addition, the actors of Firms in Financial Services and Firms in Manufacturing are mutually dependent since the latter are the consumers of the services provided by the former. Based on the results of the analysis at both the levels, the inclusion of the information about the identified relationship between the Op Risk losses and the state of the economy for the purpose of the calculation of the regulatory capital, required to be held by Firms in Financial Services, is suggested. The establishment of a regulatory authority concerning the coverage of the Op Risk losses in Manufacturing, which currently does not exist, is recommended as well. The suggested implications are expected to result in more appropriate responses to the realization of Op Risk losses. That means more efficient capital allocation due to the calculation of the regulatory capital closer to the actually required, and financially stronger Firms in Manufacturing because of the introduction of regulatory capital requirements.","operational risk; business cycles; dynamic regression; actor analysis; regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Based on the extensive research done in a group of 4 people, we have chosen healthcare related functions as potentially the most applicable to create a brand, attract investments and provide essential facilities for the neighbourhood.

I believe that a Conference Centre could become a link, providing collaboration space for the Science Cluster and attracting the public by facilities, exhibitions, public events and not last – an architectural quality. My project is based on the relationship of old and new: a new multifunctional space within the historical framework. Situated at the beginning of the long strip of the linear park, connecting the South Chicago neighbourhood & Lake Michigan, the conference centre plays an important role in the composition of the campus. Connecting the pedestrian routes, spanning from west to east and from north to south, the building becomes a linking element not only functionally, but also spatially. The building is concealed behind the walls, with only the external envelope visible, reflecting the sky above.

What’s worse, this CBD has some inborn weakness when compared to the other CBD due to some urban planning mistakes. The first one is that the core of this CBD is divided into two parts by a busy road. The buildings in this area are disconnected. People who want to go to the other sides of the CBD have to walk for a long time or experience the anxiety space under the Huanshi East Road. Besides, people in this area also lack space for recreation and public activities. The aforementioned factors decrease the attractiveness of this CBD. This pose the research question: what can be an appropriate solution for this complicated site? To deal with the huge amount of information of the site efficiently, the application of advanced digital tools and design methodology will become important part of the design exploration. More precisely, combined with the outcome of urban analysis and climate study, a system that refers to the concept of self organizing system / agent based modeling will be built for simulating the function arrangement and initial form – finding. By analyzing the results of these simulations, conclusions can be made with regard to public/private zones, topology and location as well as morphological translations.

Uit de enquête, gehouden onder 984 huurders van vier woningcorporaties en één huurdersvereniging, valt te concluderen dat van de tien gestelde mechanismen uit de literatuur, er zes bij huurders significant van invloed zijn. Opvallend hierin is, dat de meeste sub-mechanismen van investeren géén significante invloed hebben op het gevoel van eigenaarschap, terwijl dat wel in de lijn der verwachtingen van corporaties lijkt te liggen. Het grootste deel van de respondenten geeft aan, mentaal eigenaar of niet, te investeren in de woning. Het meest van invloed op het gevoel van eigenaarschap blijken de sub-mechanismen die inspelen op de identiteit die huurders herkennen in de woning of de band die zij met de woning ervaren: sub-mechanismen welke lastig te beïnvloeden lijken door de woningcorporatie. Op basis van dit onderzoek kan wel vervolgonderzoek gedaan worden of de sub-mechanismen onderling invloed hebben op elkaar en wellicht een meer kwalitatieve insteek voor vervolgonderzoek: wát ervaren mentaal eigenaars precies in de woning?","mentaal eigenaarschap; woningcorporaties; enquête; mental ownership; huurders; mechanismen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing Policy, Management and Sustainability","",""

(mentor)","2014","The research aims to redefine how adaptive planning approach can help traditional spatial planning system to deal with conservation and development land use conflicts through a set of adaptation plans. As most planning system in the world, spatial planning in Taiwan in concerned with both planning making and the control of development (Chen & Shih 2010). Hence, the Northeast Coastal National Scenic Area (NCNSA) Plan is the master plan of the traditional comprehensive model dominating land use and regional planning since 1976. In addition, the designation of slope land in Gongliao (the dominating administrative area of NCNSA) by Rules of Slope-land Conservation and Utilization Act regulated and restricted the built area development. The NCNSA master plan combined with zoning plan reflects the ESAs guidance in regional level and strictly protects landscape from development. As a result, the contradiction areas are mainly overlapped with the settlements in floodplain and mountain villages along Shuangxi River valley. However, the rigidness of land use regulations not only eliminates the possibilities for specific type waterfront development along Shuangxi River valley, but also leads to conflict relationship between the designated conservation areas and the locals. Three research questions will be answered in this study: (1) What are the conservation and development conflicts in case study area? (2) What are the priority spatial development principles? (3) What are the strategies to integrate conservation and development land use conflicts? The research methods include official document review and landscape analysis. A set of adaptation plan will be used to illustrate as development strategy between nature conservation and development. The conclusion will help the completeness of existing local development plan response to national and regional policies as well as local needs.","Adaptive planning approach; conservation and development conflicts; National Scenic Area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-26","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2014","The assignment for this graduation project is provided by Urban Arrow, which is a company that focusses on the development of electric assisted cargo bikes. Their goal is to offer an alternative to cars in urban areas, as they believe a cargo bike is more efficient and environmentally friendly. Urban Arrow’s tagline is Urban Smart Mobility, offering cargo bikes for families and companies. Currently Urban Arrow offers two-wheeled bicycles which are able to move through the city reaching a speed of 25 km/h easily due to their manoeuvrability and electric assistance. Unfortunately, the use of two wheels results in instability at low speed and when standing still, as the users have problems in balancing the bicycle once it is loaded with more than 100 kg. These problems especially occur in commercial use where an increased load capacity is desirable. This problem lead to the assignment of this graduation project, where Urban Arrow asked for a product for commercial use. A cargo bike had to be designed which allows the user to transport loads up to 200 kg without instability during the set-off and standing still. The bicycle should have the manoeuvrability of a two-wheeler and the stability of a conventional three-wheeler. As Urban Arrow makes use of a modular product, only the front part of the cargo bike had to be designed, including the front wheels and cargo compartment. Research on bicycle dynamics was done to get a better understanding of the problem of instability. Furthermore, the context was analysed and the commercial use was explored by looking at the transported products and the environment in which the bike will be used. The project focussed on a technical solution for the given problem. Aesthetics were not taken into account, as function was more important in this stage than the appearance. A three-wheeled cargo is the final result of the project, including a tilting mechanism to allow the bicycle to lean into corners like a two-wheeler. Multiple solutions were created to use the benefits of a third wheel for stability, all of which were tested and analysed. Moreover, a full-sized working prototype was made to test the technical solutions. To finalize this project, recommendations were made for further developments based on the test results and findings during the project.","Bicycle; Cargo bike; Mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","","52.006351, 4.367185"

(mentor); Komossa, S. (mentor)","2014","Since the introduction of the coffee houses, Istanbul gained an important element to form a public sphere. These places enhanced the forming of a public opinion which is a crucial aspect of a democratic society. In the Ottoman empire these places were even seen as a nest for the opposition. Nowadays public spaces are threatened by a privatization frenzy resulting in a mass dissatisfaction of citizens. The Gezi protests in Istanbul caused for a national turbulence in Turkey stressing spatial issues in the public domain and challenging the meaning of public sphere in Istanbul throughout the history. Ignited by the protests citizens in Istanbul started reclaiming their public spaces. It started with parks being turned into public forums and continued in empty buildings being squatted and transformed into cultural centers. These local initiatives were adapted by several neighborhoods in Istanbul and functioned as urban incubators for communal activities. They provided for space where everybody could unrestrictedly engage in political debates and form a public opinion. Inspired by this act of reclaiming, this project turns a private object in the urban tissue of Istanbul's Üsküdar into an encapsulated public space. The remains of the first flour factory of Istanbul is reclaimed, which means that the meaning of the object in the city changes in favor of the public. With its porous shell the former building is an extension of the public realm where the infrastructure, nature, institute and the civic society comes together. Through infrastructural elements combined with porous borders and several institutional infills the building integrates the artificial landscape of the urbanized Üsküdar with the view of the Bosporus and the green of the Fethi Pasha Grove.","reclaiming; Istanbul; infrastructure; reuse; public sphere; public domain; Üsküdar; Pasa Limani; Fethi Pasa Korusu; institution; urban regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-11","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Design - Public Building","","41.031172, 29.020949"

(mentor); Van der Toorn-Vrijthof, W. (mentor); Harteveld, M. (mentor); Zandbelt, D. (mentor)","2014","Placemaking as a structural tool for the collective end-user to customize the streets; research on the space and guidelines for the Bergweg, Rotterdam Citizen participation has been an important topic within the built environment for quite some time now. In the Netherlands this practice started as panel groups that provided input for the designers of neighbourhoods, and has developed into a mandatory part of public project development. Cooperating with the end user from early on creates a smooth process and decreases the amount of annoyance experienced by the end users. The Dutch government is shifting from a social state into a participation society, therefore the citizen gets a more and more central role in urban renewal. “Individuals and groups, inhabitant and entrepreneurs build, reuse and reorganize dwellings, workplaces, parks and streets or even entire neighborhoods and business parks.” (Ruijs, 2012) At the same time the funds for urban renewal are slowly runnig empty, while the citizen participation model in its current state is very cost intensive and very focussed on a custom approach. To be able to enable the end user as a sustainable partner in the proces of revitalizing the Bergweg, the placemaking process according to Project for Public Spaces is used as a generic tool to be able to design for flexibility. Enabling the end users means providing them with space that has very little restrictions for use, and clear guidelines. This, with constructive facilitation can offer a revitalization proces where the end user plays a central role in the final result. Placemaking Archetypes Placemaking is the transformation of a space into a place. This is a proces that is influenced by the existing built environment, the present end users and the time frame we live in. Within these variables, 4 factors make up the archetypes of places. 1. Placemaker It can be an individual, a group of entrepreneurs, or a owners association. The placemaker is someone who is putting in time and effort for a place, varying from the initiative to maintenance. 2. Lifecycle place How frequent and how long a space is transformed into a place has direct effect on the social-spacial structure, and could also have influence on the fysical-spacial structure. 3. Type / Function place The functions that are added in the public realm consist out of (a combination of) 5 activities De func die worden toegevoegd in de openbare ruimte bestaat uit (een combinatie van) 5 zaken: greenify sitting / cover playing / sport eat / drink expose / art 4. Ownership / Accessibility Place The relationship between a place and public space, considering the accessibiltity and ownership, is an important factor in who is (or can be) involved. This, with the scale and size influence the right for a place to exist. This varies from completely open, to open for contribution or consumption, or completely closed Space When designing space for placemaking, it is important to maintain the road-like functions of a street. This means using the right dimensions for pedestrians, cyclists, cars and in the case of the Bergweg, trams. Traffic safety is one side of the coin. the other is maintaining accessibility for emergency services. Unremovable obstacles should be placed carefully, also considering eventual maintenance for the underground infrastructure. Designing the street in a matter that shows the difference between space ment for placemaking and space that functions as a road is advised. This can be done with difference in material, height, colour and structure. Keeping it simple leaves a larger readibility of the difference between road and space. Guidelines Giving the end user guidelines considering the freedom they have, and the responsibilties this comes with. The placemaking archetypes give the end user a spectrum to choose within. Not obstructing the road function or creating traffic danger is paramount. The more permanent / irremovable a place is (breaking ground), the more it needs to be guided. This means that the placemaker needs to identify him/herself and agree upon taking responsibilty for clean and safe maintenance. Also, in the case of moving out, the transfer or reconstruction of the original situation is a responsibilty of the placemaker. Controlling that the end user does not use the provided space for storage, or unsafe playing, is the responsibility of the local organisation. Method Developing a long term corridor vision for the street is important, a vision that includes the wishes of entrepreneurs and residents. This way property owners can do their part in steering towards the revitalization. Creating a balance between the street as infrastructure, a road, and the street as a destination, for living and shopping, is the core of the vision of the revitalization. Transparancy in the plinth, diversity and extravertedness are recommended for the Bergweg, which has many pre- WWII buildings that provide plenty of identity. Maintaining and re-using the available history is a strengt that creates a differentiating street. Besides offering space and guidelines, it’s important to guide the proces of revitalization. Finding the right matches and entrepreneurs is one side, the other side is letting people do their thing. Providing a digital platform on which the end user can register the place that they make creates a medium that is 24/7 reachable, provides communication and can be used to monitor the street. Forming an organization that is hybride between a Building Improvement District and a owners association is reccommended. This organization can gather the funds, vision and negotiate with the municipality. Furthermore this organisation will be managing the placemaking and the digital platform. This re-assures the end user that they keep control and flexibilty, while the municipality has 1 partner to deal with. Conclusion Providing space and guidelines and using a constructive and modern method can give the end user a central role in urban renewal. It is important that urban professionals guide the vision forming and design process so that a long term impact becomes realistic. Implementing this in a context where the end user has already started making claims can increase the chance of success. Furthermore, changing the current citizen participation model from custom demand into citizen impact, freedom with responsibilities is a shift our government has to make.","placemaking; revitalization; archetypes; eigendom en gebruik openbare ruimte; burgerinitiatieven; Bergweg","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-24","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing + Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Rots, J. (mentor)","2014","Wind industry is developing fast, moving from onshore to offshore and from shallow water to greater depths. At the same time, it is facing significant cost challenges. There are certain advantages to placing wind turbines offshore: better wind resources, economies of scale and increased public acceptance. The cost of traditional substructure solutions for shallow waters, such as monopiles, is greatly increasing with the depth. At the same time, reports show that considerable wind resources could be accessed in deep water, if alternatives to bottom fixed substructures are developed, such as floating wind turbines. Traditionally, their support hulls are manufactured of welded steel plates and represent a major contributor to the final cost of energy. Meanwhile, reinforced concrete is the most utilized material on our planet, in multiple industries, especially in large scale applications. However, the idea of possible cost reductions boosted by the use of alternative construction materials, has received very little attention in the offshore wind industry, with no full scale attempt and only one prototype, to the present date. Two reinforced concrete floaters have ever been built in the offshore oil and gas. Another option for reducing the total cost of floating wind energy could be utilizing large scale turbines which harness more wind. Furthermore, these suggested cost cut alternatives could be coupled into a large scale reinforced concrete floating wind turbine. The present work considers the design and analysis towards an optimizable baseline, of a braceless reinforced concrete semi-submersible supporting a DTU 10MW reference wind turbine. Initially, an extensive literature review is conducted and a design basis is established, given limited previous experience exists. Following, simple analytic formulas are applied to determine the main characteristics of the floater, in terms of its stability and motions, relevant for ensuring an adequate operation. Next, numerical analysis tools are used to confirm these findings. With the determined hydrodynamic and static loads, a quasi-static linear structural analysis with constant material properties is conducted. The floater is modeled as shell elements. The resulting stresses are post-processed based on the actual non-linear material behavior, for the ULS. A corresponding bill of quantities and materials cost estimate are developed, together with an assessment of the CO_2 impact. Consequently, the main conclusions and advice for suitable future research are formulated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Offshore Engineering and Wind Energy","",""

The study is motivated by a very simple question: instead of being eaten up by new towns, can agricultural landscape perform more actively in the process of development? I pick Guangming, a new town being built in Shenzhen, to test the idea of integrating agriculture and urban development.The project is divided into two parts: 1) reasoning the integration of agricultural and new town development; 2) investigating the planning and design methods and tools to facilitate the integration. In the project, agriculture is recognized as an existing entity that should be incorporated in urban development and transformed properly, rather than a new design concept introduced into the Green City Guangming. By analyzing the existing agricultural performance and new town development and theoretical studies on urban agriculture and landscape approach to deal with urban-rural relationship, I argue that agricultural landscape can act as a medium to achieve a more integrated landscape management of the city region, convey ecology into spatial forms, moderate impacts of new town development on local farmers, and deliver public goods for local communities in addition to food production. The new potentials of agriculture implies a new planning approach for urban growth on agricultural land, which is referred as Agricultural Landscape Approach in the project. The five principle of the approach are ecological green network, process over time, landscape characteristics, relevant for people and multi-scalar framework. The approach is tested and evaluated by the development of a city-scale design of Guangming and two district-scale designs, Xinqiang and Jiazitang.","agricultural landscape; new town development; landscape approach; urban agriculture; ecosystem service; urban-rural relationship; China; Shenzhen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-24","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Complex Cities Studio","","22.7119, 113.9386"

For one thing, The interactive route system in my building is an important part of the west to east spatial strategy of our group. For another, I establish connections between the public building route and the diagonal downtown-view route in the design of my building. 3, The design responds to the challenge of the orewalls. Inspired by the original scenery inside the orewalls, I design an interactive route to bridge the historic atmosphere inside the orewalls and the natural environment surrounding it.

(mentor)","2014","Beach state classification, though simple in its concept, is difficult to be distinctly and accurately applied in some real life situations. The issue is further compounded when it is applied to mega- nourishments which, in essence, are morphologically different in terms of an artificially-formed beach versus a naturally-forming beach. Yet, another contributing factor could be due to the difference in geographical locations, with varying wave heights, wave periods and sediment sizes, which result in different permutations of the dimensionless fall-velocity (?) values. The six beach state classification scheme presented by Wright and Short (1984) has been the widely-accepted guidelines in the coastal engineering community. Even when references are made to these diagrams, there is an issue of subjectivity as not all coastal researchers may reach the same conclusion when the same image of a particular nearshore morphology is used. This has been found through a questionnaire finding. This paper thus attempts to present a conceptual quantification technique which analyses the alongshore variability along the coast of the Sand Motor as a basis to classify beach state indiscriminately and objectively. Three beach states, namely Longshore Bar Trough (LBT), Rhythmic Bar and Beach (RBB) and Transverse Bar and Rip (TBR), have been observed at the Sand Motor from bathymetric surveys which spanned a monitoring period of two years. It has been found that the success rate of executing the objective beach state classification via the conceptual quantification technique is 94.0% for LBT, 66.6% for RBB and 54.4% for TBR features. Interestingly, LBT has been found to be the persistent and occasional beach state at the updrift and downdrift of the Sand Motor respectively. Furthermore, it has been observed that these occurrences of beach state along the Sand Motor can be divided into three temporal stages namely the formative, the dormant and the developed phases. Stage I has been associated with the formative period of the Sand Motor since its completion in August 2011. It has largely been affected by the formation of a spit and its subsequent dynamics while advancing towards the downdrift of the Sand Motor. Stage II has been a relatively dormant phase where there were no significant changes to the observed beach states. Stage III is considered the developed phase where beach states could be observed along the whole analysed length of the Sand Motor. These three stages have been found to be sensitive to seasonal variations, particularly the increased number of storm events during winter period. The development of the beach states is also found to be highly dependent on the spit dynamics in the case of the Sand Motor.","Sand Motor; beach states; alongshore variability; bathymetric surveys","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","",""

(mentor)","2014","The initial reason of the sheltering of a community, which is developed in what we nowadays call a city, was the proximity to the natural resources such as the water and the quality of soil and the geomorphological relief and etc. The contemporary city seems to lack of a positive relation between the urban context and the natural landscape in which urban areas and natural landscape interact giving importance and meaning to each other. The quiet new field of landscape architecture stands to the border line between them. The transition moment between the urban and the natural environment creates different edges in the city which construct the image of the whole city. This thesis questions how these edges of the city could be transformed as to create an urban narrative of the spirit of the places and a dialogue of the city and the natural resources. It would be a dialogue within the reshaping of the urban context and specifically the reshaping of the city edges. The spirit of the place, the historical context and the existent natural characteristics are the elements that are involved to this thesis in order to answer with a design approach, the research question of this thesis. The result is a project through scales at two edges of the city: the motorway D2 and the riverfront to Danube. The large scale of the intervention focuses in a focal point of the city where Danube, Carpathians, Medieval city and a motorway coexist.","landscape architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-25","Architecture and The Built Environment","Landscape Architecture","","Flowscapes","","48.0838, 17.0635"

The “computational” nature of the whole process serves as both an opportunity and challenge to develop a design methodology out of analyzing the complexity of current social and climatic context and using these presets as “intrigues” to drive the form-finding process, as well as the performance of the project. This personal project is located in a somehow “extreme” situation: the fact that the surrounding urban context will no longer be existed provides a tricky setup for context research. Moreover, the multi-functional requirements, especially the restricted ones regarding ferry operation, are in the other way around of significant research importance. Consequently, the research process focuses on “creating” an urban context and “illustrating” the inner programme relationship. Computational tools are in crucial status at this stage. It is fair to say this project, at research level, indicates what the Hyperbody graduation studio is searching for in the sense of producing a research outcome to guide the afterwards design, in both urban and architectural level. In practical or social level, this project is definitely an experimental one. However, the purpose of this kind of academic projects is to develop future possibilities of built environment, and research projects could reflect the certain social trend at that time as well as vertically inheriting past wisdoms throughout the history of architecture. If we would call this project “a mat building in digital age”, which exactly indicates the current emerging technology to be influencing the architectural occupation and the whole urban development, meantime referring to the old ideals of integrating urban and architectural scale by designing horizontally spanned building network, we are actually revealing the relationship between this project and wider social context.","computational design; digital form-finding; ferry station; complex programme; climatic ecologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Hyperbody","","51.904641, 4.416428"

The cyclic irregular loading history in this thesis was represented by the equivalent number of cycles Neq with a certain level of cyclic to average stress ratio tcy / ta which can be derived using cyclic shear strain accumulation procedure developed in NGI. The first part is the bearing capacity analysis of bucket foundation in clay. The second part is to produce the displacement contour diagrams. The bearing capacity analysis used in-house software BIFURC from NGI. The normalized failure envelopes were investigated for different degree of cyclic degradation expressed by Neq, soil profiles and bucket foundation geometry h / D. The two soil profiles used in this thesis project were constant cyclic shear strength with depth for OCR=40 and linearly increase cyclic shear strength with depth for OCR=1 & 40. Drammen clay was used as basis for the evaluation. The mobilized ultimate capacity were plotted for pure horizontal load, pure vertical load and pure overturning moment. The loads were applied in the decoupling point, meaning that the pure horizontal load fail under pure sliding. It was found that the three load component were equally influenced by cyclic degradation and that the increase and reduction in the total failure as function of Neq and Fcy / Fa could be defined by one curve for a given OCR. The cyclic effect during combined loading was studied through normalized failure envelopes. The normalized failure envelopes do not change for changing cyclic loading history for the same soil profile. The normalized failure envelopes changed in HM load plane due to different h/D and different soil profiles. The failure envelopes describes a full surface in the 3D load space HVM. Besides, the failure envelopes could be described by formulas suggested by Gourvenec and Barnett with some modifications for the failure envelopes in HM plane. Displacement contour diagrams were produced for a wide range of load combination in HVM load space. MATLAB was used to interpolate the results from bearing capacity analysis to produce the displacement contour diagrams. The displacement contours gives the stiffness for bucket foundation under cyclic loading.","Bucket Foundation; cyclic loading; failure envelope; displacement contours; Offshore wind turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Department of Maritime and Transport Technology","","European Wind Energy Master - EWEM Section of Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The 600 Acre, South Works Master Planning Project is currently being modelled in isolation with the existing social context of South Chicago as well as the overall economics of Chicago as a shrinking city. The graduation project aims at understanding the complicated dynamics of division and segregation in Chicago to arrive at a solution that is deeply rooted in the South Chicago neighbourhood and yet radiates its influence as an important member of a network of similiar projects throughout Chicago. The project presents an opportunity to construct an urban strategy that would mediate between the developer aspirations and the intention to create a motor for the development of the marginalized neighbourhood of South Chicago. De-centralization of desirable places to live, work and relax within the urban limits of Chicago is to be proposed as an antidote to the American model of sub-urban sprawl as the idea of the city. The most important aspect of the project is to identify a catalytic project that with the neighbourhood upgradation would create a branding image for the site and also serve as the kick start for the future developments by attracting the critical mass of pioneer settlers. Building upon the legacy of Chicago to be the forerunner in the field of urban innovation and the natural beauty of the site, an International Think Tank for Urban Research is to be established at the South Works that will bring the initial settlers (students, professors, visitors and local workers) and also transform the South Works Project into an ongoing urban lab for the coming 25-40 years, rather than a restrictive masterplan. In the initial phase of the design process we established 3 key catalytic projects that would be the Limbs (Metro Station), Heart (Library and Vocational Institute) and Brain (Southworks Urban Research Forum) of this entire urban strategy, connecting them with a continuous line of pedestrian streets and plazas. I personally was interested in designing the Southworks Urban Research Forum (SURF) as it aims to be the ambassador of the new way of sustainable and interdependent living that is envisioned in the overall strategy. Also, it was challenging for me to re-think the institutional type while impregnating the restrictive model of research and office building with a public component.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Complex Projects","","52.0017, 4.3725"

Design/methodology/approach - This research sets out the use of scientific knowledge in municipal organisations by analysing real estate strategies. The aspects, barriers and reasons that influence the use of scientific knowledge are researched. The empirical study is wrapped up with solutions which aim to stimulate the use of scientific knowledge to smaller the difficulty of real estate management for municipalities in practice. Findings - The analysis of the real estate strategies shows that only 15% of the municipalities in the research sample uses scientific knowledge. 93% steers on one or more added values of real estate. Most of the municipalities, 68%, steer on cost reduction with regard to real estate. Only 8% of the municipalities steer on promotion of the city using real estate. Municipalities use scientific knowledge to support and clarify real estate management within the municipality. A lot of barriers are identified which refrain the municipalities from using the scientific knowledge. Research limitations/ implications – The results presented in the current study are semi-transparent due to 40 document analysis and the number of 5 interviews. Valuable insights can be produced by executing more interviews with the municipalities of the research sample. Originality/value – The use of scientific knowledge would smaller the difficulty of real estate management for municipalities. Both supply of, and demand for scientific knowledge should be improved to enable municipalities to apply the knowledge.","public real estate management; municipalities; scientific knowledge; the Netherlands","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real estate management","","52.0054382, 4.3695916"

(mentor)","2014","Humanoid robots could perform a large variety of tasks, ranging from helping the elderly and entertainment to carrying out repairs in hazardous environments such as nuclear power plants. Therefore, they are an important topic of research. However, controlling the balance of two-legged robots still proves to be a challenge, especially during more complex motions such as walking. One of the issues is inaccurate knowledge about the state of the robot. Specifically, the Center of Mass and the locations of the feet are required for balancing control. Because of uncertainties in the kinematic chain such as play, link flexibility and parameter uncertainty as well as sensory noise, they are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, a state estimator is proposed making use of the robot’s full-body dynamics to predict the next state. The Unscented Kalman Filter is chosen to fuse the predictions with the measurement. To evaluate the new filter design, a second estimator is implemented as a benchmark, using a conventional Linear Inverted Pendulum Model for the prediction and a Kalman Filter for data fusion. Simulations and a preliminary application were used to investigate the robustness and accuracy. Estimation with a pendulum model gave incorrect estimates in the presence of sensory bias. Using the full-body dynamics, however, the effect of sensory bias was reduced significantly. Moreover, the proposed method was shown to be robust against parametric errors. However, the performance varied between different motions, making it hard to tune. Improving the filter to inherently work for various movements as well as making the filter numerically efficient enough for online implementation still requires further research.","bipedal robot; state estimation; unscented kalman filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Van der Spoel, W.H. (mentor)","2014","A fully glazed facade is a facade which provides maximal advantages for buildings concerning daylight and view. Daylight reduces the energy use for lighting; view provides comfort and gives the possibility to experience the surroundings of the building. The possibility of providing solar entrance into the building has big influence on the reduction of energy consumption for heating in winter period. Applying a fully glazed façade requires necessary measures to control solar entrance in the building. Unwanted solar radiation results in a unwanted heating of the building, increasing the energy consumption for cooling. Unwanted light irradiation leads to discomfort due to overexposure. In the current design practice shading is applied in- or in front of the glazing. The shading (temporarily) outweigh the benefits of the glass surface. A permanent- solar controlling glass prevents the utilization of the heat of the sun in any situation. And an adjustable sun shading device in front of the window is keeping out the heat of the sun, but also keeps out the light and the view. For these reasons, also from an energetic point of view, the amount of glass in a façade is often limited. The façade concept researched in this study is a fully glazed façade that has the ability to shade without drastic reduction of light and view, and that optimizes the energy balance of the building. The facade has two positions: closed and open. The facade in closed position, is flat, vertically oriented, and offers the benefits of insulation and solar gain. When the facade is in open position, it is forward inclined and is creating shading as a result of the inclination. The change of position of the facade is performed by tilting the facade forward. The expectation is that this dynamic facade can provide energy savings compared to existing façade types. The purpose of this study is to calculate the resulting energy consumption of this dynamic facade. Also the façade concept is technical-practical elaborated. The main questions of the research are: What is the energetic performance of the dynamic façade, what is its best configuration, and which mechanisms play a role in the energetic result. The facade is proposed for an office with fully glazed facade. For the calculation of the energy performance, a detailed model of a standard office room and its façade is created. Existing façade types, used to compare the dynamic façade with, are the following conventional variants: - a façade with low g-value, a facade with outdoor blinds, a facade shading by geometry, and a façade with reduced glass area. The technical-practical elaboration of the dynamic façade answers the question of how the adaptable façade can be made in practice. This elaboration focusses on how an adaptable façade can be created while maintaining constant primary functions. The results of the energy performance calculations are the input for the technical elaboration. The method of the research is as follows: first the two static positions of the façade are modelled separately by means of dynamic modelling in TRNSYS. The two positions are combined in a dynamic model of the dynamic façade that is able to change position during simulation, depending on the desired comfort-temperature. The resulting values of energy use for heating and cooling of both the dynamic façade and the conventional variants are compared to each other. Researched is the influence of the properties of the dynamic façade on the resulting energy use. For various locations in Europe, the dynamic facade is compared to the best performing conventional variant(façade with external sun shading). This comparison makes it clear the locations of preference for the dynamic facade. Concerning the technical elaboration; by means of researching the separate elements of the façade, the concept is elaborated into a detailed design. Factors that are addressed are the material choice of the movable layer, the moving of a façade element and the combination of those factors into a façade system. Results are in favour of the dynamic facade. Following from the comparison with the existing types, the dynamic facade gives an energy consumption of a fifth of the best performing static variant. Applying night- cooling changes the advantage of the dynamic façade to a third of the best performing conventional variant. In this comparison the energy use for heating and cooling is used. To get a complete overview of the energy use, the influence of ventilation- energy, lighting- energy and motion- energy needs to be added in the comparison. During the period of the year where normally cooling takes place, the initial state of the facade is opened, and during the period of the year where normally heating takes place, the initial state of the façade is closed. During these periods the facade changes to another phase when the external climatic makes that the thermal comfort otherwise could not be guaranteed. Out of the comparison of the dynamic façade to the conventional, for other climates in Europe, the effect of the dynamic façade depends on the type of summer; locations with a hot summer, compared to locations with a warm summer are reducing the effect. Concluding, the simulated facade is focussing at exchanging heat by means of transmission. The elaboration of the façade is focussing on the combination of the two positions. In closed position the heat transmission is minimized, and in open position the heat transmission is maximized. To ensure constant basic functions of the façade, like water- and air- tightness, and sound isolation, a flexible movable layer with high mass is used. A foldable bellow principle is used to make this layer movable. The resulting façade system is a fully glazed facade with adaptive heat transfer and sun shading.","facade design; climate adaptive building shell; heat transfer; sunshading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Facade design","","52.0066700, 4.3555600"

The research we did about spatial condition before P2 helps to sharp the idea of what kind of intervention should be taken and why it should happen in the place we choose. It helps to make the storyline coherent from the urban strategy to an architectural project.

To this extent, it is important to consider classical flutter for a wind turbine, as here flap and torsion vibration of the blade couple with each other resulting in a potential catastrophic failure of the wind turbine. Classical flutter is considered a dynamic instability boundary problem, which means that there is a specific rotational speed boundary beyond which the fluid-structure interaction becomes unstable. For classical flutter this boundary is the flutter speed. Due to the wind turbine blades getting larger, the possibility of the blades approaching the flutter speed is increased.

The growth also means that it is more difficult for participants to find a possible practical partner due to the large amount of people. The difficulty is also affected by the fact that students do not see each other during courses, and most of the time haven’t met any of the participants from the course. For this Bachelor Project we have improved upon this process by creating an application that can be used to create practical groups without the participants being required to search intensively through all the participants. Participants are able to easily access the application, fill in some relevant information about themselves and then get recommendations of possible practical partners or practical groups. We have divided the project in three phases:  Research and set-up (phase 1)  Design and implementation (phase 2)  Testing, documentation and presentation (phase 3) Each of these phases describes the things that needed to be done during that phase. During the implementation phase we used a known software development framework. This develop- ment framework is known as scrum. Scrum is based on the agile software development framework which can be used to manage software projects. We use the Play framework for development of the application. The Play framework gives us the possibility to easily create a web application using Java. This frameworks follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern applied to the Web architecture. For our recommendation algorithm we used our custom designed algorithm. This algorithm uses the skills defined by the user and the teacher to find the best recommendation with the preferences of the teacher. Creating code with good quality, maintainability and extendability of the system was important during the project. We achieved this using several tools, like Findbugs and Checkstyle. Another important aspect of the project was testing the code. We have performed different kind of tests to ensure good functioning code, to ensure everything is functioning appropriately. For the maintenance of our code we uploaded our code to the Software Improvement Group (SIG) and received an above average rating. During the implementation phase, we already started with testing. Because the system was not com- pleted during this phase, only parts of the system could be tested. We performed different kind of unit tests to provide a basic code coverage. We also used continuous integration, which executed the tests ever time we pushed our code to git. Besides the unit tests we have performed integration tests to ensure the connection between the different components. The testing of the entire system is done after the implementation phase was completed. This was partly done by checking if the final product matches the requirements that were set. It is also done by letting the target audience use the system and document the findings. A working beta implementation of the complete system was delivered as a proof of concept and most of the initially set requirements were fulfilled.","bachelor project; MOOCs; peer matching","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Technische Informatica","",""

Because this place is one of the main resort destinations and brings a lot of income during the summer time, the land value is continuously rising up and people are competing for the few Soviet Union houses that are left and can be reconstructed. Consequently, people who actually grew up in the area or work in the site can not afford housing anymore. Thesis raises the questions such as: what is the future of preservation? How can we use existing values in the Curonian Spit for sustainable development that would improve livability for local people?

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor)","2014","The Aitik mine is the largest copper mine in Sweden. In the surrounding area several minor deposits have been found. If these deposits will be mined the ore can be handled in the concentrator of the Aitik mine, which means that the ore has to be transported to the Aitik mine. Transportation options of one of these satellite mines, 15 km away from Aitik, are investigated. This is based on a pre-feasibility study provided by Boliden. The transportation scenarios of nearby mines have been analysed in order to find similarities to the satellite mine. The similarities are as follows: the Renstrom mine is located 15 km from the concentrator, the ore of the Aitik mine has the same composition and pit of the Kaunisvaara project is in the same order of magnitude. Selection criteria are listed, involving limitations, environmental issues and economics. The criteria are listed from low influence to high influence: forest, animals, emission, shareholders, employees, transportation costs, profit, maximum weight and fragmentation size. Eight different transportation scenarios are listed based on these similarities and selection criteria. Two of these scenarios are further analysed. In these scenarios the ore is loaded on a mine ruck to the surface and further transported with highway trucks to the concentrator. One of these scenarios involves stockpiling before the ore is brought to the concentrator, this is found to be the best option. In this scenario 11 mine trucks with a payload of 50 tonnes, 16 mine trucks with a payload of 25 tonnes, 3 shovels, 1 wheel loader and 4 highway trucks are needed. The total costs of the mining and the transportation to the concentrator will be 36 SEK/tonnes, which is about 5.5 USD/tonnes. Further investigation can be done by changing the duration of the project, in order to conclude what this will do to the costs. One can also investigate what will happen when the equipment will break down and what will happen when the equipment will be leased from a contractor. Finally, the mining schedule and the amount of equipment need to be geared to each other.","transportation; satellite mine; Aitik","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resources Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dekker, M.C. (mentor)","2014","Wrist pain is a common complaint. In the Netherlands the prevalence of hand and wrist complaints is estimated at 125 per 1000 persons. Wrist pain can occur suddenly due to traumatic accidents such as a fall but can also be developed more slowly over a long period of time, leading to chronic pain. The effects of wrist pain on people can be tremendous. When pain has developed such, it can be so severe that someone cannot perform routine tasks such as work or housekeeping. This project focuses on the ‘overuse’ type of wrist pain. At the moment Philips is investigating the use of blue light for wrist pain in the form of a wrist band concept. The goal of this project was to investigate what product interaction is ideal for users suffering from wrist pain, in order to benefit most from the wrist band. Possibilities of other products or services such as smartphone functionality that might contribute to the interaction were taken into account as well. A user study was carried out with 16 participants - from two large groups - who suffer from wrist pain due to overuse of the wrist: office work and racquet sport. The goal of the study was to understand the users and the needs of the user with regards to interactions. The study showed that the two groups were very similar in terms of their pain experiences and wrist band preferences: The wrist band is seen as a serious product aimed to relieve wrist pain. Users would like to use it during their private time at home while relaxing. Most users have treated their pain by an expert, but not with success. They were very positive about the idea of blue light therapy for relieving wrist pain. Most valuable factors in a wrist band solution were application method, use freedom, use friendliness, mobility and safety. The main difference was found in the preference for smartphone functionality, which was more likely related to age and gender. Functions that could have potential were treatment intensity, reminder, remaining time and self-monitoring, dependent on the feedback provided via the smartphone screen. Two realistic concepts were developed based on user needs, technology, Philips brand and product portfolio: Top-battery and Separated-battery. The concepts differ in battery and user interface positions, which leads to a different size, balance and related interaction. For each concept a physical model (mock-up) was built. Several smartphone interfaces were designed capturing the functions that were most interesting. An interactive prototype of the functions of the device and smartphone application was developed using Adobe Flash software. To validate the concepts with end-user’s feedback, the concepts were evaluated by wearing the prototypes and simulating the functions. The majority of users prefer a compact wrist band with controls on top and without solid components on the bottom. Users had a positive experience when imitating the functions, which was very easy once they have used it. The smartphone application did not add much value as almost all users mentioned that the focus is more on the band itself. A final concept and mock-up were developed building upon Top-Battery with the main solid components located on the top. The batteries are partly integrated in the textile and the top area is made thicker to create a smoother transition between textile and housing. The band looks much more compact after reducing the volume of the housing. The application method is improved by putting most of the weight in the middle of the band which gives a clear indication of the position of the device and allows application without the need for a surface to support it. The housing is rounded on one side, suggesting the position of the device. Finally, the interface has been optimized such that the functions are easy to interact with even from first use.","interaction; user experience; wrist pain; light therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Four samples of bentonite mines in the {\""U}nye region are researched, the M1, M2, M3 and M4 mine. The suitability of drilling fluid, foundry sand, soil improvement and bleaching earth applications is found through research on the characteristics of bentonite and by testing the specifications of the chosen applications. In this research the following bentonite characteristics are determined: cation exchange capacity, chemical composition, free swelling capacity, liquid limit, methylene blue adsorption, moisture content, pH, plastic viscosity, specific surface, swelling index and yield point. Characteristics are tested according the associated methods of the specifications. For drilling fluid, the API 13A and OCMA Standard is used. The IS 12446:2007 by the Bureau of Indian Standard is used for foundry sand. For the applications of soil improvement and bleaching earth international standards cannot be found. For this reason a specification of the European Commission on soil improvement is used. Recommended ranges found in literature are used in testing the suitability of bentonite for bleaching earth. The results of this research show a suitable outcome for the use of drilling fluid. The M1 and M4 sample are API qualified and the M3 sample is conform the OCMA Standard. For foundry sand the bentonite samples are not suitable, all samples are not performing good enough on water absorption and cation exchange. Due to found traces of lead contamination in the M1, M3 and M4 bentonite samples, but these samples are still suitable in soil improvement according to the specifications of the European Commission. However, in the M2 sample there is no trace found of any heavy metal contamination and is, except the low nutrient content, suitable for soil improvement. All samples are very close to the recommended ranges found in literature for bleaching earth, therefore all samples are suitable for the application.","Bentonite; Characterisation; Drilling Fluid; Foundry Sand; Soil Improvement; Bleaching Earth","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

The project presents a relational analysis and the ability to extrapolate the particular condition of an individual farmer in Frampol, today, from the historic events during the Second World War, the subsequent Socialist regime and the unprecedented acceleration of history and radical transformation Poland has experienced in the past two decades. Thus, the farmer is a synecdoche for the collision of larger forces, a historic legacy which claims more time to come to terms with and a pressing future set out by global trends and European visions. Rather than superimposing western development concepts and methods in a region and town which are still rich with spatial and culturally specific agricultural tradition, the project emphasizes the preservation of local diversity for a stronger (European) whole.","EU financial instruments; integrated development strategy; rural land fragmentation; underpass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Design as Politics","","50.6736, 22.6681"

The lack of interaction among different social groups can be seen as a result of multiple barriers---power fragmentation, dual city character, physical boundary and separated life circles. In order to improve the low-quality urban environment, these areas are becoming the focus of urban regeneration area for government. But the current regeneration process results in similar high-end building plots, which are no longer affordable for low-income groups. They have to move further from the city centre searching for other cheap places to live, making the segregation issue even severer.

Research and recording of the existing structure form the basis for the redesign process following subsequently. Investigation applied on all different scales of analysis (Urban, Architectural, Technical) pursues to construct a clear perception and understanding of the existing structure, concerning not only the current state of the observed object, but also a thorough tracing of the past. Fundamental springboard of the re-design approach has been the principle that every building or site of historical and social importance draws its sustenance from the qualities and substance of the surrounding life of the context area. By composing old and new under a well-bonded, interwoven fabric, the new design aims to activate the reciprocal offering process of the introvert enclave and the city around it, engaging maybe for the first time a synergetic relationship between the two poles. By re-instating the interaction between the intimate soul of the buildings and the public space, the sustainable, perpetual existence of the composition, as an indispensable component of the urban life can be substantially materialized.","Armamentarium; reuse; transformation; restoration; introversion; Delft; laboratory; old; new; complex; extroversion; monument; historic; values; redesign; refurbishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","R-MIT Research on Restoration, Modification, Intervention and Transformation","","52.006518, 4.360404"

Transparency is an important parameter for many architectural buildings. The need for a large percentage of a transparent envelope often contradicts with other conditions (like thermal or acoustic insulation) that the building needs to fulfill. Transparent polymers are a strong candidate for changing glass as the only transparent material for curtain walls. For years, glass has satisfy designer’s demands to have transparent facade with low U-value, long life span and non flammable material. The main advantages of using polymers instead of glass are that they are less brittle than glass, less weight than glass, and the ultimate strength of polymers can be higher than glass. Four polymers will be discussed in this manual, to give designing directions for alternatives to glazing. The case studies that were chosen have a characteristic performance in one or more categories and therefore are interesting and are being analysed.","AR0533 Innovation & Sustainability","en","student report","","","","","","","Campus only","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

To be able to determine the cause of the head trauma with sufficient accuracy, biomechanical analysis using finite element modeling of the infant cranium has been established. By simulating the trauma, one may be able to obtain the fracture propagation of the skull and from it determine if the scenario narrative is plausible. Geometry of skull, sutures, scalp and brain of a 2 month old infant head was obtained using CT images and meshed using voxel hexahedral meshing. Simulation of an impact to the head from a fall of 0.82 m height, to a rigid floor, was carried out in the non-linear finite element program LS-Dyna. Two scenarios were simulated: an impact to the occipital-parietal bones and an impact to the right parietal bone. The fracture propagation was obtained using the Chang-Chang Composite Failure Model as a constitutive model for the skull bones. The amount of material parameters gathered in the present study to predict fracture of the infant skull has not been obtained before, to the best knowledge of author. Validation of the models’ ability to show relatively correct fracture propagation was carried out by comparing the obtained fracture pattern from the parietal-occipital impact against published fracture patterns of infant PMHS skulls from a free fall onto a hard surface. The fracture pattern was found to be in good compliance with the published data. The fracture pattern in the parietal bone from the impact was compared against a fracture pattern from a previously constructed model at STH. The patterns of the models show some similarities but improvements to the model and further validations need to be carried out.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","COSSE","",""

(mentor)","2014","This master’s thesis presents a design intervention aiming to redefine people’s smart-phone usage, preceded by an investigation into the present-day social issue of people’s high strivings. The aim of the thesis has been to explore how a design approach can contribute to improving people’s mental health, by means of interventions that support people in their daily lives. The project has been in cooperation with the Trimbos Institute, a centre of expertise on mental health, which develops and applies their knowledge for the benefit of the health of the Dutch population. Several developments in our performance-driven society - such as the growing number of people experiencing stress - indicate that people are often setting too high expectations for themselves and consequentially experience less subjective well-being. When people have multiple strivings that interfere with one another, e.g. meeting a deadline and spending time with friends, they experience conflicting life-goals. A framework has been developed summarizing the compentences people need to posess to constructively deal with conflicting life-goals. An essential competence is for people to questioning their own (limiting) convictions. Nowadays, people subconciously feel the need to be connected and are afraid of missing out. This conviction underlies people’s urge to compulsively check their mobile phone, also referred to as phubbing. The goal of this project has been to make people question whether they can miss out by making it feel absurd to constantly check your phone. The Attention Seekers is a set of interactive coasters that respond to mobile phone usage within its surroundings. A radio-frequency detector recognizes when mobile phones are being actively used and a small mechanism makes the coasters slowely move around, thereby playfully grabbing people’s attention. The device confronts people in social settings with their urge to constantly check and respond to messages. The absurd response of the device make people concious of their behaviour and reconsider the necessity of phubbing.","design; conflicting life-goals; phubbing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Nick, H.M. (mentor); Jansen, J.D. (mentor); Hagedoorn, S. (mentor)","2014","This thesis looks into the possibility to produce geothermal energy in the Roer Valley Graben. The locations in this area are limited due to the low permeability of the deep Triassic layers. Fractures can enhance the heat production by increasing the effective permeability and decrease the pressure that is needed to produce the heat. However, fractures can also decrease the lifetime of a reservoir due to early breakthrough of the cold water. The goal of this study is to explore the influence of fractures on geothermal heat production. Multiple 2D fracture patterns are modelled in a numerical finite element program and the fractures are represented as lower dimensional line elements. The breakthrough time is strongly influenced by the position of the horizontal fractures. A smaller spacing between the fractures decreases the breakthrough time and the breakthrough time is increased if the orientation of the doublet is not in line with the fractures. The vertical fractures also influence the breakthrough if the fractures are connected to horizontal fractures. The standard Advection-Diffusivity Equation (ADE), applied to an effective porous media, is fitted to the breakthrough curves of the numerical models by changing the apparent thermal dispersion. A different method, the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) framework is also fitted to the numerical breakthrough curves. This framework, that is developed to describe solute transport, has five parameters that can be changed to create a fit. The global breakthrough curve is captured better by the CTRW, however the breakthrough is better described by the ADE. Both methods show similar results estimating the lifetime of the numerical model. To determine when the ADE is able to describe the breakthrough curve of a certain fracture model, the area of influence of the fracture model is plotted against the error between the numerical experiment and the ADE. If the area of influence of a fracture pattern is small, the ADE has trouble describing the breakthrough curve correctly. If the full width of the model is not covered by the area of influence, two cold fronts evolve, one through the fractures and one through the matrix. If the cold front of the matrix would arrive at the outlet before the cold fluid through the fractures has cooled down the outlet, the breakthrough curve could not be described by the ADE. If the fractures are placed in each other's area of influence the cold injected fluid can travel further because it is less retarded by the matrix, creating an even earlier breakthrough. I found that the area of influence also influences the apparent thermal dispersion. A negative relation could be constructed between the two parameters. The discussion about thermal dispersion and its dependency on Peclet is also addressed in this thesis. Different relations between Peclet and the apparent thermal dispersion are studied and the relations varied from a linear relation to a power law relation. I found that the three regimes that Detwiler (2000) constructed for solute longitudinal dispersion can also be constructed for the apparent thermal dispersion. For values of Pe smaller than 1, the apparent thermal dispersion has a very small negative to zero relation with Pe. For intermediate values of Pe (between 1 and 10) Peclet is linearly related to the apparent thermal dispersion and for larger values of Peclet a power law relation can be constructed. The power law and the additional thermal dispersion parameters are dependent of the subsurface parameters and the fracture pattern. The three regimes are constructed for a fracture/matrix permeability ratio between 8.000 and 8.000.000.","geothermal; heat transport; fracture; thermal transport; Roer Valley Graben; dispersion; energy; brabant; breakthrough; CTRW; Continous Time Random Walk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

The aim of this manual is the description and comparison of several systems and strategies for cooling buildings in hot humid climates. To cool down a building you need to move the energy from a space or from the air to outside. In a hot humid climate you also need a supplemental dehumidification system to maintain the relative humidity (RH) below 60%, and this can be a large part of the total energy consumption of a building. In recent years, non-efficient mechanical air conditioners have been (ab)used to control the temperature, relative humidity and air purity in order to achieve indoor comfort. The shortage and the environmental impact of conventional energy sources and the increasing of their cost is pushing toward the introduction of new “energy saving” technologies for cooling and, at the same time, the return to the use of natural techniques during the design process. This manual explains a method to achieve comfortable sustainable building design in hot humid climates. Start with knowing the climate, and be aware of what affects the thermal comfort of building’s inhabitants. In the design, first use passive cooling strategies, then apply one or a combination of different active systems to achieve thermal comfort. Finally, check if the building matches the size and the features of one of the case studies provided.","AR0533 Innovation & Sustainability","en","student report","","","","","","","Campus only","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Thin cylindrical shells are commonly employed in civil and structural applications in which the dominant loading condition is global bending. In applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles, the design of the structure is commonly limited by buckling. The traditional approach to improving buckling strength pursuant of greater design economy is to use steel ring and/or axial stiffeners. However, the total steel tonnage may be reduced with stiffeners, but the additional fabrication costs can limit the cost advantage. Meanwhile, it has long been observed in the silo industry that granular filled cylinders exhibit strength gains due to the internal pressure and stiffness of the granular bulk solid against the shell wall. For large diameter fabricated steel tubes in bending, an elastic granular fill may be useful in replacing ring stiffeners, increasing critical buckling moments, and reducing risk by providing more stable postbuckling behaviour. However, the strength gains related to the elastic stiffness of a granular core has received very little attention and has been limited to the axial loading condition. In the project work, the candidate uses theoretical and computational methods to investigate the effects of an elastic granular fill on the buckling strength of cylindrical shells subject to global bending. In particular, cylinders in the elastic-plastic range will be considered in order to represent applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles. Effects of an elastic bulk fill on strength gains and imperfection sensitivity are considered with interest in improving design economy.","buckling; granular fill; bending; cylinder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor)","2014","Because of the focus on weight minimization, aircraft are becoming more and more flexible. Therefore, the frequency separation between flight mechanics motion and structural vibration decreases. This calls for a flight mechanics model that includes aeroelasticity. The development of such a model was the subject of the current research. This model can be used for gust and maneuver load prediction in the preliminary design phase. With accurate load prediction, structural integrity can be ensured and unstable flight conditions can be avoided. Moreover, the model may be used to design active load alleviation systems to increase passenger comfort, reduce fatigue, and decrease loads on the wing structure. A modal structural model and a quasi-steady aerodynamics model are integrated in a partitioned manner to form an aeroelastic wing model. This aeroelastic wing model is implemented in a multibody dynamics environment, in order to model flight dynamics and the effect of aeroelasticity thereon. An A320-like aircraft was analyzed in the current research. The effect of aeroelasticity on flight mechanics was investigated. Inclusion of flexibility substantially affected the trim control variables, but had an almost negligible effect on the flight mechanics modes and stability derivatives. When flexibility increases, these parameters are affected. Aeroelasticity has a non-negligible effect on the (peak) wing loads after maneuvers or disturbances. Especially for maneuvers or disturbances that increase lift, and therefore wing deformation, the peak loads are affected. Moreover, wing loads are particularly affected by disturbances that have a direct effect on the wing, such as aileron deflection. The objective of the current research was to improve on an existing aeroelastic flight mechanics model, based on the lumped-parameter approach. The modal model created in the current research proved to have a computational effort that is several times lower than the lumped-parameter model. In addition, the accuracy of the modal model can be increased beyond that of the lumped-parameter model at only a small additional computational cost. Because of the reduced computational cost, and the potentially increased accuracy, the modal model performs better than the lumped-parameter model. Due to the qualitative nature of these conclusions, it is probable that they can be extended to other conventional, low aspect-ratio aircraft in the subsonic flight regime. Definitive, quantitative conclusions could not be formulated, because of the absence of complete validation data.","multibody dynamics; aeroelasticity; SimMechanics; flight dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2014","Surface water is microbiological unsafe, contains too much salts and is polluted with anthropogenic substances like pesticides, medicines, endocrine disruptors and industrial chemicals. The production of safe drinking water out of this water is only possible by applying a robust treatment. A process that can remove virtually all unwanted substances from the water in one step is reverse osmosis (RO). The main bottleneck in the wider application of RO with spiral wound membranes is the membrane fouling. This occurs on the feed spacer of the spiral wound membranes and at the membrane surface. This fouling occurs with particles, salts and/or microorganisms and results in a raise in pressure drop and reduction in permeate quality. An innovative idea to deal with above mentioned drawbacks is a membrane process in which spiral wounded NF/RO membrane elements are cleaned hydraulic (mechanically). The membrane is placed vertical and the membrane fouling is controlled by means of a periodic air/water flush, AiRO called (combination of the words air and RO). This AiRO process line needs hardly any pretreatment, is free of antiscalant dosage, uses less chemicals than traditional NF/RO and the concentrate is easy to dispose to surface water. The semi practical AiRO research described in this thesis is carried out with an automated pilot plant that was equipped with 2 8” RO membranes. The pilot was placed at the banks of the Hollandse IJssel river in Montfoort. The pre treatment was a drum filter. The pilot was started up in December 2010 and operated non stop for one and a half year. The research has shown that AiRO is a reliable robust barrier in a surface water purification process line. There is no effect on the operation of the process if the turbidity of the feed water varies between 4 and 75 FTU and if the oxygen content in the feed water varies (indication for microbiology). The process appeared to be economic interesting and withstood the practical durability test. Pre treatment of the feed water of the AiRO with a 120 µm micro strainer is sufficient. The commonly in Netherland applied 35 µm micro strainer is advised because it will give advantages for the AiRO process (less wear in pumps and energy recovery) and will promote the surge for a solution for the concentrate. Commercial available NF/RO elements are applicable in AiRO and the membrane stack is composed with pressure vessels with 2 8” elements in series. The investment costs of a complete drinking water treatment with the AiRO process are 20 to 33% lower than a treatment based on UF and RO. The application of 16” pressure vessels containing 2 16” elements in series may result in even lower investment costs. A flush was executed with the maximum allowed feed pressure (specs. Membrane manufacturer), the flush water velocity was 0,2 m/s in the membrane feed spacer, and with an air velocity of 0.24 Nm/s. Energy recovery from concentrate (Fedco) is essential to obtain energy efficiency. The flush program that resulted in a stable operation of the process consists of the steps. The flush interval is 4 hours and pressure drop NPD is the parameter for fine tuning of the interval duration. A flush should start if the NPD doesn’t rise linear anymore. A CIP has to take place, if the NPD before a flush rises above 50 kPa. The applied chemicals have to be balanced on the feed water composition. Manganese oxides by example are hardly washed out by a flush, they have to be removed during a CIP with citric or ascorbic acid. The design recovery is 35% and operation of AiRO at this low recovery results in a large concentrate stream, which is free of antiscalant and with a low content of salts. This flow is expected to be allowed to discharge to surface water. The flush water can be discharged to surface water, after sedimentation of the solids in it. The produced sludge is free of chemical additions. This will improve the useful application of the sludge. The used CIP fluid has to be discharged to the sewer after neutralisation of the pH.","water treatement; RO; airflush; waterflush","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","","52.10543, 5.05868"

(mentor)","2014","Traditionally, voltage control in MV distribution networks has been focused on dealing with voltage drop along radially operated feeders. The actual implemented controllers use local voltage measurements and have been designed and calibrated for a passive and radial use of the MV system. The presence of distributed renewable generation (DRG) makes these assumptions no longer valid. The power generated by DRG units will increase the voltage at adjacent nodes and even cause it to be higher than the voltage at the primary substation. Consequently, the presence of DRG will affect voltage control in distribution systems and it needs to be reconsidered whether methods like local voltage control and reactive power injection can still enable the network operator to cope with the newly introduced voltage rise issues. The aim of this study is to create a new voltage control strategy, which will not only successfully limit voltage variations, but also allow for an increased penetration of DRG. The proposed coordinated voltage control strategy deploys control of HV/MV transformers On-Load Tap Changers in combination with active power control provided by Intelligent Nodes, that allows network reconfiguration. The Cigré MV distribution network benchmark is used as a basis for the test system, while appropriate models for the PV Power Plants, the Wind Power Plants and the Intelligent Nodes were developed. In order to draw realistic simulation results, a summer / winter seasonal variation is featured. The proposed voltage control algorithm is incrementally developed, allowing for the identification of factors hindering the controller performance and the development of a control algorithm which is more targeted towards dealing with specific issues. The commercial power system simulation software DIgSILENT PowerFactory 15.0 is used for carrying out these simulations. The analysis of simulation results shows that the proposed voltage control strategy is capable of facilitating the transition towards active MV distribution networks, by offering considerably higher DRG penetration levels and strictly bound network voltages. The modelled controller is particularly applicable to MV distribution networks across North Europe. Among others, the limiting factors for an increased DRG penetration are identified, along with the effects that the reactive power control and the choice of voltage limits have. Finally, recommendations for future research are provided.","voltage control; MV distribution network; distributed renewable generation; On-Load Tap Changer; Intelligent Node","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-23","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Moan, T. (mentor); Gao, Z. (mentor)","2014","In recent years, offshore wind energy has experienced a huge development. Floating wind turbines may become competitive for water depth larger than 50m. However, high cost is still the main challenge for the offshore wind industry. Floating offshore designs provides the possibility to carry large wind turbines to reduce the cost per MWh. In this thesis, a pontoon-type semi-submersible platform has been designed to support the DTU 10MW reference wind turbine. The initial design is made though upscaling of an existing 5MW semi-submersible platform design. The design is then checked against buoyancy, stability, hydrodynamic and strength criteria. In addition a spread catenary mooring system has been designed based on the catenary theory. Further tests show that clump weight might be needed to balance the strength and stiffness of the mooring lines. Floating wind turbine models with different levels of complexity have been established and studied through the thesis. In addition, viscous drag force and second order wave force have been implemented. Finally the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn model is established, and extensive numerical tests have been performed to check the model. The modelling of blades, hub, nacelle and shaft has been found to be difficult and will result in some difficulties in eigenfrequency prediction of the wind turbine. It is also found that the blade pitch controller can excite large platform pitch resonant motion at above rated wind speeds, which could be possibly solved by reducing the PI gains of the controller. Finally, time domain coupled dynamic analysis of the floating wind turbine system is performed by the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn code. Characteristic responses of the semi-submersible floating wind turbine are studied and compared to those of the land-based wind turbine. It is found that platform motions have limited influence on the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine. Besides, operating at rated wind speed is found to produce the largest blade and tower bending moments for both land-based and floating wind turbines. For the floating wind turbine, resonant surge and pitch motions could be excited by turbulent wind under operational conditions which will dominate the response. Second order wave force has some influences on the surge and pitch resonant responses, but these influences are small comparing to those of turbulent wind. However, second order wave force could be important for the study of heave motion, which is wave force dominated even under turbulent wind conditions.","floating wind turbine; semi-submersible; DTU 10MW RWT; coupled dynamic analysis; platform design; SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering / European Wind Energy Master program Offshore Engineering track","",""

(mentor)","2014","In history scientists and engineers have constantly been looking into nature for innovative solutions to problems and questions they encounter. This is also the case for the maritime industry and more specific for those interested in developing new types of propulsion, continuously seeking improved efficiency in the chase for lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. Oscillating foil propulsion is such a development. When investigating fish, it was seen that some fish types use the motions of their tail to behave as an oscillating foil (so-called carangiform mode of propulsion) resulting in a form of unsteady flow thereby generating efficient propulsion. The oscillating behaviour of the foil consists generally of heaving and pitching motions combined with a forward motion resulting in a periodic cycle, which can easily be described mathematically. This oscillatory motion results in the creation of a (time-averaged) velocity profile in the wake behind the foil resembling an unstable jet caused by vortex shedding from the foil. The shed vortices forma so-called reverse von Kármán (vortex) street, resulting in the jet being formed behind the foil. This jet, when controlled correctly and under the correct conditions, will manifest itself as a momentum excess resulting in a thrust force. The shedding, strength and form of the vortices themselves can be controlled through control of the different kinematic parameters involved in order to form an efficient maritime propulsor. The current research focuses on a RANS-based numerical model to simulate oscillating foil behaviour and its application as a viable maritime propulsor. The research identified the most important kinematic parameters, being the Strouhal number and the angle of attack profile, and the importance of the vortex formation, timing and interaction. The created understanding of the phenomena behind also form the base for the development of the numerical methodology (choices made). The numerical model is developed within ANSYS FLUENT® and uses a dynamic, moving mesh approach to simulate the foil behaviour. The definition of the motion, and consequent mesh motion, proofed a great modelling challenge but was eventually overcome. The resulting model applies a two-dimensional finite volume RANS-based approach using second-order spatial discretisation schemes, a first-order implicit time discretisation scheme and the k ¡! SST turbulence model. The model is verified using different verification procedures to test a wide range of settings and choices of the numerical approach. The verification study determined the appropriate grid size, time step and that the application of an additional flow transition model is not deemed necessary. It also shows through a momentum flux analysis that the calculated forces make sense. The conclusions of the verification study concerning these settings form the base for further modelling in the validation study. A validation study is performed over a wide range of different parameters, each relating to a different objective of the numerical model. It is proven that the influence of a variation in Strouhal number, a changing angle of attack and a higher Reynolds numbers can be modelled. Flow visualisation comparisons also proofed the capabilities of the model in accurately visualise (and predict) the relevant flow phenomena. A comparison with other numerical results identified the model to produce similar results compared to other codes and these conclusions can be used for further model improvement and analysis. The numerical results produced are validated using an uncertainty assessment, in which the comparison between the validation uncertainty and numerical comparison error is shown to be appropriate. The uncertainty assessment quantifies the numerical modelling error as acceptable and proofs the validity of the used modelling approach. The qualitative model evaluation, which follows, shows several interesting fields for further use of the model (as there are hull interaction studies, further improvement of the propulsive efficiency and uses of oscillating foils in other areas). The evaluation is concluded by stating that the used k ¡! and dynamic mesh capability are essential parts, required for a RANS-based model to accurately simulate oscillating foil behaviour.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor)","2014","We are currently facing an increasing amount of challenges in the area of photonics as more and more applications in need for active “photon control” sprout in different fields of science. Adaptive Optics (AO) is the subject which deals with measuring, reconstructing, and reshaping the phase of a photon wavefront in real-time and can, thus, provide the framework for controlling the photons in areas such as medicine, astronomy and telecommunications, among others. The objective of this graduation project is to create a novel distributed method for wavefront reconstruction, integrate the method in an AO loop, and analyse its properties. This method will use the intensity distribution measured by the wavefront sensor instead of the classical slope approximation (obtained using a centroid algorithm). Using the complete intensity distribution gives us more information than the slope approximation and therefore, a more accurate reconstruction is expected. Moreover, we will estimate the wavefront using B-splines basis functions. These splines are defined locally which makes them suitable for the application of distributed reconstruction methods. The content of this thesis is divided into two distinct parts. In the first part, we analyse the different components of an AO system with special emphasis on the state-of-the-art phase retrieval methods. Furthermore, the B-splines framework is presented alongside distributed optimization techniques with special emphasis on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The second part of the thesis uses the theoretical information from the first chapters to support the development of one centralized and two distributed algorithms for solving phase-retrieval problems using pupil-plane sensors. The results from these methods, together with the results from a compressive sampling method which decreases the quantity of measurements used, are presented in the last chapters. It was verified in simulation experiments that the average reconstruction error achieved by the novel centralized method surpasses the classical approaches which use slope measurements for aberrations with an RMS value smaller than the wavelength. It is also shown that the variance of the reconstruction error using the novel method is reduced by two orders of magnitude. Regarding the two distributed methods (unstructured and structured ADMM applications), it is shown that the unstructured method has a very low convergence rate which renders this method unpractical for real-time applications. The structured method showed much more promising results given that it was able to converge to within a 5% tolerance of the optimal centralized solution after 50 ? 150 iterations. This method can also be implemented in a completely decentralized manner which is suitable for a GPU/FPGA implementation.","Distributed Optimization; Adaptive Optics; Wavefront Reconstruction; Splines; B-Splines; ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC (Delft Center for Systems and Control)","","","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Van der Meer, F. (mentor); Chatzi, E. (mentor)","2014","This master thesis details the investigation of the effect of geometrical imperfection on thin shell structures using general FEM software packages. The author proposes a finite element based method for the analysis and design of thin shell structures, and describes the implementation of such a procedure on four different FEM packages. The procedure involves the assessment of imperfection sensitivity of a design, and imposing geometrical imperfection in the shape of the first buckling mode prior to a geometrically non-linear analysis. Starting with thin metallic cylinders, by incorporating imperfection to the surface, the author shows that ANSYS is capable of reproducing resulting similar to Koiter's asymptotic theory and to experimental data. The author further demonstrates the robustness and easy-to-use nature of the imperfection procedure by implementing it on four simple yet realistic structures with both symmetric and asymmetric load cases. For extremely imperfection sensitive structures such as an axially loaded cylinder. The author then introduces four different types of imperfection that may be imposed in place of the first buckling mode, and gauges the effectiveness of each with a modified knock-down factor. By varying the vertical curvature, it is discovered that an axisymmetric imperfection shape governs the ultimate buckling capacity of any near-cylindrical shells. An theory is being developed that explains the effect of the axisymmetric shape. Change in Gaussian curvature is calculated as the end of every load step in the FEM analysis. By plotting the change in Gaussian curvature, the onset of buckling can be readily defined. Finally, physical non-linearities are introduced to the FEM models to gauge the effect of yielding and cracking on a steel cylinder, and a reinforced concrete (RC) cooling tower respectively. It is found that metal buckles within the elastic range, and yielding eliminates post-buckling capacity without altering the ultimate capacity. With RC cracking, it is discovered that instability occurs soon after cracks develop at the buckles of the imperfection shape, therefore reducing the capacity by as much as 8 times from that of the elastic model.","shell; buckling; finite element method; imperfection; koiter; curvature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","","51.998717, 4.375754"

(mentor); Popov, M. (mentor)","2014","The preferred technology for connecting far from shore offshore wind plants to the onshore AC power system is the voltage-source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission system. There is a large number of advantages, namely, the decoupled active and reactive power control, the capability to reverse power flows without changing voltage polarity and finally, the capability to operate in weak and isolated power systems. Beside the above mentioned advantages, HVDC systems are capable to transport large amounts of power within large distances. The minimal cable power loss makes it desirable to use HVDC technologies in order to transport electrical power for distances above 60 km. Future power systems are expected to include large in-feed of power electronic based generation as a result of converter interfaced renewable energy resources. Furthermore, the construction of a Pan-European HVDC transmission network, mainly used as bulk transmission system, will enable the inter-connection of previously asynchronous systems in a multi-terminal DC grid. Furthermore, it will enable large offshore wind power plants to be part of this MTDC grid. However, even if it seems that the onshore AC power systems are inter-connected in a MTDC grid, the HVDC converters forming part of the MTDC network will decouple the AC power system dynamics. Having the networks decoupled, in case of disturbances such as faults, tripping of generation unit, puts the system’s frequency stability into greater risk. The present thesis deals with the study of different methods of providing primary frequency response by making use of the multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) network. The AC systems’ primary frequency response is investigated, and controllers for provision of primary response are proposed. To this purpose, two configurations have been studied, a point-to-point and a multi-terminal topology. In both situations an offshore wind park is connected, through VSC-HVDC transmission, to one or more onshore AC power systems, modelled by single machine dynamic model. The time-average, instantaneous value modelling approach is used for the VSC-HVDC system; it contains control systems, phase-locked loop and detailed representation of DC transmission lines. The controllers proposed for the primary frequency response study are: a frequency droop controller which provides primary frequency response, a synthetic inertia emulation controller implemented on the DC voltage control loop of the HVDC converter and finally, a synthetic inertia controller using the frequency derivative, directly measured at the grid connection point. Since the power injection by a voltage-source converter can be controlled, the above mentioned controllers can be used to assist the frequency response of the AC power systems. Following a disturbance (i.e. trip of a unit), the frequency droop control method utilizes the deviation in system frequency from the nominal value, to adjust the power being supplied to the AC area. The synthetic inertia emulation controller employs the energy stored in the capacitors to emulate inertia response by changing the DC link voltage reference, based on the variation of the AC system’s frequency. In a MTDC scheme, such a method can be used to provide exchange of primary frequency reserves between asynchronous areas. The last control method uses the frequency derivative to control the active power in the converters, to strengthen the primary frequency response of the AC system undergoing a disturbance. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the above control parameters is performed to investigate various interactions between the AC and the DC system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Sustainable Energy Technology","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

Omdat in het onderzoek van Van 't Wout de implementatie van het driedimensionale probleem erg foutgevoelig is, willen we een één-dimensionaal probleem opstellen dat zich, hopelijk, hetzelfde gedraagt als het driedimensionale geval. We zullen daarbij iets zeggen over de stabiliteit en convergentie van de oplossing. Hiervoor bepalen we eerst een nauwkeurige referentieoplossing op basis van een discretisatie met centrale eindige differenties voor plaats en tijd. Deze gebruiken we om de convergentie aan te tonen van de oplossingen van de andere methoden. Daarna gebruiken we basisfuncties voor de plaats en centrale differentie voor de tijd. Als laatste kijken we naar zowel basisfuncties voor de plaats als de tijd. Door te kijken naar een één dimensionaal probleem is de implementatie veel gemakkelijker. Dit maakt het analyseren van de TDIE methode betrouwbaarder en vooral een stuk eenvoudiger. Dit zou ons informatie kunnen geven over het lastige driedimensionale geval. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de TDIE-methode stabiel is voor de tijdsbasisfuncties Quadratic Lagrange, Cubic Lagrange en Quadratic Spline. Cubic Spline blijkt alleen voor grotere CFL(Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy)-waarden stabiel te zijn. Het CFL-getal is het verband tussen dt en dz/c. Tevens convergeren de verschillende tijdsbasisfuncties naar de referentieoplossing. We kunnen echter niet de orde van convergentie bepalen met behulp van de referentieoplossing omdat voor verschillende CFL-getallen de oplossingen een klein faseverschil hebben. Hierdoor komen de datapunten niet overeen en geeft het een verkeerde orde van convergentie. De convergentie van de basisfuncties zelf komt wel overeen met de orde die is gegeven voor deze basisfuncties. Wel moet een groot CFL-getal gekozen worden om in het asymptotisch stabiele gebied te zitten. Bevinden we ons hier nog buiten, dan kan de orde van convergentie verschillen.","TDIE; electromagnetic scattering","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Bachelor Technische Wiskunde","",""

(mentor); Wijdeven, B. (mentor); Van den Bos, W. (mentor); Van der Hout, A.J. (mentor)","2014","Traditionally, ports are located in areas protected by natural shelter. Shelter is needed for the safe mooring of vessels and for the efficient handling of containers and other cargo. Disadvantage of the areas which provide natural shelter is their limiting depth. Due to the increasingly bigger vessels, dredging in ports became inevitable. Besides that, ports with large breakwaters were constructed in the coastal zone. Vessel dimensions are still growing and problems, with for example the limiting depth of a port, become bigger. This study proposes another way of thinking: bring the port to a large natural water depth instead of bringing a large water depth to the port with dredging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the open container port concept. An open port is defined as an offshore and environmentally exposed port. The focus of this present study is on ports for container vessels. This is because container terminals involve the most stringent criteria on environmental conditions. Besides that, open ports for other types of cargo are already more common. The open container port concept was evaluated for its economical, technical and financial feasibility. The open container port concept appeared to be a nice solution for large future container port projects. The value of the coastal zone becomes increasingly higher. An offshore located port is inevitable when the coastal zone is fully used for industrial and recreational purposes. Besides that, an open port minimizes the impact on the morphological environment. More exposed berths may be feasible. This is because larger container vessels respond less to wave conditions. Moreover, recent developments in mooring systems and to a lesser extent in container cranes contribute to the idea that container handling at exposed berths is possible. To evaluate the value of the open container port concept, case studies for the region of Singapore and for the region of west Africa are performed. The main reason for an open port in the region of Singapore is the high value of the coastal zone. The coast of Singapore is fully used for industrial and recreational purposes. An open container port based on a reclaimed island was purposed for the region of Singapore. From a technical analysis, it appeared that no shelter was needed at the berth. However, it could not be guaranteed that the moored motions of smaller vessels and feeders would not exceed the prescribed limits. An economic analysis showed that a new container terminal which is only able to welcome large vessels is feasible for the location of Singapore. An open port at the coast of west Africa was proposed to deal with the dynamic morphology of this region. Therefore, high costs for the dredging of the approach channel and the port basin were avoided and erosion of the coastal zone was minimized. Extra shelter was needed for the proposed port of west Africa. The shelter was provided with a berth located in the lee of the reclaimed port and a small breakwater. Besides that, it was found that the offshore location of the proposed port is beneficial to avoid high critical infragravity waves. For the case of west Africa a financial analysis was done. Although high construction costs were found for some parts of the proposed open container port, the concept seemed financially feasible. It was concluded that the open container port concept can be applied for a lot of situations and regions. This study illustrates that the open container port can be an attractive alternative, which should be considered in the planning phase of future port projects.","sustainable ports; container ports; alternative wave sheltering; port layout design; offshore; environmentally exposed; feasibility; Singapore; west Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","With the decline of conventional gas resources in many industrialised regions, energy security has increasingly become a topic of interest. Fuelled by disturbed diplomatic relations, both national and regional governments have the desire to decrease their dependency on foreign nations for their gas supply. However, the energy future of these regions is uncertain, and energy markets are highly complex and dynamic. The use of simulation modelling might provide a solution for discovering system behaviour of complex multi-actor systems, such as the gas market. Over the past decades, multiple simulation methods have evolved, including System Dynamics (SD) and agent-based modelling (ABM). Although both methods have been applied to overlapping areas of interest, they both are fundamentally different in terms of conceptualisation, formalisation and implementation, which is likely to impact the outcomes of the simulation exercise. In this research, a multi-method approach is proposed as a way to explore the effects of method uncertainty and to improve simulation modelling for policy analysis by tapping into the relative strengths of both SD and ABM. The question that is central to this research is: What are the merits of a multi-method approach in scenario discovery? An answer will be provided to this question by applying the multi-method approach to the case of regional import dependency for natural gas. For this case, the aim is to discover and explore import dependency scenarios for selected world regions, given the relevant uncertainties that are affecting these scenarios. In specific, the effects of global shale gas development will be explored. Two models, one SD model and one AB model, are provided with partially identical inputs, and will be treated as equally ‘true’ representations of the real-world system. With regard to the case, it has been shown that the gas market and thus import dependency is strongly demand-driven, though also other leverage points exist to steer the system towards lower levels of import dependency. For the Far East region, incentives are required to push domestic gas production towards higher levels. Depending on the assumptions made regarding the economic growth of regions and the size of their resources, all regions may face both high (>50%) and low (<10%) import dependency. The logical next step would be to define regional policies and test their robustness and performance across both models. However, the current models are limited in the uncertainty spaces that are explored, and, depending on the type of policy, have to be adapted to allow for the testing of policies. With regard to the multi-method approach, it has been shown that SD models and AB models are able to complement each other in terms of capturing system behaviour. The multi-method approach has led to the discovery of system behaviour that would otherwise have remained unknown. The implications for policymaking are twofold; on the one hand a multi-method approach provides a stepping stone towards more robust decision-making, on the other hand it poses an additional challenge for finding, defining and evaluating the performance of policies. More experience with the multi-method approach in various types of problems is required to provide a more decisive answer to the main research question.","shale gas; multi-method research; agent-based modelling; System Dynamics; Exploratory Modelling & Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-06-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

Dit staal is voornamelijk bestemd voor de automobielindustrie, de bouw en de verpakkingsindustrie. Bij Tata Steel in IJmuiden wordt staal geproduceerd vanuit de basisgrondstoffen ijzererts en steenkool. Het productieproces binnen Tata Steel IJmuiden is opgedeeld in de afdeling Manufacturing Iron & Steel en Manufacturing Rolling & Coating. Binnen de afdeling Manufacturing Iron & Steel wordt ijzererts en steenkool omgezet tot vloeibaar staal. Van dit vloeibare staal wordt binnen de afdeling Manufacturing Rolling & Coating bandstaal gemaakt. De Gietwalsinstallatie, de Warmbandwalserij, de Koudbandwalserij en Coated Products zijn werkeenheden die onderdeel zijn van de afdeling Manufacturing Rolling & Coating.

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2014","Designs to be manufactured by Additive Manufacturing (AM) are subject to geometrical restrictions which are necessary to guarantee successful production. This makes it necessary to modify the obtained topology optimized design such that it is manufacturable. By doing this the optimality of the structure can be reduced. To achieve a manufacturable design directly from the topology optimization requires the incorporation of such a geometrical restriction directly into the optimization process. This research has been carried out to develop a method to do so. The manufacturing constraint being implemented is that a structure should be self-supporting. For this to be the case overhanging features in the design must be at an angle of at least 45 degrees with respect to the base plate. Three approaches have been formulated and investigated: (1)a multiple objective, (2)global constraint and (3)a density filter. A global measure has been formulated for the multiple objective and the global constraint and a filtering scheme for the density filter. The three approaches have been implemented into a 2D optimization code written in MATLAB. Three predictable reference models have been used to test the suitability of each method. The results show that the multiple objective and the global constraint remain potential candidates but further investigation is needed to determine proper parameter values. The topologies obtained with these approaches were modified to partially meet the manufacturing constraint but remained with overhanging features. The filtering method produced topologies that had no overhanging features. The design was a compromise between slight alterations and the introduction of support structures. This approach however showed instabilities that are directly linked to the proposed filtering scheme. True convergence was not achieved with any of the approaches. The filtering approach provides a proof of concept for the inclusion of the 45 degree overhang restriction but further development is needed. The other two approaches are also potential candidates for inclusion of the restriction.","topology optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bijlaard, F.S.K. (mentor); Kolstein, H.M. (mentor); Sinke, J. (mentor)","2014","Today, there are only a few types of structural engineering applications where structural adhesives play a role, in contrast to other engineering sectors. The possibilities and difficulties of structural adhesive bonding in structural engineering, especially for steel-to-steel connections, are investigated. Practically all structural adhesives are polymers. The cohesive properties mainly depend on their polymer structure and eventual additives. Specific adhesion covers all adhesion types through intermolecular forces (chemical, adsorptive, diffusive and electrostatic). For specific adhesion, good wetting is important. Mechanical adhesion is characterised by interlocking. The mechanical behaviour of most structural adhesives is best described by the Drucker Prager (or related) model. Therefore the tension strength is limited, hence connections should be designed for shear and compression. Lap connections are prone to shear lag which causes a low effectiveness of long laps. Shear lag is mainly influenced by the axial stiffness of the adherents, and shear stiffness and thickness of the adhesive. Lap connections are also prone to peel, due to eccentricity of the lines of action (externally and/or internally). Peel is mainly influenced by adhesive and adherent thicknesses, bending stiffness of the adherents and axial stiffness of the adhesive. The material properties of adhesive are strongly influenced by time-and-environmental effects, especially temperature, moister and creep are important. The mechanical properties of adhesive bonds provide potential for lengthening of steel beams, structures with thin elements, small tolerances or HSS, and fatigue sensitive, composite, hybrid and laminated structures. Due to the relative low weight, adhesive bonds have potential for light weight structures. Due to the appearance, aesthetics may allow the choice for adhesive bonding. For structural engineering there are four specific points of attention. Firstly, the strength of adhesive bonds depend on the adhesive thickness. An optimal thickness exists which is relatively small. The tolerances used in structural engineering make the application of a thin bondline difficult. Secondly, the service life of structural engineering applications is usually 50 years. At such time spans the time-and-environmental effect may lower the design strength drastically. Thirdly, for adhesive bonding a clean working environment is needed, which is difficult to achieve on a construction site. Finally, there is a lack in knowledge, products and code/directives for structural engineering. For adhesive bonded beam-to-column connections a continuous beam instead of a continuous column is beneficial with respect to tension. Nevertheless, tension is hard to avoid in T- or X-shaped beam-to-column connections. An L-shaped roof connection is the most suitable beam-to-column connection for adhesive bonding. The connection can be achieved by two adhesive bonded L-shape plates to the flanges of the beam and column at the inner and outer corner. Linear elastic FEM calculations with linear elements show that, due to shear lag, the effective length of these plates is limited. Due to the large differences of axial stiffness over the width of an H-shaped profile, load transfer mainly takes place near the web. Calculations with higher order element or non-linear material behaviour are not possible with commercial computers. To increase the efficiency of load transfer at the middle of a lap, stepped adherents can be used. The change of axial stiffness at the steps causes an uplift of the shear stress distribution. FEM and practice tests are executed for an adhesive bonded stepped double strap connection. The connection exists of two 15mm thick steel plates (S235) which are bonded (Sikadur-30) by two bonded (Sikadur-30) steel stepped straps. The straps exists of three 3mm thick, steel plates (S235) of 200mm, 400mm and 600mm length. FEM calculations predict a nearly linear load-displacement curve and a failure load of at least 400kN. The load-displacement curves of the practice tests are similar to the FEM curves up to 300kN, afterwards the curve slowly flattens. A mean failure load of 561kN, a sample standard deviation of 12.85kN and a 5th percentile failure load of 549kN have been achieved. Failure was imposed by adhesion failure; all connections show delamination near nearly all lap ends.","adhesive; structural; stepped; steel; connection; strap; bonding; shear lag; peel; lap; structural adhesive; adhesive bonding; stepped strap; double lap; structural engineering; tensile test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Choosing inappropriate values of these parameters causes the optimization routine to never reach a good result, even by increasing the population size and the number of generations to high numbers. As an alternative to GA, we studied the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method. This is one of the newest methods for global optimization which is claimed by some authors to perform better than GA.

(mentor); De Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2014","The world is changing, markets are shifting, consumers are getting knowledgeable and therefore pickier in their product selection, and new technologies are introduced faster and faster. These changes will affect all aspects of a company, and in particular manufacturing companies. In order to adapt to these challenges companies are looking to change the way in which value is added to products. One of the possibilities to respond to these changing conditions is by tying services onto existing products; these bundles are also referred to as Product-Service Systems (PSSs). The changes an organisation undergoes in order to become able to offer PSSs are called servitization. A large number of manufacturing companies see the potential of PSSs but struggle with the servitization process. Literature has defined several barriers which hamper the servitization process. One of the barriers that needs to be overcome is defined by the question: “How can / should competitive integrated Product-Service System be designed within the context of an industrial organisation?” This is the main research question of this thesis. An answer to this question will be provided by developing a matrix which links service components to product characteristics. To construct the matrix, this thesis employs three research methods: a literature study, a case study and interviews. The results of these methods have been validated by means of triangulation. The research has been performed for Royal Philips N.V., which is a Dutch product manufacturing organisation creating products in the field of Lighting, Healthcare and Consumer Lifestyle. Philips has identified the changes in the market and wants to adapt to these changes by means of servitization. This thesis will provide Philips with a tool which can be used to design Product-Service Systems, based on scientific theory and practical knowledge.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Veeke, H.P.M. (mentor); Lodewijks, G. (mentor)","2014","Can Damen return to the old warehousing facility? The short answer is yes, but no. When viewing the central warehouse as a distribution center, the required space can be reduced to much less than is available in the old warehouse. However, because the warehouse is often used as a storage facility, a return is made impossible. At this time, 4200 m2 is used for receiving the goods, 8200 m2 is used for temporary storage, and 6400 m2 is used to create the shipments. By changing the categorization of the incoming goods and going to a one-buffer system, the section for receiving goods can be reduced to less than 1000 m2. The temporary storage now uses 8200 m2, but this is caused by the average time in storage of almost 9 working days (Little’s law). This means that goods are 9 working days too early (on average). By changing the mindset that ‘then at least we’ll have it’ internally and by giving clear feedback internally and to the supplier, this can be brought back to less than 1200 m2. By changes inside the central warehouse (disregarding the changes outside of the span of control of the central warehouse), the current amount of goods can be stored more efficiently in 3000 m2. By generating a continuous flow for the outgoing goods and by eliminating the enormous time loss created by slow scanners, the outbound process can be done with less than 2000 m2. This would easily allow a return to the old central warehouse, offering 6700 m2. All this being said, Damen keeps on storing more and more goods for extended periods of time and both warehousing facilities become fuller and fuller. This is caused by leftovers from finished projects (ranging from custom made propellers to more standardized parts). Some of these leftovers have been there for more than five years and might still be there for five more because they have once cost a lot of money. Besides this, canceled or delayed projects form a large part of the storage area and according to Damen ‘this will never change’. On top of all of this, Damen has expressed that 90% of the flow of goods only accounts for 10% of the value and that this should just ‘be there’ so that it won’t delay the other 10% of more costly items. Although this is understandable, this can be translated to a lack of willingness to change the attitude ‘at least then we’ll have it’. When regarded as a distribution center, there will be no problem in returning to the previous location with some changes in the process. When including the enormous amount of stored goods that is continuing to grow, there is no possibility of returning and in a few years, even the total of 24000 m2 will not be enough.","Warehouse; Space efficiency; Damen Shipyards Gorinchem; Delft Systems Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transportation Engineering","","Production Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2014","In recent years, along with the higher GPU’s computational speed and memory bandwidth compared to those of CPUs, GPU-accelerated reservoir simulation has been studied quite extensively. The results so far have shown that Fermi generation GPUs could accelerate IMPES (implicit pressure explicit saturation) reservoir simulation considerably. Along with several new features, the current generation Kepler GPU has been improved from its previous generation by having much higher FLOPS and memory bandwidth. However, major changes in Kepler, such as the removal of automatic L1 global memory caching and the requirement of instruction level parallelism, make additional optimizations essential to obtain close-to-peak performance. On the application side, researchers have found that foam can be used to improve gas injection by addressing several causes of poor gas sweep efficiency. However, foam simulation is hampered by long simulation time because of its large fractional flow slope. In this paper, it will be discussed how to implement efficient IMPES reservoir simulation on current generation Kepler GPUs, and how to apply it to foam simulation. The IMPES code is optimized by maximizing exposed parallelism (thread and instruction level parallelism-TLP and ILP), coalescing global memory access, reducing redundant global memory access by explicitly using shared memory via warp specialization while avoiding memory bank conflict, using 1D texture memory as a pre-computed table and using various forms of GPU read-only memory. Furthermore, since reservoir simulation components such as sparse matrix formats, preconditioners and solvers that work excellent on CPUs might not be efficient on GPUs, the components are chosen so that they not only just work efficiently for foam simulation but also for foam simulation on GPUs. For the example considered in this report, and using a GTX Titan Black GPU, speed-ups up to 129 times in the saturation update and matrix assembly can be obtained compared to a parallel implementation on an Intel quad Core i7-4770k. For the pressure solver part, the GPU implementation is up to 39 x faster compared to the CPU implementation. The maximum solver speedup is achieved for large models (with more than 6 million grid cells), whereas for smaller models (a million cells or less), the speedup is reduced because GPU-CPU data transfer latency might still be dominant and small data fits in the CPU cache. Overall, the use of a GPU makes large-scale foam simulations (with six million grid cells or more) possible to be completed in days, whereas it is predicted that it will take months to complete the same simulation using a CPU.","Kepler; IMPES; GPU; Foam; Reservoir simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Groensmit, E.K.M. (mentor)","2014","Europe’s transport sector is predominantly fuelled by oil products, fuels which are finite and emit large amounts of greenhouse gasses (i.e. CO2 and NOx) upon combustion. Therefore the sector is faced with stricter emission control regulations in the coming decade. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel has shown prosperous results for reducing these emissions. Because of LNG’s properties and the inherent changes in regulations, LNG is an attractive alternative to improve on the current situation. However, the use of LNG as a fuel requires immense investments in infrastructure which are, by definition, impeded by a classic chicken-and-egg problem. The supply side of LNG will not establish an infrastructure until sufficient demand arises, and end-users have to retrofit or even replace their fuel systems and engines. Both are faced with large amounts of uncertainty on lumpy investment decisions. As the world’s largest independent tank storage provider, Vopak’s LNG department would like to provide the necessary infrastructure. However, one of the problems that Vopak is currently facing is that some important investment decisions are deferred due to the current valuation methods. Risks are translated into high contingency costs, which are added to the costs of the investment proposal. Moreover, as the LNG value chain is transforming radically in the coming decade, Vopak experiences even more uncertainty. The company is in need of new evaluation methods to cope with these uncertainties. The problem owner’s traditional decision-making process and financial methods are no longer accurate to evaluate investment proposals faced with a high level of uncertainty, and it calls for a new valuation method. A literature study and case study has been conducted to structure this research. The literature study describes a number of alternative financial methods that are more robust in dealing with high levels of uncertainty. Most alternatives have the goal to fight this uncertainty. However, by applying real option theory, a combination of financial options theory and decision analysis, the focus is placed on flexibility to co-exist with uncertainty. Moreover, it concentrates on exploiting uncertainty as it will create risks but also opportunities. In the Case Study two alternatives based on the real options principle, are compared to the traditional approach on the development of an LNG truck loading bay at the Gate terminal in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The case study results were presented to the LNG department of Royal Vopak N.V. and a survey was held to gather feedback on the results. Subsequently the following research question is answered in this study; What are the advantages and disadvantages of using real options in uncertain investment decisions for Vopak in the context of an emerging LNG infrastructure? The advantages of using real options for investment decision-making at Vopak are that these two alternative methods have shown their (strategic) value when they are applied on Vopak’s initial investment proposal of the LNG truck loading bay. The first alternative, real option analysis, provides significantly more insights in the underlying assumptions and choices determining the investment decision. The case study results show that Vopak would benefit more by constructing two or three LNG truck loading bays, instead of one as planned originally. The second alternative, designing for flexibility, provides the opportunity to quantitatively substantiate the choice to incorporate flexible design option in the design of such truck loading bay. Both alternatives are designed as financial modelling tools in Microsoft Excel ®. On the contrary, disadvantages of using real options became clear after presentation of the case study results; managers perceive switching to a different valuation method as a barrier. Furthermore, significant resources (i.e. extra knowledge, time and money) are required to implement the real options principle, yet the problem owner has no outlook on a possible success. These necessary investment process changes are rarely mentioned in current real options literature. Therefore this study also presents an implementation procedure for the above mentioned alternatives. The problem owner is seriously interested in incorporating the mind-set behind real options (considering flexibility) in their traditional valuation approach. In order to actually implement the proposed methods in larger and other projects, more case studies at Vopak are required. Future research should focus on the explicit linkage between infrastructure investments and the use of real options. The real options concept, and especially the methodology behind designing for flexibility, can potentially provide more insights on infrastructure investments when they are considered to be social-technical systems which are being developed under competition or cooperation.","Real Options; Royal Vopak N.V.; Uncertainty; Monte Carlo simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-06-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management; Engineering Systems Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Kaaij, T. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor); Verlaan, M. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor)","2014","In this master thesis the residual circulation in the North Sea is investigated. It has been shown that the numerical models used in this thesis (DCSMv5 and DCSMv6) give a rather low representation of the actual circulation pattern in the North Sea. The dominating forces which cause residual currents in the North Sea are the tidal forcings, meteorological forcings and density variations. Their variability over the whole domain, as well as their interaction with bottom topography and the earth’s rotation, leads to a variety of different processes. Since it is difficult to quantify to total transport over the whole North Sea, the focus in this thesis lies on the transports through the Strait of Dover. Studies on fluxes through the Strait of Dover date back to the late 1920’s, where in situ velocity profiles were measured and integrated over the crosssection to make an estimate on residual flows. In later studies different methods were used to obtain valuable information on transports. Use was made of electric potentials through a telephone cable, high frequency radars and modelling studies. Because the magnitude of residual transports is an order of magnitude smaller than short scale movements like tidal oscillations, the estimated trans- ports lack accuracy. They vary between 87000 to 235000 m3/s. Dutch ecologists suggests an annual inflow in the order of 100000 m3/s. In this thesis the state-of-the-art numerical DCSM models of Deltares have been com- puted in Delft3D-FLOW to investigate the dominant processes in the Strait of Dover. The models cover the complete northwest European continental shelf and calculate depth aver- aged barotropic flow. The representation of the general North Sea circulation is qualitatively well, except for some highly stratified and density driven areas. However, the in- and outflow of water at the North Sea boundaries is considerably low. The leakage of the radioactive nuclide Antimony-125 from La Hague in 1985 till 1994 has been simulated to give an in- dication of the spatial varying transit time of the current model. It is shown that in the southern region transit times are simulated to be two times larger than other modelling studies and measurements suggest. The daily varying residual flow through the Strait of Dover has been investigated by applying a Low-Pass frequency filter to the modelled fluxes. The contribution of tidal residuals are found to be very significant with an average annual flow of 45000 m3/s. When meteorological forcings are also taken into account the annual inflow for the year of 2007 equals 56000 m3/s. Since meteorological forcings vary throughout the years, a quasi-linear approximation is formulated where the daily residual flow is a function of the wind induced shear stress and wind direction. A correlation of 0.79 is found for this linear approximation. For rapidly varying surface elevations differences between the North Sea and English Channel the approximation fails to give proper estimates. During the research, model adjustments were made to (1) assess the sensitivity of the fluxes and (2) look for candidate solutions to improve the amount of transport through the Strait of Dover. Physical adjustments have been made by implementing density differences, residual surface level boundaries and a varying bottom roughness. The numerical adjust- ments were for the largest part based on different discretization methods. In addition, a preliminary computation has been performed in DFlow-FM; a recently developed simulation package which computes on an unstructured grid. Although there are notable differences for each adjustment, the effects are small in comparison with tide and wind induced residuals.","Residual flow; Strait of Dover; North Sea; Residual circulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Thiel de Vries, J.S.M. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor); Mil Homens, J.P. (mentor)","2014","The longshore sediment transport (it will be referred also as LST) is a core issue in the field of coastal engineering. It is among the most important nearshore processes that control the coastal morphology, and determines in large part whether shores erode, accrete, or remain stable. Consequently, it is important to be able to calculate the LST rates. For this effect, there are various sediment transport formulae. One classification of LST formulations is the following: a) bulk transport formulas (assuming a simplified representation of the physical processes) and b) process-based formulas (including a large number of physical processes). The bulk LST formulas due to their simplicity are routinely used in coastal engineering studies. However, there is still great uncertainty in their estimations. One factor that may contribute to this uncertainty is the fact that the inputs to the bulk formulas are mostly wave characteristics at the edge of the surfzone, whereas morphologic features are usually not, or to a limited extent, included. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of various morphologic features in the surfzone on the LST rates. It was investigated whether there are any significant correlations between LST rates and cross-shore surf zone features such as beach slope, the presence and number of bars and dimensionless parameters (i.e. the Iribarren parameter ? and the dimensionless fall velocity ?) which may represent morphologic features. The process-based model UNIBEST-LT and the process-based formula Van Rijn 2004 were used. It can be assumed that reliable estimates for the actual sediment transport were provided because most of the physical processes known to influence LST are included in the models and because these models were calibrated with laboratory and field data. The influence of the tide was not included in this study. All calculations were performed using the same sediment characteristics, i.e. sand with D50 in the order of 200?m which is a typical value of the study area, the Holland coast. For the simulations, two types of cross-shore profiles were used: a) flat profiles and b) JARKUS profiles (measured profiles from the Dutch coast). The simulations with flat profiles were done using a single-wave condition climate. The range of the values of slopes were chosen according to the values of bars seaward slopes (measured from JARKUS profiles), because it is more likely that waves break over there. Generally, it was concluded that both the slope and the Iribarren parameter ? influenced the calculated LST rates in a similar way: the steeper the slope (or the higher the Iribarren parameter ?), the higher the LST rates that were calculated. No clear trend between LST and ? was observed. However, the ? values were calculated with single wave conditions, whereas the ? is usually calculated for representative wave conditions that dictate how the cross-shore profile is. Also, some conclusions about the bulk formulas CERC and Kamphuis were made. Finally, it was studied how the slope and generally the cross-shore profile features are taken into account in the Van Rijn 2004 formula. The simulations with JARKUS profiles were done using a realistic wave climate (measured off the Dutch coast). The measured cross-shore profiles covered the area of the so-called Holland coast. No clear trend was observed between the computed LST rates and the number of bars of each cross-shore profile. Subsequently, the following slope parameters were studied: The average, the root mean square, the variance, the average downwards and the root mean square downwards slope. Significant scatter was observed between the computed LST rates and the various slope parameters. However, in all cases it was observed that the higher the value of the slope parameter the higher the computed LST. The strongest correlation was observed in the root mean square downwards slope results, while the highest scatter was observed in the average slope results. Furthermore, the variation of slope parameters (independently from the type of slope) played a more important role on the resulted LST for wave conditions of high ?(H^2.5×sin??2a)? values than for wave conditions of low ?(H^2.5×sin??2a)? values. Also, some conclusions about the bulk formulas CERC and Kamphuis were made. Finally, some recommendations for further research were provided (e.g. the investigation of bed and suspended load separately, the investigation of the influence of the number of bars, including their magnitudes and the investigation of the influence of the width of the surfzone or dissipation zone on LST rates). Additionally, based on the findings, it was concluded that in case the influence of cross-shore profile slope (or a related parameter) is to be implemented in a bulk LST formula, this influence (e.g. a parameter) should be related to the wave conditions: the higher the wave power (e.g. the quantity (H^2.5×sin??2a)?), the higher the influence of the cross-shore profile slope parameter. The implementation of such a parameter should be investigated further.","longshore sediment transport; UNIBEST-LT; surfzone; cross-shore profile shape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.37, 4.89"

These structures are subjected to environmental forces of wind, waves and current which causes stress concentration on the joints affecting the fatigue life of the structure. One of the procedure for the calculation of Stress Concentration Factors (SCF) for tubular joints involves the use of parametric equations as a means of identifying the critical joints to be considered for further detailed investigation. The guideline’s insufficient clarification on the methodology to be employed for multiplanar joints caused difficulties in the calculation of fatigue life of support structures especially for OWEC (Offshore Wind Energy Convertors).The design of these structures are driven by Fatigue Limit State (FLS) and to be cost effective in the competitive Offshore Wind Energy market the structures needs to be designed such that their total weight and cost of fabrication are less. Some of the challenges faced in the design of Multiplanar Tubular Joints for offshore support structures are The calculation of SCF’s using the parametric equations for Multiplanar Joints are not well defined. When there are a large number of critical joints in a jacket, Finite Element (FE) analysis is tedious. Improvement of the fatigue life of the structure without any drastic change in geometry and total weight of the structure. An attempt to tackle these issues was carried out by studying effect of fatigue life of multiplanar joints. The joint configuration was modified such that the gap between the connected braces and the brace – chord angles were kept constant. This helps to optimize the joint geometry while keeping the overall geometry of the jacket the same. The static strength of the joint is also calculated and verified. The following research have been carried out in this thesis. The thesis describes the procedure followed for the calculation of SCF’s for multiplanar joints using time domain fatigue analysis. In this case a multiplanar KK joint is considered for the purpose. Development of a program to calculate the best configuration of the geometry such that the fatigue life of the joint is improved. Study of the influence of Static strength over the Fatigue strength of tubular joints.

Nowadays, data is considered to be a valuable asset in enterprises. This value is primarily caused by two important data applications: Business processes and reporting. Firstly, increasingly complex and globalizing business processes require the support of reliable data. Secondly, enterprise data is used for financial and compliance reporting. This means that data is used to easily gain insight into the business performance, enabling regulatory compliance with legislations such as Sarbanes-Oxley. Notwithstanding the importance, data quality and data management is poor at many companies. When data quality is poor and improperly governed, companies are likely to face serious inefficiencies, as well as high losses due to government fines and a diminishing market position. Over the last few years, a new solution strategy has emerged, named data governance: An overarching methodology that defines who is responsible for what data at what point in the process. As a form of governance, it is implemented top-down and throughout the enterprise. When implemented. data governance can assure that the enterprise data is of sufficient quality. KPMG has helped clients improve their data quality through a data governance framework, for instance in the logistics, financial and retail sector. Literature research as a scientific substantiation of the effects of data governance frameworks is however limitedly available. The effectiveness of and gains from current data governance projects is thus at best known from practice. Knowledge on a measuring method is thereby also limitedly available. As it is hard to make quantitative estimates of the perceived benefits, it is in this research attempted to find a way to both qualitatively and quantitatively express the effects of data governance interventions by exploring literature and KPMG practice.","Data goverance; Business performance; Compliance; Logistics; Retail; Measurement method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

In search of new sustainable energy sources, Delft University of Technology’s KitePower group developed an airborne wind energy system. This system is based on a pumping cycle principle where a kite is reeled out with high traction forces while turning a generator, and reeled back in at lower traction forces while consuming energy. In the end, net power is produced. Research within the KitePower group has been mostly focused on the mechanical and control aspects of the system. However, recent studies within the group have shown that the system efficiency can be increased by having a better performing kite. In search of an improved kite design the shortcomings of the current design procedures were identified. These procedures are mostly derived from the kitesurf industry where the designers have limited knowledge of aerodynamics. As a result, little is known of the kite while in-flight, such as shape, angle of attack, or even pressure distribution. Knowledge of these parameters is however essential for the validation of numerical analysis models which could be used to design and analyze kites. Additionally, the experimental data could also be used for design purposes taking into account the fact that the complexity of the numerical analysis of a flexible kite will lead to computationally intensive models, which are not recommended for use during the initial design phases. To provide a first solution to this lack of experimental data of in-flight kites, this the- sis presents the development of a system which can be used to measure the pressure distribution on the surface of a flying kite. The system is based on MEMS (Micro- Electro-Mechanical-System) barometric pressure sensors, the LPS25H by STMicroelec- tronics. The components are individually tested to evaluate their suitability in a pressure measuring system. Because of the barometric nature of the sensors and the requirement of the dynamic pressure for the pressure coefficient computation a pitot-static system is developed, tested, and calibrated. The developed pressure distribution measuring system was incorporated into a flexible strip which is easy to mount onto the desired surfaces. The pressure strip was compared to the well known pressure tabs measuring method on a rigid wing section in an open jet low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology. Improvements applied to the system increased its performance resulting in a minimum pressure coefficient overestimate of 5% compared to the pressure tabs. The sensors over the middle part of the airfoil (from 15% up to 65% of the chord) showed similar response with errors of ±5%, while at the leading edge and trailing edge of the profile larger errors were observed. The latter is explained by the larger relative thickness of the pressure strip compared to the airfoil thickness in those regions.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","A large-scale nourishment known as the Sand Motor has been implemented along the Dutch coast as a Building with Nature solution designed for the upcoming 20 years. Given the long-term period of the project, a combination of in situ measurements and remote sensing techniques are currently in use. An X-band radar system is deployed at the Sand Motor, but requires further research into its applicability in such a dynamic coastal climate. Radar data can be processed into hydrodynamic parameters such as waves, currents and bathymetry information through use of a 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This technology is highly desirable for coastal engineering applications since it presents a relatively effortless method to capture high resolution spatial and temporal hydrodynamic parameters. The objective of this research is to develop an X-band radar depth inversion model at the Sand Motor for further investigation into remote sensing as an accurate tool for estimating nearshore hydrodynamics. The developed model should be able to accurately estimate hydrodynamic parameters from raw X-band radar images with high temporal and spatial resolution. This thesis explains the development, calibration and validation of the X-band MATLAB Fitting (XMFit) model at the Sand Motor for a single storm in October 2013. XMFit proved to be a valuable remote sensing tool for extracting nearshore hydrodynamics based on in situ comparisons. The SeaDarQ software developed by Nortek B.V. is also used as a quality benchmark. The storm results showed that the XMFit is more robust and accurate relative to the currently available SeaDarQ software. A sensitivity analysis was completed to further analyze the spatial and temporal patterns associated with XMFit accuracy. Spatial statistics indicated high error around the edges of the radar domain, which led to a reduced radar footprint by implementing a spatial cutoff of 2.5 km. The smaller domain results in much less scatter with a near-constant linear bias of 2 m. High accuracy in XMFit is directly linked with waves exceeding 1 m, wind speeds exceeding 12 m/s and the alignment of wind and waves. The metocean limits help conclude that XMFit requires spectra spreading in wavelength-frequency space to help constrain the dispersion shell. This finding directly links with locally generated wind waves, more commonly referred to as wind sea. Ideal results based on the spatial and temporal limits further reduced the linear bias to approximately 1.6 m. The ideal conditions show a much better agreement between radar-derived and in situ bathymetry and hydrodynamics. A relationship between the inaccuracy of XMFit during flood tide was linked to complex nearshore hydrodynamics around the Sand Motor. Note that the flood tide at the Sand Motor exhibits complex flow structures (i.e. stratification and large scale eddy formation on the lee side). XMFit averages these complex 3D flow structures evident during flood tide into a single large computational cube, which drastically simplifies the hydrodynamics. This work concludes by emphasizing the need for additional research into XMFit since it proved applicable at the Ameland inlet along the Dutch coast. Instantaneous results increase confidence in XMFit given its ability to extract the complex ebb-tidal delta, the orientation of the flood channel and coherent wave-induced currents. This work proves that XMFit is a valuable model for extracting high resolution spatial and temporal hydrodynamic parameters.","depth inversion; Sand Motor; remote sensing; X-band radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.052285, 4.184252"

For this, a conceptual analysis is performed on several components/tasks. This analysis pinpointed the challenges in this concept. It can be concluded that the concept is technical feasible, if the horizontal swinging motion of the cabin during transit will not lead to instability of the system. Also the actual operating conditions are highly depending on the boundary conditions. The goal of the second part of this report is to investigate the possible instability caused by the swinging motion of the cabin. For this a simplified 2D model was constructed, using an equivalent mass and tangent force. Using the Newton-Raphson method a time-history analysis was performed. This analysis showed that the system is stable and that the accelerations experienced by personnel seated in the cabin are within the human comfort criteria during normal operation. The second part of this report also describes the test set-up which is built to demonstrate the working principle of the system. The test set-up showes that the general principle of the Sea Spider concept works. As it’s designed respecting the appropiate scaling laws, the test set-up can be used, besides as a demonstrator for sales purposes, in future research.

(mentor); Van den Hende, E.A. (mentor)","2014","Literature Open innovation (OI) is an activity that enables knowledge to be transferred across traditional company boundaries. Although sharing knowledge is not something new, the broad scope of collaborations, and the implementation of external knowledge throughout the entire innovation process make open innovation something unique. The popularity of OI is highly influenced by rapid global developments in business environments, which make a collaborative form of innovation more attractive. Benefits include a faster recognition of new ideas, sharing costs and investments, generating extra income by selling intellectual property, and improved innovation results. It is of vital importance to keep improving products and processes when operating in the food and beverage industry. Next to that, the food and beverage industry is under an increasing amount of pressure from consumers and retailers, who demand a higher innovation pace in an environment where time and money are scarce. It is, however, difficult for firms to keep up with the rate and complexity of newly introduced innovations when they operate on their own. It is therefore considered that a focus on OI is needed. Searching outside a company’s boundaries for knowledge assists in increasing a company’s innovation practices. Theoretical framework As with all types of innovation, an OI process faces challenges and barriers that need to be recognized and overcome during the OI development process. Interestingly, an overlap between OI barriers and regular innovation barriers was found, as aspects of ‘regular innovation’ barriers can be recognized in the reviewed OI barriers. However, the reviewed literature on OI does not specifically mention this similarity with regular innovation barriers, and the found OI models and frameworks limit their scope to arranging and sustaining partnerships, leaving other (open) innovation barriers untouched. Thus, to learn more about the faced barriers and used solutions in an OI process, initiated for developing and implementing a novel technology in the Dutch food and beverage industry, an answer to the following questions is looked for: 1. What does the process of open innovation of novel technologies in the food and beverage industry look like? What were the different phases of the NPD process? 2. Are there substantial similarities between barriers in an open innovation food project and a regular NPD project? How do the similarities in a open innovation food project differ from barriers in a general NPD project? 3. How have any barriers of the focal project been overcome, and what barriers have not been overcome? Method In order to find answers to the research questions, an in-depth case study research is conducted in the Dutch food and beverage industry. The present case was studied during a three-month period and is based on a literature study, 12 interviews, and three follow up emails. All interviews have been audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded following the grounded theory method. Results The results showed the development process consisted of an initial development part, and a second part in which a back-up plan needed to be initiated. Therefore the process of the focal case could be divided in two parts. For each part the main barriers and solutions are divided in core categories: Part 1: Everything that happened ‘before the back-up plan initiation’: - ‘Internal preparation of open innovation’, - ‘Sharing & communicating’, - ‘Balance difficulties & common interests’, and - ‘Make use of useful knowledge sources’ Part 2: Everything that happened ‘after the back-up plan initiation’: - Managing open innovation’, - ‘Open up innovation process’, - ‘Reaching common understanding’, and - ‘Facing challenges’ The results showed multiple barriers occur during internal processes and partnering processes. Conclusions When analyzing the results it was found that the focal OI process contained innovation phases that can also be found during regular innovation. When comparing the findings of the present study with literature, it was concluded that a large overlap existed between barriers of a regular innovation process and barriers of an OI process. No overlap was found for partnering barriers, which indicates these barriers are unique for OI. Next to that, during the focal project both barriers for internal processes, and partnering barriers were difficult to find solutions for during the OI process. These findings indicate that the scope of current literature on OI phases is too narrow, and should be extended. Also the findings verify the partnering barriers, which are indicated throughout literature.","open innovation; FMCG; barriers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-06-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2014","Our ancestors in prehistory already used visuals for communication. Their rock paintings were durable and therefore lasted longer than the regular oral stories that were passed on from generation to generation. Throughout history visuals have been used to communicate stories and knowledge. INK follows our ancestors in using visuals for communication between different groups. INK is a start-up company that makes business issues visual and interactive. INK offers a facilitating service characterized by the use of interactive creative sessions and visual thinking methods to makes its client’s vision and strategy less complex, more understandable and more engaging, with a tangible visual output as final result. The visual thinking market is unexplored. There are just a few competitors. Yet, the market is attractive and will lure new companies. If INK wants to grow and stay ahead of the competition, it is essential to know the exact added value of visual thinking, the process of the service and if there are possibilities to optimize the service. The aim of this research is to understand the process and the added value of the visual thinking service of INK and to determine areas of improvement to lift the service to a higher level, in which the needs and expectations of the clients are better matched. To reach this aim, extensive literature research, observations and case studies focused on three elements; 1. Analyse INK; what does the company look like? 2. Research the visual thinking service of INK; what does the process of the service and the output look like? What is the added value of the different elements? 3. Derive possible improvements for INK; how can the service be evaluated and where lie opportunities to optimize the service? Literature research and case studies revealed that visual thinking is a specific way of design thinking that influences the understanding of the essence, improves the dialogue, helps to explore new ideas, improves communication, creates a fun experience and improves the reputation of the issue that is visualized. Combining the theory on visual thinking with the theory on boundary objects, it seems that visual thinking can function as a boundary object. The case studies confirm that visual thinking can translate, transfer and transform knowledge across syntactic, semantic and pragmatic boundaries. The service of INK is best described by a service blueprint. This blueprint shows the different steps and the connections between all elements. Adding the emotional experience of the client to the service blueprint makes it more valuable. The service blueprint, together with the emotional experience and the findings of the case studies make it possible to evaluate INK’s service. INK has the desire to work on more projects. Literature research reveals that customer loyalty is an important factor when clients select a service provider. Customer loyalty is determined by service quality, satisfaction, trust, commitment and emotional experience. This research shows that the overall emotional experience and customer loyalty will increase if INK improves its service with the following six recommended solutions; 1. Creation of an acquisition example 2. Improvement of commercial skills 3. Increase of efficiency in the preparation 4. Management of expectations of the process 5. Increase of feedback efficiency 6. Create a follow-up The implementation plan will help INK to execute all improvements and give the managing partners a handhold that prioritizes the steps to be taken.","visual thinking; service blueprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

In a wide range of applications, ranging from photonics and plasmonics to seismic exploration, efficient wave field solvers are required in various design and optimization frameworks. In this thesis, a Krylov subspace projection methodology is presented to efficiently solve wave propagation problems on unbounded domains. To model the extension of the computational domain to infinity, an optimal complex scaling method is introduced. Traditionally, complex scaling has been used to simulate open quantum systems. Here, an optimized complex scaling method is implemented that allows us to simulate wave propagation on unbounded domains provided we compute the propagating waves via a stability-corrected wave function. In our Krylov subspace framework, this wave function is approximated by polynomial or rational functions, which are obtained via Krylov subspace projection. We show that the field approximations are actually expansions in terms of approximate open resonance modes of the system and we present a novel and highly efficient Krylov subspace implementation for media exhibiting second-order relaxation effects. Numerical examples for one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems illustrate the performance of the method and show that our Krylov resonance expansions significantly outperform conventional solution methods.","Computational Electromagnetics; Krylov subspace; model order reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics, Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2014","This thesis describes my graduation project at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering in Delft, which has been conducted for the Product Design Group of Philips Research in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The goal was to create a feasible and meaningful product proposal that makes use of the wireless power technology. As a result, a concept appliance called the Gran Libertà was proposed that allows people to change the functionality by exchangeable function blocks. Based on the vision, a Sous Vide function block was created that gives people the opportunity to cook in a simpler way. In the beginning of this project, a user research was performed that consists of a field and contextual research to get an in-depth understanding of the current context. At the field research a couple of kitchen retailers were visited to explore interesting developments in the kitchen. Next, people were interviewed by using a Guerrilla style - short and quick - contextual research to gain knowledge about cooking and interactions of people in the kitchen. From these findings, contextual factors were collected, also called ‘building blocks’, to be used for the future context. Factors are observations, thoughts, theories, laws, considerations, beliefs or opinions. Additionally, a factor research - literature review - was conducted to collect factors for the kitchen context of 2020. After reducing the complexity of the 98 collected factors by referring to their interrelationships, 6 clusters were created called the ‘Meta-factors’. Next, by finding positive or negative correlations between these separate meta-factors, clusters could be created and placed on a dimension to present a clear framework of the future context. Looking at this framework, the four quadrants formed future directions for which Philips and I could design a product. Furthermore the following two quadrants ‘the interest in simplicity’ and ‘interest in autonomy’ were selected to create the following vision statement: “Philips and I want to enable people to cook in a simple way while they should be able to occasionally experiment beyond conventional meals” Next, interaction and product qualities were created that together with the vision statement has been used to create two conceptual ideas. One concept was about simpler cooking by using RFID technology, whereas the second concept was adaptable to specific situations by exchangeable attachments. The final choice between the two concepts was based on several criteria in which ‘the best use of the technology’ was the most important one. Eventually, the concept with the exchangeable attachments, also called function blocks, was chosen to transform this conceptual idea into a final manifestation. In its final form the concept should be experienced and used as defined in the vision (vision statement, interaction qualities and product qualities). The final product is called the Gran Libertà and expresses the wide applicability of the concept. It is designed to have three components: (1) base unit, (2) function block and (3) remote control. In addition, the function block is envisioned to be a Sous Vide (pronounced as soo-veed) immersion cooker in which people can greatly benefit of its nutritious food and easy way of cooking. Furthermore, other attachments are also suggested that will provide a better value to the concept and will also inspire people to experiment beyond conventional meals. Finally, the concept was evaluated by conducting a qualitative research method ‘focus group’ to get new insights that may be essential for future modifications of the concept. The findings from the focus group made it clear that the participants had a positive attitude towards the concept. Of course, there were some recommendations for Philips to improve upon the concept before introduction in the market.","product design; Philips; vision in product design; vip; innovation; wireless power; induction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-06-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics & Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

This is most severe at the beaches of Boca del Rio just south of the city of Veracruz. Here, small beaches can be found between large groynes. These groynes block the southward littoral drift significantly but proved not to provide protection against episodic storm erosion. The cause of the erosional problem is in cross-shore direction, therefore solutions should be considered which act in this direction as well. Eventually a nourishment, a dune, an offshore submerged breakwater and a beach toe were designed as possible solutions. Firstly the impact on the current situation is simulated which is referred to as the do-nothing situation. Afterwards, runs were done with an XBeach model to check the storm impact on the beach profile for several combinations of the solutions mentioned above. To evaluate the simulations above six criteria were taken into account with different importance. The extent to which the erosion is counteracted and the costs are the most important criteria, besides values for the sustainability, durability, recreational value and hindrance contribute as well to the total score of a considered solution. Finally two combinations showed interesting results. On the one hand a nourishment and on the other hand an uninterrupted submerged breakwater in combination with a nourishment. Both can additionally be combined with a dune resulting in a slightly higher value due to better performance and higher recreational value.  A nourishment is initially a cheap solution, but has to be maintained every few years by additional nourishments, resulting in increasing costs and hindrance for beach recreation. A large benefit of only performing beach nourishment is that abundance of sand will be available due to extension works at the port of Veracruz.  The combination of a breakwater and a nourishment requires a high initial investment. The result however is a very durable solution which will protect the coastal system for many years without maintenance. Besides the costs a disadvantage is that large amounts of rock have to be imported to construct the breakwater, which does not contribute to a sustainable solution. Eventually it depends on the national and local governments which of the solutions above will be performed. They can choose between a very durable solution with high initial investments or an initially cheaper solution which is sustainable but demands frequent maintenance.","Mexico; Veracruz; beach erosion; artificial beach nourishment","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","19.132051, -96.102776"

Uncertainties surrounding the gas sector make it difficult to determine future requirements of the gas infrastructure. A decision model that analyses the performance of different replacement strategies under different scenarios of demand and supply is constructed. Part of Stedin’s network has been used as a case study. Decision variables were the replacement strategy’s capital expenditures and the maximal allowed sustainable gas feed-in. Sustainable gas feed-in entails biogas production and gas from the power-to-gas concept. From the analysis can be concluded that under high demand, more sustainable gas can be fed into the network than under low demand. The research also showed that the most important decision moments are 2015, 2020 and 2040. As replacement decisions on large parts of the infrastructure have to be made in these years. From the analysis can be concluded that there is not one specific replacement strategy that is efficient under all scenarios of demand and supply. Therefore, a flexible replacement strategy is required, this can be created by implementing real options: learning before investing and flexibility in the network capacity. The first real options creates a value 6.5 M as it enables the network operator to steer away from over investments. However, if in the first 15 years a reducing strategy is chosen a lock-in is already created, switching to another strategy would be less sufficient. The second real options is only valuable when less than 550 m3/h of sustainable gas feed-in is expected. If more sustainable gas feed-in is required then it is more efficient to construct a storage facility. The model provides the network operator with an holistic view on the replacement task that lies ahead, what the costs of different replacement strategies are, and their direct effect on the performance of the physical network.","gas infrastructures; replacement strategy; investment under uncertainty; real options; decision model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Energy and Industry","",""

Up to now, products that are designed using waste streams as a starting point have not been able to significantly affect waste trends. The goal of this design project is design a product from the consumer wood waste stream on a large scale. First, a wastestream analysis is conducted for the wood waste from the consumer market, to investigate which sub stream is most suitable for new product development. Particleboard plates are the most suiting; therefore this material is used as the starting point for the design process. Multiple analyses (material, production technique, product possibility, internal and external, etc.) showed that practically and strategically, modular furniture is the best new application the particleboard plates. After an extensive material experimentation phase, six concepts for modular furniture using particleboard plates are developed. These concepts are assessed on the programme of requirements, costs and ecological impact (Fast track LCA), whereupon the combination of two concepts led to the final design. In the embodiment phase the design of the ShelFold is elaborated and finalized, a foldable modular closet system, which uses twisted rope as a connection for the particleboard plates. The final design, which is ready for mass production, is evaluated on its ecological impact, the impact on the waste management system, usability and value. The findings of these tests are translated in recommendations and critical success factors for an effective market introduction.

(mentor); Ninaber-van Eyben, B. (mentor); Van Barneveld, M. (mentor)","2014","U-Needle B.V. is company specialized in the development and production of mono-crystalline silicon micro-needles. These micro-needles have a thickness of 0.25 mm and a maximum length of 2.00 mm. Because of this short length, micro-needles are an ideal solution for easy and reliable intra-dermal injections, which finds its use in many applications. U-Needle is still in the development phase; they do not yet sell actual products, but offer research and development for their clients, yet progress is made in a high pace. In order to be able to enter the market quickly and easy in the coming years, a redesign of U-Needle’s current micro-needle device is needed, and this project was set up to do so. In order to come up with a feasible design, the scope of the project has been narrowed down to U-Needles most important client: Dermacom. Extensive research has been done on various aspects, such as market demands, competitor analysis, expert interviews and observations, study of the current micro-needle device and an analysis of (medical) standards and regulations. From this research spawned the following vision: “Come up with a feasible design that helps U-Needle position itself as a top-supplier of micro-needle devices. The design should differ from the (little) competition there is by having a strong focus on ease of use and safety, as well as presenting itself as a qualitative product by a high-end, appealing packaging design.“ Together with an extensive program of requirements, this vision was leading for the following concept- and embodiment phase. As a concept, a micro-needle device was proposed that features a bigger, more reliable cap, which has been optimized in many ways. A hub – add-on system was proposed as well, to make the device versatile and adaptable. With this system, U-Needle only has to manufacture one type of needle (length); the add-on provides the final function, such as effective needle length. Furthermore, a concept for a sample-sized secondary packaging has been proposed. After the initial concept, the design went through three iterations before the final design was made. Several prototypes have been ordered, tested, destroyed and evaluated to come to the final design proposal. This design has been optimized on many levels, such as safety, usability and manufacturability. High quality renders show the product and its different aspects in its final form, pointing out the unique features and the differences between the new and the old micro-needle device. Even though the final design is the fourth version, there is always room for improvement. These are suggested in the final chapter of this report.","microneedle; needle; silicon; medisign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","IPD","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","The main objective of the present experimental investigation is to study the turbulent reacting flow field in the region where a stable premixed flame jet (Re = 3250 and ?= 1.3) impinges normally on a cooled cylinder and gain a better understanding of the effect of the cylinder wall temperature. PIV measurements were done in a plane normal to the cylinder axis for both a cold wall (100 °C) and a hot wall (500 °C). The effect of wall temperature on mean flow velocities and Reynolds stresses were investigated by comparing the results of detailed PIV measurements for both cases. The effect of wall temperature on the mean flow velocities is minimal. In the impinging jet region, small differences in the mean velocities only exist near the wall due to thermal expansion. In the wall jet region, small differences in the mean velocities arise further away from the wall caused by the mean position where large scale vortices are created. It was found that the position where these vortices form are generally further upstream for a hot wall than for a cold wall. Large Reynolds stresses are found at two locations: (i) At the location where the inner flame bends around the wall, large Reynolds stresses are present due to the wavy motion of the inner flame as a result of shear between the fast unreacted cold core and the slow diffusion flame. (ii) At the outer edges of the diffusion flame, large Reynolds stresses are present due to the periodic passing of large scale vortices, altering the velocity flow field in the wall jet region. At both locations the Reynolds stresses increase with increasing cylinder wall temperature, which is related to the position where vortices form.","combustion; PIV; flame-wall interaction; Reynolds stress; impinging jet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Segeren, M.L.A. (mentor); Ten Oever, E. (mentor)","2014","Gravity based support structure By a joint venture of BAM and Van Oord an innovative type of Gravity Based Structure (GBS) for an offshore wind turbine was developed. The GBS consist of a concrete caisson and a steel shaft. The applicable water depth range is between 35 and 60m. Hydrodynamic loading on the shaft In order to optimize the support structure, the hydrodynamic loading on the steel shaft is investigated. Previous studies with a CFD package showed an increase of the load on the shaft with a factor 2 compared to the Morison equation. The hypothesis is that the presence of the caisson is responsible for this increase. Therefore the (numerical) CFD model FinLab is used to investigate the influence of the caisson on the wave forces on the steel shaft. The influence of the caisson is investigated within FinLab for the extreme wave (ULS) and for two relative moderate waves (FLS). The presence of the caisson leads to an increase of the maximal horizontal force on the shaft of about 20%. The bending moment cycle (important for fatigue) does not change significantly. It is concluded that the caisson is not responsible for the increase of a factor 2. However, while investigating the influence of the caisson, for the shaft a comparison with the Morison equation is made. It is found that FinLab gives much higher forces for the ULS wave (a 75% higher maximal horizontal force on the shaft) than the Morison equation. By also interpreting the results of the FLS waves there seems to be a relation with the degree of non-linearity of the wave. Different possible causes for the difference are discussed. Those causes give a possible explanation why the Morison equation would be less accurate for a highly non-linear wave. It is however recommended to calibrate the outcomes of FinLab with experimental data. Influence of the hydrodynamic loading analysis on the design The influence of the higher wave forces obtained with FinLab on the design of the shaft is investigated by means of a case study. By performing a FLS and ULS analysis the required dimensions of the shaft can be determined. The FLS analysis is based on a simplified method to be used for pre-design only. With respect to fatigue (FLS), the higher loads found by FinLab for highly non-linear waves do not result in a higher fatigue load. This has to do with the small probability of occurrence of highly non-linear waves. With respect to the extreme event (ULS) the strong increase in bending moment due to waves found by FinLab (+120%) results in a 26% higher total bending moment (wind+waves). Conclusions The most important conclusions of this research are that 1) The caisson does not significantly influence the ULS and FLS analysis 2) The Morison equation gives lower wave forces than an analysis with FinLab. For further design these conclusions have the implication that the caisson does not have to be part of the structural schematisation when the wave loads are determined. For the FLS waves most likely the Morison equation can be used, which has large benefits for the calculation time. For the ULS wave another method than the Morison equation is suggested.","hydrodynamic; offshore wind turbine; FinLab; gravity base structure; GBS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The heavy lift market is characterized by ultra heavy and/or odd sized loads. Heavy transports are unique projects, which are engineered for that one time job. Standard heavy lift and transport equipment is used to the extent possible for each project, but often specialized structures are required. A structure that is often used for this purpose is a heavy lift beam. Heavy lift beams are used for load spreading, as well as applications in horizontal and vertical transport. RollDock is a shipping company that provides worldwide heavy lift services over sea. RollDock is currently in the process of designing a new wide deck heavy lift vessel for loads up to 15000 tons, the Module Carrier (MC). This type of vessel will be put into service in 2015. When loading ultra heavy loads, a support structure is required to prevent damage to the deck due to concentrated loads. Current practice is that this support structure is engineered and manufactured individually for each project. To reduce on engineering and material cost, RollDock has requested to design a standardized steel beam that can be re-used for several projects. For increased productivity of this standardized beam, it must be multi functional to be used for other heavy lift purposes than solely as supports on the MC. These purposes are also found in RollDock’s sister company Roll-Lift, which facilitates heavy lift projects on land. The functions of the beam are determined using past RollDock and Roll-Lift projects, as well as functions that may be useful in future projects. The functions for the modular beam are skid support beam, grillage, different parts of a heavy lift gantry, a vertical spacer and a temporary bridge. The goal of this research is to develop a concept design of a modular, containerized, multi functional beam for heavy lift purposes, with the main purpose to be used for loading the BigRoll MC using platform trailers or skidding.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

We consider various prominent mediators in the wound healing process and model the influences that each of these mediators has on each other and their surroundings. Using the model, we find that the number of myofibroblasts and the forces they exert on their surroundings are important factors in the degree of contracture formation.","contraction; myofibroblasts; transforming growth factor-b; collagen synthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Numerical Analysis","",""

(mentor)","2014","Lely is a manufacturer of products aimed at the agricultural sector, such as automated milking robots and forage harvesting machines. About 10% of the total revenue (€567 million in 2012) comes from forage harvesting machines, of which the majority is assembled in a factory in Maassluis, where this research has been conducted. Forage harvesting machines are meant for working grasslands. Because grass grows in the spring, peak demand occurs in the spring. Furthermore, short lead times towards the customer (independent worldwide dealers) are necessary because of the short time window which is optimal for working the grass. Assembly is divided over several assembly lines, the assembly lines have a capacity ranging from 5 to 50 machines per week. A relatively large number of parts has a lead time longer than three weeks. Because short lead times are required, machines are assembled based on a forecast. Consequently, Lely assembles to stock based on a forecast, this forecast is updated every month and states the expected number of sales per product group per month (there are 29 products groups and over 100 different machines). Historical data is used to determine the expected sales per machine per month. Based on the forecast, a production plan is made, which states the required number of machines to be assembled per week. Procurement is based on this production plan. Two problems are apparent. First, the on-time delivery (realized production/planned production per week) is considered too low (on average 85%). About 30% of the productions problems can be contributed to shortages: a part is not in the assembly line when it should have been. There are multiple reasons for shortages, but at least 70% of the shortages occurs when the ERP-system indicated parts were available while in practice, they were not. Based on cycle counting, the inventory record accuracy was found to be <50%, which leads to a great risk of shortages. Second, the inventory of parts is considered too high. In 2013, there was on average 11 weeks of inventory even though the average throughput time is three weeks. A reason for the high inventory is frequent changing of the planning, due to an on-time delivery <100% or because the demand is different than was forecasted. The demand may be different because within a product group the actual mix may be different than the forecasted mix, since this is based on historical data. A high inventory also increases the risk of shortages, because a lack of storage space (which can also be seen as a surplus of inventory) leads to a relatively low inventory record accuracy, because multiple SKUs are stored in the same location. Research has shown that such parts and locations have a higher prevalence of shortags…","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Hurricane Ike made landfall on 13th of September 2008 on the Galveston Island in the Texas area. This hurricane is the third-costliest hurricane that ever has made landfall in the United States and the costliest hurricane in the history of the Texas. The possible future disasters should be prevented by using the best practices and existing technologies used in the Netherlands and New Orleans to protect the region. The Ike Dike is a coastal barrier which would protect the Houston/Galveston region from the possible future hurricane storm surges. If we consider the Ike Dike as system level 1, in system level 2 the Ike Dike will consist of a system of levees, a coastal barrier and a storm surge barrier in the Bolivar Roads Pass. This storm surge barrier can be further divided to the environmental barrier and the navigational barrier in system level 3. The focus of this report is the conceptual design of the navigational storm surge barrier of the Bolivar Roads Pass as an important part of the Ike Dike concept. In this report, firstly the Ike Dike is defined as a system with special requirements. The focus is then on the navigational barrier as part of this system and particularly the moveable gate. The requirements are defined for this barrier and an integral design method is chosen as the design approach. This integral design includes different steps. In the first design step, different options for the barrier gate are investigated and evaluated using the Multi Criteria Analysis on the basis of boundary conditions and program of requirements. The floating barge gate is chosen as the best option for the moveable gate of the navigational barrier. The conceptual design of the barrier is the second design step which defines the system of the barrier and the operational phases. Concrete is chosen as the construction material and the barrier is designed for the full surge retaining height (MSL+5.5 m). In design step 3, the barge gate is geometrically designed as a caisson structure. A gate with the dimensions of 230 m* 36 m* 22.5 m is the final design result with the weight of 70,779 tons. The complementary structures including bed protection, berthing system and articulation system are depicted and designed in the design step 4. Design evaluations and reflections and risk analysis in design step 5 control the design and provide an overview of the design results and important design parameters. As part of the design iterations, in design step 6, some design revisions are realized including the choice of material (concrete or steel), retaining height selection, design with prestressed concrete and initial hydrodynamic analysis of the structure. Comparison of the steel barge gate with the concrete barge gate shows that the steel barge gate has less weight while it is more expensive. Furthermore, the design with the prestressed concrete reduces the weight of the structure to 63,724 tons while increases the construction costs of the barge gate. The preliminary design and overview of the supporting structures including abutments and foundations is the next part of the report. The abutments are designed as the piers in prestressed concrete with the dimensions of 24 m* 7 m* 5 m each. Due to the weak subsoil of the project site, deep foundations in the type of steel tubular piles filled with concrete are proposed as the suitable foundation type for the structure. The project management aspects such as construction methods, maintenance aspects and cost calculations are the other discussed issues. The barge gate can be constructed in the dry dock and be transported to the site afloat. It is expected that the navigational barrier with the concrete barge gate costs 303 million USD while with the steel gate costs 538 million USD. The total cost of the barrier of the Bolivar Roads Pass (including the environmental barrier and the navigational barrier) is estimated in the range of 2.3 billion USD to 4 billion USD. The choice of the concrete barge gate for the navigational barrier is expected to be an economical and realizable solution for the Bolivar Roads Pass storm surge barrier. However, there are some issues which should be investigated more. The articulation system (swing point) of the barge gate is an important aspect of the project which needs special attention. The barge gate in this size has not been realized yet and the operational phases should be investigated more using hydrodynamic analysis or by using the laboratory tests. The construction of the barrier and installations require offshore works which may in reality increase the costs compared to what is calculated in this research project. The optimizations should be done to reach the best configuration for the barge gate in the future.","navigational barrier; design; Bolivar roads; barrier; storm surge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
