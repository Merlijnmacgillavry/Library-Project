(mentor)","2006","Laser scanning is a new technique for three dimensional point measurements. Over the last decades the number of applications in which these measurements take place, has grown significantly. In every application the surveyors are looking for the same result, namely a three dimensional point cloud of the object of interest. The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of the visualization: the objective is to automatically register a laser scanner point cloud with colour images. This objective is based on the developed data acquisition of Zoller + Fröhlich GmbH, Wangen im Allgäu, Germany: a digital camera is fixed on the laser scanner close to its centre. The instrument produces a full scan and colour images of its environment. The automatic registration of laser scanning data and colour images designed in this research is successfully implemented by making use of gradient operators, edge detectors and descriptors. Points of interest are found and matched in both the intensity image of the laser scanner and the colour images of the camera. The matched points are used to determine the external parameters of the colour image in object space with a non-linear rigid optimization. These parameters form the connection between the colour points and the laser 3D coordinates. Visualization can be made now by either plotting the colours onto the 3D points or plotting the range data onto the colour image.","laser scanning; automatic registration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geomatics","","Geomatic engineering","",""

(mentor); Besemer, J.W.J. (mentor)","2006","Infrastructure is not only the hardware but encompass many more, such as the people involved. The geographic component of the information gives it extra value, but generating it is very costly. There are many different definitions of GII and it is useful to identify the vital components of which a GII consists. Based on the four GIS dimensions, humanware, orgaware, infoware and technoware different components of a GII can be identified. GII consists of dynamic conditions and possibilities offered to various types of users to generate, share, access, and use geographic information. The infrastructure consists of technical standards, the physical infrastructure, an institutional framework, a financial basis and awareness at the decision making and management levels. GIIs operate at different levels: from corporate to global. The final purpose to develop a GII is to improve decision making. Decisions require information and an optimal GII facilitates the access to current and accurate geographic information. Within governmental organizations the obligated authentic registers will be of increasing importance for the GII. DURP stands for digital exchangeable spatial planning and is setup to modernize the spatial planning process by the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment. The objectives of the stimulation programme are to make the spatial planning process more effective and efficient through digitalizing of the development, use and exchange of spatial plans, as well as to improve the involvement of citizens and to make the process more transparent. Municipalities are not yet obligated to digitize their local land use plans, but new legislation in the near future is suspected to change this. Digital exchangeable spatial plans consist mainly of geographic information and are used by a lot of users within the municipal organization. Spatial planning on the local level, municipalities, is of great importance. Municipalities are responsible for developing local land use plans, which can be very detailed and have strong judicial value. That is why it is important to have the most up to date local land use plan. The relation between GII and DURP is clearly noticeable here. The characteristics of this relation is the scope of the research. The integration of DURP within a GII will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the use and development of the spatial plans within the municipal organization. Besides this the existence of a GII could influence the implementation of DURP, as well as DURP could influence the implementation or development of a GII. Between the different municipalities there are strong differences in the implementation of DURP. This all leads to the following research question: How does the implementation and development of geographic information infrastructure within the municipal organization relate to the implementation and development of digital exchangeable spatial plans? Municipal organizations consist of two parts: the political and the official organization. The official organization is usually organized according to the concern model. Specialized decentralized sectors and on top a central concern staff and facilitating services. The sectors are each responsible for specific problem areas, for instance economy or social welfare. Currently most of the municipalities are developing from a company-orientated organization, where the focus is on results and performance to an environmentorientated organization, where the focus is on output and process. ‘Turn over’ of the organization or decompartmentalization of the sectors is needed to be able to serve the citizens in a better way. Based on the two models of Graafland (1993) and Kok and van Loenen (2005), stages of development of geographic information provision within municipalities are identified. Currently most municipalities are developing from the stages ‘local control’ to ‘infrastructure development’ defined by Graafland. Local control is characterized by a development of standards, slight awareness for cooperation and the management level gets involved and tries to formalize internal relations. Infrastructure development is characterized by a start of authentic registers, change of organization and a more top down approach to support development of infrastructure. This transition is a shift from demand driven to supply driven and from controlled bottom-up to controlled top-down. The corresponding stages of the GII development model are from the end of the ‘stand alone’ stage, to ‘exchange and standardization on technical level’ and to the beginning of the stage ‘intermediary’. Finally, when considering information provision within municipal organizations it all turns down to the field of tension between a sector and a corporate approach. The implementation and development of DURP is researched in the selected municipalities. The start of DURP is mainly triggered by external events. Together with the digitizing and making exchangeable of the local land use plans comes standardization. The Information Model Spatial Planning (IMRO) is developed to offer each municipality the same set of standards. Although the IMRO standards leave space open for own interpretation, it is a first step in improving the spatial planning. Many of the investigated municipalities initiated the digitizing together with updating of outdated plans. Municipalities are covered by a large amount of local land use plans, often more than 200. Many plans are joined together, to approximately 30 or 40, and the current situation is recorded. The plans are lay down in object-based geographic information files, in which the regulations and explanations are linked to the planned objects. These projects are mostly supported by the GII coordinating department to help implementing the object-based method of working, together with the ICT department which supports the acquiring and integration of the software. Redesigning of the work processes within the development of a local land use plan and setting up managerial control for the continuation of the standard processes and output are important factors for a successful implementation of DURP. This research did not reveal an observable pattern between the level of development of GII and DURP within the investigated municipalities. The relation must especially be found in human and organizational aspects. Knowledge at the GII coordinating departments has in many cases supported the setup of the digitizing of spatial plans. The object-based method of working, familiar to the GIS community, has caused a culture shock within the departments responsible for spatial planning. Another human aspect is the awareness for sharing geographic information. The possibility of other departments to consult spatial plans through the GII will motivate them to share geographic information as well and to keep the information up-to-date. The vital standardization needed for the digitizing of the spatial plans can be used as an example towards other work processes and information sources. For the generation and dissemination of information through a GII, it is important that all the work processes are optimal designed for the exchange and use of geographic information. Exchange requires standardization. Although there is no relation between the development of the two aspects, GII and DURP are certainly intertwined with each other. The information generated by digital spatial planning is often shared through the GII and a lot of the information required within the spatial planning process is obtained through the GII. In most of the researched municipalities, DURP is integrated within the GII. In other words the GII facilitates an important part of the input and output of information within the spatial planning process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","Geo-information resources","","GIMA","",""

(mentor); Zevenbergen, J.A. (mentor)","2006","On December 26, 2004, the world has evidenced one of the most horrible tragedies in history of humankind. Land administration sector was also badly influenced by the catastrophe. The cadastral offices in Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Nias were severely damaged by the tsunami. Most of cadastral records were lost or destroyed. The ground benchmarks, natural and man-made objects were also destroyed by tsunami and/or clearing out works in the tsunami affected areas. With nothing left on the ground, the land administration processes should be started from the scratch. The Government of Republic of Indonesia (GoI) was quickly responding by publishing five-year master plan of rehabilitation and reconstruction of NAD and Nias, especially on the spatial layout and land affairs. Unfortunately, many have criticised the GoI’s master plan. Besides its macro scale (Kamil, 2005), Fitzpatrick (2005) underlined the relocation camps and coastal buffer zones proposals as promoting disquiet among Acehnese. Many of Acehnese just wanted to go home and resettled their houses in the exactly same location as their previous houses that are swapped by tsunami (Montlake, 2005). NAD is well-know by its uniqueness among other Indonesian provinces since NAD has entirely different cultural background. As most of Indonesian region used to be ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdom, NAD had only been ruled by several Islamic sultanates in different periods of time. Therefore, NAD has a strong Islamic culture. The implementation of Syariah, Islamic Law, has been strengthening the Islamic background of NAD. Besides its strong Islamic background, Acehneses have also different customary land administration system than other Indonesian provinces. The Acehneses’ customary land administration system is basically originated from the Islamic culture. The Acehneses’ customary land administration system is basically intending to maintain sustainable development and promoting equality for every Acehneses to enjoy the outcome of development. In order to focus on efforts of rehabilitating and reconstructing Banda Aceh, this study only highlights two out of three components of land administration, which are land tenure and land use. Land valuation, which is another component of land administration, is not included within this study due to the collapse of local governmental institution that is in charge in the valuation of land, as well as due to the prohibition of land transfer before the land administration system in Banda Aceh is working properly. In this study of land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh, the effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh is being evaluated. The evaluation of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh is performed with special references to the Acehneses’ customary land administration system, land administration theories and cases, Indonesian land administration policy and regulation and progress on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. During the performance of this research, interviews and literature study were held to gather information on above mentioned special references. Interviews were held in Banda Aceh, Jakarta and Bandung and covered the point of view of the decision maker, professional and intellectual on land administration field, as well as the aspiration of Acehneses and particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh. On the other hand, the literature study was particularly performed for collecting information on land administration theories and cases in post conflict areas. Moreover, information regarding Indonesian general and special land administration laws, regulations and policies for Banda Aceh was gathered during the performance of the literature study. Additionally, the aspiration of Acehneses, particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh was also acquired from the literature study, to complete the information gathered by interviews. Having evaluated the contribution of Acehneses’ customary land administration system, it is concluded that the customary land administration system is still wanted to be applied in Banda Aceh, even though the Indonesian land administration system has been applied in there for almost half of a century. Some immediate actions on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh that are not in accordance with the customary background of Acehneses, such as titling the land under Indonesian land tenure regime, could still be applied during the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, the customary land administration system is still wanted by the Acehneses and particularly citizens of Banda Aceh to be applied in Banda Aceh in the future. For evaluating effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, a land administration system performance evaluation framework is developed in this study. The evaluation framework in this study is developed based on conventional land administration theories, as well as adopting the cadastral evaluation framework of Soft System Theory (see Barry, 1999; Augustinus and Barry, 2004). The land administration system performance evaluation framework comprises of three evaluation frameworks, which are evaluating the compliance level of land administration system and its components to the needs and wants of Banda Aceh citizens, as well as the fulfilment of objectives of the higher system of land administration. Having compared the Indonesian land administration system and its implementation to the land administration theories, as well as to the state of land administration in Banda Aceh, Indonesian land administration system is lack of compliance with the land administration problems in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. Several basic problems have been identified, such as dualism of land administration regime and lack of fulfilment of land registration features that are simplicity, security, affordability, currency and sustainability, as well as lack of realism, binding power, participation/consultation and human resource in Indonesian land use system. Due to existence of previously mentioned basic problems, which leads to bad-operated and ineffective land administration system in Indonesia, immediate efforts are needed to address the land administration problem in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. GoI, its representative and its partners in rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh therefore have formulated regulations and guidelines regarding the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. Having evaluated the policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, it is concluded that the main problems of land administration in post-disaster areas, which are insecurity of land tenure and needs to address the effect of the catastrophe and disaster mitigation in spatial plan of Banda Aceh, have almost been solved. The policy of GoI on land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh also provides a means to fill the gap in Indonesian land administration regulatory framework, which could be employed as well in the future for advancing Indonesian land administration system. Nevertheless, adoption of breakthroughs proposed by and performed under the policy of GoI on land administration in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might not be able to fully fill the holes left by Indonesian land administration system, such as the recognition of Acehneses’ customary land tenure (known as Hak Ulayat in Indonesian land tenure system) and no binding power mandated to relevant governmental institutions to enforce the implementation of spatial plan. Without efforts to address the basic problems in Indonesian land administration system, the land administration state in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might return to its initial state, even after fully accommodating the previously mentioned breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh. Therefore, besides adopting breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration in Banda Aceh, this study recommends the government to provide supportive regulations to adapt to the customary background of Acehneses and Indonesia in general, as well as supportive regulations and procedures for accelerating the rehabilitation and reconstruction of land administration system in Banda Aceh. This study also recommends GoI to train and educate land administration professionals for ensuring the good performance of land administration, as well as to address the basic Indonesian land administration problems.","Land Administration; Post-Disaster; Banda Aceh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","Geo-information resources","","","",""

Codes applied to seismic engineering, e.g. eurocode 8, do not make a differentiation to relatively long structures. So, what is the effect of uneven excitation on relatively long structures? Is there an effect at all? Do the structural stresses increase/ decrease? The earthquake load, according to the eurocode 8, is modelled by a modal analysis spectrum. Consequently, this modal response spectrum is applied on a modal analysis. The only information a modal response spectrum contains, is the information about the maximum response of a single degree of freedom model during a design earthquake event. The modal response spectrum does not contain information about the time delay in excitation. Therefore it is not possible to implement the effect of uneven excitation when applying the modal analysis. inc a This research investigates the effect of uneven excitation on a jetty structure by the time history method. A model has been set up according the Euler- Bernoulli beam model. The calculation is done for the Alkion earthquake for variable angles of incidence. For particular angles of incidence does the maximum bending moment peak. The cause of this response amplification is discovered in the transfer functions.

(mentor); Stelling, G.S. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor)","2006","This report is the conclusion of a comprehensive set of experiments, which were performed on weirs placed obliquely in an open channel. Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behavior and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighborhood of the weir, and hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. The report also aims at presenting a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient for oblique weirs. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Three different types of impermeable weirs are tested, namely a rectangular sharp-crested weir, a rectangular broad-crested weir (both placed 45 degrees obliquely to the flow direction) and a dike-form weir with both upstream and downstream slopes of 1:4. The last type was tested with several oblique angles of 0, 45 and 60 degrees with the incident flow. By adjusting the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow regimes and states reveal the complex three dimensional structure of the flow with various phenomena like hydraulic jump, undulation, flow concentration, flow divergence, gyre formation, etc. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which make it more difficult to perform accurate measurements. This flow regime also accounts for the higher head loss and energy dissipation than in case of submerged flow. Generally speaking, the hydraulic phenomena that happen in the neighborhood of an oblique weir are equivalent for different weir form, although there are some remarkable differences such as the size of the recirculation zone behind weir, and the amplitude of the undulation waves. Experimental data were obtained by many instruments and techniques; most of them had been carefully calibrated and were highly accurate and reliable. The data collected from acoustic and electro-magnetic single point velocimeters and depth measurements were used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. Meanwhile the whole surface flow velocity field was measured using particle tracking velocimetry technique, which helps obtaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. Combine with mathematic tools we can interpret the data and gain necessary statistical information. When the oblique angle of the weir is altered, both the flow direction and the flow rate change. The flow always tends to keep its direction to nearly perpendicular to the weir crest when it reaches and passes the weir. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at on one side of the flume behind weir, the variation in flow velocity distribution and other asymmetries across the flow. Increasing the oblique angle, the effective length of the weir increases significantly, whereas the discharge coefficient Cd slightly decreases. Together they make the discharge capacity of the oblique weir increases. Finally, the discharge coefficient and its relations to other flow and geometry parameters obtained from this research were compared to the available knowledge on oblique weirs, including the published researches from De Vries (1959), Borghei et al. (2003) and the numerical models simulations from Wols (2005). The common findings between researches enhanced each other reliability; whereas the differences are a motivation for further studies.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Coenders, J.L. (mentor); Welleman, J.W. (mentor); Veltkamp, M. (mentor)","2006","In the last decad es, the computer has taken in a prominent position in the day to day life. Also in many professional worlds, computers have become indispensable for efficient business processes. The field of structural design has followed this tendency. Computers have become a tooI a structural designer cannot do without. For efficient structural design processes however, computational power is not yet being used in the most efficient manner. Structural engineers still have difficulties with using available software in an efficient structural design process. Coenders and Wagemans [2005] have proposed a new approach toward use of computers in the structural design process: the Structural Design Tools approach . The Structural Design Tools concept should enable the structural designer to utilise the power of the computer better in the structural design process. The Structural Design Tools concept doesnt strive to be an all-comprising model, but a collection of simple tools that can be chosen by the designer to build his design. The tools should be simple to use, parametric, reusabie, able to communicate with software used in the design world and able to communicate with the user. Instead of using the computer for engineering purposes. the computer can be used for design purposes. An important aspect of the Structural Design Tools concept is the parametric associative character of the design tools. Parametric design is used for the rapid generation of computable design representations describing design alternatives. Potential design alternatives are generated and evaluated in order to obtain insight into the impact of the structural parameters on the final integral design. With adding associativity to the structural design process, design steps are linked and the possibility of adjusting the parameters in the end of the design process is reached. With designing structures for Free Form Architecture, this ability is very valuable. Since there is little design experience with these kind of structures, it is hard to predict what the impact of a design decision on the final design is. The ability of defining the values of the structural parameters at the end of the design process can lead to a more efficient structural design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); van Zanten, E. (mentor)","2006","Dit onderzoek bestudeert de processen die bepalend zijn voor de afbraak van de Galgeplaat in de Oosterschelde. De beheerder heeft een beter inzicht hierin nodig om beleid tot behoud van het intergetijdengebied te kunnen maken. De probleemstelling luidt: Welke processen zijn bepalend voor de afbraak van de Galgeplaat, voornamelijk gelet op de verticale erosie? Hoe zal deze zich ontwikkelen? De hypotheses uit de literatuurstudie (2006) worden in dit onderzoek met behulp van een data-analyse getoetst. In het tweede hoofdstuk wordt de belangrijkste gebruikte literatuur gegeven en de verschillende hypothesese. Hieruit worden de bepalende processen voor de morfologie van de Galgeplaat zichtbaar. Aan de hand van computermodellen worden de bevindingen uit de data-analyse nog eens extra getoetst. Daarnaast wordt aan de hand van de computermodellen een voorspelling gemaakt van de plaatverandering. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op meetgegevens verzameld in de periode 1983 tot 2001. Uit de data-analyse blijkt dat er voor de voltooiing van Oosterscheldekering vaak plaatopbouw voorkomt. Er is dan min of meer een evenwicht in sedimentatie en erosie, met een licht overschot van sedimentatie. Na de komst van de kering, in de periode 1987-1993, begint de daling van de Galgeplaat. Uit de data-analyse blijkt dat er nog wel plaatopbouw plaatsvindt, maar niet genoeg om de erosie te niet te doen. Door een onderverdeling in windrichting komen de sedimentatie-/erosiepatronen sterker naar voren. Hieruit blijkt dat de noordelijke windrichting zorgt voor de resterende plaatopbouw. Windgedreven-, golfgedreven- en getijdenstromingen samen zorgen dan voor een versterkt plaatwaarts sedimenttransport. De zuidwestelijke windricht-ingen veroorzaken de grootste erosie op de gehele plaat. In de periode 1987-1993 heeft de wind voor 44% een karakteristieke zuidwestelijke windrichting. Dit verklaart de duidelijke achteruitgang van de plaathoogte van de Galgeplaat: Doordat de golfrichting haaks op de getijdenstroming staat, wordt veel sediment door het getij plaatafwaarts getransporteerd. In de data-analyse is extra gekeken naar de invloed van een gesloten kering op de sedimentatie/erosie op de Galgeplaat. Hieruit blijkt dat een sluiting van de stormvloedkering niet leidt tot extra erosie. Het is moeilijk om uit de beschikbare data het exacte effect van een sluiting vast te stellen, er zijn namelijk weinig vergelijkbare situaties met een niet gesloten kering. Wel blijkt dat een sluiting geen extreme erosie op de Galgeplaat tot gevolg heeft. Voor een beter beeld van de toekomstige verandering van de Galgeplaat, is in de data-analyse gekeken naar de verandering van de plaatverlaging in de tijd. Het blijkt dat al snel na de realisatie van de kering de plaatopbouw zo goed als verdwijnt. De erosie daarentegen verandert weinig. Tussen 1994 en 2001 is de plaat-afbraak zelfs minder extreem geworden. Dit lijkt te duiden op een vertraging in de achteruitgang van de Galgeplaat. Bij het trekken van deze conclusie is echter enige voorzichtigheid geboden. In de jaren 1994-2001 zijn de opgetreden stormen veel minder extreem geweest. Dit maakt de vergelijking lastiger. Echter voor een voorspelling kan aan de hand van probabilistische berekeningen de kans van voorkomen van stormen berekend worden. Zo kan een duidelijker beeld worden verkregen van de plaatdaling. Met behulp van computersimulaties met het WAQUA- en SWAN-model zijn de bevindingen uit de data-analyse nogmaals bekeken. Met name naar de invloeden van de windgedreven stromingen op het resulterende stromingsveld. Hieruit komt naar voren dat een noordwestelijke windrichting zorgt voor een significante toename van een plaatwaarts sedimenttransport. Dit geeft een extra onderbouwing voor de bevindingen uit de data-analyse. Daarnaast is met behulp van simulaties met het SWAN-model een beeld verkregen van de significante golfhoogte bij de diverse windrichtingen. Hieruit blijkt dat niet alleen de golfhoogte de bepalende factor is voor de plaatafbraak. De noordwestelijke windrichting zorgt namelijk voor de grootste golfhoogte bij de Galgeplaat, maar resulteert niet in de grootste erosie.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Quak, C.W. (mentor)","2006","With the increase of the availability of large-scale geographic data set and the rise of widespread computer networks, such as the Internet, the need has arisen to be ableto transfer this data by means of these networks. The networks form the basis for a Geographic Information Infrastructure (GII), in which data users, data providers and data producers are connected with each other.There also exists the need to offer this data on several scales to end users, for example to get an overview of an area first. Because the geographical information are now sent by the computer networks and large-scale geographic information brings many data, data reduction must take place. This is to prevent that sending of the information takes too much time. Generalization of geographical information is a possible means to let this reduction take place.Generalization is the selection and simplification of detail appropriate to the scaleand or purpose of the map. The appliance of generalization demands that choices mustbe made with respect to which geographical objects are selected and simplified and how this selection and simplification must take place. Moreover, also the surroundings of the objects to be generalized, are often taken into account in the generalization process, which makes that the complete process even requires more time. This way, the complete process can not be carried out in real time.Earlier, reactive data structures, in which geographical information is stored in the computer with several levels of detail, have been proposed as a solution to allow the use of generalized large-scale geographical information in real time. So far, these data structures were using redundancy with respect to geometry. For this reason a new conceptual model has been developed, where a number of existing data structures have been combined into two new data structures, namely, the GAP face tree and the GAP edge forest (described in Van Oosterom, 2005). The complete structure is termed tGAP structure, inwhich tGAP stands for topological Generalized Area Partitioning.The tGAP structure has not been theoretically verified, nor implemented or tested. Therefore, the objective of this research is to theoretically verify the data structures and to test the data structures considering requirements such as loading time and storage capacity.To reach the objective literature study has been performed in the field of generalization, database management systems and the data structures. Moreover, a prototype has been built, with which the data structures have been implemented in a mainstream database management system (DBMS) with spatial data types. Literature study has shown that generalization is a key issue in the complete process of obtaining and processing geo-information and that using reactive data structures is asuitable option to offer the results of generalization within a GII in real time.The implementation of a prototype has shown, that it is possible to implement thedata structures in a mainstream DBMS. The data structures are implemented in Oracle Spatial, the DBMS, and by means of Apache, a web server, opened up to Google Earth, a geographical viewer. The data structures in the prototype make it possible to view thegeographical data interactively within the viewer independent from the size of the area to be loaded.The final conclusion must be, that with some workarounds and with some changes tothe proposed conceptual model, it is possible to implement the model as described in (Van Oosterom, 2005). With an implementation it becomes possible to show geographical data on a variable number of detail levels and the implementation shows that the data structures can provide the desired data reduction within a GII in real time.","generalization; topological data structure; gap-face tree; blg-tree","en","master thesis","Delft University of Technology, OTB, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","GIS technology","","","",""
