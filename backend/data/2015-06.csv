(mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor)","2015","Intension In this graduation project I will make a redevelopment of the Q-Port building to a Hotel and Congress Centre: On the one hand, my project focuses on the refurbishment of an office façade into an energy producing façade. This renew has an ecological, social and economic importance. These three aspects reflect my sustainable approach. On the other hand, the establishment of a new use strategy for the Q-Port building in form of a Hotel and Congress Centre plays a key role. The Q-Port building is a bad example of urban planning when an important aspect of life – work – leads to mono-functional urban sectors. Instead of thinking in certain functional categories, I want to create spaces in the urban context in which we simply enjoy living – spaces with leeway for individuality – regardless of how large the building is. KEY Feature - “Grüne Lunge” Key feature of my design is the “Grüne Lunge”, an open public way and an energy generating technology as design element of the façade to unite the urban concept and the energy concept within the façade design. The redesign of the Q-Port building is linked to the historic urban planning strategy to be a green recreational area. Urban porosity is the key intention of the new hybrid Q-Port building with the aim of pedestrian oriented urban places. The transformed Q-Port building becomes localized a `social condenser´ for new communities: The “Grüne Lunge”, an open public space spirals upwards from the street and guides the people through the building. ReDesign The redesign is not only use related but also energy efficient with the design of an energy generating façade, which makes the building to an energy production. In the focus there is an active intelligent façade, the “Grüne Lunge”, in relation to the climate of a building and the possibility for the urban context: The façade is my fascination because it shows most dominant the architectural value of a building. It is the visible statement to the world and it gives a face to the building. Façades connect the inside space and the outside city rooms and have a high potential as multifunctional construction elements. The new task of the façade in my design is, that the “Grüne Lunge”, which is an open public way, is linked to the energy concept of the whole building and is main part of the ventilation concept. The “Grüne Lunge” is an open public way, which spirals upwards, and guaranties natural ventilation in the rooms. In the summer time it transports cold air from the north side of the building into the south part. The night cooling out of the building in the summer is done by the “Grüne Lunge”. In the winter time the air is transported from the south side of the building and is preheated in the buffer zone of the “Grüne Lunge” and flows over an air guide system in the suspended floors into the rooms. Moreover, the “Grüne Lunge” acts as an interspace and a connection point for the public and private activities within the building. Benchmark The perforated glass in the building envelope is only broken by the transparent envelope of the “Grüne Lunge”. The “Grüne Lunge” in the building`s envelope can be seen from the highway or the streets and by this people get interested in the new use strategy of the Q Port building. The new Q Port building should become a highlight building in the Brettenzone like a Benchmark for the city part Brettenzone. Therefore the installation of a media façade which offers surface for commercial activities is done in addition to the BIPV modules at the closed façade parts. This is the next step into a more sustainable future: The energy concept for the Q-Port building is able to generate energy within the façade and so unifies the energy demands of the future.","facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The recent application of Glass Reinforced Aluminium (Glare) in the Airbus A380 has proven to be a suitable candidate to replace metal structures. The reduction in weight and increased performance results in lower emissions and cost reduction. Therefore research has been performed at the Delft University of Technology, dedicated to the residual strength of fibre metal laminates. This has resulted in reliable prediction methods for flat structures. However in practise these structures are reinforced, to be able to support the loads present in aircraft, while minimising mass. The addition of these local reinforcement features has revealed interesting residual strength characteristics. It was observed that these structures may possess the ability to arrest unstable crack growth, when damaged, which is of great interest for the analysis of damage tolerance aircraft structures. Currently no simple prediction method is available, giving insight in the crack growth characteristics and enabling crack growth predictions in the early design phase. Therefore the objective of this thesis is to predict the damage arrest capabilities of stiffened structures in a simplified manner. Based on the literature study it was observed that the current understanding of fibre metal laminate stiffened structures was insufficient for predicting the fracture mechanics of built-up structures. Therefore the available linear elastic fracture mechanics for metal structures is modified to account for plasticity and stiffeners ahead of the crack-tip, by assuming isostrain conditions. As result, the stress intensity reduction factor is successfully implemented, incorporating the presence of a stiffener in combination with the Irwin plasticity correction method. This configuration results in accurate crack growth predictions for residual strength data obtained from literature. The model verification is expanded with experimental test results to validate the crackarrest capabilities of a stiffened structure. Therefore four test samples were tested and analysed, representing the different stages of the residual strength diagram. Based on the test results some difference were obtained in the model, which can be appointed to the negligence of stiffener yielding and stiffener effect on the plastic zone growth. Nevertheless a residual strength has been predicted within 7.5 % of the experimental data. Finally it is concluded that the model is able to predict the crack growth characteristics of a stiffened structure in a simplified manner for both metal and fibre metal laminates.","Fibre metal laminate; FML; residual strength; stiffened structure; crack arrest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Design and Production of Composite Structures","",""

(mentor); Harteveld, M.G.A.D. (mentor)","2015","The welfare state is transforming into a participatory society, in which citizens are expected to fill in the gaps left by the retreating government. At the same time, the government is trying to decentralize, putting increasing emphasis on cities, districts and neighborhoods. How can we, as urban planners and designers, facilitate participation in this changing political paradigm? A lof of concepts come into play when linking these ideas about society - thus social issues - to spatial solutions. The aim of this graduation project is to facilitate collective efficacy - the social cohesion among residents and their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good. In order to do this, the urban planner/designer intervenes in the physical environment. The environment must be designed such, that it facilitates public familiarity on the one hand (people knowing one another) and territoriality on the other (individually or collectively feeling responsible for a space). These two concepts in turn can facilitate collective efficacy. In Beverwaard, a cauliflower neighborhood in the utter southeast of Rotterdam, the subjective scores of participation and social cohesion are far below average. and anonimity is high. Yet, the municipality of Rotterdam promotes Beverwaard as a district where people know one another, with a village-like vibe. These observations make Beverwaard a testcase very well suited for this graduation project. Beverwaard as a whole is mainly residential, except for one shopping center. However, the shopping center is located far away for a lot of residents, which means they often take the car to shopping centers outside of Beverwaard. Also, the district is experienced as a whole district instead of a district with spatially articulated smaller entities in terms of scale. The housing quality in Beverwaard is often appreciated, although they often house lower income groups. Hence, the residents of Beverwaard often feel at home in their own private houses and sometimes in the district as a whole; the institution of a neighborhood for instance, is hardly mentioned. The infrastructural system is characterized by a cauliflower structure; main roads branch out into secondary roads, which in turn branch out into third order streets that are often designed as “woonerven” or parking spaces (“hofjes” for parking). The public spaces for staying in Beverwaard, like the streets, are also differentiated in terms of scale of use. While most of the streets function relatively well with the exception of some of the hofjes for parking, the public spaces do not always work as well as perhaps intended. Often, the spaces that do not function well, are not used a lot or where conflict is likely to arise, there is a problem with the readability of the space. The territorial boundaries are often unclear. From a literature review and the spatial analysis of Beverwaard and Overschie as a case study, a pattern language has been developed. These design patterns each provide a hypothesis, often concerning a spatial solution for a socio-spatial problem. The patterns are a convenient way of translating research into design elements, while the design can likewise influence the patterns as well; developing a pattern language is a dialectic process. The basic layout of a design pattern makes it an ideal tool to communicate with laymen, but also with professionals. The patterns are ordered in a pattern language, in which the semantic relationships between the patterns play an important role. By visualizing these relationships, design choices can be made more explicit, and are therefore easier to communicate. Returning to Beverwaard, the main problems, as described, result from a lack of spatial articulation of certain spatial entities, as well as a lack of places to interact with others. The long-term vision for Beverwaard aims to take a few important measures: the boundaries of neighborhoods are spatially articulated, each neighborhood starts to develop an own identity overtime and the facilities located in the center now are spread out over the district at strategic locations as places to meet others. The vision ideally is established in a workshop with “local leaders”, actors who know what goes on in the district and have the capacity to act on it. Furthermore, two scenarios have been established to guide the transformation on the smaller scales: the readability scenario and the enclosure scenario. The readability scenario is aimed at spatially articulating territories on various scales; it is relatively cheap, flexible and “open”, as it outsiders are still allowed to go anywhere. The enclosure scenario in contrast, is characterized by an enclosure of spaces for outsiders or at least limiting the number of outsiders at specific locations. This scenario is relatively expensive, inflexible and “closed”. Ideally, the choice of scenario for a specific location is done in a workshop with local leaders as well. In this workshop, the more abstract, large scale patterns are employed. The choice of scenario provides the framework for the further infill of the actual interventions. The infill is ideally decided upon in a workshop by local residents; their local knowledge is essential in redesigning a public space, for instance. In this workshop, the more concrete and small scale patterns are used, as they can be more easily understood by the laymen and are most relevant for the concrete infill of the framework. The vision as well as the specific interventions are all targeted at making territories readable and facilitating public familiarity on various scales. Each of the interventions is shown in flowcharts, making the choices of patterns and thus the design choices explicit. Together, all the small scale interventions fit into the long-term vision and they will generate a district with a gradual transition from private to public. Hence, the original idea behind the cauliflower district has been updated, to form an environment that will facilitate collective efficacy. Beverwaard thereby might become the district it aims to be; a district ready for the participatory society.","Urban planning; Participation; Pattern language; Territoriality; Public familiarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Fabrics","","51.892175, 4.567609"

The focus lies with the combination of a loadbearing capacity and an aesthetic value specifically derived from this production technique.

However, the core of the research is done by physical and digital modelling and concluded with physical tests of two types of one to five scaled mock-ups. The first part focusses on the possibilities and aesthetic of the shape, the second part seeks to substantiate the structural probabilities. The result is a design of a pillar with a suggestion for the supports to the bridge deck and the ground. The design seems feasible but further research is needed before the capacities of the design can fully be substantiated and the product can be put in practice. The current obstacles include uncertainties in the used calculation software, the interaction of the different wound bundles and the durability of the composite material. Shown is that an aesthetic value can be gained from the technique and the material whilst maintaining structural capacity. A lightweight product can be constructed and diversity can be achieved according to the described principle.","Filament winding; FRP; Light weight pillar; Bridge; column","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Structural","",""

(mentor); Madsen, H.A. (mentor); Ferreira, C.J.S. (mentor); Vita, L. (mentor)","2015","In the last years, large scale Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are re-gaining a general interest in the wind energy sector as an alternative to Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs). However, the existing standards and guidelines for wind turbine certification do not include specific requirements for VAWT rotors. This thesis aims to study the adequacy and applicability of the IEC 61400-1 ed.3, 2005 International Standard minimum design requirements, when it is applied on multi-megawatt VAWTs. This is accomplished by simulating a VAWT aeroelastic model under various Design Load Cases (DLCs) and analysing the results. The motivation comes from the recent years scientific research and developments which revealed that a VAWT can be beneficial in some types of applications in comparison with a HAWT. As a result, a minimum engineering integrity proof for VAWTs is needed before the installation and operation phase as in HAWT. The work is split into two main phases. The first copes with the construction of a reliable large scale VAWT aeroelastic model which serves as the basis for the analysis. A 5 MW 2-bladed VAWT aeroelastic model is built based on the “DeepWind” concept. Since blade instabilities were reported the ""Sandia 34 m, 500 kW VAWT test bed"" is up-scaled and used as guidance for the modification of the blade structural properties. In addition, the selection and validation of an aeroelastic code able to compute the VAWT aerodynamics and loads under different environmental conditions and wind turbine states is investigated. The study has been conducted through a special project by the author as part of this thesis. It was meant to study and apply an aeroelastic code by constructing a VAWT aeroelastic model. The Sandia 34 m, 500 kW VAWT was modelled and simulated with HAWC2 aeroelastic code, showing good agreement with experimental data published by Sandia National Laboratories. In the second part is studied the adequacy and applicability of the aforementioned international standard on VAWTs and recommendations are made by simulating several DLCs using HAWC2 code. Ultimate and fatigue loads during normal operation of the wind turbine are extracted and sensitivity analyses of relevant parameters that could influence the results are performed. These include the blade stiffness and structural damping, and the generator slip. Various wind conditions are applied including extreme operating gust, extreme wind shear and extreme wind direction change. The results from normal power production are compared with the “NREL 5 MW HAWT” which has the same rated power as the VAWT model in order to give an insight on the load levels between horizontal and vertical axis turbines. Design situations of parked turbine and emergency shut-down are also investigated. The results (chapters 3 and 4) indicate that the loads emerging from the extreme wind shear and wind direction change conditions are not critical for the VAWT, thus the corresponding design load cases could become optional. The case of parked turbine with locked rotor at specific orientations relatively to the wind direction revealed blade instabilities when the turbine was simulated under 50 year recurrence period wind conditions. The load comparison between the horizontal and the vertical axis wind turbines showed that the loads at blade low root and turbine base bottom are higher in VAWT but it should be noted that the NREL turbine is a 3 bladed configuration, while the developed VAWT model has 2 blades. The case of supported tower with guy wires was analysed and relevant load cases are proposed. In general regarding the loads it is concluded that the inherent variation of the blade aerodynamic forces during every revolution results to highly deterministic loads on the turbine reducing the effect of turbulence. This could lead to lower partial safety factors if could be demonstrated in other VAWT types. Finally, some small modifications on the definitions of the standard are proposed in order to avoid ambiguities when it is applied to VAWTs.","Windenergy; vertical axis wind turbine; standard; certification; DLC; load cases; VAWT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-30","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","EWEM","",""

Still, there is no known general method to make an online estimation of the state of balance of the walking human, with the limited and local sensor measurements that are usually available. Previous work has failed to address such an estimation for human walking rather than standing or biped walking, with only an upper body Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and by incorporating the major human balance strategies, to adequately predict the interaction between the human and the robot. In this study, a state estimation technique is introduced: the applied observer is an Additive Unscented Kalman Filter (Additive UKF), and the model consists of a spring-loaded inverted pendulum and articulated upper body, with virtual pivot point (VPP) control and foot placement based on the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM); the Virtual Pendulum Model. The following is described: the dynamic model and observer design, a sensitivity analysis with simulation data, and observer performance with data from a human walking experiment on a treadmill. Proper tuning and limited errors in model parameters, particularly foot contact detection, resulted in promising estimates. With further research toward improved parameter estimation and higher efficiency for online implementation, this method could be useful for the prediction of human movement.","Additive Unscented Kalman Filter; Human walking; Inertial Measurement Unit data; Observer; State estimation; State of Balance; Upper body; Virtual Pivot Point","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

Although a number of projects have indeed provided different kind of good public space, the question of how to achieve new identity for these cities through enhancing the social life of citizens is still under discussion. Therefore, spaces are still here for more research and interventions on the theme of re-development of post-industrial cities, especially on the aspect of social impact and cultural identity.

During the past decades and centuries humans have achieved a power over some elements of the natural environment such as the rivers. We have used the rivers as a way of transportation from the beginning of our times until nowadays, they have also been used as sewage system; situation which is changing from some years ago and we have reclaimed terrain from the flood areas for agriculture development. All these new ways of using the rivers have transformed this element. When we talk about the rivers we not only refer to the stream of water, we refer to the stream and the areas surround by it, which is known as the riparian zone. This zone is interconnected to the river stream in many ways so they both protect and evolve together. The area varies depending on the morphology of the river, it can be just a stripe of vegetation with the riverbanks or it can include a floodplain area and sometimes it can be extended until the begging of the hillslope. They have a vital importance on the processes and dynamics of the river and all the species related with this ecosystem. Over time the control of the rivers by humans took us to modify the riparian zones and by extension the streams of the rivers. Based on the case of the Rhine River we will see some changes made to the river. Focus on the region of Basel we will expose more in detail how the river borders have been transformed leading us to adjust our view over the way we treat the river. A new view of the transformed border of the river will be expose based on the integration of the built and the natural environment that will allow the development of both environments.","Basel; Rhine; Riparian zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-30","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Landscape","",""

(mentor); Eigenraam, P. (mentor)","2015","Free-form transparent wide-span spatial structures which have being constructed so far, are based on the concept of three sets of components, the structural components, usually steel elements to ensure both compressive and tensional capacity; the glass cladding elements for expressing transparency; and thirdly an in between set for connecting the cladding with the primary skeleton. Even though glass technology is becoming more and more promising, glass is still considered doubtful in a load-bearing capacity, which implies to a repetitive architectural and engineering repertoire. Nevertheless, in the last two decades there has been a tendency to explore the design and realization of pure structural glass domes. The outcome of these experiments, resulted in glass domes of the same conservative geometry of a sphere of small spans between 5-12.5m. Therefore, the glass still has not reached its limits in terms of architectural forms and span size. Additionally, those studies do not pay any attention n climate performace of the structures limiting to structural aspects. Therefore what is of special interest concerning the presented research is whether or not there are possibilities to implement glass plates in the construction of free-form spatial structures, as a main load-bearing component and the same time fulfil climate performance requirements. In respect to the emerging technologies of glass technology and computation, design strategies revolving around the assumption of using glass to realize a transparent form-active system, are presented through a new concept for an innovative connection method. In particular, the concept of connection relies on the composition of a transparent hybrid composite composed by thermally strengthened glass, sentry glass plus and woven fabric composite. Particularly, the composite has an extended part outwards of a reinforced glass plate, used for easy assembly and disassembly as well as the transfer of tensile forces and improving so the post breakage behaviour. The complete system out of glass plates and joints is controlled by determining the appropriate stiffness during design. The ultimate target, is to apply the concept of this joining method to any free-form shell geometry constructed out of planar glass plates. In particular, the concept of the hybrid transparent composite is explicitly analysed and numerically modelled in order to determine the parameters influencing the performance of structure. The analysis and FE modelling as well as thermal performance simulations took place in three levels, the micro, meso and macro scale so giving information about the performance from the smallest part to the whole structure. For investigating the macro scale, that is a case study of an application of the hybrid transparent composite, an existing transparent roof shell was chosen for the purposes of the research. The existing shell sets the framework of a specific engineering problem giving so a context to the research. Therefore, by re-approaching the same engineering problem, the aim is to maximize the levels of transparency, to minimize the visual disruption caused by the connections and in addition, to solve the same engineering problem with less construction materials by which the use of steel is minimized and the attention focuses on the load-bearing capacity of glass.","structural glass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Building Technology","",""

All plots can accommodate an independent house, in order to allow for infinite changes. Meaning that they could be demolished without affecting other houses. This project is a revival of ‘Supports’, a concept introduced by John Habraken in 1961. Steward Brand concludes his book How Buildings Learn with a perfectly logic statement: ‘All buildings are predictions, all buildings are wrong’. Because all buildings will need to change at some point to deal with a dynamic context. Some allow for this better than others, and some are just really wrong. Which perhaps applies for the apartment building as we know it. This typology usually only allows for small indoor changes. This severe lack of adaptability will leave them redundant far too soon. This is a serious problem from a circularity point of view. Especially with the ongoing global urbanization; there is and will be a high demand for stacked housing, which will require an incredible amount of resources. We must use these resources in a smart way, by constructing for independent housing, not apartments. This will allow infinite adaptability and enables everyone – not just the wealthy – to regain full control over their own house. This project even allows them to organize the plot configuration with an app.","Habraken; Circularity; Drager; Re-use; Housing","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering","","Stock / Flow","","52.306561, 4.947121"

(mentor); Heijnen, P.W. (mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor)","2015","Networked infrastructures such as gas and water pipelines, roads, railroads or power grids provide essential utilities and services to society. Common characteristics of such infrastructures include high capital costs, generally long lifetimes and irreversibility once the construction of such networks have finished. In the design of these networks, the planners face a multitude of challenges ranging from traditional factors such as technical complexities, space-constrained areas to emerging factors such as complex multi-actor contexts and climate change. A chronic challenge is a multi-actor context in which supply capacities from the supplier side, demand capacities from the consumer side and information about the actual commitment of the network participants, who are about to be connected to the network, can remain uncertain for a long time. The uncertainty is especially high when the network involves multiple suppliers and multiple consumers. While deterministic network design ignores these uncertainties, non-deterministic network design takes them into consideration. The goal of this research is to develop an approach of designing a multiple source (supplier) - multiple sink (consumer) network layout that minimizes the initial investment costs while remaining flexible in its response to future changes of network participants. To this end, firstly an agent-based deterministic modeling method of Ant Colony Optimization was developed, which proved to be feasible in finding cost-minimized network layouts of multiple sources and multiple sinks. Next, the method was extended to a non-deterministic method by embedding flexibility options in order to deal with the uncertainty on network participants. The modeling methods of Ant Colony Optimization were found to be intuitive, extensible and customizable. Based on the modeling outputs, the final design approach can be a supportive decision-making tool in the network planning stage. Future work needs to incorporate more practical criteria required by decision makers into the modeling to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and decision making process in reality.","networked infrastructures; uncertainty; agent-based; Ant Colony Optimization; network flexibility; real options; multiple sources; multiple sinks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Energy and Industry","",""

The blast blowers are steam turbines that drive large air compressors, with a power up to 37MW. In the last four years the blast blowers have suffered from a higher unplanned downtime than is acceptable for the company. This situation endangers the reliable and efficient operation of the blast furnaces, resulting in a great financial risk for the company and making it a top priority to ensure a reliable compressed air supply. Improvements for the operational and maintenance strategies were researched. For the operational side this resulted in the introduction of process standards and a risk assessment of the production planning. Here is concluded that the risk assessment model behaves as expected and can be used to compare different scenarios in terms of probability of production loss. Some scenarios were analyzed, lead to the conclusion that the situation of the equipment status was indeed critical, that the expected production loss will return to normal levels starting january 2017 and that there are investment possibilities to reduce the risks from that point on. For the maintenance strategy advice for condition verification and a model for performance monitoring were introduced, where is concluded that wear and damage to the blast blowers possibly can be detected using the thermodynamic performance model that was created during this research.","Delft Systems Approach; reliability; performance monitoring; risk assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","52.47391, 4.620476"

However, the vast majority of public space does not perform as well. One example is Oude Noorden, where the public space has failed to provide a noticeable benefit for the community and contribute to a separation between the different cultural groups within the multicultural neighbourhood. Moreover, the transition zones between public and private spaces are absent or do not work well and this results in social disconnection and poor public life. This thesis looks at the question of how spatial interventions can enhance the quality and increase public life of public spaces within a multi-cultural neighbourhood like Oude Noorden in Rotterdam. I particularly look at the design of the intermediate zone between public and private spaces, named as interface. Architects create urban areas by situating an imposing structure and the public and private spaces occurs as leftover spaces. However, it is precisely this space that is one of the main components that influence public life in-between buildings and shape our movements and behaviour. I developed design criteria that can be translated to other contents and locations to create a successful public space and increase public life.","public space; Oude Noorden Rotterdam; public life; interface; urban regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Design of the Urban Fabric","","51.9166667, 4.5"

One type of mutations on the DNA affects a single nucleotide; these are called SNPs. Some SNPs are related to Alzheimer whereas others are related to other diseases or traits such as hair color. In this report, we have investigated if Alzheimer SNPs are related to specific epigenetic states. Specifically, we searched for patterns to distinguish Alzheimer SNPs from other SNPs. For this, we explored numerous similarity approaches, such as differences in state counts, clustering methods, and a classifier.

Every city is characterized by centralities and marginalities, with specific socio-spatial concentrations of maximum significance, while others lack in value. The political landscape of Eastern Europe has dramatically changed over the past few decades. The challenges in the contemporary urban landscape are the result of technocratic approach to the spatial planning system and society during Communism. Its process of urban systematization to create a mask of national homogeneity on a complex ethnic patchwork has affected and changed the cultural landscape. Paradoxically, this policy of assimilation has resulted in the enhancement of ethnic boundaries and led to the contemporary fragmented cities in which increased social injustice is visible. Roma are generally considered ‘outsiders‘ by the ethnic Bulgarians, as there is little shared national culture among the dominant national culture and the specific culture of the Roma minority. This vulnerable position of Roma in the socio- economic hierarchy is reflected in their spatial position in the urban landscape. The Roma, or: ethnic minorities in general, ask for a new vision on the urban planning systems, whereby multi-cultural diversity and self-managing communities form the core of the urban development strategy. There might be limitless ways to integrate communities within the socio-spatial reality of a city. Yet, the defining feature of every community is its connection with the landscape. The operative landscape approach defines the landscape as a constantly evolving medium that takes notion of programmatic and ecological dynamics and uses landscape to direct communities to an inclusive whole by incorporating change over time and maintaining an active project agenda. This thesis explores an ethnic minority as Cultural Enclave to understand how the cultural identity of an ethnic group could be used as a defined feature with potential in itself for integration. Thus fragmentation becomes diversity and is something to be celebrated rather than conquered.","landscape architecture; Roma; in situ upgrading; cultural enclave; ethnic minority; strategic spatial planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Landscape Architecture","","43.211134, 27.889866"

(mentor); Meijs, M.H. (mentor); Jongert, J. (mentor)","2015","Local skateboarders in Bandung still play skateboard on the streets since they consider to not have a designated/adequate space to practice their passion. Although the government addressed this issue by building the 1st skatepark only in 2014, it ended up being largely neglected/unused for its bad overall design and for being too small for accommodating the increasing number of skateboarders. The failure of such a skatepark was also due to the wrong/poor quality materials and construction techniques implemented, since no skilled-labor has been exploited. On the other hand, even well-designed/built skateparks sometimes fail to meet skateboarders’ needs. This is due to the nature of skateboarding, being a creative and evolutive discipline that continuously demands different grounds, obstacles, heights, generally speaking an increasing level of challenges. Currently, skateparks fail to facilitate interactions between skateboarders and other city users, while fostering the already common idea of skateparks as social “ghettos”. Conversely, architects can potentially think the design of a skatepark as an architectural challenge, being an interactive public space with specific topological requisites and social implications. The design target envisions the merging of a skatepark into an architectural multipurpose building. By doing so, the resulting hybrid-building helps skateboarders and cityusers to dialogue, thus becoming an attractive “urban facilitator” of functions in the city on different levels. The skatepark merges at the level of the roof of the hosting building to ensure a certain degree of physical separation while still allowing the two parts to dialogue. The multipurpose building is considered as adaptable since it can host a manifold number of fix functions (mosque, distro shops, bar-lounge, hostel, workshops) as well as pop-up or temporary ones (food stalls, spontaneous meetings, playground for young and elders, skate events) that take place in different periods during the day/week/month. Skateboarders are therefore motivated to make use of both the skatepark as well as the underneath facility. Specifically the workshop rooms will be used to produce custom boards or new skateramps. Furthermore, the hybrid-building is built with “plantation by-products” woods such as coconut tree and rubberwood tree as well as the more typical Indonesian bamboo and sengon. Coherently utilizing these type of woods instead of teak or similar from tropical rain-forests results in a more sustainable and cheaper solution that at the same is endowed with an added architectural value and unique “identity” that can only be given by exploiting the right mix of local resources. Moreover, a wooden construction allows the skatepark to be easily flexible/adaptable according to skateboarders’ needs. The skatepark is composed by customizableelements that can be mounted/dismantled with ease in order to achieve a possible ever-changing skateableterrain thus solving the problem of skateparks considered as limiting playground that constrains skateboarders’ expressivity.","skatepark; Indonesia; skateboard; bamboo; rubberwood; Pasupati; Bandung","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","","6.8982305, 107.6086472"

Hence the research for electric vehicles with efficient drive systems with electric motors, especially Permanent Magnet Motors has received a lot of attention lately. %This increasing interest in PM motors is mainly due to the high energy density of modern permanent magnets along with high Residual Magnetism , high Coercive force and high Curie temperature. In addition to these the cost of Permanent Magnets are decreasing on an average which will make PM motors cost competitive with other motor types. Currently there is a lot of scope of improvements in the field of design of in-wheel motors focusing on higher Power and Torque density.

The objective of this maintenance policy is to maintain a minimum required level of system reliability at minimum maintenance cost and maximum availability. The maintenance policy defines one of three predefined preventive maintenance actions at fixed time based intervals for each of the subsystems. These maintenance actions are assumed to improve the degradation rate of the reliability of the system during the time interval between maintenance or increase the reliability after maintenance or both. The reliability degradation of the system and its subsystems is model by a twoparameter Weibull distribution based on the actual failure data of the rolling stock fleet under the current maintenance policy. Improved reliability, availability, and cost driven maintenance policies are presented for the rolling stock braking system and compared with each other and the currently used maintenance policy. It is concluded that the proposed maintenance policies can offer significant improvements in reliability and maintenance cost.","maintenance; failure modeling; reliability; availability; rolling stock; maintenance cost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering & Logistics","",""

As a result, there is highly need for evidence-based information to support decision making. Campus managers need better information systems and tools to support their management tasks and to inform and engage stakeholders. In order to contribute to this understanding of the current condition a maturity model will be developed to support decision making. This tool will measure the maturity level of the current state of campus management, including the performance level.

Offshore wind farms are capital intensive investments and lowering uncertainties and costs throughout design, planning, installation and operational phases will offer cheaper electricity production and a more competitive nature against fossil fuel powered energy. <br/>Of course, a big part of the total cost of a wind farm is the wind turbines themselves. Innovations in the design and manufacturing processes are always welcome in order to further advance within the learning curve of the technology and achieve efficient economies of scale. Furthermore, the blades of the wind turbine rotor are its most important component because they express the most basic operation of the turbine, aerodynamics and energy capture. Yet they pose structural challenges. There are efforts to maximise energy output while keeping their mass low, which should subsequently drive down secondary costs. Additionally, another important factor is the increase of energy output in the farm level that can lead to a larger cost reduction. <br/>This thesis aims to investigate the performance and feasibility of lightweight, low power density rotors. This investigation is made by acquiring a performance baseline with the reference rotor of the 10 MW INNWIND machine and comparing it with the proposed alternative rotor designs by means of parametrical modifications. The reference machine rotor radius is 89.166 m, with a blade mass of 41.7 tn and a rated power output of 10 MW operating at an optimal lambda of 7.5. All the new designs include an increase in rotor radius to 103 m. They also include differences in operational parameters such as rated rotational speed, blade slenderness and tip speed, while rated power stays the same. These designs result in different blade masses and allocation of energy production...","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Jahn, I. (mentor); Colonna, P. (mentor); De Servi, C. (mentor)","2015","This report focuses on the design and analysis of various subcomponents of the supersonic nozzle test section of the ORCHID setup. The primary concern is a study dedicated to the model support system which is crucial to the success of a series of gas dynamic experiments for high fidelity software validation. Standard design rules and empirical models are not directly suitable for the nozzle test section design, mainly due to the thermodynamic behaviour of the working fluid, which expand close to the critical point. The configuration of such a support system for the model typically consists of a sting and base support. The aim of the study is to design this model configuration and computationally investigate the influence of these non-ideal flow effects on the conceived model and support system. The model support must remain minimally intrusive to the results of the flow field whilst also being structurally sound. Such results will be useful for the ongoing development of realising the ORCHID setup. A number of sub-goals to complete the objective included analysing non-ideal compressible flow simulations, designing the model and support system and conceiving a coupling tool between the fluid and structural domain. A field known as fluid-structure interaction was investigated to model the coupling tool, and it revealed that using a method known as the radial basis interpolation was recommended. This transferred values between the interfacing boundaries of the fluid and structural domain. Several geometric models were investigated and a diamond model was chosen as it transfers the most stress onto the support system. Pertaining to the fluid setup, a frontal height of 9 mm was selected for the diamond based off results and a review of literature concerning the supersonic blockage phenomenon. The Method of Characteristics was also used to generate the diverging nozzle profile. Concerning the structural setup, a low-carbon AISI 1010 steel was chosen. Two test cases were chosen which involved high-fidelity calculations. This required the coupling tool, where information was transferred to the FEA solver. The first case being an aligned case where the model was aligned to the nozzle and the second being a deflected case. Results indicate that the effect of pressure was insignificant for the aligned case, with a maximum stress of 0.564 MPa and deflections at the tip being 6.074 x 10-4 mm. For the deflected case, it was found that the influence of temperature played a major role in the structural integrity; an increase of 500% in stress from the results of pressure influence and 7% in maximum deflection at the tip. The main conclusions drawn are that the support system would not yield under steady state conditions but the deflections observed was considered significant enough such that it may hinder the results of the flow field. As a result, recommendations for future work include conceiving the automation tool to conduct a full two-way fluid-structure interaction process to analyse plant start-up.","FEA; FSI; vapour tunnel; supersonic nozzle; Model Support System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Propulsion and Power","",""

(mentor)","2015","Recent developments in the demand response (DR) arena (PowerMatcher platform, Google’s NEST device, FAN communication standard, ENDAX platform etc.) indicate that the world is not becoming simpler. A complex set of interactions and mixtures at different levels of demand response aggregation can be expected in the near future. Given the goal of ""liberalization where possible"", such a context is bound to lead towards a market where independent market parties capture different parts of the aggregation value chain. Sooner or later, it will become difficult to make sense of the emerging complexity. Therefore, to capture the economics and market model interactions for independent demand response aggregators in Europe, the following research question was developed and explored in this thesis: ""Under what market conditions can a viable business model be developed for an independent demand response aggregator in the European power markets?"". In the quest of answering this question, three aggregator roles (an In-home Aggregator (IHA), a Community-level Aggregator (CLA), and a Central Aggregator (CA)) are identified and proposed in this document. Then, to map the interactions between these new roles and existing market participants, the electricity market of The Netherlands was considered as a reference herein. Subsequently, through deliberations with different stakeholders (Suppliers/Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs), Distribution System Operator (DSO), Transmission System Operator (TSO), Industrial lobby group (Eurelectric), A French Aggregator, Researchers, and other commercial 3rd parties), a three-layered market model is developed and proposed. Furthermore, the generic business model of a small end-user demand response aggregator is presented along with the assessment of its business case in the day-ahead and intra-day markets of The Netherlands. System Dynamics is used as the modelling tool for this purpose. It is found that there is a potential of generating approximately 2 Billion Euro revenues in one year if all the Electric Vehicles (7500) and Solar PVs (27000) in The Netherlands provide their generation/consumption as flexibility in the market. If the number of Solar PVs in the country increases to 500000, then an aggregator can create more than 9.5 Billion Euros in revenue. As the number of Solar PVs increase beyond a threshold [which is in between 500000 and 700000], an aggregator’s revenue starts dropping. But, a similar rise in the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) does not have the same impact. This is because EV-based flexibility is less when compared to the flexibility from Solar PV generation. Lastly, it is found that an aggregator cannot generate enough revenues if only household equipment-based flexibility is used as demand response. As an answer to the main research question, eight market conditions and seven policy recommendations are also presented.","demand response; aggregators; electricity market; business model; Europe; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Energy and Industry","",""

(mentor); Capota, M. (mentor)","2015","In the age of information our society generates data at an increasing and already alarming rate. To keep up with the rapid increase in the amount of available data, the academics have shown strong interests in the emerging research field of Big Data Processing (BDP), which explores technologies aiming at efficient processing of enormous amounts of data. As a result, many different types of BDP systems, for example systems specialized in large-scale graph processing, have been added into the Big Data ecosystem in the past decade. The performance of BDP systems impacts both efficiency and direct operational costs significantly, and may be the primary driving force behind the development of these systems. Performance evaluation aims at providing better understanding of BDP systems, which is proven to be challenging. The coarse-grained ""black-box"" evaluation is commonly used by performance analysts, which considers a BDP system as a black-box and only observes the overall execution time taken by the jobs of the BDP systems. Such coarse-grained evaluation method fails to provide much insight of the internal operations of the BDP systems. In contrast, fine-grained performance evaluation can be challenging and time-consuming, as it requires in-depth knowledge of the BDP systems on the implementation level, and can involve much repetitive work to process large amounts of performance statistics. Moreover, it is under question how efficiently the users can make use of the results of performance studies, as many studies are often out-dated, have a limited scope, and are difficult to reproduce. This thesis work consists of three main chapters. First, we propose Granula, a fine-grained performance evaluation framework which facilitates performance modeling, performance archiving and performance visualizing of Big Data Processing jobs. This framework is designed to extract fine-grained, comprehensive performance results from BDP systems and to facilitate performance-related knowledge exchanges between system developers, researchers, and end users. Second, using the Granula framework, we build comprehensive performance models for two graph processing systems i.e., Giraph and GraphX. The evaluation method used for the purpose of building these performance models can be reused by others for their custom workload, and these models can be extended by other performance analysts for more in-depth studies. Third, we conduct fine-grained performance evaluation on these two graph processing systems and validate the performance models we built. Among the important achievement of this study, we investigate and quantify the performance overhead and the performance bottleneck of these systems. Overall, we hope to have provided better understanding of the performance of BDP systems by improving on the process of performance evaluation, and by defining a method to integrate performance evaluation into the Big Data ecosystem.","Big Data Processing; Performance Evaluation; Graph Processing System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems Group","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Snijder, A. (mentor); Lee Martin, C. (mentor)","2015","Conservation of natural environment and historical areas, declining the environmental impact and aesthetic appearance are the most important issues in modern architecture especially in designing large structures such as bridges. Glass is the material that gives the opportunity for designing a transparent structure which may meet the aforementioned requirements. My initial concept was designing a structure which allows maximum transparency and not detracts people’s view of the space. In addition, glass can be used for constructing the structure because of its notable compression strength, elasticity and stiffness (young’s modulus of around 70 GPa), its durability and versatility, elegancy and transparency. However, structural applications of glass are restricted due to some deficiencies such as intrinsic brittleness and manufacturing limitations. Therefore, glass is usually associated with load-bearing skeletons usually made of metals or polymers. What is more, bridge may be the best example of engineering and structural physics which has notable role in our social life. Nowadays due to major breakthrough in the field of glass, glass has been used for constructing the bridges but regardless of having remarkable transparent structure, their load bearing capacities are again assigned to a traditional steel work. It means that using glass in a safe primary or secondary structure which still demonstrates that glass is a fragile and dangerous material. However, it is possible to exploit glass with its unique structural behavior in a safe structural component, utilize its undoubtable beauty and offer the excellent space quality. So, in that case heavy steel supports and strong aluminum systems are replaced by glass beams and columns which lead to more structural integrity of bridge and give spectacular view to the water. This project is designing a movable glass bridge which is covering the mentioned purposes and may lead to more investigation about the movable load bearing glass structure in the future.","structural glass; glass connection; movable bridge; structural Ddesign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-29","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Sustainable Design Graduation Studio","",""

With the city’s growing popularity its urban population is expected to double in coming 20 years; while the area governed by Pune planning authorities will double in next five years. The current planning approach is based on differentiated land use which focuses on territorial scales and long term goals. In this planning approach, everyday life processes tend to be ignored. This causes problems which are most prominent in the urban fringes. Fringe areas are vital in the growth and prosperity of the region as a whole. For its weak institutional situation the fringe lands urbanize in an unpremeditated manner and the potentials of its diverse environments degrade by the time the area begins to develop fully. We address this issue with a focus on complexity theories of cities (CTC). Herein, the city is viewed as a complex system characterized by the interaction of dynamics from the bottom-up and top-down forces. With this insight the proposed complexity approach explores into local dynamics and investigates how they can be taken into account to include contextual qualities. This is done by using micro-stories that describe the day-to-day life of families, including previous generations and their socio-spatial context. This information helps interpret the territory in a manner so as to build plausible visions. From this approach we attempt to outline - how a weak institutional environment in the current planning system may be strengthened towards a more inclusive process of urbanization.","urban fringes; contextual dynamics; inclusive urbanization; social capital; Pune","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","European Postgraduate Masters in Urbanism (EMU)","","18.5203, 73.8567"

In contrast to the digital baseband of other Wi-Fi standards, this design consumes much less power: the power consumption of this Digital Baseband (DBB) is around 200 - 400 uW, which is hundreds times less than that of the traditional 802.11 baseband. The basic modulation method of the system is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and the detailed algorithms are explored. To prove the robustness of the system, some error tests for the system are performed. A gate-level hardware design is also presented to prove the low-power design. Based on the synthesis results, a series of optimization is done to lower the power consumption. The DBB has been implemented in 40nm Low-power CMOS process to prove the concept.

Traditionally, these devices are powered using a battery that needs to be recharged. Wireless power transfer has the potential of enabling new applications of those and many different devices, where it is not possible to use the battery (e.g. due to its size or weight), or where recharging the battery using a wired charger is not practical (e.g. wireless sensor networks). In this thesis we investigate Wireless Power Transfer Networks (WPTNs). These are the networks of wireless power transmitters and receivers that are connected together in a network with the goal of increasing network efficiency through maximizing charging of receivers while minimizing the consumption of energy in the network. In this thesis, the architecture of devices in such WPTNs has been proposed. Subsequently, a physical prototype of such networks has been designed and build. Finally, two fundamentally different approaches to achieving high efficiency has been proposed and analyzed in this thesis. After designing and creating the proof-of-concept WPTN system, its performance has been analyzed, modeled mathematically and verified experimentally. A number of performance measures of WPTNs has been proposed and two approaches to solving the optimization goal of WPTNs have been compared using these measures. Finally, certain conclusions have been drawn on the trade-offs between the first --- simpler approach, and the second --- more complex approach.","wireless power transfer; wireless energy transfer; efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Telecommunication","",""

At Delft University of Technology the WILMER Open Socket has been developed for below elbow amputees. It allows easy donning and doffing, and minimizes perspiration problems by leaving 75% of the skin uncovered. However, the relative large locking mechanism and the bulky structure of the socket degrade the cosmetic value of the prosthesis and can result in reduced wearing. The aim of this study was to design a new WILMER socket that fits closer to the skin and is more aesthetically pleasing. A new design was also made for the locking mechanism to reduce the thickness of the socket for children and patients with long and thick residual limbs. The final design and the prototype of the locking mechanism have a height of 7.2mm, which means that a reduction of 6.8mm has been achieved. The new WILMER socket was made out of stainless steel wire mesh. The socket has a smoother transition between the arm and the limb (<5mm) (original 11mm) and a forearm shell covering the mesh gives a more lifelike appearance. The socket is also adjustable and it can easily be donned and doffed. The new WILMER Open Socket can have a great value for below elbow amputees. A more natural looking prosthesis improves the cosmetic value and can result in increased wearing. However, there are still steps in the fitting procedure that need to be simplified and evaluation of the comfort, permeability and patient’s opinion on the design is needed.","WILMER Open Socket; Locking mechanism; Prosthesis; Below-elbow prosthesis; Arm amputee","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

These new safety standards will for a lot of river dikes be stricter than the currently prevailing safety standards. A lot of work has to be done to make sure all the river dikes will meet the new safety standards. The safety level of river dikes can be improved by means of spatial measures, which decrease the hydraulic load on the dikes by increasing the flood conveyance capacity, or by dike improvements, which increase the strength of the dike. The effectiveness of spatial measures has always been assessed in terms of water level reduction and not in terms of reduction of the flood probability. In this research a rapid assessment tool is developed with which the reduction of the flood probability by spatial measures can be assessed. This reduction has been calculated for several types of measures and it is compared with the effectiveness of more traditional dike improvements. The delta programme prescribes a strategy in which the increase of the flood probability because of climate change is counteracted with spatial measures. The difference between the current state of the dikes and the new safety standards should be resolved with dike improvements. This research shows that the flood probability reduction by spatial measures is overestimated. Due to this overestimation more spatial measures will be necessary to counteract climate change than was expected. A new strategy is proposed in which the flood probability for failure mechanism overflow/overtopping is reduced with a combination of dike improvements and spatial measures. The probability of failure for other failure mechanisms (piping, macro stability) is reduced with only dike improvements.","Room for the River; probability of flooding; spatial measures; dike improvements; effectiveness; river dikes; safety standards; delta programme","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Dooren, M.M.M. (mentor)","2015","Home healthcare for chronic illness has emerged as a solution to the increasing demand for healthcare. Philips, as one of the leading companies in this field, is developing a people-centered, technology-empowered ""Hospital to Home"" ecosystem to improve people's well-being and enable people to live a healthy life at home as long as possible. With this mission, Philips aims to establish a holistic solution that covers all aspects of health: physical health, mental health and social well-being. At this moment, the development is in an early phase, with various problems to be defined and plentiful opportunities to be captured. This design project has been initiated to prevent social loneliness, which is a risk in home healthcare since the patients may have less social encounters. This is an exploratory project to discover possibilities to enrich the home healthcare ecosystem of Philips by integrating social and emotional support to patients with chronic illness. People with chronic heart failure have been chosen as a representative group due to its high prevalence, the benefits they can get from a successful home care service and its close relation with mental health. Research has been performed to define the crucial problem and seek for design possibilities. Based on the topic, three main research questions have been brought up: a. what are the causes to social loneliness in relation to chronic heart failure; b. what support can be provided to avoid the problem; c. how can the desired support be provided and integrated into people's life. The research has been conducted from three levels: current context, existing products and services and cardiovascular disease patients' experience in the context. First an overall understanding about the topic was gained via literature review and online study of the current context, existing products and services and the patients and informal caregivers' challenges. Then an in-depth research about the patients has been conducted with interviews and expert meetings. The research findings have revealed the fact that social loneliness cannot be prevented by tackling a single point. It is connected to both the individual and the society, such as the person's self-esteem, physical condition, his or her social network and environment, accessibility to a social context and so on. These findings outlined the future context and interaction. In the future context, the patient and family caregiver will take the main responsibility with support from the medical professionals and social resources, including relevant organizations, and volunteers. In terms of future interaction, supporting to enable is the key factor. Reciprocity and shared value or goals are the main qualities to create more meaningful bonding among people. With a more comprehensive understanding about the problem and possible solutions, a design vision has been brought up together with the feedback from patients and experts. In the project, the product service system aims to enable people to find the richness in their life and to get involved in meaningful social interactions unconsciously. This is realized by guiding users into the context where they can explore their potential and see their value. The experience qualities of the interaction between the product service system and the user are also defined based on the research findings; they should be guided, adaptive, enjoyable and surprising. Using the defined design vision, future context and interaction as guidance, different concepts have been generated in the ideation and conceptualization phase. One concept was selected for further development based on evaluation with experts and patients. The main idea of the concept is to enable the users to do activities that fit with their personal interests and values by providing relevant information and facilitation. The goal is to find a balance between letting them enjoy what they want to do without exceeding the limitations of their bodies due to their condition. In order to motivate the patients to do activities where they have the chance to meet like-minded people and enhance their belief in themselves, the system is designed to give people inspiration about what they can do, giving a sense of security and guidance to help them stay within their capability zone. On the whole, the concept has received positive feedback from patients and medical professionals. It is especially promising as help for people who are trying to adapt to life with cardiovascular diseases to find their own ways of living. The positive and negative feedback from the concept evaluation indicates the direction of improvement and focus. The design has been reformed to emphasize more on providing an inspiring and fun experience, guiding the user to reflect on their current condition and taking control of their own situation. The final evaluation has been performed with chronic heart failure patients to validate the design solution. The outcome is positive and the concept has been proven by the participants to be promising in enabling them get better control about their daily activities and social interactions with others. They wish to have a product that can help them live a normal life following their own desires. Based the feedback, a final concept proposal and recommendations are provided.","social loneliness; chronic heart failure; hospital to home; social support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Currently there are 6 of these platforms installed in the Southern North Sea managed by Shell. The main functions of these platforms are to house the wellheads and divert produced hydrocarbons into a subsea pipeline system. The wells of these platforms are located inside the 3.5 to 4.2 m wide monopile foundations. The first step of constructing such a well is the installation of a conductor pipe. This long steel pipe is usually installed to about 70 m below the mudline using a hydraulic hammer or a drilling & grouting technique. When in 2007 monopile platform L09-FA was built, NAM well engineers were tasked with installing 4 conductors within its monopile foundation. An impact hammer was used to drive the conductors to the designated depth. Soil resistance to driving however increased with the installation of each conductor, finally obstructing the fourth conductor of reaching its target installation depth at all. When in 2014 additional wells needed to be installed within the same platform, two additional conductors had to be constructed first. It was however not clear how these conductors should be installed, as impact driving had already shown to be limited and the application of the drilling & grouting technique was not permitted in this situation (by Shell standards). Hence well engineers had to come up with another way of doing this. A solution was found which consisted of a combination of vibratory driving and drilling & grouting. The two additional conductors were successfully installed using this method. It was however not clear whether the chosen solution truly was the best way of installing these conductors and whether this solution could be re-applied in similar situations in the future. The objectives of this research were to determine the best way forward for the installation of additional conductors within monopile foundations using the SWIFT-10 drilling rig and to determine how the prospects of the method identified as best way forward could further be improved. In order to complete the first objective, a wide variety of pile installation techniques were compared on their applicability and operational considerations. In order to complete the second objective a study into vibratory driving was conducted using a vibratory driveability prediction model provided by a geotechnical engineering company called Allnamics.","drilling; vibratory driving; swift; conductors; wells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bauer, P. (mentor)","2015","Advancements in power electronics has sparked the adaptability of dc systems in varied application fields. The phenomenon of electric arcing in such dc systems, arising due to the absence of zero crossing of current during normal operation, has impeded the widespread proliferation of dc-based technologies in the market. Considering the advantages presented by adopting dc over the ac systems in terms of efficiency and compatibility with renewable energy, it is of great interest to remove any such impediments involved in developing a mature, viable and sophisticated dc system. In context of low voltage dc microgrids, a novel arc detection method has been proposed and validated through simulations as well as real time experiments. It is shown that the detection scheme is able to rapidly and selectively identify series arcing by solely monitoring the load side voltage. The boundaries associated with threshold trigger voltage selection and detection time are defined based on varied circuit configurations. The algorithm is designed to be tolerant to the grid side voltage fluctuations in order to avoid spurious triggering. In context of arc characterization in high voltage dc systems, the bus transfer facilitated by GIS disconnector is studied. Analytical expression for recovery and re-strike voltage is derived to enable their estimation from the measurable space variables of the experimental set-up. The simulation model emulating the experimental set-up and the parameter estimation methodology is developed and validated. By varying the configurable parameters like initial capacitor voltage, switching frequency and source inductances, the possible recovery voltages across the disconnector is simulated. Based on this, a series of experiments aimed at studying the arcing characteristics during bus transfer process are designed and conducted. Finally, analysis tools are created to estimate the parameters describing the arc behavior, such as burn time, starting arc current, corrected arc voltage, input arc energy, recovery and re-strike voltage.","arcing; arc detection; arc extinction; dc arc; dc microgrids; series arc; hvdc; lvdc; high voltage; low voltage; bus transfer; gis; disconnector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DC Systems, Energy Conversion & Storage","","Electrical Sustainable Energy","",""

The main piece of software used to achieve this goal was Tribler, a peer-to-peer file sharing program that provides users the ability to download their files anonymously. Since Tribler is not written for mobile devices, it, along with all of its dependencies, needed to be cross-compiled for the ARM CPU architecture. All of Tribler's dependencies were successfully ported, except for a cryptographic library due to its lack of stability and maturity. As a result of this, an application was created that successfully streams video from a decentralized network of peers, but without the ability to do so anonymously.

(mentor); Hartjes, S. (mentor)","2015","The aviation industry has struggled with reducing the amount of noise that aircraft generate, especially when flying close to communities. This effort has led to the introduction of technological and operational novelties such as efficient trajectory planning. In line with these operational efforts, a tool has been designed in the TU Delft, making use of dynamic optimization to define optimal Noise Abatement Procedures (NAP). Although the degree of precision of this model is high, the nature of its calculations makes it unsuitable for online applications. Alternate solutions have been explored, obtaining promising results especially with the so called ‘snake algorithm’. A snake is defined as a chain of masses, connected to each other by a spring-damper system and with its extremes fixed to a desired origin and destination. When released, the springs tend to pull the masses together. Furthermore, a series of ‘obstacles’ are located in the vicinity of the snake, exerting a repulsive virtual force towards the masses and. For the purposes of this research, the population communities are represented as obstacles that bend the trajectory away from densely populated areas. When released, the system will oscillate before reaching a minimum energy equilibrium position, which represents an optimal trajectory. The objective of this research is to fully implement the snake method for a NAP planner, augmenting the previous models with the following added characteristics:  Use a clustering mechanism to properly represent the communities as solid obstacles.  Work in a three dimensional space and generate complete trajectories in the x, y and z axes.  Implementation of new forces, to allow the snake to generate extremely curved trajectories.  Make use of the Integrated Noise Model, which was explicitly designed to represent aviation acoustics, showing graphically and numerically the impact of the trajectory on the population. Since as yet it has not been fully explored, the design and implementation of a 3D online tool for NAP represents a significant innovation. The results of this model have been compared to those optimal trajectories for two departures from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, proving that the model is capable of generating accurate ground tracks while creating an acceptable vertical profile with complete autonomy. Furthermore, this research demonstrates the potential that the snake algorithm has for the development of aircraft navigating under modern scenarios such as Performance Based Navigation","Noise Abatement; Path Planning; Snake Algorithm; Aircraft; Noise; Snake Method; Optimal Trajectory; Elastic Bands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","Air Transport Operations","","52.3081, 4.7642"

To minimize the damage to healthy tissue, radiation is applied from several directions into the body. When treating cancer with radiotherapy, the organs nearby the tumor are at high risk of getting damaged. In the treatment plan the dose to the organs at risk has to be balanced with the dose given to the target. These calculations are nowadays done by medical personnel. Although a lot of treatments succeed, without much damage to healthy tissue, a lot of treatments do serious damage to the organs at risk. Can treatment plans be optimized in terms of organ sparing? To reach optimization, several methods have been executed in order to create groups within a patient set. 115 patients of prostate cancer have been analyzed using Principal Component Analysis and Agglomerative Clustering. The data consist of Overlap Volume Histogram values of the bladder and rectum in a CSV file. Each CSV file contains 201 values. These CSVs are used as an input for both methods.

The Agglomerative Clustering method results in six plots. A variation in linkages and connectivity has been used, but all six led to no clear distinction within the data. These results led to the conclusion that no subgroups are distinguishable based only on OVH data and no prediction can be made that optimizes radiotherapy plans based solely on OVH data of patients.","radiotherapy; Erasmus MC; PCA; clustering; Rotterdam; plan quality","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

This methodology although promising needs further systematic analysis regarding the determination of the minimum number of controllers required and their corresponding locations (in the uncertain parameter space) to address stability and performance issues.

(mentor); Schreurs, E.P. (mentor); Van de Pas, R. (mentor)","2015","Place, being a product of personal perceptions, makes the establishment of such an inevitably subjective endeavor. The unavoidable Canadian perspective that I bring to each experience of the Dutch landscape has led to a project initiative aimed at revealing the uniqueness of currently ‘placeless’ spaces that reside within the fringe area of many Dutch cities. As an outsider, and in many cases a wanderer, there are spatial qualities and characteristics that present themselves during my own experiences that would otherwise go unnoticed by the native eye. Channeling such circumstances, and utilizing architecture, due to both passion and educational requirement, this thesis works to concretize uncategorized and unrecognized space by providing and establishing a place that is a result, a response, and a means of reinsertion into the Dutch landscape. This thesis proposes an architectural approach to place-making. It explores the process of narrative within the application of small scaled and curated installation spaces so to find a means in which architecture can create a place experience. The research investigates how a series of architectural interventions can establish a sense of place; a sensual experience that allows both person and place to be intertwined and resultantly defined. The aim is to better understand the relation of users to space and place so to comprehend that which is necessary to convert one into the other respectively. The objective is to design an architectural intervention that creates place within a placeless space by reviving and revealing the hidden aspects that are ever existent in space but gone unexperienced. The research reveals the layers that make up place and how it can be identified, established and experienced. A series of case studies at various scales reveal how installation like spaces fabricate place. By means of their small and intense atmospheres that are staged but without program they create an opportunity for an open dialogue between self and the situational surroundings. The projects demonstrate the freedom of imagination and interpretation necessary to have people engage with and identify themselves within a space, both in the moment and in memory. Place, being a personal product, therefore is relational to each individual, and must be weak in the sense that it is not strict in regards to its ways of being experienced. How one is situated within a space defines the place that is established. Place can exist in many forms, but what is essential is that it can be engaged with, lived in and experienced. By enabling one to insert their own narrative into a space, it becomes a personal and explicit place. An architectural place must allow moments and memories to form through personal encounters and engagement so that one can truly in and of the place. The resulting project series is located on three ‘placeless’ sites on the outskirts of Rotterdam with a design objective is to reveal what is hidden within each interstitial landscape. Though each has the same task, the resulting places are explicit to the site they are situated on. The installations ignite an intrigue within users, standing bluntly within the context, and invite a wondering and wandering within its walls. The forms are not only implanted but integrated within the site to show their site in a new light. Through a sequencing of events within each architectural intervention, the existing site is intermittently restricted and revealed to the reader; the experiencer. The architectural form establishes new circumstances to engage with the landscape, awakening one’s distant gaze to one of focus and precision, exposing a composition of site specific qualities that had previously not been realized. Each design being both a response and reaction to the landscape, they offer unique experiences and moments of pause within their respective chaotic contexts. Each architectural installation offers the opportunity to identify, orient and dwell in the here-and-now; in a personal and momentary place.","place-making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

Its main advantage is the high processing speed, which is in the order of seconds. However, application of this technique with thermoplastic composite (TPC) materials is still limited. One of the areas in which almost no research has been done is continuous ultrasonic welding of TPCs. This MSc thesis therefore explores some possibilities on a continuous variant of the ultrasonic welding process, applicable to TPCs. To do this, a machine was designed and developed which has a single, horizontally moving axis. This machine is able to weld in a straight line, complying to any thickness changes in the material. The design has been tested by comparing welds made with it with welds made on a conventional machine. The machine works correctly, but the frame has to be made stiffer, for which recommendations are made. Research was conducted into multiple-pass welding as well, as it is a potential solution for some of the problems sequential ultrasonic welding is facing. This research consisted of welding lap shear specimens in two separate passes, and comparing the produced weld with a reference (single-pass) weld. It is shown that the welding processes and welds are very similar, which makes current knowledge on ultrasonic welding applicable to multiple-pass welding.","continuous ultrasonic welding; thermoplastic composite; multiple pass welding; machine design; lap shear strength","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","","51.990656, 4.3766204"

(mentor)","2015","Gas has proved to be a successful extractable hydrocarbon resource from shale in the United States. In Europe results have so far been disappointing, but with increasing global energy demand a lot of interest remains in the potential of recoverable shale gas reservoirs. However, the way how the economic potential of shale is mapped is insufficient, because there are no industrywide measurement techniques available for measuring the flow properties of these (ultra)low permeable rocks. A proper assessment of the petrophysical properties of the cores from potential areas is therefore very difficult and the results are highly variable. This study assesses the problems found after evaluating a round robin of experiments on selected samples. The multi-lab experiment was performed on crushed shale to compare the results between different laboratories. The permeability results from the various renowned laboratories were found to differ by multiple orders of magnitude on permeability results. For this study, a selection of core plugs and crushed material from various shale formations was analyzed using a wide spectrum of experiments and history match simulation models. The experiments were performed on the analyzed shales and consist of xenon expansion under a CT scan, as well as helium and methane expansion on linear, radial and crushed core plugs in confined and unconfined sealed core holders for different gas pressures. The measured data was history matched with multiple models including a single and multiple porosity-permeability model, with and without a high-permeability streak (e.g. fracture or silt layer) and the Klinkenberg effect. The combination of all these experiments and simulations resulted in a large dataset. After significant quality control, conclusions could be drawn from this data set, resulting in clearer insights into how porosity and permeability from shale samples can better be computed compared to the current technique that uses simulation results from a crushed GRI experiment. Xenon flow in shales under a CT scan provided some insights into the permeabilities of the studied sample, but the accuracy is low. Propagation of the expanded gas over time could be monitored when the measured data was extracted from these images. If more information about the flow behavior of the expanded gas could be derived from the CT images of xenon invasion, this would improve the understanding and makes the simulation model more realistic. The round robin test results for porosity were found to be similar between the laboratories. These experiments were conducted with the noble gas helium. Even though methane has a larger molecule size than helium, the computed porosity from methane expansion is larger due to adsorption on organic matter. Langmuir curve experiment results showed adsorption curves whose maxima positively with the TOC (total organic carbon) of the samples. A more reliable approach than the round robin test results for permeability is proposed by combining the results of the experiments, such as perform a full core experiment on a radial sample drilled parallel to its lamination in an unconfined set-up, then measure a radial linear sample drilled perpendicular to its lamination in a confined set-up and finally perform a combination of these techniques. The first two of these experiments can be inverted with a single porosity-permeability model and the last one with a multiple porosity-permeability model. The first two results can thus verify the high and low case of the multiple porosity-permeability model, resulting in a more reliable result than obtaining permeability from crushed shale history matches.","Shale; Gas; Permeability; Klinkenberg; CT scan; Round robin; Langmuir; porosity-permeability model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

However, little is known about the patterns of leisure-related physically active travels. One of the reasons behind this lack of research is the matter of collecting ground truth data for validation. Yet the data suitable for this kind of research is voluntary produced by people using sports tracking applications. Thus the aim of this research is to develop a method to acquire, manage and process the data from sports tracking applications in such a way that it would serve as a ground truth not only for examining urban recreational travel patterns but also for modelling the phenomena. In other words, the goal is being able to define where recreational actvities happen, where they do not and finally, use this knowledge to give an indication to every space of how likely it is that the space is or will be used for recreation. The Master Thesis report describes methods used for mobile sports tracking application data acquisition and processing in tandem with OpenStreetMap and Eurostat Urban Atlas datasets. The processed data is used as a ground truth in order to calibrate and validate the developed Runability Index, which has been introduced as an indication of space potential to be used for recreation, based on the well-known measure of walkability. The developed method for acquiring ground truth urban recreational travel data has proved to be suitable for investigation of related matters in European cities with sufficient application users. Even though, the Runability Index has not provided enough correlation with the collected data to be validated, it has ascertained that transport-based active travels have different characteristics than leisure-based ones and therefore need to be explored separately.","GPS tracking; sports tracking applications; urban recreational travels; urban space network; OpenStreetMap; Urban Atlas; Runability Index","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Van der Hoeven, F.D. (mentor)","2015","Predictions from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI 2014a) show that high temperatures and heat waves will occur more frequently in the future. Warm weather leads to even higher temperatures in the city, because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This is not without risks, since heat can affect the health of people. Especially among elderly, poor, and minorities many extra deaths are reported because of heat. Heat does not only have a negative effect on people, but also on the economy and environment of a city. When the UHI effect is present, there is a temperature difference between the city and its surroundings. This is caused by the structure of the city, in which five characteristics play an important role. Together the amount of shadow, reflection (albedo value), perviousness, openness to the sky (sky-view factor), and fraction of vegetation/water, determine whether a city retains much heat or not. Since these heat related characteristics can be measured, an indication can be given of how heat proof a certain area is. Also, measuring these characteristics can give insight in how effective an adaptation strategy to heat can be. This is done in a case comparison for two locations in the cities of Antwerp, London and Copenhagen. In this case comparison, the heat related characteristics are estimated for before and after a given development. From the comparison of these results, it has become clear that interventions on a small scale and large scale both can have a positive effect on the local environment. The existing body of knowledge on adapting to the UHI effect, shows a gap in how to integrate adaptation strategies into urban design. Therefore, design elements are used in this graduation project to make this integration possible. The design elements combine the heat characteristics and adaptation measures, which can become part of a design. This leads to a design that is both good for the city and against heat. The mentioned design elements are described in a pattern language. The pattern language focuses on adaptation to heat, and is generically applicable in (Dutch) cities. In the Netherlands the UHI effect occurs in many cities, from which Rotterdam shows one of the largest temperature differences. The air temperature difference can be up to 8°C (Heusinkveld et al. 2010), while the surface temperature difference is 4,9°C (E. J. Klok et al. 2012). When looking closer at the temperatures, it becomes clear that the UHI effect of Rotterdam is mainly present in the central, western and southern part of the city. Two neighbourhoods in this area, called Bospolder-Tussendijken and Cool, are chosen as design locations for the implementation of the patterns. They both are vulnerable to heat, but in a different way. In Bospolder-Tussendijken there are many young children, and it is a poor neighbourhood with a weak social cohesion. In Cool we can find many working people, who are influenced by heat in terms of labour productivity. The developed patterns are implemented as test cases in urban designs for Bospolder-Tussendijken and Cool. It has become clear that focusing on the weaker heat related characteristics of the design location, has more effect than implementing patterns without focus on specific characteristics. Furthermore, it is not important how many patterns are used in a design, but the fraction of implementation should be as large as possible. Integrating adaptation strategies against heat in urban design, with the use of patterns, helps to create spots in the urban environment where people can cool down.","Urban Heat Island effect; adaptation strategies; integration; urban design; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Metabolism","",""

Although commonly used for detailed analysis (FEA) and documentation (CAD/BIM), few tools address the needs of the early design stages for flexibility and quick, insightful feedback and documenting the justification of design choices. This absence of suitable tools leads to missed opportunities for computation in early-stage analysis and documentation of design progression and rationale. StructuralComponents has been developed as a tool for the early conceptual stages of structural design, until recently mainly focused on high-rise structures (Rolvink [13]). This paper describes the next steps of the development of a more generally applicable building model which supports composition of design justification (Coenders [5]): the collection of analysis models, reasoning, mental models, scenarios, etc. which form the backing of the choices which form design. This paper discusses the proposed building model and its underlying concepts, based on research into design theory, modelling approaches, and structural design practice as well as its application in practical examples. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype has been developed which demonstrates this modelling approach is flexible and versatile enough to document various types of designs, processes and reasoning.

Should atrocities be committed by the the government, they would have a hard time to cover-up the truth without blocking the Internet. Governments have demonstrated their ability to restrict access to the Internet during events like the Arab spring. The Shadow Internet bachelor project aimed to create an application that thwarts government censorship by allowing the spread of incriminating footage without the use of the Internet. This way, a video could be passed around until an enterprising journalist can smuggle the footage out of a censored region. When in a safe area, he would be able to spread the footage to the world. Our application implements this functionality by using Android Beam to transfer videos. Android Beam is Google's implementation of Bluetooth file transfer that is started through NFC. As the Google Play Store will not be available during an Internet blackout, it also supports installing itself on other phones through the same mechanism. This will allow the spread of both our application and the video without the use of the Internet. In order to facilitate the spread of evidence we have implemented Tribler support. This allows the anonymous uploading of videos into the Tribler network. The project was divided into 3 Scrum cycles lasting two weeks each. Each cycle iterated upon the existing application, with a focus on adding additional functionality. The first cycle focused on creating the first prototype and getting used to the Kivy framework. The second cycle saw the addition of the core features such as NFC file transfer and the video recording. The final cycle focused on improving the user experience and adding Tribler support for uploading videos. This cycle was plagued with a number of problems that delayed progress, but were eventually resolved. As of this writing, the application supports video recording and allows for file transfer through Bluetooth, along with the application itself, to another phone through the use of Android Beam. Sadly, Tribler support has not yet been fully implemented.","Tribler; mobile; peer-to-peer; Android; video recording; file transfer; Bluetooth; python-for-android","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","BSc Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2015","With the fluctuating fuel oil prices and increasing environmental awareness more and more attention is given to durable ways of shipping cargo around the world. Reducing fuel consumption by using wind as a source of auxiliary propulsion is one way to achieve that goals. Different projects utilising Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP) have been investigated and/or realised in the past years. Since these devices often don’t exert the propulsive force in line with the sailed course a leeway angle is introduced, which influences the hydrodynamic forces. This thesis focusses on predicting the sail induced hydrodynamic forces on a coastal cargo vessel under stationary leeway angleswith the RANS solver ReFRESCOat model scale. The ship was modelled in three distinct modelling steps: The bare hull without appendages and propeller, the appended hull without propeller and the appended hull with propeller, implemented through a RANS-BEM coupling. All configurations were calculated for a range of (small) leeway angles in a double body set up, neglecting free surface effects. The appended configurations were calculated with different rudder angles and different thrust ratios relative to the thrust required at the self propulsion point of the model. Furthermore a grid refinement study was performed for the bare hull configuration to estimate the numerical uncertainty of the obtained results. The bare hull configuration and the appended configuration with implemented propeller were compared to available model test data obtained from available towing tank test results. From the grid refinement study on the bare hull a high numerical uncertainty became apparent for the lateral force and yawing moment. Visualisation of the calculated flow around the hull revealed an increase in vortex intensity and a change in location of the shed vortices for grids with increasing cell density. The bare hull longitudinal force was not validated. The lateral force and yawing moment were validated with a high validation uncertainty. The calculated bare hull forces on the grid with highest cell density show an under prediction prediction of the longitudinal force, which can be explained by the omission of wavemaking drag in the calculations due to the double body set-up. The lateral force is under predicted while the yawing moment is over predicted. The lift and drag due to leeway shows good agreement with the results up to six degrees of leeway but are under estimated for leeway angles of nine degrees. This indicates that asymmetric wave profiles due to leeway contribute to these forces and cannot be captured by a double body set-up. The lateral centre of effort is predicted too far forward but the trend with respect to leeway was captured. For the appended condition with implemented propeller good agreement between the calculated and measured values for the lift due to leeway was found with comparison error for higher rudder angles. The drag due to leeway showed good agreement with the measured results with higher comparison errors for lower thrust ratios. All calculations showed an over prediction of the longitudinal position of the centre of effort of the lateral force. Higher thrust ratios and higher rudder angles showed greater under prediction of lateral force and over prediction of the yawing moment, which was likely caused by the incapability of the model to calculate the increased turbulence in the propeller wake, influencing the forces on the aft part of the hull and rudder. The rudder force in longitudinal direction showed values of up to the same magnitude of the force generated by the hull for higher angles of attack on the rudder. The lateral force produced by the propeller due to leeway was found to be negligibly small in comparison to the lateral force produced by the hull and rudder.","CFD; RANS; sail-assisted; leeway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Paap, R. (mentor)","2015","In the Netherlands the Socio-Economic Council (SER) has signed an Energy Agreement where Dutch parties have laid out a basis for a broadly supported, robust and future proof energy and climate policy. In the joint vision on the future energy mix, LNG and bio LNG are being referred to as important opportunities for the Dutch economy to sustain heavy road transport fuels. A transition from diesel to LNG and bio LNG is capital intensive, because gas trucks are more expensive and there is no infrastructure or bio LNG production capacity yet. If the Netherlands wants to cut heavy road transport emissions, policies have to be developed to stimulate alternative clean fuels. The question arises what the effects of a transition to bio LNG will be for the Dutch economy and society. This thesis is going to answer the following main research question: Which policies and regulations can be used to stimulate bio LNG and what is the value of SCBA in providing more insight in the effects of these policies? The research question is answered by using several methods, firstly a literature review is conducted on current support schemes and regulations towards bio LNG on a national and European level. The next step is to conduct interviews with actors currently involved in (bio) LNG. Meetings of The National Working Group bio LNG in combination with conferences and project visits are used to compose a view on current and possible future measures to stimulate bio LNG. Now the context is well established, the building of a SCBA model can begin. The first step is to compose a “business as usual” (BAU) case. The next step is to define the possible policy alternatives to stimulate bio LNG. The alternatives are composed by combining measures found in the previous phase. The number of trucks of different alternatives are based on sources found in literature. The alternatives go into the SCBA model and effects are calculated. The net present value of the effects is determined by the model and alternatives will be compared to the BAU case. The use of the method SCBA in spatial-infrastructure projects to support ex ante go or no go decisions is well established. In this research the SCBA will be used to explore effects of policy alternatives in a very early stage of policy development. The SER proposed a future energy mix, but how to get there (measures) is not clear yet. The transition to alternative, currently not used fuels inherently imposes more uncertainties to the SCBA than in a more traditional SCBA practice. In this research the introduction of bio LNG is used to elaborate on the value of SCBA in exploring highly uncertain environmental policies. From literature and interviews four measures to stimulate bio LNG are identified:  Fuel tax increase or decrease  Regulations on minimal amount bio LNG blending in LNG for transport  Subsidize mitigated CO2 emissions in transport  Virtually green bio LNG through certificates These measures are combined in four policy alternatives; Gas, FQD, Diesel Tax and CO2 subsidize alternative. The alternatives result in certain shares of (bio) LNG trucks, based on sector forecasts and assumptions. The figure below shows how the effects of the policy alternatives is calculated using the SCBA. The timeframe is according to the SER Energy Agreement set to 2050. After the calculation and discounting, all effects are grouped to get more insight in the distribution of the effects for different actors. Calculating and adding all the effects results in the numbers presented in the table below. Alternative Net Present Value BLN  BAU (reference) 0 Gas 1,4 FQD 0,8 Diesel tax 1,5 CO2 tax reduction 0,4 The model outcomes show that all alternatives score better than the BAU reference, this is mainly caused by the forecasted growing gap between the diesel and LNG fuel prices. LNG and bio LNG shares are strongly connected. The positive external effects of the policy alternatives increase relatively to the number of LNG and mainly bio LNG trucks. The Gas alternative scores high on macro-economic effects, but has the lowest governmental revenue. The figure below shows how the effects are distributed over transporters, the fuel market, government revenue and external effects. From a governmental point of view the “Diesel tax” alternative seems interesting, but this alternative will increase costs for transporters. The by the sector proposed “Gas” alternative brings the least tax revenues for the government. This is mainly caused by a high number of LNG trucks and lower LNG tax than diesel tax. The transport sector faces the lowest costs in the Gas alternative. Figure 20The effects for the “fuel market” are not significant, this can be explained by the way the CBA model is built, in the input variable fuel price profit margins are included. The SCBA method forces the researcher to value all effects and make them comparable. Detailed information about effects is crucial to perform calculations. In this research an “Effect data sheet of different fuels” of a consortium of research institutes is used as input data. Even though detailed information was available, a lot of assumptions have been made to reach the outcomes. The field of bio LNG is in a pilot plant stage, surrounded by many uncertainties. Communication about the uncertain outcomes is important to value the SCBA in the decision process. This SCBA is executed in an ex ante policy development stage, not as a decision support tool (go or no go). The method is used for systematic data gathering and comparison of effects. SCBA increases the insight in the usefulness and feasibility of policy alternatives to stimulate bio LNG. This prevents policies that have a negative effect on the welfare to be developed. SCBA can result in a better understanding of the different effects of policy alternatives for policy makers. Decisions can be made on the basis of a better understanding of all the societal aspects of policy measures. The SCBA gives insight in the distribution and order of magnitude of different effects. The method exposes the real trade-offs. The distribution shows where problems can occur when policy alternatives are implemented. SCBA enhances discussions in the early stage of exploring policy alternatives by providing objective and independent information. The SCBA is used in an undeveloped area of a possible transition to bio LNG where policy alternatives are not developed yet. This setting revealed some weaknesses of the SCBA method. The quality and bandwidth of input data is uncertain. Some variables are more certain than others, so there is a data asymmetry. Accumulation of assumptions and shortcuts can lead to biased results. The presentation of the outcomes is difficult, a generalized table only shows aggregated information. Practically this SCBA is the first to examine the effects of a transition of heavy road transport to (bio) LNG. The outcomes of this research approves further development of (bio) LNG according to the SER fuel mix suggestions. If the policy measures are more crystalized out and the actual production of bio LNG is starting up the advice is to perform a more detailed SCBA in combination with a transport model to support final go or no go decisions about bio LNG stimulation.","bio LNG; social cost benefit analysis SCBA; alternative fuel; heavy road transport; policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","system engineering policy analysis and management","",""

Point clouds obtained from airborne scanners cover most roof information but lack facade information. Similar but orthogonal to airborne scanning, street-view point clouds cover well of the facade information but lack roof points. Therefore, it is necessary to combine those point clouds in order to construct a complete building model. For this combination, simplification is needed in which edge preservation, outlier removal, noise smoothing and uniform density have to be considered as these properties are desired in many post-processing applications. In this thesis, an algorithm pipeline is proposed that is able to take in an outlier-ridden, noisy and non-uniform roof and facade point clouds and generate an outlier-removed, edge-aware and uniform point cloud. The algorithm pipeline can be divided into two independent phases: outlier removal and simplification. The outlier removal algorithm can remove singly scattered and small cluster of outliers, whereas the simplification algorithm pipeline is able to generate a noise-reduced, uniform and edge-aware point cloud. The pipeline is validated to be able to achieve the objectives. Proof of efficiency in running-time is given, so that it can be used for processing large-size real-scene point clouds.","point cloud simplification; LiDAR point cloud; panoramic imagery point cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-29","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

The advisory section, in particular the IT Advisory, required a system that is able to analyze, process and visualize captured network traffic. This network traffic is gathered from the own company or their clients. The goal of this project is to design and develop a ""Security Information and Event Management System (SEAMS)"" that manages Network Intrusion Detection services and provides a report specifying the condition of the analyzed network. In order to manage the different Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) their results need to be merged. Every IDS produces a different result based on their focus. To gain the most valuable information of the network traffic, one has to merge all IDS’s results. The major challenge in developing such a SEAM System is that the system should be able to process an enormous amount of data. This data is roughly between 2- 10TB. The stakeholder required the system to be built in a modular way. This leads to both maintainability and adaptability of the system since the customer accounts for the extension of the product. During the research the development team acquired a large amount of knowledge about network traffic. In addition to this knowledge, they gained understanding and expertise in the used IDSs. By gathering this knowledge, the product got molded into a useful, extendable and efficient Dokterservice for the client. The process, for the development of the Dokterservice, was set up by means of the Scrum methodology. A change of requirements is a pristine reason to apply the scrum methodology, as development tasks are flexibly generated. Hence during the development process, any (un)expected changes could easily be adapted to the product and into Scrum. The dokterservice that is created is able to read, process, merge and visualize the data gathered from the network traffic. Continously throughout the development, the product got tested on captured malicious network traffic, which varied tremendously in size. Furthermore, the product got tested by means of unit tests and continous integration. This ensured the team that the developed components work as they should. In addition to the aforementioned ways of testing, we also had continuous interaction with our stakeholders and organized demo’s for possible future end-users. The future outlook of the Dokterservice is very prosperous. KPMG plans on applying the Dokterservice for future network analysis. We also have provided some future work recommendations which are included in our final report.","network analysis; SIEM; information security; IDS","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Currently available land and water use maps don’t meet the needs of hydrologists and water managers in many cases, particularly in developing countries. Existing maps often lack the resolution and detail required by hydrological models, and those that do meet requirements are limited in spatial coverage. The research presented in this report attempts detailed land and water use classification in the Netherlands and California using time series analysis of spectral indices generated from reflectance data of the European Space Agency’s PROVBA-V. The satellite combines high temporal resolution (2-3 day revisit time) with moderate spatial resolution (100 m pixels) which is especially attractive for coverage at the scale of river basins. The Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) algorithm was used to perform Fourier transformation of the selected spectral indices resulting in frequency domain harmonic component maps and gap-free, cloud-corrected reconstructed time series images. Two approaches for classification were attempted: unsupervised classification of the harmonic component maps after undergoing principle component analysis and supervised classification of time series index curves using a root-mean-square (RMSE) error minimization approach. Neither approach was able to reproduce the ground truth maps used in either location with an accuracy much higher than 50%. Both approaches were also outperformed by traditional unsupervised classification using reflectance data from 3 cloud-free images acquired during different seasons. Thus, the hypothesis that time series with very high frequency would be a suitable source for the determination of water and land use classes in river basins appeared false for the approaches used in this report. The results found that accuracy of classification using time series data was limited by low variation of time series index curves between classes and high variation within classes. While the high temporal resolution data used in this research may be useful in vegetation monitoring of one particular agro-ecosystem, the limitations posed by time series curve variability suggest that applications in land and water use classification of river basins with a heterogeneous land use is limited and perhaps a higher spectral resolution would prove more useful. The results also found that accuracy was also lowered by strong seasonality in the Netherlands and that classification performed better in larger contiguous areas less affected by the mixed-pixel effect. In some instances the RMSE classifier output seemed to exhibit correlation to vegetative and water features in richer detail than the ground truth map it was compared to. Thus, recommendations for alternate ground truth sources were suggested. Overall, the method showed some promise but will likely need to be fine-tuned for better performance and may be better suited for detailed differentiation of hydrological behavior within a certain land use classes, rather than as a first-pass classifier. It may be worth investigating if this technique can be used to improve the performance of existing classification techniques, perhaps by contextual application within a decision tree classifier. Notably, the mapping of vegetation cover, soil moisture and development intensity by spectral indices could help to classify the heterogeneous landscape of a river basin into certain land use classes with similar hydrological characteristics.","land classification; remote sensing; water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","","",""

As the client wants to develop a new modular platform next to their current platforms, the choice of frameworks and techniques was still open. We split up the backend and frontend, because they wanted to have a static frontend communicating with an API server. We used Ruby on Rails for the backend and Ember.js as a frontend framework. The modular structure has been implemented by building plugins for these frameworks, being a Rails Gem and an Ember Addon. Also, we built a command line tool to generate new modules to make it easier to work with the new structure. The resulting plugins allow for the generation of both frontend and backend modules, being able to communicate with each other. They can be executed both standalone, and integrated into the new platform. During this process we wanted to keep high software standards in mind. We continuously tested the product and measured code coverage, quality and other analytics. We have used the Scrum methodology for our agile workflow.

Reservoir sedimentation due to turbidity currents is often severe in these cases. Turbidity currents are not well understood due to their complex turbulent flow structure, the interaction between the flow with the particles and the interaction between particles themselves. In this thesis the venting efficiency was determined for three reservoir implementations that might decrease sedimentation caused by turbidity currents. The three were: an additional sediment sluice, blocking a part of the reservoir and a deepened thalweg. Computations were done by means of a Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model. The Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan was taken as a case study. In this particular reservoir suspended sediment concentrations are measured during the event of a turbidity current. According to the model results the additional sediment sluicing tunnel was the most effective solution.

It was shown that a RANS model such as presented, is able to capture the complex behaviour of turbidity currents in reservoirs and is therefore a valuable tool for reservoir managers.","turbidity currents; stratified flows; Delft3D; Shihmen Taiwan; density currents; reservoir management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Rivers, Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Knaack, U. (mentor); Hordijk, G.J. (mentor)","2015","The demand of customized solutions to product design and to the building sector, has become more and more evident during the last years. Researchers and architects are experimenting the potential of new technologies of digital fabrication, like Additive Manufacturing in order to facilitate the process of customized products. This project is motivated by the potential of digital fabrication in personalized solutions, leading to a “new industrial revolution” in the product design sector the industry of contraction. The research is focusing in “customization” by Additive Manufacturing where individuals are invited to be part of the design and production process, introducing a non-standardized solution for daylight and shading. The proposed sunshading devices for window frames, are customized by each individual according to his/her needs, exploring different geometries for efficient and aesthetically pleasant shading systems for facades. The performance of the sunshade is regulated by its geometrical characteristics. Therefore, a direct relation between geometry, fabrication and light control performance is suggested. This project tries to connect product design with shading performance by taking advantage of parametric and computational design techniques, for personalization of the design and, also, by utilizing additive manufacturing for the final customized product. The proposed external sunshading device for window frames is a “from file to factory” product, while every customer can create his own individual sunshade for a specific window frame. The concept introduces an interface, where the user will choose one of the specific geometries existing in an library of designs. Then he will adjust the geometry by changing the parameters given by the interface regarding his own individual situation, and he will 3D-print the sunshade to his printer or he will order his object printed, also, from the web. Finally, he will assemble the object with snap-fit connections and he will adjust it to his window frame. Since AM permits digital designs to become into physical products at any location in the world (i.e., “design anywhere, build anywhere”) and web 2.0 is able to propagate product ideas and designs fabricated through AM, it is obvious that the combination of the above -Web 2.0 with AM- can start a new approach of product design and new models of entrepreneurship.","3D printing; Customization; Parametric design; Daylight performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-30","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

Lean construction tools are known for improving labor productivity while increasing job satisfaction, which is also related to labor productivity. This research aims to design three questionnaires to measure these relations, and give some initial insights about the relations. The designed questionnaires help measuring the relations between the three concepts; starting or finishing the work on time, being in a hurry, feeling confident doing a task and being pressured to do a job are some ways of measuring the relations between lean construction tools, job satisfaction and labor productivity.","Real Estate & Housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

Sure enough, segregated, deprived neighbourhoods are a common outcome of this phenomenon. Often unplanned and uncontrolled social expansion characterised by primarily low-rent neighbourhoods increases population density and simultaneously diminishes living conditions and spatial resources. The social interaction in between the different age and ethnic groups are lower and the ‘fear of the others’ is fairly high within the population. The European city has been facing the trends of Non-Western multiculturalisation for decades now, and the Brussels Capital Region is a noteworthy example with a truly diverse population. The driving motivation behind this project was the author’s fascination for cultural diversity, the concern for social groups afflicted by poverty, and the hypothesis that they might require a different planning point of view. Therefore, to combine theoretical thinking and practical responses, the main research question explores how urban interventions could enhance the position of deprived residents of the Canal Area in central Brussels. This approach was seeking to explore how environmental social and economic sustainability can be enhanced in close inter-relation and enforcement to tackle socio-spatial inequalities.","multiculture; segregation; participation; public space; social economy; temporary urbanism; diversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Architecture, Urbanism and Buid","",""

People negotiate face-to-face, over the telephone and even miles apart. Each context is different and needs to be tackled differently. Negotiation is a complex process involving emotions, relationships and also a lot of skills. It is something that is influenced by genre and culture. Negotiation is also considered a win-or-lose situation. But if more parameters are added, it can be made into a win-win situation for both parties. The Pocket Negotiator was a specially designed computer support system to help users in the negotiation process. The Pocket Negotiator is a human-computer interaction tool for effectively eliciting a user’s negotiation preferences, explaining the negotiation process, and providing optimal negotiation solutions. When the user specifies the negotiation domain, user profile, user interaction, user’s and opponent’s state of mind and focus of attention, the system can support him/her in an adaptive, user-friendly and intelligent way. This tool is now in an extremely research oriented format and although it can easily be applied in the market, the challenge is to analyse the market potential and find the best market application for it. The aim of this project is to find market opportunities where there is a need for support in the negotiation process. After the thorough analysis and synthesis the market direction of “Win the Quote” is taken forward and a tool called Skizu is conceptualised to enable the negotiation process in between a client and a company. On studying the market and interviewing the users the main conclusion was that understanding the clients need was key in winning the quote. This conclusion led to concentrating only on the exploration phase of the negotiation process in theory. Thus, Skizu helps making the implicit needs of the clients more explicit. It also helps structure the needs better and to understand what is practically possible. Skizu, helps understand and manage the expectations of the clients. Skizu uses a futuristic interactive approach that is projected on the table. Above the table is a smart camera and projector that acts as an interactive control centre. Skizu also has an app that keeps track of the changing expectations. Skizu will help you stand out in the eyes of the client, as they can see the extra step that you take in understanding their needs and also making them realise it by asking the right questions. With Skizu you genuinely listen to your clients and make them feel valued. Skizu is validated and has shown potential to evolve in future.","negotiation; product service system; quotation process; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The phenomenon of salt precipitation is gradually increasing and is becoming a serious issue in the North Sea. The North Sea operators are aware of the serious consequences of the issue of salt precipitation in the gas wells. During gas production the reservoir brine will evaporate leading to an increase in dissolved salt concentration. Salt precipitation results in a decrease of porosity and permeability and consequently a decrease in gas production and eventually in the killing and the abandonment of the well. Currently water washes are used to remove and dissolve the salts but a good understanding is still lacking as the problem is complex. In this study we model radial flow near the well bore and further enhance it to a layered inhomogeneity structure. Numerical simulations using TOUGH2 with the EWASG module are done to determine the rate and location of salt deposition. Various parameters are investigated in order to observe the sensitivity of the model as a basis for further studies. This study shows that the location of salt precipitation is influenced by parameters such as a change in differential pressure and salinity content while the introduction of heterogeneity does not influence the location of salt deposition for this particular model.","salt precipitation; radial flow; modelling gas flow; heterogenity; productivity decline in gas wells; TOUGH2; EWASG module","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section Petroleum Engineering","",""

These can be used as a method for communication between different stakeholders acting on the reuse of a listed monument. The theories and instruments are developed and tested with a single object, a Warehouse in Harlingen, The Netherlands, dating from 1657 and owned by Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser since 1930.

(mentor); Zlatanova, S. (mentor); Nourian, P. (mentor)","2015","Facade reconstruction from terrestrial LiDAR point cloud is affected by both quality of point cloud itself and imperfectness of object recognition algorithms. In the facade, there are many features, which are shared within an object or among objects. For example, within one window, the boundaries of it may share parallel and orthogonal orientation; windows in the façade may share same shape and orientation. This thesis focuses on these features, which can be called regularities, to improve the quality of facade reconstruction. There are three main objectives in the research. The first is to detect the wall and its holes, which represent existence of windows, intrusions or extrusions on the wall. Second, local regularities within one hole and global regularities shared among holes are explored. Last, the quality is evaluated by testing two datasets in order to show overall effect of the procedure. The RANSAC plane fitting algorithms and prior rules are used to find the wall planes from the point cloud. Instead of extracting holes directly from 3D points, a rasterization approach is employed to extract holes, a more robust way to deal with noise and various densities without loss of information. Regularities can be classified into two categories: local regularity with one hole and global regularity among holes. Global regularities consist of two types: global regularities among similar holes or between different holes. Nine cases of regularities within these categories are listed and explored. A hierarchical clustering is employed to identify regularities in certain feature spaces where the objects sharing the regularities will be close. We propose procedures to focus on finding features for corresponding regularities so that clustering can be employed to identify and apply them. In the beginning of the procedure, ICP (iterative control points) is used to identify groups of similar holes. The registered points and transformation matrices are used for finding features for identifying and applying local regularity and first type of global regularity. The boundaries from different holes are used to extract features in order to identify and apply second type of global regularity. To test the performance of the algorithms, two datasets from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds are used. The local regularities and first type of global regularities are explored for both datasets. The second type of global regularities is explored only for the second dataset, as there is only one group of holes in the first dataset. The quality of both results presented by holes on the wall is analyzed. The two results both show good effects of applying regularities and good matching with original point cloud.","LiDAR point cloud; regularity; local regularity; global regularity; ICP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

This research focusses on the specific group of existing late 19th and early 20th century institutional buildings in city centres. The influence of the building structural system is examined in a literature research. Next to this theoretical research a design research is undertaken. In this research a transformation design is made for two buildings which differ greatly in main characteristics. During this design phase multiple influential characteristics are identified. In total a group of 12 influential characteristics is identified. They range from the urban design scale to the level of details.

(mentor)","2015","Near field thermal radiation is the enhancement of thermal radiation by photon tunnelling when the separation gap between the emitting and the receiving object is below the wavelength of thermal radiation. This is caused by evanescent waves on the surface of the object, by surface plasmon polaritons and by surface phonon polaritons. In recent years researchers have modelled and experimentally measured near field thermal radiation. The near field radiative heat transfer between two objects of materials supporting surface phonon polaritons is a strong function of the separation gap. Below 1 um the slope of the distance-heat ow curve is d^-a, where a depends on the geometry of both objects. The goal of this thesis was to determine if near field thermal radiation can be used as a measurement signal to determine the size of the separation gap between two objects. Using the principles of fluctuational electrodynamics models were made to calculate the near field radiative heat flow between various materials (dielectrics, metals, semiconductors and magnetic materials). For curved objects the proximity approximation is used to calculate radiative heat flows. It was discovered that the amount of near field heat radiation between two objects strongly depends on the types of material involved. The heat transfer between two SiO2 plates is expected to be over 1000 times as high as the black body radiation limit in submicron gaps. The heat transfer between an SiO2 plate and a gold plate remains well below the black body radiation limit for the same separation gap. An experimental setup was designed and build to demonstrate that near field thermal radiation can be used to measure the gap between two objects made of a material supporting surface phonon polaritons. Because of its thermal sensitivity silicon nitride cantilevers with a layer of gold on them were used as thermal sensors, a glass microsphere glued on the free end of the cantilever provides the surface phonon polariton supporting material. The substrate used was a glass microscope slide. The experiments where the setup was placed in air confirmed that the setup is sensitive to heat flows between the sphere and the substrate, in atmospheric conditions this heat flow is dominated by gas conduction, in vacuum this is dominated by near field thermal radiation. These experiments also revealed that the setup is sensitive to drift, likely to be caused by temperature changes in the environment. When the experiment was done in vacuum the results were inconclusive, the contact point between the sphere and the substrate could not be determined and therefore it is not known where the size of the separation gap is zero. More measurements are needed to confirm whether or not near field thermal radiation can be used to measure distances between objects.","thermal radiation; near field; position sensing; distance sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","PME","","SOM","","52.01, 4.22"

The results indicate a larger overloading of distribution transformers in 2040 in the village and rural accessible districts, compared to the more urban district types.

This research is about the analysis of mobility patterns in different neighbourhoods in three cities in the Netherlands. The study is based on the validation of mobility theoretical performances by the actual performances measured through the analysis of GPS logs of households, who live in the neighbourhoods. A series of spatial indicators based on proximity, density and accessibility are computed in order to assess the theoretical performances of the neighbourhoods. To achieve this task, information about built environment characteristics and infrastructure networks is retrieved from OpenStreetMap, BAG, BBG, and CBS datasets. Then, using statistical methods the results are validated by the analysis of the GPS tracks of the residents. In the end the neighbourhoods are classified into five classes, according to the different levels of performances in terms of sustainable mobility. In such a way, it is possible to better understand the key factors that influence actual people travel patterns.","mobility patterns; GPS; OpenStreetMap; open data; people travel behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

This growth of population means that a large number of houses has to be produced to keep up with the growth of the city and at the same time deal with the current housing shortage. Around ten years ago the Ethiopian government started a mass housing program that provided houses that can be bought with subsidized loans. All around the city condominium blocks are built, from small scale interventions in the inner city to large scale developments in the periphery of the city. These large scale peripheral neighborhoods have an urban lay-out that reminds us to the modernistic ideas of large buildings in vast open fields. A suburban landscape is created with compounds that consist of around six housing blocks that have little or no connection with the street life. In many occasions these compounds are fenced off for a sense of security. All this results in a public landscape that has little connection to the buildings and the people that live in them. The design proposal focusses on one of these peripheral neighborhoods that has been build six years ago. By introducing a new type of housing block the public space is transformed from a vacant unpleasant landscape into a network of pedestrian streets and public places.","global housing; Addis Ababa; housing; urban design; Jemo; condominium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-25","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture & Dwelling + Methods and Analysis","","Global Housing","",""

As the core of LED systems, LED drivers need to be well designed in order to properly drive the LEDs with high efficiency, high reliability, long lifetime, and last but not least low cost. The major objective of this thesis project was to design an emitter switching power Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) based LED driver using the low-cost switch mode driving topology that can achieve high efficiency and low power dissipation. Using power BJT instead of power MOSFETs was because of the low cost feature. At the same time, there was a topology investigation on the low-cost high-quality driver. BIFRED was chosen due to the single switch structure. An average model of the BIFRED was built to facilitate the analysis and design. In order to make the power BJT has the same switching performance as power MOSFETs, there was a literature study of the characteristic of the power BJT. Aiming at overcoming the disadvantage of power BJTs, the emitter switching technology was investigated. Next was the design of the emitter switching power BJT-based LED driver. The hardware of the LED driver was experimentally tested, and it showed a good performance with high efficiency of the driver and low power dissipation in power BJT.","Emitter switching; LED driver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Sustainable Energy","",""

(mentor); Verbree, E. (mentor); Quak, C.W. (mentor)","2015","Freight is moved by trucks on the road more and more, which is a worrying thing, especially for the environment. A very good alternative to transportation by trucks is transportation by trains. The Dutch government aims to increase the transportation of goods by train from 13% of all transportation to 20% of all transportation, but in reality, freight transportation by rail is used less and less. One of the main reasons is inefficiency in the process, which is caused partly by the fact that freight wagons or entire freight trains can get lost, easily for as long as a week. Not only does this cause inefficiency in the transportation of goods, it also poses dangerous situations if the location of wagons is not exactly known. In this thesis, performed at the company CGI, a system was researched and developed to make real time localisation of trains on marshalling yards possible, using low cost GNSS devices. Three characteristics of marshalling yards have played a large role in the development of this system. First, the fact that freight trains are usually stationary on marshalling yards, this posed an interesting research angle for this project. During the project, the influence of combining multiple GPS measurements to improve the accuracy of the result was investigated, both average and median calculations were used to take these previous measurements into account. A second important characteristic of a marshalling yard is the fact that trains will always be located on a specific track on the marshalling yard. In the time that it remained stationary, it cannot have moved from one track to the other. The tracks on the marshalling yards will be taken as an extra reference system in this project and play an important role in making the resulting location understandable for the end users of the system. The last characteristic is that the order of the wagons cannot change while the wagons are stationary. This order of the wagons is also important to make the result understandable. The order of the wagons on one track is calculated using the distance and the bearing between the different devices. Using these characteristics in the processing phase of the GPS measurements, a real time system to localise the freight wagons on marshalling yards has been developed.","freight trains; marshalling yard; GPS; GNSS; average; median; previous results; localisation; positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-25","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

Furthermore, we provide an implementation of the Online Gradient Descent Method on a portfolio management problem where we have four stocks and we seek the best investment strategy to obtain the biggest profit over the stocks. This has lead to a wealth increase by a factor 1.37 after four years of investing where the best fixed distribution over the stocks in hindsight leads to a wealth increase of 1.68.

(mentor)","2015","Robotics have developed at a very high rate in the last few years. Industries are becoming capable of automating repetitive procedures without pause, and the production speed and quality are improving everyday. The main drawback of robotics in industry is the inability to deal with slight changes in an environment or in certain object parameters. This problem is very much present at Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM) Cargo, therefore they want to automate parts of their product handling cycle. KLM Cargo handles 540 000 tons of cargo every year and their processing hub is located at Schiphol airport. A number of automation opportunities exist at this location, such as the use of Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV), smart planning algorithms and palletising/depalletising robots. This last point is addressed in this thesis. The automation of the palletising/depalletising procedure is highly complex for a number of reasons: large variety of packages to be handled, restrictions for orientation of packages, hazardous materials, and more. The planning of a palletising order can handle the orientation problem and the placement of hazardous cargo, but the variety in size, weight and shape of packages makes fully automated palletising/depalletising difficult. The process of handling the packages is performed by manual labour and with the help of forklift trucks. An ideal solution to compensate the arduous labour is to use physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). This concept allows a robot and human to handle cargo together to place it at a location. The current academic developments in human-robot collaborative object manipulation require known object dynamics and dimensions. This information is not known at KLM cargo, and therefore, the framework of human-robot collaborative object manipulation must be extended to allow for unknown object dynamics. One approach is currently being developed by using the Slotine and Li method of adaptive control. Unfortunately, this approach has a big drawback with regards to persistence of excitation. A new method utilizes fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (TS) system with the sector nonlinearity approach where payload information is included in the systems state vector. This approach allows an observer to estimate the payload parameters without the persistence of excitation limitation. This thesis shows the motivation for using the fuzzy approach and develop it for a two-link manipulator and compare its performance to the classical approach. While the classical approach works under persistence of excitation, a one link manipulator is shown to work without this condition. Two fuzzy observers were tested, the fuzzy Luenberger observer and a sliding mode observer. Unfortunately, for the two link manipulator a feasible observer gain is not found. The approach was tested again, but this time only to estimate the mass of the payload. Unfortunately, this did not yield a feasible observer either. In order to find out the reason for this infeasibility and create an approach that will obtain a feasible solution requires more analysis of the observability of the fuzzy system.","Takagi-sugeno; Payload estimation; physical human-robot interaction; Luenberger observer; MSc Thesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Thallam Thattai, A. (mentor)","2015","Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) systems including Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) and Metal Hydride (MH) based hydrogen storage seem to be an attractive technology for near future power production owing to reduced Greenhouse Gases emissions, increased flexibility and relatively high efficiency. The system design and the thermodynamic evaluation including a second law analysis of large scale natural gas combined cycle systems including CCS combined with MH based hydrogen storage has not been studied so far. The major challenges in the development of these system models are related to process design, system integration and heat management due to the different nature of the metal hydride charging (exothermic) and discharging (endothermic) reactions. The current work presents a thermodynamic system analysis of such a system using ASPEN Plus steady state models. A pre-combustion capture option is chosen in order to facilitate hydrogen co-production and hydrogen storage. In order to understand the effect of capture and H2 storage on NGCC plants, the study has been performed by developing three system models; a reference NGCC system model including a triple steam pressure Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), a NGCC system model including pre-combustion CO2 capture utilizing a Gas Heated Reformer - Auto Thermal Reformer (GHR-ATR) and a Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) and lastly a NGCC system with both CO2 capture and MH based H2 storage. Parameters of applied equipment are defined on the assumptions and parameters based on the activities of three CCS R&D projects. The NGCC system with both CO2 capture and MH based H2 storage includes the system design and the analysis of the system performance of a high temperature and low temperature MH during charging and discharging. The MH system model includes most relevant features of the MH storage system for this application like gas cleaning, adsorption/desorption kinetics and isothermal operation. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) and sodium alanate (Na3AlH6) has been selected as respectively the high temperature and low temperature metal hydride based on operating conditions and MH properties. Heat transfer oil is used to facilitate heat transfer between the MH system and the HRSG. Charge and discharge operation with a hydrogen split of 50% of the hydrogen rich stream has been assumed based on current daily load curves and the practical operation range of NGCC systems. The total input of natural gas was maintained constant during the different cases. An electrical efficiency of 59.9% and a net power output of 431.2 MW has been obtained for the reference NGCC system which is comparable to similar systems described in literature. The NGCC including CCS shows a net power output of 348.2 MW and an electrical efficiency of 48.4% with a Carbon Capture Ratio (CCR) of 0.953. The large reduction in electrical efficiency of (-11.5%) with respect to the reference NGCC system is related to the large power requirement for the Air Separation Unit (ASU), the CO2 compressor and the additional steam requirement for the reforming of natural gas and the rinse and purge process of the SEWGS unit. The overall electrical efficiency of the NGCC system including CCS for the magnesium hydride (MgH2) case and the sodium alanate (Na3AlH6) case are respectively 48.1% and 47.4%. The reduction in the performance with respect to the NGCC system including CCS is relatively low for a hydrogen storage capacity of 50%. This makes metal hydride based hydrogen storage an interesting technology to increase the reliability and flexibility of future power production with less capital and operational costs. The observed difference in the overall electrical efficiency between both MH cases can be explained by the differences in heat utilization during adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. The obtained results and the composite curves show a high sensitivity between the selection of the steam pressure levels in the steam cycle and the operating conditions of the MH storage system to the overall performance. Therefore, it is recommended to do a more profound sensitivity analysis on the steam pressure level in order to improve system performances of both storage systems. Furthermore, a major constraint for both charging cases is the small temperature difference obtained between the hot curve and cold curve in the economizer section of the HRSG resulting in a large required economizer. A 2nd law analysis shows the major irreversibilities for the different cases in the combustor, the air compressor, the gas turbine and the GHR-ATR. The additional losses in the GHR-ATR substantiates the large reduction in power output in the CO2 capture system. The total exergy efficiency of the MgH2 storage system is 64.7% and is comparable to other storage systems integrated in NGCC systems like Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). Further investigations are required to predict accurately the irreversibilities in the subcomponents of the system due to incorrect exergy calculations by Aspen Plus and an inappropriate formulation to calculate the chemical exergy.","Natural gas combined cycle; Pre-combustion carbon capture; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Thermodynamic analysis; Process design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Processes and Energy Technologies","",""

For this purpose, idealized simulation bathymetries that reflect morphological characteristics of two different beach states (namely longshore bar and trough and transverse bar and rip) were created on the basis of observations of the subaqueous topography at the Sand Motor, a mega-nourishment located in the coast of South Holland. Sediment transport simulations were performed for a range of hydrodynamic conditions that reflect typical sea conditions at the Dutch coast. It was found that two dominant morphological aspects determine the response in net longshore transport: 1) the alongshore variability of morphology and 2) the slope and general configuration of the beach profile; and the relative importance of these two are dependent on the hydrodynamic forcing exerted on the system. Relevance of the profile shape on determining sediment transport behaviours increases as the angle of wave approach increases: Steeper slopes in the swash zone promote higher transport rates for medium and especially for high wave angles. Generation of topographically controlled rip currents that increase or decrease net longshore transport rates depends on the angle of the incoming waves with respect to the coast. Situations with nearly normal wave incidence result in larger potential for rip current development than situations with obliquely incident waves.","longshore sediment transport; beach states; Delft3D; rip circulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering / CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2015","Voor het varen in stilstaand water is door Schijf een methode ontwikkeld die, middels het behoud van massa en energie, een beschrijving geeft van de stroming naast en onder het schip. Doordat het schip het water voor de boeg verdringt naar de achterzijde, zal een stroming optreden die tegengesteld gericht is aan de vaarrichting. De bijkomende stroomsnelheid die hierdoor optreedt wordt ook wel de retourstroomsnelheid genoemd. Deze methode is in een later stadium onder meer door Verheij et al. [3] uitgebreid om ook voor vaarwegen met stroming de retourstroomsnelheid te kunnen berekenen. Echter, in de publicatie van Verheij et al. blijkt de richting van de retourstroomsnelheid vaak niet kloppen. Daarnaast wordt in de betreffende publicatie een beperking aan de methode opgelegd die, ingeval van een stroomafwaarts varend schip, de methode onbruikbaar kan maken. Bovendien blijkt de methode vanuit wiskundig oogpunt niet toepasbaar te zijn wanneer een schip, dat aanvankelijk met de stroming mee vaart, abrupt wordt afgeremd. De bovengenoemde vraagstukken hebben als gevolg dat de toepasbaarheid van de methode van Verheij et al. aanzienlijk wordt ingeperkt. De onderzoekvraag die hieruit ontstaat luidt daarom: “Kan de formule van Schijf toegepast worden om voor elke stromingssituatie, dat wil zeggen voor stilstaand water, stroomopwaarts varend en stroomafwaarts varend, geldige resultaten te verkrijgen?” Ter illustratie is hierbij een praktisch vraagstuk aangewezen, namelijk het ontgrongsprobleem in de Oude Maas. Het is gegeven dat de bodem in deze rivier plaatselijk als gevolg van te hoge retourstroomsnelheden is gaan eroderen. Hierdoor is het van belang om de optredende maximale retourstroomsnelheden voor alle mogelijke situaties in kaart te brengen. Het berekenen van de retourstroomsnelheden vereist naast een goed functionerende oplossingsmethode ook enkele relevante gegevens. Deze gegevens zijn verzameld waarna de maatgevende waarden zijn geselecteerd. Men is er vervolgens in geslaagd om een nieuwe oplossingsmethode te ontwikkelen die in alle situaties toepasbaar is. Ook wordt er een alternatief aanpak gepresenteerd waarmee de nieuwe oplossingsmethode toepasbaar is voor situaties waarin het schip stroomafwaarts vaart en wordt afgeremd. De resultaten die met de nieuwe oplossingsmethode worden verkregen zijn tenslotte vergeleken met de resultaten uit de methode van Verheij et al. en geverifieerd met diverse andere methoden, waarna geconcludeerd kon worden dat de nieuwe oplossingsmethode betrouwbaar is. Tot slot is aanbevolen om de methode, die door Verheij et al. wordt gehanteerd in het collegedictaat van “Inland Waterways: ports, waterways and inland navigation”, aan te passen aan de oplossingsmethode die in dit onderzoek is gepresenteerd.","Schijf; retourstroomsnelheid","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); De Servi, C.M. (mentor)","2015","Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main greenhouse gases that contributes to the current climate change. Its increasing share in the Earth atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperature. To prevent the sea level from rising and increased severity of extreme weather, many governments are now trying to reduce their carbon footprint. One third of the global CO2 emissions are produced by fossil-fuelled power plants. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is considered one of the leading technologies for reducing these emissions. This thesis is part of investigating the feasibility of the ROAD 2020 project. This project will be one of the worlds first large-scale Monoethanolamine (MEA)-based Post Combustion Capture (PCC) demonstration project with offshore storage. The power plant in this project is designed so that it can rapidly change between full and part load operation. The combination of the resulting fluctuating flow and offshore storage makes compressing the CO2 a challenging problem. An integrally geared centrifugal compressor train seems the most suited compressor system for a PCC process. However, their operational limitation is their short operating range for compressing CO2 at high pressures. If not properly controlled, this compressor train can significantly reduce the capture unit efficiency. Moreover, possible flow instabilities like surge, two phase flow and hydrate formation could inflict unrepairable damage to the systems in the PCC process. This thesis investigates the dynamic performance of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train for a PCC process retrofitted to a coal-fired power plant. The dynamic performance of the compressor train is evaluated for different process configurations which include different compressor control strategies, addition of a well control valve and a single and double compressor train configuration. The figures of merit used to assess the dynamic performance are: compressor work, impact on stripper pressure, occurrence of surge and choke, occurrence of two phase flow. To evaluate these figures of merit a dynamic model of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train has been successfully developed. The model also includes the transportation pipeline and offshore storage well. The open source Modelica language is used for the development of the dynamic model. The simulations performed with this model give more insight in the performance of the compressor train and its impact on the CO2 capture process, transportation pipeline and storage well. Recycle valves seem the most suited solution for the compressor train to extend its operating range during minimum load of the power plant. Simulations show that all evaluated process configurations meet the required performance and guarantee a stable filling of the offshore storage well. However, each configuration has a different power consumption, possible process complications and impact on the process capital and operational costs. To propose an optimal process configuration for the ROAD project a further techno-economic investigation is required. Two future research directions can be distinguished to obtain this goal. The first direction should focus on extending the developed dynamic model with a capture unit model. The second direction should focus on the technology gaps that make the integration of MEA-based PCC processes with offshore storage challenging.","CCS; PCC; Compressor; Modelling; Modelica; Compression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","Wind power has proven to be one of the most versatile forms of renewable energy. Similarly, offshore wind is currently emerging as the most promising method of meeting the global target for low cost of renewable energy production, given the massive potential of wind at sea. However, from the wind turbine design point of view, the requirement of having a low cost offshore plant implies both that the energy yield of the system is maximized and that the associated operational and maintenance costs are minimized over its entire lifespan. Control systems, while certainly required for safe wind turbine operation, can also help in addressing these challenges. Offshore wind turbines are especially subject to large variations of their physical parameters due to heavy environmental conditions and the pronounced passage of time. This report provides an overview of the research approach taken towards ensuring that wind turbine control system performance, while always affected by several introduced factors that cause deviations of the model parameters from their nominal values, remains in some sense optimal. An analysis of the extent to which typical control loops within a wind turbine control system are affected by design uncertainty is first presented; subsequently, an improved design problem is formulated based on the analysis results and solved within the framework of linear parameter-varying control theory; the presented design methodology for the formulated practical problem has the potential of reducing typical design safety factors considerably thus allowing for a decrease in wind turbine production costs by up to 9%. The document is concluded with several qualitative remarks and possibilities for further development resulting from the presented information.","wind energy systems; control systems; linear parameter-varying control; robust control; ice accretion; scour; reliable wind turbine control design; uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

These current and newly developing systems in ships are expected to cause scour at beds around berthing structures with greater likelihood than the systems preceding them, which increases the importance of protection methods used to deal with this issue. In early 2015, the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC) has published a report titled ‘Guidelines for Protecting Berthing Structures from Scour Caused by Ships’ with the aim of providing practical guidelines and detailed background information about vessel propulsion systems in order to allow designers to make a proper design of the bed protection in front of the berth structures or to estimate the scour expected to develop. However, the applicability of these guidelines to real scenarios remains to be assessed. The limitations and uncertainties associated with the guidelines have been determined by applying the aforementioned guidelines to the riprap type of bed protection design of both open and solid berthing structures in an inland mooring facility located in the Rotterdam harbour. In examining these guidelines, it was revealed that several assumptions are necessary due to lack of information on various parameters and some specifications of the design ship, along with shortcomings and limitations of the methods and equations presented. The significance of these assumptions on the applicability of the guidelines has been investigated. In cases where limitations have been found, owing to assumptions or otherwise, certain solutions can be offered to overcome these. The guidelines were found to be applicable and provide decent instructions for a proper bed protection design in spite of the requirement of some assumptions. The effectiveness of the guidelines can be improved thanks to further research with bed protection designs for different case study locations and various bed protection methods to verify the conclusions reached in this study. Moreover, supplementary resources like a catalogue containing detailed information about several ship characteristics with relatively higher influences in the design process can help designers to gather more accurate data to be used in the calculations.","PIANC; Thrusters; Propellers; Berthing Structures; Deterministic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering (CoMEM)","",""

This phenomenon has already occurred in the Netherlands since WWII. The Netherlands have known times in which the LTV ratio of mortgages reached a height of 120%, with the result that many residences nowadays have a lower market value than the value of their mortgage. Recently, the Financial Stability committee presented a report as advisory body of the Dutch Government in which they advocate for a step-by-step reduction of the mortgage limit to a maximum of 90%. This should prevent significant residual debts from home-owners in times of a new crisis in the housing market. Due to this measure, starters will have to save for an additional three years on average before they are eligible for a mortgage. In the meantime they should be able to accommodate themselves in the private rental housing sector. The expected development of the private rental housing demand is between 80% - 200% and with the limitations of the maximum mortgage this demand relates to an increase of 90.000 - 190.000 dwellings. Investors have still not substantially invested in the private rental housing sector. What keeps them from investing in this particular housing sector? To which extent does the rent regulation play an inhibitory role? This research is focussing on adjustments within the rent regulation, which leads us to the following research question: How can adjustments within the rent regulation contribute to increase the private rental housing supply for low moderate income households? Research has shown that there are differences in effects from rent regulation on large investors and small/local investors and that there are different effects in regions with a high market pressure or a low market pressure. The Dutch housing market lends itself for attracting more small and local private investors with (temporary) laws and regulations following the examples from England (Buy to Let), France (Tax benefits) and Germany (Subsidies).","Private huursector; Geliberaliseerde huursector; Huurregulering; Inkomensafhankelijk huren","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing","",""

(mentor); Voorendt, M.Z. (mentor)","2015","This document includes a survey whether the wind set-up formula is valid and accurate in case of irregularly shaped lakes with a strong varying water depth. The formula is designed for a pure theoretical situation, the question is whether the formula is valid in situations that differ a lot from the theoretical one. The research is carried out with data (wind speed, wind direction and water depth), from the Grevelingenmeer (Netherlands, province Zeeland). First several assumptions are made with respect to the relevant wind directions and speeds for the different measure stations. Wind set-up won’t be generated when the wind speed is very low. The relevant wind speeds are the mean values per hour above 13 meter per second. The relevancy of the wind directions does depend on the location of the measure station. The mean values of all the data are calculated in order to correct for the setting time of the lake, to arrive at a more or less stationary situation. The fetch is defined as the length of the lake parallel to the wind direction. It is not easy to model the water depth, shallow water does give a higher value for wind set-up in comparison to deep water. However, the water depth of the Grevelingenmeer is strongly varying, so an assumption had to be made. The mean value of the water depth is assumed, in order to balance the varying base of the lake. It is a rough assumption, but possible errors in this approximation are compensated by the friction coefficient kappa. The conclusion of the main research is that the wind set-up formula is valid and relatively accurate. The order of magnitude of the wind set-up is 10 centimeter, the standard deviation is in the order of 1 centimeter. The dispersion of the wind set-up is independent of the wind speed. Using the original wind set-up formula gives the mean value of the wind set-up. In order to compute the design value of the wind set-up, depending on the allowed probability of exceedance, there has to be added an additional value of wind set-up. So, the dispersion is not caused by a scatter of kappa.","wind; set-up; accuracy; lakes","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

With dementia progressing, life outside of the caring home becomes more demanding and peoples’ life sphere gradually shrinks. At a certain point, it shrinks in between walls of the care unit only and continues till the point where it becomes the person himself and his immediate bodily surroundings. In the late stage of dementia, one single room becomes the whole world which tells us how extremely important the direct environment is, as it may contain the whole life of a person at each moment here and now. With so many abilities and certainties slipping away, support from the environment is enormously important as it can be one of the last thing demented people can relate to. How can such a sensitive, unconditioned support be achieved?","dementia; care center; elderly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore lab","",""

Since the link between the theory of architectural design and the notion of laymen participation has not been well analyzed and documented yet, the first part of this paper tries to establish such relationship through the thoughts of Christopher Alexander. Moreover, the first chapter offers possible explanations of the uncertain development that participatory design has experienced in the field of architecture so far. The second part of the report introduces the practical experiment that was developed during the first months of the research and contributed to the research by a substantial practical insight. The subject of this experiment was to design a game as a vehicle for a participatory architectural project, and through a thorough reflection gain more knowledge about this topic. The final game design was developed through a series of less complex preliminary game designs, which are described as the different phases of the experiment. For a relevant reflection on the experiment, that was developed on a more intuitive knowledge base, more literature study on games and game-like participatory projects was needed. These topics are briefly introduced on the beginning of the third chapter, together with a description of two case studies and one example of game-like participatory projects realized in urban planning. This knowledge is used in the subsequent reflection on the proper experiment, which raises mainly practical questions about participatory practice in architecture, detects the problematic aspects of this approach and suggest several topics were more knowledge needs to be produced.","participatory design; game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Burgmeijer, M. (mentor)","2015","Mangroves have been proven to be an asset to coastlines because of their myriad advantages relating to coastal protection and stability. Unfortunately, in the past, due to economic necessities or other reasons, many of these mangrove swamps in tropical areas came under threat and were subsequently destroyed. As the awareness about the positive effects of mangroves’ is becoming widespread, many places would now want to re-plant mangroves along the coast. However, such mangrove rehabilitation projects face major challenges, in terms of design, costs and implementation. The goal of such a project would be to create a conducive environment for highest mangrove growth with the lowest possible costs. But, though a case study along the eastern coast of the Indian city of Mumbai, it has been found that creation of a ‘conducive’ environment will involve various factors, addressing the growth requirement of the mangroves as well as protecting the planted area from perturbation due to the sea. These challenges have been tackled through a multi-alternative approach, with various possible solutions for the layout, structural design and drainage of the environment. The optimal design consisting of bamboo-piled walls and drains for such a project has then be worked out based on the overall benefit against the cost incurred. It is to be borne in mind that there is, at present, little guidance available for the design and planning of such mangrove rehabilitation projects. Therefore, a study encapsulating various aspects of the project design, including engineering analysis and cost computation has been presented as a guideline for any such projects in the future.","mangrove; Mumbai; Thane creek; dredged material; confining structure; drains; dikes; bamboo piles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering (CoMEM)","","19.00, 72.30"

Explore Lab is a Graduation Laboratory of the Faculty of Architecture, TU Delft. In this Lab I had the opportunity to follow my fascination on public spaces by doing research and producing a graduation projet out of it. The theme of the project involved the careful analysis of the urban context of Jersey City, NJ trying to figure out what are the strengths and weaknesses of the site by focusing the attention on public spaces. The main goal of the research was to collect informations and input for the design of the master plan which has been developed as a group work by merging four differents research on four differents aspects that led me to define the borders and special characteristics of my building site. Moreover, the results of the research have been largely useful to understand and best solve the complexity of an hybrid building that integrates at the same time private and public functions together. Despite the fact that the research outcome aimed to work as a guide line for the masterplan development, in its ensamble it also gave me the tools and the basics to approach the building design in the best way possible. The opportunity given by the Graduation Lab to have the freedom to choose and define the graduation theme has required, during this year of research and design, a constant reconsideration and reorganization of the framework which has led the final design to be unique in its kind. The input given by the location’s circumstances with its needs and its challenges have brought me to extend my knowledge about public spaces, the way they are used and the way they should be used. My design goal has been from start to try transalte my research of public spaces in urban scale inside the building scale. Their integration into a building design have been, finally, a sort of crown for the design goal I was aiming at. Since the direction of the thesis was not given from the Graduation Lab Studio, the method chosen for the thesis research was directly established by me. Firstly, since New Jersey region was chosen, a method to understand how to analyse and design city’s public spaces as people gatherer was researched; by looking at works done by Gehl, and examples in the metropolitan area of New York, Newark and New Jersey done by Mumford, Jacobs, Johnson, Whyte, Smith ecc I had the opportunuty to collect nformations that led me to understand what were the problematics of the area and what were the possible solutions. In a second phase the privately owned public spaces issue came back, as a top layer, introducing a second methodology to analyse the city from a POPS point of view. The deriving methodology used in the research process was fundamental for my thesis design. The elaboration of a method for a new analysis of the city aiming at tackling all kinds of the public spaces issue gave me the opportunity to gain a fixed, generalizable procedure, which finds its conclusions in giving very precise guidelines for the design phase.","Resilient Density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Architecture","","ExploreLab","",""

Reliability of these machines is an increasing demand, for industry relies heavily on the use of these machines. Maintenance is the best option to ensure reliability over the lifetime of these assets. Nowadays the popularity of condition based maintenance is rising, for this strategy can reduce costs and still guarantees reliability. The current state of the equipment is important information for condition based maintenance to be successful. However no methods that give information on the current condition of low voltage electrical machines exists. ABB developed a lifetime expectancy method that provides information on the machines current condition, as well as a remaining expected lifetime. Sadly this method is limited to machines with a nominal voltage of 3,3kV and above. In this study the possibility of a lifetime expectancy model for LV- and MV-machines (up to 3,3kV) is investigated. This thesis contains an extensive literature study on the stresses, failures, causes of failures and offline measurements that can be performed on electrical machines. A number of measurements have been picked for use in a practical setup. With this setup, trends in measured values have been found during an accelerated (thermal) aging process. These trends indicate that it might be possible to develop a lifetime expectancy model. The trends are presented and a generalized version of expected trend values is presented. However much more research is necessary to validate the generalized formulas, investigate influences of other stress factors and to make a complete model that provides information on the condition and remaining lifetime of electrical machines.","low voltage electrical machines; insulation siagnosis; lifetime expectancy; accelerated thermal aging; condition monitoring; ABB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Machines & High Voltage","",""

This company is situated at yes-delft and is in the development of designing an upper body exoskeleton to aid workers that are involvedin repetitive work done by construction workers or factory workers. The objective of the company Skel-ex is to set up a pilot at interested companies, that are able to invest in Skel-ex. So the objective within this master thesis is a working and visual prototype. For this thesis the target group was set to construction workers that do repetitive work. A smaller research field would lead to a more in debt analyses. According to several studies 14% of the construction workers have physical pain in the shoulders and back due to repetitive work and by harsh working environments. Conducting a field research at a construction side of Laudy revealed that masons have the most physical demanding job on a construction side due to repetitive actions and small workspace that restrict working in ergonomic positions. These conclusions could be backed up by literature research that conducted a questionnaire amongst construction workers. The research that was conducted on context, anatomy, ergonomics and technical gave insights of the requirements and the complexity that would be phased when designing a non-motored upper body exoskeleton. The exoskeleton has to be flush to the body as possible, Because of the tight workingspaces of masons. To mimic the human shoulder joint a minimum of 3 degrees of freedom is necessary. These 3 degrees of freedom are the movement within the glenohumeral joint. The scapulathoracic has 4 degrees of freedom but only have minor movements within these directions. The fitting of the product will be specified on p50 this because it is not possible to design a prototype for every individual. There are no real competitors that have a product on the construction market. There are several competitors that are in the development phase of a wearable exoskeleton but these aren’t specific for the construction market. In the end a successful prototype is created that helps the user in the upward motion of the arms. The exoskeleton has 5 degrees of freedom. The shoulder joint made out of a thick steel wire with a silicone coating has 3 degrees of freedom, The linear arm slider has one degree of freedom and thehinge of the armrest also has 1 degree of freedom. This will give the user almost no restrictions when moving. Two silicone springs on the back are being loaded whit the gravity that is working on the arms. This force up to 20N is being stored within these silicone springs and is being released with flexion and abduction of the arms. The transition of the silicone springs to the arm is with a steel wire that goes around a pulley and trough a outer Bowden cable. The rigid backpart gives extra support to the back of the user, but allows the user to move freely. The forces that act on the exoskeleton are being redirected to the waist of the user like a backpack. The first prototype is designed for male p50. When designing for the majority p05- p95 male 20-60, three sizes are needed so the space between the shoulder of the user and the shoulder joint will be between the 30mm and 50mm. This will insure a good fit. More testing needs to be done and several improvements need to be made. But for a first prototype and proof of concept this end result can help to start pilots and get companies interested.","exoskeleton; non-motored; construction workers; Skel-ex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Prooijen, B.C. (mentor)","2015","Deltas are of great importance to humans all over the world. They are densely populated coastal areas, where land arises from sea. An amazing gradient where two worlds meet and nature and humans proliferate traditionally. Yet this gradient increasingly disappears due to the great technical advances since the 19th century, which tried to control the marine dynamics of deltas to ensure safety of the hinterland against inundation. The Deltaworks in the Netherlands embody this. The masterpiece of the Deltaworks meant the construction of a national icon: the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, which does not only withstand storm surges, but even daily controls the tides of the sea in the Eastern Scheldt. However, this permeable dam has resulted in the erosion of the intertidal area and subsequently in an insatiable demand of sand, which increases annually due to sea-level rise. The intertidal area will have disappeared in about 2080 as a consequence of this sand hunger, with major social - and ecological problems as a result. Besides sand hunger, Zeeland also suffers from space hunger. The rise of mass recreation in the past century has led to the cluttering of holiday parks in the hinterland of the delta, which destroy the lowlands and the delta in their vastness. Therefore, a holistic solution for the Zeeland delta does not only secure the intertidal area, but also encompasses the finding of a suitable place for recreation in its delta. This is achieved by means of the deconstruction of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier and Grevelingendam, and using the resulting new marine dynamics to promote the social - and ecological situation of the Eastern Scheldt. The new multifunctional coastal defense systems protect the hinterland from inundation permanently and is in itself a new landscape entity of Zeeland in which the function of recreation becomes integrated into the landscape. This way Zeeland is strengthened integrally between sea and land and the Eastern Scheldt is transformed from a nature - to a human reserve, where all interactions live together as an obviousness.","Landscape Architecture; Eastern Scheldt; Oosterschelde; Seascape; Sand Hunger; Space Hunger; Multifunctional Coastal Defense Systems; Building with Nature; Ecosystem Services; Living Systems; Landscape Machine; Storm Surge Barrier; Climate Change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-23","Architecture and The Built Environment","Landscape Architecture","","Flowscapes","","51.561865, 3.951302"

(mentor); Glazer-Grzech, A. (mentor); Hu, B. (mentor)","2015","The European Commission proposed to increase recycling of packaging to 80% by 2030. This undermines the goal of a resource efficient Europe, because this may lead to the substitution of flexible packaging with the relatively easy to recycle rigid packaging. Developing a feasible method to separate materials in flexible packaging can contribute to the substitution of rigid packaging with flexible packaging, and can result in saving millions of tonnes of packaging material from being used and disposed, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and transport costs. The goal of this project was to test a sink-float method for the separation of materials from a type of flexible packaging that consists of 77% LDPE, 12% aluminium and 11% PET. A bench-scale set-up was constructed and multiple experiments were performed. A product of 98.6% pure LDPE was produced from the float fraction of the set-up and has value and a destination in injection moulding. The aluminium product had a grade ranging from 58% to 82% depending on the recovery. This could possibly be upgraded to 90% by a simple sieving step in the process. The aluminium product needs to be processed further before it can go to its next destination. It needs to be briquetted to be useful for a smelter. An economic analysis was performed including an estimation of investment costs, earnings and Net Present Values of different scenarios. All were considered feasible. Even if an aluminium product of around 50% purity is made, the process would still be feasible due to the LDPE product. However, much value is given away like this, and adding a step to the process to concentrate the aluminium further could be well worth the effort.","recycling","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Materials and Environment","",""

(mentor)","2015","The application of morphing structures in conventional aircraft is a method to improve aircraft performance by both reducing the total fuel consumption for a given mission profile, or by allowing one type of aircraft to perform a wider range of missions. The current generation of aircraft does not widely use morphing technology to optimize flight performance, instead specialized types are developed specifically for one target mission. This report shows the process of integrating a span, twist and camber morphing system into an unmanned testbed as part of the CHANGE project. First several configuration concepts are proposed and evaluated which allow the twist/camber system to be developed independently from the span extension system. This results in a wing design where the leading and trailing edges contain the morphing mechanism, while the central wing box provides space for the span extension mechanism. The application of morphing surfaces is also limited to the inboard wing sections, as the internal volume of the tips is dedicated entirely to housing the extending wing sections. Several options for the morphing mechanisms are discussed and traded off, though eventually a novel system is developed based on open section torsion for twist control and sheet bending for camber control. The magnitude of the deformation required to meet pre-determined target shapes is calculated via numerical simulation, as are the forces which are imparted on the structure and the actuators by elastic loads. Aerodynamic loads are also calculated. Finally, a detail design is proposed for both the leading and trailing edge mechanisms which satisfies the required camber and twist ranges while taking into consideration the maintainability of the structure and availability of parts. The design consists of a GFRP skin of which the top surface acts as a compliant hinge. The lower surface of the skin is supported and constrained by an internal mechanism, while actuation is provided by electric servos. The symmetry of the final design allows for left to right interchangeability of the entire control surface.","morphing; morhping; uav; unmanned; aircraft; twist; camber; flap; aileron; adaptive; high lift device; variable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Propulsion and Performance","","Design Integration and Operations of Aircraft and Rotorcraft","",""

(mentor)","2015","The transformation of conflict-affected countries into peaceful, stable, and more prosperous ones is an immensely complex task, often susceptible to contradictory pressures and to the risk of relapsing into violence (UNDP and World Bank 2007). Most common approaches link social and economic development with conflict and peace, slowly; the environment has become central to understanding of both war and peacebuilding. Characterized by multiple transition processes including the transition from conflict to peace, democratization, decentralization and market liberalization, post-conflict situations, often perceive environmental governance and the sustainable management of natural resources as being distinct from – and sometimes even in conflict with – peacebuilding and development. However, natural resources and the environment hold tremendous peacebuilding potential and are able to underpin many peacebuilding priorities (Conca and Wallace 2012; Jensen and Lonergan 2012). As a mechanism for peace, the environment has some useful, perhaps even unique qualities that are well suited for peacebuilding and conflict resolution. Environmental problems ignore political borders. They require a long-term perspective, encourage participation by local and non-governmental organisations, help build administrative, economic and social capacities for action and facilitate the creation of commonalities that transcend the polarisation caused by economic relations. The present document is the report of the author’s graduation project. Its main goal is to identify the conditions under which environmental governance can facilitate, conflict transformation and peacebuilding in the region of Barranquilla, Colombia. The study is primarily an attempt to systematize the role of spatial planning in environmental governance with regard to conflict prevention and peacebuilding, to define its scope more clearly through an environmental assessment and an integral recovery plan.","Barranquilla; Colombia; Environmental Governance; Post-conflict planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-01-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Metropolitan Spatial Structure","","10.5742, 74.4654"

(mentor)","2015","The rivers in the South-West of The Netherlands flow over an erosion-resistant bed, consisting of peat and clay, overlying non-cohesive sediments. As they are experiencing general incision, the erosion resistant layer becomes thinner and sometimes locally breaks, exposing the more easily eroded non-cohesive sediments. Consequently sudden scour holes may be formed that can pose risks to the stability of nearby flood defences. Mobile bed laboratory experiments were carried out to study the corresponding scour process, using a local opening in steel plates to represent a broken erosion-resistant top layer. I found that once the scour hole extends to the edge of the top layer, this layer is undermined. As a result, the sediment is only transported in suspension and although the turbulence within the scour hole is increasing, the rate of scour decreases. With the stiff steel plates at a fixed location the scour hole approaches an equilibrium depth. However, undermining in the field, will eventually lead to failure of the top layer and consequent growth of the horizontal extent of the scour hole. But not all scour holes in the field are growing, indicating other processes. This raised the assumption that the poorly erodible layer can also fail by deformation and covers the slopes of the scour hole; thus functions as a falling apron. Numerical computations with FINEL3D showed the shear stresses at bed of the scour hole. High shear stresses were observed at the edges and inner slopes of the scour hole. These shear stresses exceeded the critical shear stress of sand, which indicated that the slope are protected by the poorly erodible layer. Field research has to be carried out to validate the models and the proposition of the behaviour of the poorly erodible top layer.","Scour; Laboratoy experiments; Poorly erodible layer; Undermining; Suspended transport; Shear stress; Turbulence models; FINEL3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

However, the modelling of three-phase converters from fundamental port-Hamiltonian principles has been an unexplored direction. This study focusses on deducing a modelling procedure to model a three-phase rectifier and a three-phase inverter from a fundamental port-Hamiltonian perspective. Such a perspective involves the derivation of a model from a mathematical expression of the Dirac structure. Two procedures are formulated, where either the switches are viewed as virtual elements or as nonlinear elements. The study concludes that both techniques are equally suitable for the modelling of the rectifier and the inverter. Furthermore, incorporating non-ideal switches is easier when regarding them as nonlinear elements, but obtaining a parametrised form (parametrised by the switch state) is more straightforward when regarding them as virtual elements. Both methods require us to identify the currents and voltages in the network as efforts and flows based on the network topology. However, this turns out to be ambiguous for the conjugate variables of the interconnection ports and switches. To cope with this, two conventions are proposed.","Power converter; port-Hamiltonian; inverter; rectifier; graph; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

This spatial open data can be confusing for non-GIS experts, since data is published as either typical geo-formats or metadata is missing. Linked data could benefit in that regard. Linked data is a method to publish data on the Web in a way that it can be easily combined with other datasets on the Web. Linked data has benefits for spatial data regarding the combining of datasets to solve cross knowledge domain issues, the linking of metadata with the spatial data and the possibility to ask spatial queries. The research focused on how to apply the linked data method for spatial open data in order to profit from the benefits of linked data. The research provided a methodology to create spatial linked open data. In the case study for the Municipality of Rotterdam, four spatial open datasets concerning the composition of areas and neighborhoods in Rotterdam Zuid were converted to spatial linked open data and visualized on a Web map to exemplify the possibilities and limitations for spatial linked open data. The case study showed that there are multiple users who benefit from spatial linked open data. The results also showed that modeling spatial data according to the OGC standard for spatial linked data, the GeoSPARQL ontology, provides the possibility to ask spatial queries over the data to do a simple analysis or inventory over multiple heterogeneous and distributed datasets, by dynamically and implicitly linking datasets together on their location. As of now, not all tools for creating linked data support spatial data yet, therefore it can be time consuming to convert the data to spatial linked data.

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (mentor); Nourian, P. (mentor)","2015","In recent years, the concept of 3D city models has been gaining in importance as more 3D geometry of urban areas is becoming available. Although 3D City models offer a structured way of storing geometry, in practice a significant amount of geometry is not considered valid. This hinders the further analyzing or processing of these models. Since manual repair of 3D City models is very time consuming and prone to errors, automatic repair methods are highly desirable. However, none of the existing repair methods are able to entirely repair all defects in 3D City Models. This thesis focuses on the process of transforming a defect 3D city model into a valid one by using a voxel-based repair method. The first step of this process is the scan conversion of a (defect) 3D building model into a volumetric representation. By applying a set of morphological operators, a single volume without holes can be acquired. The second step is to reconstruct a triangle mesh for a given volumetric representation. Two workflows are proposed to perform this step. The first workflow is based on the Marching Cubes algorithm, which generates a triangle mesh for a grid with binary or scalar values. The second workflow has been developed on the base of the Dual Contouring algorithm, which uses intersection points and surface normal vectors of the input model to generate a triangle or quad mesh. Finally a detriangulation is performed in the post processing, which writes the repaired model back to a polygonal 3D City model. In order to preserve any attributes of 3D City Models throughout the repair process, three alternatives are proposed; geometry based assumption, voxel based preservation or grid edge based preservation. Each of these possibilities may be suitable, depending on the selected workflow and desired application. Both workflows were tested on existing 3D City models. Validation of the first workflow shows that using the Marching Cubes algorithm is suitable for a reliable repair method. Applying it on a dataset with 90% of defect buildings, resulted in a dataset where only 4% of the building models remained defect. It must be noted however, that during this process sharp features are rounded off and jagged surfaces may appear. The validation of the second workflow, which aims to preserve sharp features by using the Dual Contouring algorithm, often resulted in self-intersections and thus defect output models. It was concluded that more research, including an implementation of an extension on the Dual Contouring algorithm are needed in order to determine the suitability of the second workflow for the repair of 3D City Building Models.","3D GIS; 3D city models; repair","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2015","A thorough redesign of the aircraft industry is needed to cope with diminishing fossil fuel reserves, including operation, aircraft design and propulsion systems. The European Commission sponsors the RECREATE research project to investigate the cruiser-feeder set-up, in which cruise-optimised aircraft stay aloft for extended periods while feeder aircraft transport payload and/or fuel between the ground and the cruiser. This study focusses on the design of a cruiser aircraft that uses nuclear power to transport up to 1000 passengers so that its endurance is only limited by maintenance intervals. Even though the Cold War produced some design options for nuclear aircraft, new research is needed to assess this concept’s feasibility in the near future aircraft industry. RECREATE has provided a preliminary layout for the cruiser aircraft, however weight estimation of the propulsion system that converts reactor power into propulsion proves to be a major hurdle in assessing the feasibility of the cruiser design. Within the 1 million kg weight budget that has been set, 100,000 kg is reserved for each heat cycle. Therefore, this study sets out to design a weight optimised heat cycle. The primary cycle reactor coolant is selected to be LBE because of its inherent radiation shielding and heat transfer properties. Outside of the shielding vessel, three options are investigated for the secondary cycle: an open cycle using FLiBe as a working ?uid, and a regenerative and recompression lay-out of closed cycle using s-CO2. Because LBE limits the output temperature, only the closed cycles prove feasible in this study. An optimisation process consisting of an initial grid search and a final optimisation is used to minimise the weight of heat exchangers and piping of the system, whilst leaving turbomachinery and driveshafts to be optimised in other studies. The regenerative cycle comes out as the lightest thanks to its reduced number of components and lower mass ?ow. After the optimisation the minimum weight cycle has an overall thermodynamic ef?ciency of 45.4% using a maximum pressure of 60.5 MPa, with the designed components weighing 65,600 kg. This leaves a budget of 34,400 kg for the systems that were excluded. This is considered more than suf?cient to state that the heat cycle weight remains within the required 100,000 kg. The nuclear cruiser requires comprehensive additional research and validation, such as a detailed design of the reactor and safety features. The results of this thesis also have to be corroborated by further calculations, simulations, and experiments. Nevertheless, this research has provided an important initial assessment of nuclear-powered propulsion for civil aviation.","nuclear aircraft; RECREATE; heat cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","FPP","","","",""

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor)","2015","In recent years, the sporting world has become an industry of millions, sometimes even billions (Deloitte, 2012). The commercialising within the world of sports has had several effects. One of these effects is that private investors are starting to see the possibilities of investing in sports real estate, stadiums. In addition, there is a declining willingness of local, national and European governments in facilitating financing for stadiums and other flagship projects (PWC, 2011). The consequence of this shift in facilitating and thus ownership of sports stadiums is the fact that the focus will change from a more social perspective (government), to a perspective that is purely focussed on financial value (private investors). These investors see much more potential in stadiums than the single-day use that is most common. Investors acknowledge that the potential of modern stadiums could be much broader. Think of other sporting events, concerts, promotional events, business meetings, etc. These make that sport stadiums nowadays have a much more multifunctional purpose than they had previously. Multifunctionality is a major aspect that could increase profitability and should therefore be researched even more (Jakimovska, 2007). This research will focus on enhancing profitability of sports stadiums through the design of the stadium. The research question that is formulated for this problem is: “How can a decision support model contribute in enlarging the return on investment, based on the lay-out of flexible and multifunctional sports stadium projects, in order to increase feasibility?” The research results in a model of an inductive nature, which means it can also be used for other stadium developments and/or renovations. The model covers all the different areas that have an influence on the potential return on investment over a predefined period of time. This ranges from ticketing, functions but also construction costs. The research therefore covers a number of different areas of expertise. Besides the field of design and decision support systems, the research also covers building economics, and weighs the costs of a newly built stadium against the costs for renovation an existing one. The created tool can greatly contribute to the decision making process in the early stages of decision making, but can also serve as a useful tool in retrospect. The case that has been chosen for the research is De Kuip, the stadium of football club Feyenoord in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Because of its proximity here in The Netherlands, it is a project with more familiarity and it can be visited for a deeper insight into the project. The stadium of Feyenoord has been a subject of discussion for the past few years, with the owners being unsure if to build a new stadium or to renovate the existing one. The final decision of this issue came in the beginning of 2014, with an advisory commission insisting the renovation of the stadium. Project developer BAM had been awarded the development rights after a competition with another project developer, but failed to come up with a feasible design for the renovation of the existing stadium. The research uses the information of this failed project to investigate if a more feasible design solution had been possible. Two other cases, the Amsterdam ArenA in Amsterdam and the GelreDome in Arnhem are analysed as well to enhance information on the project and to serve as comparison. The results of the research are according to the initial hypothesis. The two stadiums that were analysed for comparison show a profitability that is in line with the minimal expected Internal Rate of Return that is required for stadium projects. The main case of the Kuip however, shows a feasible project, but a project that is not feasible enough for investors to take part in. The next chapters in the research go into detail on how the design of the stadium can be adjusted to make the project feasible again, and the initial bid of project developer BAM is recreated and analysed as well. Overall conclusions initially show that no such approach is ever used in stadium projects. Implementations of this method might not be as smooth initially since the approach adds a great deal of transparency to the negotiation process, which is something that is not always beneficial for all involved stakeholders. Further research and further development of the resulting model has to be carried out to give a more accurate representation of reality, making the model even more useful in the negotiation process.","Feasibility; Stadium; Investor; Operations Research; Multifunctionality; Profitability; Decision support system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Aligning Real Estate Demand and Supply","","51.89384, 4.52317"

Traditionally large energy utilities developed offshore wind projects with merely their own resources in combination with corporate finance. However due to a significant growth of the size of projects and due to changing market conditions external financing sources are increasingly needed to meet the development demand. According to recent literature, institutional investors are able to play an increasing role in the financing and refinancing process of offshore wind parks. This research will focus on the Netherlands. This research will map the variables that influence the decision making of Dutch institutional investors and it shows how their role in Dutch offshore wind projects can be increased. By doing so a literature review study in combination with interview data was used. The result is a theoretical model that shows the interconnectedness of the factors that influence the investment decisions. Currently a knowledge barrier hinders institutional investors to invest in offshore wind projects, this should be mitigated by intensive knowledge sharing.

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (mentor); Meijers, M. (mentor)","2015","Solutions have been introduced to handle massive point clouds in Database Management Systems (DBMS), namely by Oracle in 2011 and postgreSQL in 2013. Many common operations on these massive point clouds require knowledge about the original surface in order to analyse them. A possible method to recreate a representation of the original surface is reducing a point cloud to a 2.5D structure such as a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN). This thesis explores the possibilities to store such massive TINs in a DBMS and presents criteria to define an efficient approach. The term ‘efficient’ is defined by the size of the data structure and the performance of spatial queries. Criteria for an efficient approach are developed by reviewing existing literature and comparisons of existing implementations. These criteria include: (1) the explicit storage of nodes of TIN, preventing duplicate information and resulting in small data structures. (2) the use of atomic functions such as slope, aspect and degree in order to enable analysis of the TIN inside the database. (3) the storage of topological relationships of the TIN, which is used for both atomic functions and spatial access to the TIN. (4) the use of buckets to split the TIN into non-massive sections that can be processed one at a time. A very large spatial index on each element of a TIN is therefore not needed. An index is only applied on the extents of the bucket. The TIN inside the bucket can be traversed using the topological relationships stored. The main problem encountered is to combine solutions for massive datasets with a TIN data structure, such as the use of buckets with a topological data structure. These problems are overcome by a novel data structure to store TINs in a DBMS called the Multistar. This data structure implements the aforementioned criteria for an efficient approach. The Multistar is compared in practice with the two existing database structures: the SDO_TIN by Oracle and the Simple Feature TIN type implemented in the PostGIS extension of PostgreSQL. This thesis shows that current implementations are not usable for both storing and accessing a massive TIN of 370M points. The Multistar is one of the smallest structures available and outperforms the other data structures significantly on massive TINs.","massive; TIN; database; pointcloud; postgresql; star; multistar; topology; DBMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Heimovaara, T.J. (mentor); Hajibeygi, H. (mentor)","2015","“Dispersion” has two meanings in reservoir engineering: (1) the variety of arrival times at a production well for an injected tracer, which is mostly a function of heterogeneity of permeability in the reservoir, and (2) mixing of injected fluids in situ. It is very difficult to distinguish these two processes in situ, while the success of different processes depends on different aspects of dispersion. For instance: a geothermal producer depends on the arrival time of cold water, while low-salinity water and miscible-flood displacements are harmed by in situ mixing. Moreover, simulation studies need to contend with numerical dispersion, a purely artificial effect of numerical simulation. In this thesis we develop a first-order-accurate two-dimensional streamline-based simulator to model in-situ mixing of tracer particles. A coordinate transformation is performed from an (x,y) to an (x,?) domain, such that all streamlines are parallel, before applying the convection-diffusion equation. When using streamline methods, numerical dispersion mostly occurs in the longitudinal direction which effects particle distributions in the same way as longitudinal diffusion. Taylor (1953) described how the effect of transverse diffusion effects the distribution of particles more than longitudinal diffusion. The streamline model is used to simulate Taylor dispersion in a tube in order to study the effect of longitudinal numerical dispersion on the accuracy of the model. As predicted by (Taylor 1953), numerical dispersion is found to diminish in importance as higher transverse diffusion coefficients are introduced, increasing the accuracy of the model. This effect is further studied by comparing the first-order accurate model with a higher-order accurate model and analytical solutions. After establishing that the model works, it is compared to a particle-tracking simulator which is considered to be state-of-the-art. Particle-tracking simulators are free of numerical dispersion but cannot accurately model in-situ concentrations unless exceedingly large numbers of particles are included. Rather, they infer mixing has taken place from the variance of particles positions obtained from flow-reversal tests and assume part of this mixing has taken place in forward flow. The streamline-based model developed in this thesis shows similar results to the model developed by Berentsen et al. (2007) in the Taylor limit, but slightly different results in the convective limit and intermediate scenarios. The potential of the streamline-based simulator is shown by applying the model to a realistic, although only two-dimensional, scenario of a heterogeneous reservoir. Especially in the convective limit does the streamline based model show more accurate results than a conventional simulator. Finally, we apply the model to a situation which includes adsorption of particles by the solid phase. The adsorption and flow depend on local concentrations; a situation a particle-tracking model cannot easily model.","Taylor dispersion; mixing; streamline modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

Though a promising concept, the performance prediction of a wind-assisted vessel is a complex task involving many physical interactions. As part of a larger research plan on WASP at the Delft University of Technology, this thesis focusses on the hydrodynamic forces on bare hull models at drift angles resulting from the wind-assisted operating conditions. The aim of this study is firstly to show the adequacy of RANS CFD as a numerical tool to estimate the hydrodynamic forces (resistance, side force and yaw moment) for vessels sailing at a drift angle. Secondly, the aim is to deliver a database of hydrodynamic forces for a series of hull forms. This database will ultimately aid in modelling a wind-assisted vessel in a Performance Prediction Programme (PPP). A systematic series of bare hull forms based on one parent hull is constructed by varying draught T, prismatic coefficient Cp and midship section area coefficient Cm. The numerical tool is used to obtain the hydrodynamic forces of all models while three selected models are tested in a towing tank for validation. On the simulation results, regression analysis is performed to arrive at formulations expressing the dependency of these forces on the bare hull form parameters. The validation study shows that the numerical tool captures most hydrodynamic forces sufficiently accurate for use in a PPP tool. With side force most poorly resolved, there is room for improvement however. Using a different turbulence model could provide improvement in this area, albeit at the cost of increased computational time. The formulations obtained by regression show satisfactory robustness for vessels having hydrostatic parameters both within and outside the range of the Delft Systematic Wind-Assisted Series (DSWAS). Unfortunately, the lack of precision of the side force formulation can lead to erroneous results when applied in a PPP.","wind; assisted; ship; propulsion; towing tank; cfd; numerical; experimental; regression; validation; verification; hydromechanics; hydrodynamics; systematic series; drift; sailing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

The control principles were tested and showed that the proposed control framework was effective. However, the parametrization of the control framework was not straightforward. It seemed to have a strong dependency on the amplitude and frequency of the reference signal, also due to the still non-linear response.

(mentor)","2015","In the coming decades, the offshore decommissioning industry is becoming a quickly growing market, especially at the North Sea, where most offshore platforms have operated for more than twenty years. There is little room for the mistake in the offshore decommissioning operation, therefore the motion response analysis is essential to avoid the risks. It is common practice to use frequency domain analysis to simulate the dynamic behavior of floating structures in waves for linear system. However, offshore operations generally involve various nonlinearities such as nonlinear mooring system, wave-induced impacts during lift-off operation, and viscous forces. The frequency domain analysis is not capable of dealing with these nonlinearities, so the time domain analysis is pursued in this study. The Cummins equation provides an attractive way of analyzing the dynamics response of offshore structures in time domain, in which a convolution term is introduced to describe the uid memory effect. Neither the frequency domain analysis, nor the time domain convolution integral is convenient for time domain simulation. To facilitate the efficiency of time domain simulation, a state space model is introduced to replace the convolution term leading to a constant parameter time domain model. At the same time, the physical properties of the convolution term can be enforced into the state space model using convex optimization. The proposed time domain approach has been validated by comparing with the frequency domain analysis results for a linear system in the regular and irregular wave conditions. The topside removal concept proposed by Mammoet consists of a twin barges, in order to eliminate the problem caused by the moment-induced by the topside, as well as wave-induced motion, two linkages are incorporated into this concept. The time domain analysis proves that the purpose of these linkages are achieved that the relative sway and roll are successfully restricted. Finally, different load transfer stages are studied to obtain the dynamic response and its interaction forces between the topside and barges.","Multibody; System Identification; Time Domain Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

However, in order to provide numerical aeroacoustic predictions for realistic applications a hybrid approach is still often the only option. OpenFOAM is a popular open-source CFD package in the academic world and its usage is increasing in industry as alternative for expensive commercial software. Currently there is no acoustic module in OpenFOAM. Following a hybrid methodology, the user would therefore need to transfer saved ow data to another software package to perform the acoustic calculation. This requires high data storage and makes the method (unnecessarily) complicated and cumbersome. In this thesis an aeroacoustic method based on the linearized Euler equations (LEE) has been implemented in OpenFOAM. Instead of using the standard available OpenFOAM schemes, a different numerical method was implemented. This involves solving a Riemann problem to determine the convective terms. The code was veriffed on a series of benchmark problems for which analytical or reference solutions are available. The considered problems were one-dimensional wave propagation, the propagation of an acoustic pulse in uniform ow, the radiation by elementary acoustic sources and source radiation in two types of non-uniform ow. In all cases the found numerical solution was very close to the reference solution. The Riemann based solver was compared for these problems with a LEE solver that uses the readily available discretization schemes of OpenFOAM. Both implementations were shown to be able to correctly account for convection and refraction effects. The Riemann based solver has as advantage that it propagates waves in a less dispersive manner than the standard solver, but has as disadvantage that it is more di_usive. As validation case the sound production by a pair of co-rotating vortices was chosen. In addition to reference data, a direct simulation was carried out to also serve as reference solution. The hybrid method was tested with the LEE and with Lighthill's analogy. If the average acoustic source is not included as source term in the LEE, the LEE and Lighthill solutions were found to be very similar. Compared to the direct simulation, both hybrid methods showed a clear phase difference, which for this case can be attributed to the start-up phase of the hybrid simulation. Finally, it was demonstrated that the ow calculation can be done on small domain, followed by a mapping of the obtained acoustic source onto the larger acoustic grid, after which the acoustic equations are solved for that ow time step. This leads to considerable savings in computational power and disk space usage.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Due to their unique properties, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and therapeutic enzymes represent the most used macromolecules for biopharmaceutical development. However, currently the purification of mAbs and enzymes is a target of process optimisation, since it constitutes the bottleneck of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Recently, a model-based hybrid process development was proposed for rationally synthesising and designing a protein purification process. In this approach, a combination of high throughput experimentation for physicochemical protein characterisation and thermodynamic parameter regression can be used for an in silico optimisation of a proposed downstream process design. The main goal of this project is first to determine the physicochemical parameters of crude protein mixtures by applying three-dimensional liquid chromatography in two modes of operation, isocratic and gradient elusion. Secondly, to determine the isotherms for thermodynamic parameter regression and finally to systematically compare the determined thermodynamic parameters from the two modes of operation. The experimental scheme consisted of gradient chromatofocusing (gCF) on strong ion exchange column, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) in gradient and isocratic mode and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or Matrix assessed laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Moreover, Fourier transform and exponentially modified Gaussian peak fitting was used for the deconvolution of the resulted chromatograms. Finally, an analytical solution for the linear part of the HIC isotherm was proposed for parameter regression and correlation of isocratic and gradient parameters. The results revealed that the experimental methodology as well as the data analysis method proposed, are suitable for the physicochemical characterisation of the crude protein component mixtures as well for the determination and correlation of isocratic and gradient parameters. The determined physicochemical and thermodynamic parameters can be used to predict the protein behaviour and interactions with the chromatographic columns, while in combination with the determined isotherm parameters can be used for an in silico optimisation of a DSP design.","Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography; Isotherm; Gradient Elusion; Isocratic Elusion; High-throughput Profiling; Fourier Transform; Enzyme; Monoclonal Antibody","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Bioprocess Engineering Group","",""

(mentor)","2015","In the field of neurorehabilitation, robots are being used to provide assisting forces for therapeutic purposes, and with system identification & parameter estimation (SIPE) methods they are used to quantify neuromechanical parameters for diagnostic purposes. To better understand the beneficial effect of robotic assistance on the neuromechanical system during therapy, a tool is required that combines SIPE methods with robot assisted training tasks. This experimental study proposes a novel protocol that demonstrates the potential combination of quantifying neuromechanical parameters, using a quasi time-variant SIPE method, with a robot assisted visuomotor tracking task. A haptic wrist robot was used that simultaneously exerts assistive forces by means of a virtual spring, and force perturbations required for SIPE of the wrist joint. The tracking task was visually fed back through a gaming environment. The effect of robotic assistance on human effort and task performance was investigated and further clarified by the underlying neuromechanical behavior. Six healthy controls and one chronic stroke patient participated to test the protocol. The quasi time-variant SIPE method returned sufficient estimations with an average VAF of 86%. The robotic assistance resulted in an average increase of task performance but an average decrease of human effort. Findings of the neuromechanical parameters suggests that the neuromechanical system tended to behave more compliantly with robotic assistance. While the tracking task was presented as a position task, findings further suggest that higher magnitudes of robotic assistance might have elicited neuromechanical behavior more similar to force tasks. The findings are in line with the paradigm of shared haptic control which says that humans adapt their neuromechanical impedance to promote task performance when exchanging forces on the control interface of the human-robot system. It is concluded that the proposed protocol simultaneously yields methods for combined motor training and quantitative assessment of the wrist joint. Moreover, the novel quasi time-variant SIPE approach showed to be a promising tool to quantitatively assess stroke patients during intensive and frequent motor training tasks.","robot assistance; SIPE; neuromechanical parameters; motor training task; stroke","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor)","2015","When designing a rubble mound breakwater, one would like to predict the stability of the armour layer of the breakwater. For this purpose several armour layer stability formula are developed. The most reliable is considered to be the stability formula of Van der Meer (1988). With this method, the armour layer stability is predicted based on several parameters. One of these parameters is the so-called notional permeability, P. The definition of the word notional is important to keep in mind; existing as or based on a suggestion, estimate, or theory; not existing in reality. Or, in other words, the notional permeability is not a physical description of the real permeability of a breakwater. Furthermore, there are no methods to calculate the notional permeability. This makes it difficult to estimate a safe and reliable P-value for an arbitrary structure. The definition of the notional permeability suggests that a single P-value can be attributed to a structure. However, previous research has suggested that the notional permeability is not only dependent on structural parameters, but also on hydraulic parameters. This makes the assumption of a single P-value for a particular structure under arbitrary hydraulic conditions invalid. The P-value should therefore vary under varying hydraulic conditions. This thesis aims for a better understanding of the physical processes the notional permeability. Some of the original physical model tests of Van der Meer (1988) are selected for analysis to achieve this goal. As a tool the numerical model IH2VOF is used. This 2D vertical model is able to simulate flow interaction with porous media. And makes it possible to measure pressures and flow velocities at any point within a breakwater. In this way physical processes can be described as functions of pressures and flow velocities. The model is able to simulate porous flows by Volume Averaging the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations. This Volume Averaging introduces a porosity into the equations. Furthermore, the extended Forchheimer equation is needed to close the equations. This additionally introduces the laminar and turbulent Forchheimer coefficients and added mass coefficients to the equations. These four variables describe the porous media and are required as input to the model. Based on a literature study a hypothesis is made about the variables on which the notional permeability is dependent. The Buckingham PI theorem is applied to these variables, resulting in four dimensionless PI terms. Eventually it is concluded that the PI terms are best measured 0.5 times the significant wave height below the initial water level, inside the armour layer and in a normal direction to the front slope of the structure. With this approach, all four PI terms show a positive correlation with P.","Volume-of-Fluid (VOF); breakwaters; notional permeability; porous media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This distribution affects the stability of river bifurcations as well as the distribution of flooding risk, navigability and environmental conditions. The governing factors are the hydrodynamics of the two branches downstream as well as the spatial distribution of sediment transport in the area of the bifurcation. Fluvial islands at the bifurcation may affect both. This thesis focusses on the effect of size, position and shape of fluvial islands in the Río Magdalena on discharge and sediment distribution into the Canal del Dique, Colombia. Where the high amount of fine sediments in the Río Magdalena has negative environmental impact on the coastal area downstream of the Canal del Dique, therefore a solution needs to be found to reduce the high amount of sediment entering the Canal del Dique.

It was found that size and position of the islands have an appreciable effect on the discharge and sediment in the Canal del Dique by influencing the water level at the entrance. Whereas, the shape of the islands have small influence, where protrusions and sharp edges both seem to evolve into smooth bank lines along smooth streamlines. Furthermore it was found that bathymetrical differences have an appreciable effect. However, a maximum reduction of discharge into the Canal del Dique of 8% can be obtained when the island is located just in front of the offtake.

(mentor); Slinger, J.H. (mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Van Thiel de Vries, J.S.M. (mentor)","2015","Port locations are often selected to optimize access to land and navigable water. Many ports are therefore situated at the mouth of an estuary or along a coastline. Besides being economically important these locations are also often valuable from a biodiversity point of view. Human interventions along the coast such as port development often do not agree with local environmental processes. These interventions may be a threat to the existence of ecosystems on which our society depends in many ways. Therefore, there is an urging need for port development which is in harmony with nature and that contributes to the functioning of ecosystem services. Sustainable port development is widely regarded as ‘the answer’. This study focusses on two opportunities that can contribute to the sustainability of a port: enhancing biodiversity and the circular economy within a port and its surroundings. Generally, higher biodiversity ensures increased functioning of an ecosystem and thus supports the services an ecosystem provides. Without these services life could not exist. Enhancing the circular economy can help in mitigating the environmental pressure of a port by producing less waste and using less raw material. A promising measure to enhance both biodiversity and the circular economy at the same time within a port is constructing nature friendly banks made of residual material. Since this is not common practice in ports, it is a relatively unknown topic. The aim of this research is, therefore, to broaden the knowledge base of constructing nature friendly banks made of residual material in a port. Therefore, insight must be gained into:  stakeholders and their interests in order to understand the system;  critical design aspects in order to be able to identify criteria for a suitable design. Interviews with important stakeholders with different backgrounds (Rijkswaterstaat, Port of Rotterdam, Municipality of Rotterdam and WWF) are conducted to gain insight into their interests. The interviews resulted in an increased understanding and knowledge in constructing nature friendly banks made of residual material within a port. Four critical design aspects were identified during these interviews: 1. stability of the design; 2. functioning of the port and its surroundings; 3. circular economy; 4. ecological performance. Profound insight into the critical design aspects is gained by inspecting them further by obtaining a case study research and a design study. Project “De Groene Poort” in the Port of Rotterdam has been identified as a suitable case for this study. This project aims at establishing nature friendly banks in the Nieuwe Waterweg by using residual material from the port and its surroundings. The Nieuwe Waterweg is unique because of the open connection between the river and the sea, making it an important area for migratory fish. A design concept of a nature friendly bank of project “De Groene Poort” has already been developed. The main elements of this concept are a dam parallel to the bank and a nourishment between the dam and the existing bank. The dam is made of coarse residual material and aims to create sheltered conditions at the shore. The gently sloping nourishment is made of dredged material and creates intertidal area that allows more room for nature compared to the existing, steep banks. The stability is the first critical design aspect. It applies to the dam, nourishment and subsoil of the design. The port area is a dynamic environment; the governing loads are ship-induced water movements and a semi-diurnal tide. The design of the nature friendly bank has to withstand these loads and integrate with the surrounding functions of the port; the second critical design aspect. The requirements with respect to the functioning of the port and its surroundings apply to the functions: shipping, flood safety and nature and recreation. The design of project “De Groene Poort” must not impose limitations on these functions. In order to define requirements for the third and fourth critical design aspects in-depth research is required as limited information and knowledge is available on ecology in a port and the circular economy in general. One of the main objectives of project “De Groene Poort” is to enhance the circular economy of the port and its surroundings; the third critical design aspect. The project can enhance the circular economy by acting as a valuable destination for residual material and thereby reducing waste flows and the use of raw materials in the port. Project “De Groene Poort” aims to use two types of residual material as a construction material: 1. coarse residual material (e.g. debris) as a construction material for the dam; 2. dredged material as a construction material for the nourishment. Besides enhancing the circular economy, using residual material can also benefit the business case of the project by reducing expenses on dumping fees and the purchase of construction material. However, there is a high uncertainty in the availability of coarse residual material. Therefore, the final design must be flexible and adaptive to uncertainties on the fluctuating and underdeveloped market of coarse residual material. With respect to dredged material it is expected that the project imposes a small demand relative to the supply. Therefore, it is not a limiting factor for the design. Another main objective of project “De Groene Poort” is increasing biodiversity in the port and its surroundings by enhancing the living conditions of migratory fish in the area; the fourth critical design aspect. The Port of Rotterdam is situated in an estuary; an important stepping stone for migratory fish that need time and space in this area to adapt to the changing salinity between the sea and the river. Potentially, this area could be filled with fish like salmon, sturgeon and trout. However, the existing banks in the area are designed to withstand unnatural loads that are the result of intensive shipping, leaving little space for nature to develop. The area is, therefore, lacking food sources and areas for shelter. Project “De Groene Poort” can add value to the port in terms of biodiversity by providing food sources and areas of shelter for migratory fish. In order to define requirements for the final design, habitat requirements of the following groups of indicator species are, therefore, studied: 1. migratory fish; 2. food sources for migratory fish; crustacean/molluscs/polychaetes; 3. shelter for migratory fish; riparian vegetation. By improving the habitat of these indicator species, the project is expected to improve the overall ecological state of the port. The design requirements with respect to ecology affect the following factors: 1. water movement; 2. substrate; 3. salinity. Based on the requirements with respect to the critical design aspects, five alternative designs based on the existing design concept have been developed and evaluated in this study. These include a zero state model, three alternatives with dams with a varying crest level and an alternative with only a nourishment along the bank of the Nieuwe Waterweg. It has been investigated if the alternatives enable the conditions suited for the desired ecological state. This has been done by simulating the performance of each alternative with respect to every critical design aspect. The optimum design seems to be a trade-off between the objectives of enhancing the circular economy and the ecological performance. The higher the dam, the better the ecological performance but at the same time the higher the uncertainty in the availability of material. In case a lot of material is available the highest possible dam is the preferred alternative. When less material is available a lower dam is also acceptable in terms of ecological performance. These alternatives are also expected to be stable and impose no limitations on the functioning of the port and its surroundings. It has been concluded that the project imposes a relatively small demand of dredged material compared to the availability. It is, therefore, expected that using dredged material as a construction material will have limited impact on the circular economy of the Port of Rotterdam. Overall, it can be concluded that the impact of using residual material as a construction material in a nature friendly bank on the circular economy depends on the dimensions and on the scale at which a nature friendly bank is constructed. This is also related to the space that is available along the river or channel at which the nature friendly bank is constructed. Furthermore, it has been concluded that a nature friendly bank can improve the overall ecological state of a port. Results in this study prove that the (hydraulic) loads on the bank can be dissipated in favor of local ecological conditions. This can be of high value in industrial areas like ports where every ecological development is a large benefit according to ecologists. Depending on their size and scale, nature friendly banks can also add value on a regional scale. A systems approach is thereby necessary, linking different projects in order to achieve benefits on a larger scale. Overall, it is concluded that a nature friendly bank made of residual material can enhance the circular economy and the biodiversity of a port. However, the execution of approaches and methods from this study are only applied to one case. Therefore, the body of evidence is limited. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the impact of nature friendly banks for example in other ports and on locations other than along a channel.","sustainable port infrastructure; nature friendly banks; building with nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J.M. (mentor)","2015","A flexible bone drill provides advantages over conventional rigid instruments, because it allows surgical access via a minimally invasive approach. A new concept is to achieve this using hydropower. Hydropower could provide the advantage of energy transfer via a compliant hose through which pressurized water is flowing. The goal is to design a hydropowered minimally invasive surgical bone drill. However, in this study is focused on the design of the key element of the instrument: the hydraulic actuator. The most suitable hydraulic actuator was selected with a theoretic analysis using design requirements set for a highly challenging medical case (bone marrow stimulation). First, a speed of 750 rpm, a torque of 0.015 Nm and a maximum dimensional volume of 5 x 10 x 10 mm were set from literature to drill a 1.5 mm hole in human bone. Second, the external gear motor was selected because it met the requirements, needed the least pressure difference, and had a simple design consisting of two gears and a housing. Third, an instrument based on the external gear motor was designed and built. Fourth, the prototype was tested and its performance evaluated. Experiments show that the prototype did not rotate under pressure while a high leakage could be noticed. Eventually, three main causes for the malfunctioning were identified and quantified: Jamming/skewing of the gears, excessive friction and excessive leakage. Recommendations to avoid those issues are presented. However, the feasibility of those recommendations is uncertain, because of the small dimensions of the instrument. Therefore, it is advised to reconsider hydrodynamic working principles since the influence of leakage on their performance is less critical.","Bone drill; miniature external gear motor; microfracturing; bone marrow stimulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The primary dike protecting the polder of Bruinisse is vulnerable to piping failure, leading to a high probability of flooding. In the event of a flood, the small but deep polder would fill quickly and pose disastrous consequences, both in terms of human casualties and economic loss. Compartment dikes seek to reduce the effects of flooding by strategically retaining water or protecting areas of high value. The first phase of our study aimed to find the optimal compartment dike layout for Bruinisse polder. We began with a thorough investigation into the existing site conditions and best practices for flood protection, with a particular focus on piping failures. We modelled the effect of dike breaching to determine the consequences of flooding. The results were used to calculate the tangible economic damage and potential fatalities for several different dike compartment strategies. Ultimately, we determined that reinforcing and extending an existing former sea dike near the weak primary dike section was the optimal layout. The second phase of our study sought to determine whether compartment dikes were a viable solution for flood prevention when compared to other strategies such as repairing the primary dike. Several alternative solutions were explored, including berms, cut-off walls, relief wells, temporary barriers, raising land elevations, and improving evacuation. A probabilistic approach was used to quantify uncertainty in both the strength of the dike and environmental loads acting on it. A design and cost estimate was then prepared for each alternative solution, ensuring that they complied with safety requirements for the site. We then conducted an environmental impact assessment and stakeholder analysis to ensure a balanced evaluation. Our multi-criteria analysis determined that reinforcing the weak primary dike using a berm was the optimal solution for mitigating flood risk in Bruinisse. We recommend that additional data collection and analysis take place prior to further action.","dike; compartment; Schouwen-Duiveland; Bruinisse; piping; flood","en","student report","TU Delft, sections","","","","","","Campus only","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.636323, 4.075479"

(mentor); Wiegmans, B. (mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (mentor)","2015","The Netherlands as the ‘Gateway to Europe’ is highly profitable for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (Ministry of I&E). To maintain this position, infrastructure investments are required to remove (potential) bottlenecks and to stimulate intermodal transport. This thesis focuses on two (potential) bottlenecks in the inland waterway network, namely the sea lock IJmuiden and inland waterway lock Beatrix. The need for additional locks at IJmuiden and Beatrix has been modelled in macro and micro simulation models, although the actual impact of both locks in the waterway network is unknown. The impact of additional locks is measured in ship arrivals and deadweight capacity of passing ships. To measure the impact, a studied waterway network was developed, consisting of nodes (terminals), links (waterways) and infrastructure components (locks). Differences in impact (i)without and (ii)with additional capacity are measured in a simulation model. To choose an appropriate model, existing macro-, meso and micro- waterway simulation models are evaluated. Since the studied waterway network consists of multiple locks, this type of model becomes appropriate to illustrate the impact of additional locks. Next to existing waterway simulation models, other research fields related to freight transport are also evaluated as limited waterway simulation models are available and lag behind. As existing waterway simulation models run short and lag behind, a new simulation model has been developed to determine the impact of increased lock capacity. The new simulation model illustrates significant differences in ship arrival patterns for the current case (without additional locks) and the future case (with additional locks). It appears to be difficult to prospect future ship arrival patterns and peak arrivals, as ship arrival patterns and peak arrivals are completely different. The impact of additional capacity in the studied waterway is thus difficult to prospect. Future ship arrival patterns at IJmuiden might be managed by traffic management and therefore will decrease future peak arrivals. For Beatrix this is not the case, since ship arrival patterns and peak arrivals will remain or even increase in the future. Thus, even with additional capacity, the Beatrix lock might remain a (potential) bottleneck. Therefore, the impact of additional locks in the network is larger for IJmuiden as they schedule ship arrivals with traffic management. Future research is required to evaluate the implementation of traffic management at Beatrix. Despite the unknown consequences of implementing traffic management, Schuttevaer acknowledges the potential of traffic management and is willing to cooperate. More future research is also required to increase the reliability of ship data registration. Increased lock capacity in inland waterway freight transport is only positive for the short-term ship arrival patterns and peak arrivals. In the long-term, structural traffic management changes are also required to improve inland waterway freight transport. Waterway freight transport has substantial potential to stimulate intermodal transport and to strengthen the Netherlands’ position as the ‘Gateway to Europe’. If the sector, Rijkswaterstaat and the Ministry of I&E can work closely together, the potential can be realized. Otherwise, inland waterway freight transport will be placed at risk.","intermodal transport; inland waterway transport; lock; meso simulation; increased capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The formulation of the new gravity model indicates that the telecommunication patterns (i.e., the aggregate number of calls and text messages between zones) can be a better proxy than the distribution of population to predict mobility patterns and to measure the accessibility of a road network, allowing transport planners to make better decisions on road network design.

Only fuels with an appropriate sulphur content are allowed or, alternatively, an exhaust gas treatment system might be applied. For General cargo ships the feasible methods are selected based on a literature study: MGO, LNG and a hybrid wet scrubber. Each of these methods is accompanied by a system-configuration that affects the design of the ship and the investment-, operational- and voyage costs. Up to this day the choice of the method is based on unique and case-by-case in-depth studies which are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, a decision support tool is developed that can be used to select the most appropriate system-configuration, specifically for General cargo ships. Based on an evaluation of Conoship’s design process of General cargo ships, the choice of the method should be made in the pre-design phase. The choice is based on an evaluation of the design-aspects that are usually evaluated in the pre-design phase. These design-aspects relate to the design-requirements which are a combination of ship-owner requirements and safety-requirements: engine room space, deadweight, grain capacity, container capacity, Gross Tonnage and intact stability. The tuned method of Watson is used for the estimation of the lightweight. The estimation of the other aspects is based on methods obtained from literature.","general cargo ship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine Technology: Design Production and Operation track","","Specialisation Ship Design","",""

The research methodology used to derive the constructed framework is an adjusted approach of Verschuren and Hartog’s (2005) design cycle. The adjustment concerns the final two phases of Verschuren and Hartog’s (2005) design cycle, where they use the implementation and evaluation phase. This two phases have been omitted and replaced with the verification and illustration phase, mainly due to time and resource constraints.

(mentor); Lourens, E. (mentor); Bachynski, E. (mentor); Eiksund, G.R. (mentor)","2015","Further advancements in the offshore wind industry, which come with the use of larger wind turbines at deeper water, require larger support structures. For shallow and intermediate water depths, monopile foundations still remain the most widely-used and cost-effective support structure due to the relative simplicity of fabrication and installation. The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and feasibility of extending monopile technology for larger wind turbines and deeper water. Preliminary monopile designs to support the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine were established for water depths 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m. For large diameter piles, applying lateral soil stiffness derived from API method underpredicts lateral deflections at both seabed and pile toe. To properly account for the pile-structure interaction and the rigid pile behaviour, lateral soil stiffness was derived using finite element software Plaxis 3D. To verify the preliminary design, ULS and FLS analyses were done using 1st order and 2nd order wave models applied with Morison’s equation. For the ULS analysis, the 2nd order wave model predicts a response which is 1.9 times higher than the 1st order prediction for a water depth of 20 m. The sum-frequency effects and higher wave particle acceleration for the 2nd order wave model explain this result. For the FLS analysis, it was found that designing monopiles for higher water depths increases contribution of hydrodynamic loads to fatigue damage. A more sophisticated wave model is desired to increase accuracy in fatigue damage prediction at deeper water. Lastly, a method for predicting total fatigue damage using a fewer number of representative sea states is introduced. A Fatigue Damage Parameter (FDP) is established to correlate fatigue damage to environmental condition by means of thrust, Hs and Tp. Using at least 30% of the total number of conditions results in at least 90% accuracy in damage prediction. The applicability of the method to other structures and environments is left for future work. ____________________________________________________________________________________","offshore wind energy; monopile design; foundation; PY curve; 2nd order waves; fatigue analysis; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Geraedts, J. (mentor)","2015","Welcome to the information age, a period in human history that shifts the focus of our economy from traditional industry to one based on data processing and information technology. The Internet is the invention that stands at center of this new age, it connects billions of people around the planet in a single network. The apps on our smart phone, laptop and tablet are at one side of this network, while “servers” are the computers on the other side. These machines handle and store our most precious family photos, intimate emails and financial information. Consumers expects the software that runs on these servers to handle thousands of simultaneous connections while being secure, safe and always online. As the number of customers grew, so grew the complexity of this software in order to meet the increasing demand. “Microservices” is a novel approach thats aims to cope with the complexity of server software. In such architectures, large software processes are turned into many smaller programs that are each responsible for a specific subset of the overall functionality. This in turn, makes it easier to split the work across multiple developers. One person (or team) can be made responsible for the complete life-cycle of a single microservice and is therefore able to innovate independently. This makes sense in an “Agile” environment: a methodology that encourages iterative development and fast failures. But will only work when services can be put in operation quickly after a new iterations has finished development; often driven by automation this practice of bringing operations closer to development is called “DevOps”. Even though microservices are separated in terms of innovation, on a technical level it is often impossible to decouple them completely from one another. During user research it was shown that such coupling between services causes problems for the DevOp when he is developing and testing new code on his workstation. The coupling makes it very hard to isolate a single microservice: working on it means installing and running all the other services it depends on, and the services that those depend on, and so forth. First, this lack of isolation forces the DevOp to install, update and configure dozens of programs before he or she can begin development. Secondly, due to the nature of microservices, a single test can cause the environment to change in many different places; resetting the environment for another test becomes tedious, error prone and time consuming. “Docker” is a new technology that has seen rapid adoption in 2014. It allows software processes to be encapsulated in a standardized fashion, so called “containerization”. While large firms are focusing on developing Docker solutions for data center operations, industry analysis shows there is little competition when it comes to using Docker for the development and testing of server software. With a series of prototypes it is shown that Docker can be used to solve the before-mentioned isolation problems and help the DevOp with developing and testing his microservice. With further prototyping, the solution was developed into a concept called “Dockpit”. Dockpit provides an interface that allows DevOps to quickly fix the dependencies of their microservice into place and store this information in a single file that lives next to the source code of the service. On command, it reads this file and passes the instructions to Docker to let it take care of (re)setting the environment. Dockpit makes it possible to isolate a microservice in minutes and reset the environment in seconds with the push of button. Two user validation studies were setup to verify if Dockpit was capable of delivering value to the target group. The first study was setup to measure product-solution fit and took place at the company Giant Swarm. Through multiple hands-on sessions it was shown that the lack of isolation was an important barrier for the company and prevented them from testing their microservices consistently to gain a better grip on the stability of their product. The second validation was aimed at measuring product-market fit. A minimal viable product was created and released online, three press released were published to drive initial traffic from the marketplace. A total 336 subjects visited the homepage and only 9% of them continued to download Dockpit, none of the users were retained after 2 days. These results show that product-market fit has not yet been reached. Continued effort will be put into simplifying and reshaping the product towards a better product-market fit. Additionally, more emphasis needs to be put on the design and validation of a business model.","microservices; dockpit; software; programming; server; product owner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Two GustoMSC jack-up designs are selected as typical: a large drilling jack-up (CJ-70), and a small wind turbine installation vessel (NG-2500X). Limits for allowable wave heights during jack-up installation are determined by factors including station keeping and wave loading. Spudcan impact loading is an additional factor that becomes governing in long period waves. A better understanding of jack-up motions during installation can improve impact prediction methods and this could result in more favorable installation limits. Forced heave oscillation tests have been done at decreasing distances from a towing tank bottom with a skirted spudcan and a hexagonal spudcan. A thin disk was used to validate the model tests. Added mass of both models was found to increase with decreasing distance to seabed and with increasing amplitude. Quadratic heave damping was found to increase with decreasing distance to seabed. The latter was significantly larger for the skirted spudcan. Static frequency domain analyses were done with WAMIT and in-house GustoMSC software to investigate the influence of the measured increase of added mass and damping on the motions of typical jack-up’s during installation. Spudcan motions of the CJ-70 showed significant decrease in long period waves. The spudcan motions of the NG-2500X showed a small decrease in sea states with long period waves. The decrease of CJ-70 motions could improve installation limits in these conditions. Further research is however needed to analyze neglected effects and to quantify the improvement in installation limits for drilling jack-up’s with skirted spudcans.

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Napoles, O.M. (mentor); Stijnen, J. (mentor)","2015","A dike is designed for an extreme event which greatly exceed the situation under daily circumstances. The expected loading during such an event is, however, difficult to estimate. Inherent uncertainties in nature and epistemic uncertainties in models and statistical data impede a clear verdict about the exact loading on a dike. Consequently, incorporating uncertainties in a dike design can have a great impact. One of the aims, following the Delta Decisions of 2015, is to improve the way uncertainties are incorporated in future dike assessment and design models. Conventionally, models become more computationally intensive with the incorporation of each additional uncertainties. Therefore, it is useful to only account for most influential uncertainties. Until new models are established, the Ontwerpinstrumentarium (OI2014) is released for the transitional period. The guideline explains for which extreme event a dike needs to be designed. Looking in more detail to the OI2104, questions can be asked about the underlying assumptions. In this thesis, a modified method of the OI2014 is exhibited by looking into a dike’s location specific dominant failure mechanisms. In so, a better cost-optimal dike design can be realized. Also, a sensitivity is carried out in which currently recognized uncertainties are investigated using the PC-Ring model. In addition, a new statistical wind uncertainty model is built, wherein uncertainty is integrated a priori under the assumption that correlations between random variables do not play a significant role. The model’s implications are evaluated using the Hydra-Zoet model. From this research three main findings can be deduced. Firstly, the proposed methods of the OI2014 do not lead to a cost-optimal dike design. Secondly, addition of statistical wind uncertainty leads to a significant increase of hydraulic boundary conditions for lake systems. Lastly, the prior integration of any random variable has many computational benefits.","safety standard; normering; uncertainties; faalkansruimte; extreme value theory; wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","52.0066700, 4.3555600"

(mentor)","2015","On this MSc thesis we use two radar altimetry mission data in order to study the evolution oof the Greenland ice sheet during the period 2013-2014. The Throughout Earth’s history the cryosphere, and more specifically its ice sheets, have responded to every major climate change event by expanding or retreating its extension pulled on the direction of the new climatic situation. Thus, for the currently ongoing climate change, the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets hold a significant relevance as they are one of the most sensitive indicators of climatic changes. On this scenario, this thesis project studies the process of characterizing the mass changes on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) making use of satellite radar altimetry data provided by the K band altimetry mission SARAL/Altika. The data have been obtained from the RADS radar altimetry data base of the TU Delft. One of the main focuses has been put into the characteristics of employing the radar altimetry techniques over ice sheets and the specific phenomena that need to be taken into account when computing range values. The slope-induced deviations have been estimated by calculating the along- and across-track surface slopes on the nadir direction and correcting for the deviation caused by these on the range estimates. The result has been satisfactory when compared with an independent DEM. On a second phase of the project, the elevation changes have been computed at the intersections between ascending and descending tracks, the crossover points. Three methods have been used to analyse these elevation changes: an overall GrIS estimate that uses all crossover points as equal; a regionalized averaging method for the crossover points; and a Laplacian differential molecule method for adding a dynamic dimension to the regionalized data and thus have a smoother and better covered GrIS data. The regionalized methods have yielded a distribution of elevation changes where the north- western and north-eastern coastal areas are where the main ice loss is measured, while the interior areas show no change or a slight increase on the southern interior area. By using the elevation change estimates, annual volume changes have been derived for each of the methods mentioned above. The resulting estimates are similar from one method to the other, giving an average of -272 ± 55 km /yr for the January 2013 - December 2014 period. When translated into annual mass balances using an effective ice density of 900 kg/m a total mass change of -245 ± 50 Gt/yr is obtained. This thesis has successfully calculated annual mass change estimates for the GrIS using SARAL/Altika measurements, results that come into agreement with the ones obtained in other independent studies. In addition, it has confirmed the validity of the applied methods for the correction of slope-induced deviations and the calculation of regionalized elevation changes. The availability of longer period data records and an improved re-tracking procedure could significantly improve the accuracy of the final results.","satellite altimetry; greenland ice sheet; ice altimetry; slope-induced deviation; mass balances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space missions","","","",""

(mentor); Van Keulen, D.C. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Van Dijk, W.H. (mentor)","2015","In this thesis a particular structural system for high-rise structures is discussed: the prefabricated concrete framed tube and tube-in-tube structures. These system consist of a prefabricated concrete perforated elements in the perimeter of the structure that are the main lateral load resisting elements in the building. For tube-in-tube structures, the perimeter elements work together with a structural core that also resists the high lateral loads that are due to the wind loading on high rise structures. The thesis starts with a literature study on multiple aspects that are associated with the subject. First, an introduction into prefabricated high-rise and framed tube structures is given and some key behaviors and elements of this kind of structures are explained, such as the shear lag effect and aspects of connections between prefabricated elements. Hereafter, previous research associated with the subject is described. Most of these titles are Master's Theses from Delft University of Technology, which is at the forefront for research on prefabricated concrete high-rise structures. Other references found are articles published in Asian countries or the United States of America, but those tend to focus on cast-in-place framed tube structures. Finally, sources describing the connection between elements are described, which is an important parameter in prefabricated concrete shear wall structures. The literature study continues with an analysis of prefabricated high-rise structures in the Netherlands. It presents different structures already constructed and their relevance to the subject of the thesis. Also a description of the Dutch high-rise market is given as well as the justification for the construction of high-rise towers in this market. The literature study leads to the section on the missing links in research and the research questions associated with these missing parts of information available in literature. As a result, the research part of the thesis is divided into three parts: - Shear lag effect of non-rectangular framed tube structures - Structural behavior of prefabricated framed tube structures - Case Study Zalmhaventoren: Potential of fully prefabricated tube-in-tube structures These missing links lead to two separate parts of this thesis. Firstly a parameter research was done to answer the research questions associated with the first two missing links. This parameter research tries to answer research questions such as: “How do framed tube structures without a rectangular floor plan behave with respect to shear lag?” and describes the relation between parameters such as aspect ratio, slenderness and corner stiffness on the shear lag effect and other structural aspects. It answers these questions by changing the parameters of a basic structure in the Finite Element Method (FEM) program AxisVM. This structure has a floor plan of 14.4m x 14.4m and has 25 floors with a 3.5m floor height, adding up to a total height of 87.5m and a slenderness just over 6. All models are made in 4 different configurations: a cast-in-place configuration, a prefabricated configuration with a masonry configuration for the elements and two similar prefabricated configurations with small and large windows. Two parameters are also formulated in this section to keep track of the shear lag effect: These are the shear lag factor P, for flange walls and the shear lag factor P* for web walls. All these previously mentioned characteristics, except for the floor plan, are used for the answering of the research question on non-rectangular structures. The conclusions from this part of the parameter research are that the changes in shear lag effect are small if inside corners or corners with an angle not being 90 degrees are used. For structures with the floor plan of higher polygons, such as octagons and hexadecagons improved structural behavior was found. The reduction in peak stresses in the corners can be attributed to the shorter elements where shear lag can form and the more corners over which the peak stresses can be divided. For the parameters researched using the square floor plan it was found that both the aspect ratio (the ratio between width and depth of the structure) and the introduction of structural vertical joints between the elements in masonry configuration had no to a negligible influence on the structural behavior. The effect of the corner stiffness on the structural behavior was more profound: especially reducing the corner stiffness has a noticeable negative effect on co-operation between the flange and webs walls, which in turn increases the deflection at the top of the structure. For the relation between the shear lag and the slenderness of the structure it was found that structures with a lower slenderness, that depend more on their shear stiffness to resist lateral loading, experience more shear lag than structures with a higher slenderness. In the second part the following research question was answered: “Is it possible to build a structurally feasible prefabricated tube-in-tube high-rise structure in the confines of the Dutch building market of approximately 200m high and how does it compare to other prefabricated solutions?” In the literature report a building was described that could be used to answer both parts of this research question. The Zalmhaventoren is a proposed residential shear wall high-rise structure in Rotterdam which has been researched by ten Hagen for a Master's thesis at Delft University of Technology. In this thesis, the original cast in-situ concrete Zalmhaventoren is redesigned to a prefabricated shear wall structure that is 201.3m high. A redesign of this structure gives insight in the possibilities of a fully prefabricated concrete structure and has a model that as comparable to the model researched by ten Hagen. During the redesign the basic dimensions of the original structure were kept. The floor plan of the structure is 30m x 29.5m, has a core of 14.4m x 12m and the floor to floor height is 3.05m. Although originally designed as a residential structure, this floor height is also sufficient for other functions, such as an office function. To keep the structure comparable to the one designed by ten Hagen, 66 floors were used to reach the total height of 201.3m. Besides these basic dimensions however, significant changes were made to convert the structure into a prefabricated tube-in-tube structure. The removal of the shear walls and addition of the lateral load resisting façades changed the floor plan of the structure. To give the tube the stiffness that is required when loaded by wind, extra material was added in the corners of the structure, where windows were present in the shear wall design. Also an extra column was added in the center of the frame for the largest balcony on each side of the structure. In the lobby of the structure similar changes were made to fit the new structural system of the building. Another important part of the structural design was the determination of the stiffnesses of the different connections between the elements. Especially for the horizontal connections in the tube of the structure this proved difficult, because of the differences in normal stress between different parts in the same element. A 2-level stepped stiffness was given to these tube elements to approximate the actual stiffnesses in this type of connections. For the corner connections (of the Interlocking Halfway Connection type) the stiffness was determined for the connection in compression and in tension. An iterative calculation ensured that the correct stiffness was attributed to the correct corner connection. After the model was made, the results were analyzed. Probably the most important result, for it is often governing in high-rise structures, is the deflection at the top of the structure. For a structure of this height, the maximum allowable deflection is 403mm. For the four different wind directions, the deflection was between 282mm and 327mm. Also the shear stress between elements was checked and found to be within the limits set in the Eurocode. For two elements an estimation of the reinforcement was made. The reinforcement of the lintel was viable, but for the column near the lobby of the structure, a reinforcement percentage was found that was higher than the recommended maximum value in the Eurocode. However, if the integrity of the concrete can be assured or the less strict Dutch national annex is used, the found percentage does not interfere with the feasibility of the structure Along with the main model, some alternate models were made to research the effect of certain aspects on the most important result: the top deflection of the tower. The first one was the difference between a cast-in-place model and the prefabricated one. The increase in top deflection for the prefabricated structure was around 8%. Not negligible, but not high enough to stop considering prefabricated tube-in-tube structures from being viable. The second check was if removing the balconies, and with them the less stiff frames around the balconies, and replacing them with ordinary stiffer windows had a positive effect on the top deflection. It was found that implementing this change at the same element thickness reduced the top deflection by 34% to 42%. Even when the thickness of all the elements was reduced from 400mm to 300mm, the top deflection of a structure without the balconies was better than for the model with balconies and a element thickness of 400mm. In the comparison with the structure from the work of ten Hagen, it became clear that both lateral stability resisting systems could work for the Zalmhaventoren. Both had advantages and disadvantages that could be weighted either way by different developers if the structure was designed purely as a residential building. However, if the tower was designed as being a multipurpose building, the open floor plan of the tube-in-tube structure provides not only more flexibility at completion, but especially over the entire lifetime of the structure. Ultimately this research gives insight into the structural behavior of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure and proved that the possibilities of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure lie even beyond the 200m, especially if the technologies associated with this stability system keep improving over the coming years.","high-rise; concrete; prefabrication; tube-in-tube; framed tube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

The experimental setup has four electromagnets (coils) which can be used to shape the magnetic field above the magnets by controlling the currents through all coils. By doing this, the steel ball can be positioned horizontally in one degree of freedom. The control objective consists of accurate and fast regulation of the ball. The magnetic force created by the coils is highly nonlinear. An empirical model is used to approximate the force exerted by each coil. This leads to a constrained nonlinear control problem. Multiple nonlinear controllers are designed: a Feedback Linearization (FL) controller as benchmark, a State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) controller, a Constrained-SDRE (MPC approach) and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC). Furthermore, two learning controllers are designed: a Reinforcement Learning controller and an Imitation Learning controller based on Local Linear Regression (LLR). All controllers are evaluated in a simulation study. A satisfactory performance was achieved for both the FL controller and the Constrained-SDRE controller. The NMPC is not feasible in real-time and the RL controller did not achieve a satisfactory performance. The other four controllers were successfully implemented on the experimental setup. From the results of the model-based controllers on the setup it can be concluded that the Constrained- SDRE performs best in terms of settling time, overshoot and control effort. The imitation learning controller is able to match the performance of the C-SDRE controller, and performs better than the C-SDRE in terms of adapting to a different ball size.","nonlinear control; magnetic manipulation; learning control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

In the past, dikes were designed on the probability of exceedance of an incoming wave during storm conditions. In the near future, the design criteria will be the probability of flooding of the hinterland. In order to determine this flooding probability, the strength of the dike has to be known. This thesis focuses on the erosion of the grass sod during overtopping wave volumes. Several tests have been performed in the last few years with the wave overtopping simulator. During this thesis, some of these locations have been tested for the strength of the grass sod with a newly developed method. This new method, called the sod pulling method, tests the actual strength of the grass by lifting the grass sod out of the top layer. However, this method makes at least two cuts in the sod in order to attach the pull frame. So a methodology has to be developed to calculate the strength of an intact grass sod from the measured data. The measured forces needed to lift the grass sod can be rewritten into critical grass normal stresses for an intact sod, which can be done with a practical method developed in this thesis. In this method a shape factor is introduced to compensate for the influence of the cuts made in the sod before testing. Because of the heterogeneity of the grass sod, the individual test results are not the most important parameters. In order to determine the representative strength of the grassed slope during wave overtopping conditions, the strength of the weakest sections in the grass sod have to be determined. This can be done by assuming a normal distribution for the strength of the grass, where the 2.5% tail value will be used as the governing strength of the sod. In order to determine the parameters of the normal distribution, at least 30 tests are needed to be done as condition 2 test with the 20 by 20 centimetres frame size under saturated conditions, at random locations on the bottom half of the slope. The square root of the calculated critical grass normal stress is one of the input parameters in the critical velocity formula, which also uses the pore water pressure, the relative turbulence intensity and the density of the water. When the critical velocity resulting from this formula is compared with the determined critical velocity during the wave overtopping simulations, there is good correspondence between the values for the tested locations in this thesis. So the sod pulling test can provide results that are reliable enough to determine the critical velocity of a dike section.","sod pulling test; critical velocity; Cumulative Overload Method; wave overtopping simulator; critical grass mean normal stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The goal of this project was to improve the customer experience of bol.com’s return policy. Research found that the Dutch online shopper is generally unsatisfied with the return policies of Dutch web shops. Bol.com offers its customers free returns within 30 days, which is a more liberal policy than most competitors offer. There are however some steps within bol.com's return process that are inconvenient, like having to print a return label and needing tape to seal the box. Here lies an opportunity, especially since a good return policy is found do more than just increase customer satisfaction. Some products are more difficult to judge online than others. A return policy is found to increase the likelihood of customers pursuing an online purchase, especially for these products that are more difficult to judge. Additionally, people are found to increase their purchase behaviour at a web shop after returning a product there, which results in more loyal customers. These effects are interesting, but how can bol.com's make good use of them? In order to find how bol.com can use its return policy to increase people’s purchase intention and customer loyalty, a qualitative and quantitative research were executed. The research showed that customers who returned a product at bol.com are positive about its return policy, while customers who never returned a product to bol.com, are not familiar with the ease of returning a product. Bol.com should increase the awareness of its return policy among customers who do not have experience with returning a product. Therefore, customers should experience the ease of returning not only while returning, but already while purchasing a product. In order for this to be effective, the new return policy should minimize the time and effort to return a product. Since returning a product will always cost some time and effort, be a positive consequence should be included to compensate this. As a result of the ideation phase, a new design for the box and invoice are proposed. A self-adhesive return label is incorporated in the invoice and can be used to seal the box. Additionally, instead of 'having to return a purchase' a return will focus on 'completing a search for the right product' and 'helping other customers with their search' by stimulating customers to write a review when returning their product. This design will show customers how easy and enjoyable it is to return a product at bol.com. The validation showed that this solution is desirable for bol.com and a feasible first step towards a new view on the return policy, even though there are long term recommendations that are suggested to be implemented in the future.","bol.com; web shop; return policy; purchase intention; online shopping; service design; customer loyalty; return experience; box; invoice; review","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Management en Organisatie","",""

At the heart of this service is the hypothesis that lean startup and design thinking are complementary and form together a synergy which is called lean startup design. Dandelion Incubator Services is a pleasant and colourful co-creative space for the corporate client’s employees and lean startup and design thinking advocates. The main driver for the incubator service is the fact that in corporations new innovative ideas never make it to launch and get lost in the long dragging processes, bureaucracy and micropolitics within the organization. The report recommends the realization of the incubator service by SI Labs but with being an independent and autonomous entity and develop Dandelion Incubator Services as an endorsed brand of SI Labs to use the powerful and positive brand image of SI Labs.","service design; business incubators; lean startup; design thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Goto, L. (mentor)","2015","3D body scanning and 3D printing are promising techniques to innovate the fashion industry by making custom fit garments more feasible. Especially in the area of tight fit garments, for example lingerie, these techniques are applicable. This thesis describes the development of a custom fit bra using 3D body scanning technologies. While using 3D body scans as input, an attempt was made to automate the production of a custom fit bra. Most women wear a bra every day. Though, virtually all these women are not pleased with this piece of clothing. A bra has to give support to the breasts, feel comfortable and when wearing, women want to look good. In conventional bras, the two dimensional underwire that shapes and supports the breast is forced to follow the three dimensional body. This causes irritations and can leave permanent marks on the body. There are bras available that are more comfortable, though these bras are considered to be only functional, not aesthetically pleasing. It is hard for women to find a bra that is both comfortable, supportive and aesthetically pleasing. Next to this dilemma, finding the perfect bra is difficult because the current bra system is complex and inadequate. It is based on just two body measurements, while much more measurements are required for a perfect fit. Furthermore, every woman is asymmetrical, still the current bra sizing system does not take into account this asymmetry. Over the last decades, the bra has not changed much. Tailor made bras are expensive and still rely on old fashioned techniques. With new technologies like 3D body scanning and 3D printing, custom fit bras should be much more feasible and will take away the struggles women have with their bras. It is chosen for this project to limit the research to women with average breast sizes. By doing so, the outcome of this project forms a solid base that can be scaled down for women with smaller or scaled up for women with larger breast sizes. An attempt was made to come up with an innovative bra that will fulfil a woman’s need. The focus of the project is on the construction of a parametric breast support element. This element is created on a personal body scan using Rhino and Grasshopper. Several prototypes of the breast supportive elements were made and tested to proof this new approach on breast support is better than current solutions. The final result of this research consists of two complete custom fit bras with 3D printed breast support elements. One of the bras was tested by an actress on stage, the other bra was tested during a normal work day. The results were promising as the participants both preferred the newly invented bra type.","3D Body Scanning; Fashion; Bra; Automated customization; Breasts; Additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2020-06-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Today, offshore wind represents 14% of the EU wind energy market, and has a huge potential for further growth [1]. Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) accounts for 18-23% of the total lifetime cost in offshore wind farms, compared to 12% onshore [2]. The offshore O&amp;M tasks are more costly, being influenced by distance offshore, harsh offshore conditions, wind farm size, wind turbine reliability and maintenance strategy [2]. Exchanges of main components, also known as major interventions, causes significant costs and has been indicated as the largest uncertaintywhen predicting O&amp;M costs [3]. Major interventions are characterized by the need for a jack-up vessel to perform the exchange. No studies have been found on offshore major interventions. Echavarria has previously performed an analysis on the exchange rates of main components based on the onshore WMEP population, which had an average rated power of 233 kW [4].

(mentor)","2015","System identification is the art of constructing mathematical models from observed data. It is a well established field with a history of over 40 years, characterized by a rich theoretical background, while it has proven its worth in many real life applications. On the other hand, Gaussian processes form a specific category of kernel based machine learning algorithms. Both methods aim at making predictions based on the past data. However, in contrast with the system identification algorithms, Gaussian processes do not deliver a parametric model but a mere (non-parametric) relation between the available inputs and outputs. Over the past few years the possible synergy between the two fields is extensively investigated. More specifically, the incorporation of the Gaussian process framework in the \ac{PEI} methods for \ac{LTI} systems was recently achieved. In this way, desirable properties of the Gaussian processes such as the increased flexibility and the minimum variance property of the estimator were included in the PEI framework. Moreover, these methods manage to incorporate simple prior knowledge to the algorithm through the sophisticated determination of the covariance (kernel) properties of the related coefficients. This synergy was also recently extended to the \ac{SID} framework for LTI systems. This is exactly the starting point of this thesis. After this point, we analyse the effect of various aspects on this new algorithm, such as the kernel structure, the effect of \ac{SNR} ratio and the effect of the available data points. More importantly, the effect of the past window value is extensively investigated, since its value is critical towards the accurate identification in the classical SID methods. In this thesis it is shown that the kernel based SID methods exhibit a superior accuracy compared to the up-to-date SID algorithms. Moreover, it is shown that they are the least affected by the choice of the past window value, thus opening the way for more automatic methods, less affected by the specific choices of the users. Following the examination of the LTI case, the possible synergy between Gaussian processes and SID methods for \ac{LPV} systems is under consideration. To this end, we start with an analytic investigation of the LPV SID methods in order to highlight their characteristics. At this point it becomes obvious that a direct use of the kernel methods for LTI systems is impossible due to the differences between the two classes of systems. Therefore, new methods were sought, opening the way to two novel approaches for the kernel based SID of LPV systems. The first one is based on the introduction of a prior on the LPV equivalent Markov parameters, while the second one introduces a prior on the time varying impulse response coefficients. The theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithms are then highlighted to reveal their merits and deficiencies. Moreover, the structure of the kernels is a crucial aspect of the kernel based SID methods for LPV systems. Especially for the second proposed approach, the proposed kernels balance between two desirable but contradictory characteristics. On the one hand, simple structures alleviate the computational burden of the involved (non-convex) optimization algorithms but they can be too restrictive and so they may fail to capture the underlying dynamics. On the other hand, rich kernel structures are expected to offer better results but only if they manage to avoid local-minima, while the computational time is expected to be a serious limitation. Our solution follows after an assiduous investigation of the coefficients to be estimated and the subsequent establishment of a correlation between the kernel structure and the impulse response coefficients. This could be seen as the LPV equivalent of introducing simple prior knowledge in the proposed methods. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithms is verified through a series of identification examples. The main result of this thesis project is that the new, kernel based algorithms show a superior accuracy compared to the standard SID methods for LPV systems. From these algorithms, the so called ``LPV-RKHS-PBSID$_{opt}$'' algorithm exhibits the most accurate results, as it is both theoretically justified and also observed in the simulation examples. All in all, the performance of the kernel based SID methods for LPV systems shows a high potential, which can lead to a change of paradigm of how mathematical models can be constructed from the observed data.","machine learning; system identification; subspace; Gaussian processes; Linear Parameter Varying; Linear Time Invariant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

This can be done by changing operational parameters, like the rotational velocity of the drill string or the weight on the bit. However, increasing these parameters can lead to violent vibrations down hole. The most significant, and least investigated, type of vibration is whirling. Whirling is the lateral vibration of a drill string. Especially backward and chaotic whirling (see Figure) can cause major damage to the drill string components. A solution has been invented to prevent these violent types of whirling from developing.

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor); Liu, P. (mentor)","2015","When currents are present around a subsea pipeline, vortices are shed alternately from the upper and lower sides of the pipe. The vortex shedding can induce vibrations in areas where the pipe is suspended above the seabed. These vibrations are called Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV). VIV have been and still are a cause of concern for pipeline designers. If a pipeline vibrates during a large part of its design life, then damage due to fatigue is expected. It is therefore of great importance to understand how pipelines respond to the flow-induced vortices and how the vibrations can be mitigated. Recent research has addressed the dynamic interaction of adjacent free spans. Dynamic interaction can occur when two or more parts of a pipeline that are suspended above the seabed are separated by a narrow support. In that case the vibration of a span can be different than when it is considered separately. This area is the focus of this research. The aim is to give more information on how the support properties effect the dynamic interaction of the free spans. The properties under investigation are: the support length and the type of soil model. For a multi-span, nonlinear soil behaviour such as pipe lift off could play a role in the vibration. The implication of this would be: change of dominating response frequency, different vibration shape of the pipe and impact loads on the pipe. In this thesis a model is proposed that calculates VIV of a subsea pipeline; the Pipe-Wake model. This model allows for response of the pipeline in the time-domain, which makes it possible to add nonlinear soil effects. For clay soils a suction model is proposed that allows the pipe to break free from the seabed after the suction force reach a threshold value. For sand two models are possible: no suction or full suction. The former means that in upward motion no soil resistance is noted, while in the latter the soil resistance is equal in both directions. The VIV are modelled using a wake-oscillator. A wake-oscillator is a phenomenological model that captures the behaviour of VIV accurately. The two main aspects of this are the lock-in region and the self-limiting vibration. The pipe itself is modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam using the Finite Element Method. A nonlinear static analysis is used to calculate the pipes initial position. For the dynamic calculation the stiffness of the beam is linearized around the static deflection. Modal analysis is used to calculate the response of the pipe. A soil model, which is dependent on soil type is then added to complete the Pipe-Wake model. With this model the case study is replicated. The general conclusion of the research is that simplifying the support by either shortening it, or by assuming that soil behaves the same for both soil penetration and release, is an oversimplification in the case of a multi-span set-up. For high flow velocities this can lead to disconnection of the pipe from the support. The consequence of this is larger vibration amplitudes for lower flow speeds in relation to linear soil behaviour. Modelling the support shorter than it is in reality will lead to a drop in natural frequency and mode shape. It is therefore recommended to verify these conclusions experimentally and see if this would have implications for the design of multi-spanning subsea pipelines.","Vortex-Induced Vibrations; VIV; span; dynamic interaction; wake; oscillator; soil support; subsea; pipeline; time-domain; pipe-wake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Bottom Founded Structures","","52.011634, 4.375628"

For this purpose, the elements taken into consideration by expert operators during decision-making processes were analyzed. As a result, three different types of abstractions have been identified which influence the operator’s cognitive activities.

A reduction of the interface stiffness is proposed to mimic crack opening with a linear deformation and obtain realistic results.

(mentor)","2015","This thesis consists of multiple approaches to develop a new model to determine the porosity, permeability and the rate of desorption of 1.5-inch shale samples. The raw NMR signal of the sample in the coreholder is measured before methane injection and is used as base signal. During the injection of methane the raw NMR signal increases. The base signal is subtracted from the response during the methane injection. This difference is Laplace transformed to only obtain the T2 distributions and T1 ? T2 correlations related to the injected methane in the shales. T2 distribution holds information on the pore size distribution. Using cut-off values to separate the signal, different zones can be extracted. During injection and production of fluids, the rate and the total fluid filled porosity are used to calculate the permeability related to the individual pore size distributions. To test this theory, a high porosity carbonate rock from the Khuff formation is first injected with water. Thereafter shale samples from the Posidonia and Qusaiba formation are put to the test with injection of methane. In the majority of shale gas formations, there are two types of pore systems are present; kerogen-hosted organic pores(OP) and inorganic pores (IP). By fully saturating 1.5-inch shale cores and by continuously mea- suring the NMR signal it is possible to determine the individual porosity and permeabilities of the pore sys- tem. T1 ? T2 measurements are made to confirm the individual zones and the mobility of the fluid in the zones. A single exponential decay formula is defined to calculate the permeability. This formula is tested with an Eclipse simulation to validate the calculated value. Eventually a multi-exponential model is used to distinguish the high and low permeability components in shales. This high permeability component is interpreted to represent the inorganic pores and micro fractures, while low permeability component is interpreted to represent the organic pores and the desorption from pore surface. The Posidonia samples have an OP of 2.2-3.5% and an IP of 3.2-4.2%, while the Qusaiba have an OP of 0.2-0.3% and an IP of 0.45-0.9 %. Therefore the Posidonia core samples show better production potential than the Qusaiba samples. Understanding the shale porosities for different storage mechanisms as well as the corresponding permeabilities is essential for developing shale reservoirs and target zone selection.","NMR; Shale Gas; Permeability; Posidonia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

This traffic flow model, the information in the floating car data is able to affect the estimation for speed, flow and density. The EKF is able to incorporate the uncertainties in the traffic flow model and data-based estimations. This is especially important, as the estimations based on floating car data are shown to be dependent on the traffic conditions and the fraction of vehicles which are observed (penetration rate). Therefore, in the proposed methodology the uncertainties assigned to the floating car data-based estimation are dependent on the estimated traffic conditions and penetration rate.","Traffic state estimation; Floating car data; Extended Kalman Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport and Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Focusing on passenger transport, accessibility indicates the opportunities transport and land-use systems enable individuals to reach various activities. As a concept used in a number of scientific fields such as transport and urban planning, accessibility plays an important role in policy making. Widely used scientifically and practically though, application of accessibility in certain field still needs exploration. Air transport and HSR have become or are going to become the main long distance public transport modes mutually in many countries over the world. The concept of accessibility is not often applied in the planning and evaluation of air transport and HSR projects, which might be a problem, because the development of air transport and HSR projects requires large amount of investments, so that the policy makers need to be clear about the accessibility impact of these projects for their region. Furthermore, more and more regions are now served or expected to be served jointly by air transport and HSR. The complex influences of the interaction (including competition and complementation) of the two modes on each other and on the travel behaviour of individuals have drawn attention, yet these influences have not been explicitly interpreted. Therefore, this thesis presents an explorative research on the evaluation of the accessibility impact of combined air transport and HSR. The thesis is divided into a theoretical analysis and a case study. Various types of accessibility measures have been developed for accessibility evaluation, some of which are relatively easy to apply and interpret, while some of which are more comprehensive theoretically. In the evaluation of the accessibility measures of combined air transport and HSR, it is expected that the accessibility measures should ideally combine transport variables, land-use variables, individual variables, and air/HSR interaction variables. The time-scale of the evaluation is also seen as an important variable, because it determines the collection of data and the selection of the previous mentioned variables. In a policy evaluation, the time-scale variable needs to be predefined according to the purpose of the evaluation. Moreover, it is considered important that the accessibility impact measured can be combined in a broader social and/or economic evaluation, so that the policy makers can have a comprehensive view of the impact of the projects. Therefore, the usability in social and/or economic evaluation of the accessibility measures is considered an important variable that influences the selection of feasible measures. This thesis shows that different types of accessibility measures have their own advantages and disadvantages. Out of all the accessibility measures examined in the thesis, it is considered that potential measures and utility-based measures have relatively better trade-off between ideally combining the variables, and applicability and interpretability in a broader socio-economic evaluation. To test the applicability of these accessibility measures selected a case study for the region of Frankfurt Rhein-Main area is carried out. Due to time restriction and data availability, in the case study only potential measures are applied to evaluate the accessibility impact of (combined) air transport and HSR networks. By using the methods of minimum cost and logsum composite cost in the impedance functions, potential measures show to be capable to capture the characteristics of the competition and complementation of air transport and HSR in a mutual market. According to the results of the case study, in terms of destination accessibility to main cities in Europe, air transport provide better accessibility compared to HSR. When air transport and HSR jointly serve a region (as in this case study), better accessibility is measured. The case study in the first place demonstrates the feasibility of evaluating the accessibility impact of combined air transport and HSR networks using potential measures. In practice, using more collective disaggregate and empirical data, the evaluation can provide useful information for policy makers. In spite of the large assumptions made in the case study, some implications for policy makers can already be summarized. Firstly, the access service of air transport and HSR has an important role in the accessibility impact of the two modes. Therefore it is necessary to ensure the corresponding supportive access service in the development of air transport and HSR projects. Secondly, when the complementation of air transport and HSR is measured, the accessibility impact of the combined networks is higher than that when only the competition is included, which underpins the necessity to combine the air/HSR interaction variables in an accessibility evaluation. From the practical point of view, to improve the accessibility impact of combined air transport and HSR networks, policy makers can try to enhance the cooperation of the two modes, for example, by smoothing the transfer process between flights and high-speed trains. Thirdly, the case study also explores the social equity of the studied region in terms of accessibility. It is shown that accessibility seems a quite useful social equity indicator in the evaluation of the social impact of air transport and HSR projects. Some implications for other regions than the studied region in the case study can also be proposed. Better integration of the development of new air transport and HSR projects can decrease the negative effects of the competition of the two modes and enhance the positive influences of the complementation, for example, by enhancing the advantages of HSR in markets with a distance less than approximately 500 km and improving the accessibility of air transport by HSR access service. For countries where air transport and HSR are rapidly being developed, for example in China, it seems important to bear this in mind in the planning of the new projects. Compared to potential accessibility measures, utility-based accessibility measures, for example logsum measures, are more theoretically ideal, because they are expected to give more realistic results of the accessibility impact. Furthermore, logsum accessibility indices can be easily expressed in monetary units, which makes them potentially useful in economic evaluation (e.g. cost-benefit analysis) of air transport and HSR networks investments. Due to time restriction and data availability, utility-based measures are not studied in depth in this thesis. It is recommended that in future research, the feasibility of utility-based measures could also be explored using a real-world case study. This thesis stresses the importance of combining the interaction of air transport and HSR in the accessibility evaluation. In literature, the interaction of the two modes has not been sufficiently studied, especially in terms of its influence in the accessibility impact. Further research on the interaction of air transport and HSR from supply (supply of air transport and HSR service, e.g. routes, seats, and frequency) and demand (perceptions of individuals) perspectives could be performed, so that the influence of the interaction on the accessibility impact can be more accurately measured, and more effective policies can be designed to improve the accessibility impact by optimizing the interaction of the two modes. Additionally, the evaluation of the accessibility impact can be improved in future research by including the interaction of transport and land-use systems. This interaction is not included in this thesis. All in all, this thesis establishes a theoretical basis for the evaluation of the accessibility impact of combined air transport and HSR networks, based on which further theoretical and practical studies can be performed to assist the decision making in relevant policies.","accessibility; air transport; high-speed rail","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Transport and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Miedema, S.A. (mentor); Ramsdell, R.C. (mentor)","2015","Especially for the dredging industry in the United States of America and the leading dredging company Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company the clamshell dredge is a commonly used dredge tool. The aim of this study was production [m3/s] optimization of the clamshell bucket for stiffer clays. Different aspects of clamshell bucket geometry to clay experiments and bucket concepts are discussed and presented in the report. The approach of tackling this challenge was first evaluating four main elements of the clamshell bucket. These elements were: bucket geometry, bucket kinematics, the cutting process and the soil properties. Questions arose during the cutting process examination and its normative parameter, cohesion and adhesion. At the transition zone for rock to clay with strength of 400 kPa the adhesive strength is zero, because rock is no adhesion and therefore the adhesion has to decrease to zero. With this boundary condition the prediction was made that with increasing cohesive strength there is a decrease of adhesive strength with clay. As assessed the adhesive strength property of clay has a dominant role in the clay cutting process. The correlation between increasing cohesive strength and possible decreasing adhesive strength is of importance for fully grasping the clay cutting process with clamshell buckets or other dredging tools. For this an adhesive measuring test set-up has been designed, constructed and used at Texas A&M. The test set-up was able to pull a steel blade out from two layers of clay and measured the resistance force with an inline load cell connected to an electric actuator. A total of 56 experiments were done at two different pulling speeds, 8 and 0.4 mm/s, on three different natural field clays. The natural field clays were retrieved from two project sites. The first is the softer (10 kPa) Delaware River clay from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the stiffer grey (17 kPa) and red (87 kPa) clay from Freeport, Texas. Additional testing was done with Atterberg limits, UU-traxial and mineralogy determination. A clamshell bucket sensitivity analysis was conducted on two existing GLDD buckets to evaluate parameters that influence the production in m3/s. The GL485, an Anvil-Owen, 16 m3 and 24.5 ton and the GL484, Hawco, 9 m3 and 29.5 ton buckets were used. These two grabs were subjected to the variation of the normative parameters: cutting angle, adhesive cutting length, centre point of gravity, bucket weight, bucket span and bucket width. This analysis was done with the Clamshell Closing Simulation software (CCS32). The software can be used to make estimates on bucket payloads, forces, bite profiles in soil and the ability of varying different bucket parameters. These parameters have different results for the two buckets. The GL485’s production is mostly increased by increasing the bucket weight, lowering and outward moving of the centre point of gravity and reducing the adhesive cutting length. For the GL484 it is slightly different and the most effect on the production is reducing the adhesive cutting length, followed by increasing the bucket weight and increasing bucket span for increasing the production. With the acquired data from the adhesive experiments and clamshell bucket sensitivity analysis different clamshell bucket concept designs were created. Of the four clamshell bucket concepts, three (GLX, GLY and GLZ) have their own unique design. These concepts are evaluated with the acquired data of the sensitivity analysis leading to the final concept the GLXYZ. This concept is a combination of GLX, GLY and GLZ and its best features for improving production for every clamshell closing cycle. Each concept is graded with the multi criteria analysis and the concept with the highest overall grade is the best option for new bucket design. The adhesive test set-up with the approaches to the experimental adhesive data has led to confirming the prediction of adhesive strength development with increasing cohesive strength. With an increasing cohesive strength of the clay, there is a decrease to zero for the adhesive strength. In addition to the decreasing adhesion, there is an increase in the internal friction angle (?). This can be concluded from the data of the Freeport grey clay of 17 kPa cohesive strength and the stiffer Freeport red clay with a cohesive strength of 89 kPa with a even smaller adhesive strength. The internal friction angle for the Freeport red clay is 30 degrees, however the internal friction angle will have a limit considering rock has an internal friction angle. This has a major influence on the productions [m3/s] and production estimates of stiffer clays with clamshell dredges or any other dredging equipment.","dredging; clamshell; clamshell dredge; clay cutting; adhesion; cohesion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-04","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

There are many people living with a disability. Most of the time, with a little effort this group of people can be taken into account while designing and arranging user environments. However, for healthy people it is often difficult to empathize with people with a disability. For this Erik van Geer developed an age simulation suit, which gives the user the opportunity to empathize with people with a disability. The assignment for this project was to improve the age simulation suit, with the focus on improving the ease of use, adjustability of simulations and improving the simulated disabilities. The current suit and context was analysed and possible improvements were identified. The main focus of the redesign was on redesigning the physical limitations. Making them easy to adjust and put on by yourself. Multiple concepts where created with different focus points: 1. Low cost, low tech and easy production 2. 3D printing, simulations 3. Advanced technology, no budget limitation The final concept consisted of concept 1 and 2 combined. The idea was to make the suit open source and thus able to be produced by anyone who is interested. The use of 3D printing and other easy production methods makes this possible. The simulations redesigned in the new suit are:  Arm reach limitation  Step size limitation  Elbow/knee stiffening Additionally new simulations have been added:  Balance disorder  Hand stiffening  Stooped posture  Reduced strength The product was evaluated with a user test. The main goal was to confirm whether or not the new suit performed better than the old suit and was easier to use. Overall the final suit has improved in every aspect on the old suit. The data from the user test was used to give recommendations for further development of the suit.","age simulation suit; disability suit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Our results showed that the findings of Ahern were replicated and that the mean pupil diameter and mean pupil diameter change (MPDC) discriminated just as well between the three difficulty levels as did a self-report questionnaire of mental workload (NASA-TLX). A higher mean blink rate was observed during the multiplication period for the highest level of difficulty in comparison with the other two levels.

(mentor); Cardoso, C. (mentor)","2015","The organizational context of firms is continuously subjective to change as, for example, new regulations, ever changing market trends (e.g. the shift from ownership to sharing as with the music streaming service of Spotify) and disruptive innovations in technology (e.g. 3D-printing, the ‘cloud’ or ‘the internet of things’) relentlessly alter companies surrounding environment. Which makes that the need for organizations to not only consider these rapid and vastly changes but act upon them is growing quickly. However, in Management and Strategy theory little attention is given to the means to cope with this increasing turbulence in the business environments. In general, the objective of a strategy is to provide clarity and control in contexts characterized by change. Subsequently this should ensure a continuous fit between the organization and its business environment and by doing so, enable the creation of a competitive advantage and eventually a successful organization. Consequently, the increasingly turbulent and uncertain future poses a huge challenge for strategy making, as traditional approaches to strategy development -though often seen as the answer to change and uncertainty- actually assume a relatively stable and predictable world. A knowledge gap has been identified, in both theory and practice, that there are little to no formalized structures of an approach to strategy development that is sufficiently capable to cope with the capricious and turbulent organizational context. This research takes a new perspective on strategy development, that is rooted in the body of knowledge of Design, a field that has a proven track record in dealing with uncertainties provided by change and the complex relationship between people, places and objects. Therefore the objective of this research is to enable organizations to thrive in current organizational context by providing handles to allow flexibility in its strategy development process, which is addressed by the following research question: “How can design thinking enrich the approach to dynamic strategy development in current organizational context?”. It was found that the main aim of this research was essentially the operationalization of both concepts ‘dynamic strategy development’ and ‘design thinking’ in such a way that they can be combined. Moreover, due to the absence of explicit literature on strategy development in current context, the lack of grounded theory on design thinking in business and the fact that both concepts are founded in different paradigms; this research has found to be challenging. In order to overcome these challenges, the research was scoped by means of a case study at Strategy Works, which means that their strategy development process was observed, decomposed and analyzed from a design thinking perspective. A second sense of direction was provided by its initial research question: how its current strategy development processes, its core competence, can be defined and subsequently communicated to its clients. This implied that during the research it was aimed to make the concepts explicit, which subsequently should lead to better understanding and better communication of these concepts. These statements have led to the design of this exploratory research and accompanying approach that was focused on definition of the core principles of these concepts. In order to arrive at a definition of strategy development and design thinking, that is both comprehensive and has scientific grounding, a literature study was executed first. With the literature study, the core principle of strategy development was defined and consequently the challenges that organizations face in strategy making in current organizational is made explicit. It is found that it not necessarily the changes in the organizational context itself that makes strategy development difficult, rather it is the unpredictability of these changes. In order to have strategic foresight, to anticipate changes in the futures and being able to manage and modify the strategy to better fit this future, the strategy developer should be able to manage the vastness of potential useful information, social nature of the process and the continuation of the strategy process; characteristics that define todays strategy development. However, as far as could be established, in the Strategy body of knowledge there has been little formalized, structured and applicable approaches to such a dynamic process. It is argued that handles to such an approach can be found in the field of design, as it is stated by e.g. Buchanan (1992), Cross (2001), Dunne & Martin (2006) and Schön (1983), that dealing with wicked and dynamic situations constitutes the everyday context of any design as practice. Subsequently the concept of design thinking is explored and defined, leading to the nine principles that could be considered guidelines as to understand design thinking and apply this to practice. In order to validate our findings from the literature, an empirical study is performed concerning the relation between strategy development and the principles of design thinking in this process. This empirical study was based on the execution of a single case, exploratory case study, which is considered to be an appropriate method to understand the context depended phenomenon. The case study concerned a strategy development process executed by consultants from Strategy Works, from February 2013 - December 2013, regarding the development of a strategy (i.e. ‘Strategy 2020’). In this research retrospective accounts of participants of the strategy development process in the selected case are used to validate our findings from the literature, stating that design thinking can enrich the strategy development process. To be able to collected relevant data a document analysis was executed as well as personal interview surveys. In this case study it became evident that there were three challenges indeed prevalent in the strategy development process of the organization; the exploration and sense making of the context, social diversity and the notion that the process is dynamic and thus should continue. However it appeared that these challenges are rather interconnected and that it is difficult to consider one without the other, as for example sense making of the context is hindered by the diversity of all the stakeholders and the variety in interpretation of the data. Furthermore it became evident that the main conclusion of this case study can be found on a more abstract level, and concerns the need for structure in the flexibility and ‘fuzziness’ of the process. These insights, together with the literature study allowed us to make conclusions regarding the defined research question. The literature study showed that the main challenges in dynamic strategy development are based on the prerequisite of strategic flexibility in the strategy process; an organizations ability to manage and modify its strategy. This flexibility is required to maintain a strategic fit; the foundation for an organizations sustainable competitive advantage in the turbulent organizational context. In order to so, strategy developers need to have strategic foresight and anticipate changes in the organizational context, interpret these and act accordingly so. Our findings from the empirical research support this statement, as it became evident that the biggest challenge in practice appears to be in enabling a structured way to make the unpredictable future more present and tangible in the strategy process. The difficulty in this flexibility lays in the seemingly ‘unstructuredness’ and lack of credibility of an approach that allows this flexibility. In our theoretical foundations we have found that this can be appointed to the vastness of potentially useful information and exhaustive exploration as well as the social nature of the process (i.e. content complexity and social diversity). However, in practice it appeared that it is not necessarily the amount of information that is considered challenging, rather it is what happens with this data, how to interpret data and knowledge management in general. It was noted that processes concerning these aspects are deemed challenging to stakeholders not familiar with these activities and were considered ‘vague’, ‘fuzzy’ and even ‘magical’. Interpretation of the empirical findings show that this could be appointed to the lack of structure and handles to application to practice regarding these aspects, which reduces its credibility. These statements allow us to conclude that the possible enrichment of a dynamic strategy development by means of design thinking is rooted in its structured approach to the rather ‘fuzzy’ process steps that are required in current strategy development. In a design thinking process the emphasis is on comprehendible process steps with proven credibility to the output of such steps which can remove the seemingly arbitrariness or ‘magic’ from this process. Not only can this include multiple stakeholders that have no experience with such processes to understand its necessity, it also allows them to be involved and provides value to such an approach. In general it could be argued that this can be achieved by making the necessity of characteristics that are required in a flexible process explicit by means of the nice principles of design thinking as defined in the theory. Specifically, when one understands and becomes more of certain cognitive processes, it is stated to improve one’s ability to think about and practice that specific process. Hence, clarity and comprehension of what, why and when design thinking can be used to enable the required flexibility, will result in better application. Moreover, when the dynamicity and flexibility of the strategy process is made explicit, its output and relevance can become more visible, which should consequently increase its credibility.","strategy development; design thinking; wicked problem; strategic fit; shared understanding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Van Kampen, E.J. (mentor)","2015","This report contains a study to find faster numerical methods for Hamilton-Jacobi Isaacs partial differential equations in application to model-based flight envelope estimation. This equation can be used to estimate the flight envelope through solving a reachability problem. The goal is to update the flight envelope with this method to maintain envelope protection after the occurrence of a failure. To do so the estimation methods have to become considerably faster. Useful insights have been obtained though assessing the reachable set theory associated to the problem, which permit to designate computational resources to regions of higher interest and to solve the problem with a new set of solving schemes by using the boundary value formulation of a minimal time differential game. A small literature study is held on the level set and fast marching methods. Five different techniques have been attempted to improve the computational efficiency. The applicability of a class of non-iterative schemes, known as the fast marching methods, has been evaluated both on a theoretical level as well as through simulation. The behavior of the studied methods is demonstrated on four example problems, including a simplified aircraft model. The research has found that in application to flight envelope estimation it is not feasible to initialize the reachability problem with an estimated set, or to recursively propagate a reachable set over a failure event. The integration of the differential equation with a set of trajectories was however found to be permissible. Potential applications for this technique have been identified. It was found that the boundary value formulation of the differential equation may be used provided that the system is modeled as a time-invariant system and that the initial set consists only of trimmable states. The non-iterative Fast Marching method was demonstrated not to be applicable to envelope estimation. An extension called the safe Fast Marching method was found to give accurate but incomplete reachable sets. It is recommended to consider the acceptance of sufficient rather than optimal control inputs to simplify the optimization problem. A continued investigation should be made on the iterative minimal time algorithms, in particular the iterative fast marching method and the fast sweeping method.","flight envelope estimation; Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs; Hamilton-Jacobi-Belman; Fast Marching; Level Set; differential game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-03","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operation","","Control & Simulation","",""

Airports and airlines tend to differentiate and to offer products that are more customized at the “experience level” because at the technology level the market is a perfect competition. IDE faculty has expertise with regards to some of the challenges the aviation industry is dealing with, such as service design, experience design and supply based design and is exploring and expanding its activities in the field of aviation industry also thanks to the work of academic figures that are very experienced in this field. For this reason, the applied lab that investigates on the aviation operation -called In-flight Experience Centre- is associated to the IDE faculty and not to other more technical faculties like Aerospace Engineering. Nevertheless, the potential of the inflight experience center has not been fully explored yet, therefore also its function could be improved. Collaborating with companies and integrators of services in the aviation industry and working with the applied lab could also be very valuable for students’ education. Considering the context and the assignment requirements, the objective of this project is to design a solution that will facilitate research at the faculty and collaborations between it and companies working in the aviation industry.","aviation; collaboration; facilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","P.I.M.","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","A common method to obtain workspace extension of the slave's workspace is through rate control because it has an unlimited workspace of the slave. However, when contact interaction with the remote environment is needed, position control is often proposed due to the force feedback. To benefit from the strengths of both of these control types, hybrid designs have been proposed which combine both position and rate control within one design. Human factors evaluation is lacking to compare benefits and limitations of hybrid designs against the two common applied workspace extension designs: indexing and rate control. None of the hybrid designs were evaluated for various tasks such as a force task. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate if a hybrid design can combine the strengths of large free-space motion for rate control, and accurate positioning and executing a force task for indexing. In this research, a hybrid design was developed (based on existing designs) in which force feedback for rate control was added. A within subject human-in-the-loop haptic teleoperation experiment (N=12) was performed to compare performance for this hybrid design against indexing and rate control for a task including traversing a substantial distance (free-space subtask) and exerting a constant force against a remote environment (force subtask). The results show that the hybrid design allowed subjects to realize similar performance for the subtask free-space motion as for rate control, in combination with similar performance for the subtask exerting a force as for position control with clutching. This indicates that this hybrid workspace extension design enables the operator to use the benefits of position and rate control.","teleoperation; indexing; position control Clutching; rate control; hybrid design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-04","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The idea was to create a mega nourishment that would supply the coastal system between Hook of Holland and Scheveningen with new sediment for the upcoming 20 years. The Sand Motor is being monitored to get more information and knowledge on the behaviour on this type of nourishment since it has been the first one on such a large scale. In the winter of 2013 a couple of heavy storms have passed along the Dutch coast of which the storm of December 5th, from here on referred to as ""Decemberstorm"" (Dutch: ""Sinterklaasstorm""), was the most severe with significant wave heights up to 5.4m. For this storm bathymetrical measurements are available of the pre- and post-storm situation. This gives a unique opportunity to get insight into the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that are important at the Sand Motor during storms. In this study therefore the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic changes during a storm are investigated using the Decemberstorm as a reference case. This study presents an analysis of the Decemberstorm from which the results are partly used as input for the modelling phase and partly to validate the model results. The model study consists of depth averaged and 3D models of the Sand Motor as well as an XBeach model which compares the Sand Motor to a uniform coastline. By comparing the model results with each other and the measurements an analysis is made of how the shape of the Sand Motor influences the processes around the coastline.","sand motor; storm; Delft3D; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.054880, 4.188389"

This trend will have a large influence on the shared mobility sector. A bicycle sharing system is one of the sectors that could benefit from this innovation in key transaction. Bike-share is originated in Europe, and ever since a viable format was created quickly expanded as a worldwide phenomenon. Shareable bikes are intended to improve the mobility of an area. They are also very popular since it solves the last mile problem. Whereas public transport travels at certain times and often not stops at personal destinations, a bicycle is individual transport and therefore flexible and also relatively fast. This makes it a very popular way of transport. Variation exists in the viable formats of the service to offer transport form one point to another. The difference between these systems is within the independency and flexibility of the service. Gradually Social Lock is created to improve the quality of a bike-share service by offering reliable, flexible and affordable transport.","bike-share; bicycle sharing system; digital lock; share economy; bike lock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Garcia, N. (mentor); Arrieta, A. (mentor)","2015","The main objective of this MSc thesis project is to investigate the load alleviation potential of a variable stiffness bi-stable morphing blade section under extreme gust conditions by designing such a blade section. This project builds on the work of Arrieta et al. and Kuder et al. and is based on the DU 93-W-210 airfoil. The bi-stable element design by Kuder et al. was carried over. The aerodynamic codes XFOIL, Q3UIC and RFOIL were compared and validated with wind tunnel data and more advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics results. The aeroelastic Abaqus model by Kuder et al. was modified in order to accommodate for this project. The effects of an extreme operating gust were studied and quantifed. Especially at cutout conditions, the impact of a gust was found to be profound. Furthermore, dynamic stall effects during a gust were found to be significant at high angle of attack. It was demonstrated with a parametric study that trailing edge flaps can alleviate a significant amount of the load increase due to a gust. A morphing trailing edge mechanism was presented. This mechanism consists of a morphing trailing edge flap which is restrained from rotation by a bi-stable plate. Upon reaching a critical flap hinge moment, the bi-stable snaps from the stiff to the flexible state which allows the trailing edge flap to morph passively and hence alleviate load. The flap hinge moment behaviour of small flaps was found desirable for passive morphing and originates from boundary layer separation. A locally compressible profile skin was found to be required in order to achieve load alleviation. Therefore, a corrugated skin was implemented on the suction side of the profile near the trailing edge. Two morphing blade sections were presented, one with a large flap (20.59% chord) and one with a small flap (13.19% chord). The effectiveness of the bi-stable restraining mechanism was demonstrated. The small and large flap exhibit relatively similar amounts of load alleviation which indicates that the small flap is more efficient. The instantaneous lift reduction is around 7% at rated conditions and 17% at cutout conditions. This means that trailing edge flaps are less effective at high angle of attack in separated flow conditions. However, the amount of alleviated load increases after snap-through with increasing wind speed. Finally, the dynamic response of an instantaneously morphing flap was addressed. It can be concluded that passive load alleviation was achieved. One of the critical elements for this load alleviation was the implementation of a corrugated skin. It is deemed that the presented designs can be optimised further to achieve even more load alleviation. However, this study indicates that there is a potential for a morphing passive load alleviation mechanism which reduces the impact of extreme gusts and potentially allows for a reduction in blade mass which in turn can induce a reduction in wind energy cost.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","EWEM","",""

(mentor)","2015","Railway track circuits are electrical systems that are used for train detection. The identification of faults in these track circuits and the estimation of the severity of these faults is crucial for the safety and availability of railway networks. In this thesis a method is proposed to solve these tasks based on the commonly available measurement signals. By considering the signals from multiple track circuits in a geographic area, faults can be identified from their spatial and temporal dependencies. In this thesis, artificial neural networks are used to learn these dependencies from historical data. Although not enough measurement data was available during the writing of this thesis, it is more than likely that reasonable amounts of (unlabeled) measurement data will become available at a later time, as the required measurement equipment has already been installed. To train the networks in this thesis, the small available dataset is analyzed and used together with the currently available understanding of the fault dependencies to make a generative model. The synthetic data produced by this model are used to train and test the neural networks in this thesis. Artificial neural networks have recently achieved state of the art performance on difficult pattern recognition problems in several different fields such as image recognition and speech recognition. These recent successes can be largely attributed to the combination of large networks and large datasets. In the condition monitoring domain large datasets are generally not available. This prevents the use of the large neural networks that have become so successful in other fields. In-spite of this, some of the ideas that have become popular in other domains might still have value in the condition monitoring domain. This thesis focuses on bringing the Long-Short Term Memory architecture and the concept of end-to-end learning to the condition monitoring domain. To address the fact that only a limited amount of labeled data will be available, an unsupervised learning strategy is investigated. This strategy will use unlabeled data to pre-train a network so that it can more efficiently learn from the scarce labeled data. For the fault isolation task, it is shown in this thesis that when a large amount of labeled training data is available, the end-to-end learning strategy can detect and diagnose faults in the data from the generative model very accurately. When only a small amount of labeled data is available, it is shown that using a pre-trained network works better than using end-to-end learning.","fault isolation; neural network; railway track circuit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Systems & Control","",""

Air transport is also responsible for most of the value added. As stated by Boeing, even though air freight accounts for fewer than 2 per cent of total tonnage transported, it represents almost 40 per cent of aggregate value of total world trade, proving that it is a link of paramount importance for the global supply chains. Descriptive models can aid decision makers in their understanding of the response of global air freight flows to external factors such as the global economy and technological innovation and provide a quantitative underpinning of forecasts and of business cases for investment. Although in the air freight transport business, use is often made of long term forecasts, there is little shared knowledge about which methods should be preferred, and hardly any literature at the scientific level. Transport models were originally developed for passengers and ensuingly applied in freight. Although it is accepted that the four-step transport modelling methodology is a fitting framework for freight, many fundamental differences exist between them such as diversity in decision makers, commodities transported, mode properties, the networks etc. In the particular case of air freight transport, these elementary dissimilarities call for an adaptation of the existing methods, towards a modelling framework better suited for the airborne movement of goods. There lacks a strategic model for air freight flows at the global scale that overcomes the insufficiencies of passenger oriented models. This research contributes to the literature by formulating a model for global air freight demand and network flows. The results of the model are presented in the form of international air freight flows, followed by results on a regional level, sensitivity analysis and validation. The model is found to produce realistic results within the rational range set by observed air freight volumes.","air transport; cargo; air freight flows; transport modelling; strategic; airborne trade; service choice; belly; integrators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This is investigated by modeling zero emission energy storage devices (ESDs) in the power and propulsion configuration of a benchmark urban ferry. This benchmark ferry provides the speed profile for input to the baseline model. Three ESD configurations for providing power and propulsion are identified: the Full ESD configuration, the ideal peak shaving configuration and the on-off hybrid configuration. A selection process, which uses a baseline model to compare the power and energy requirements, is applied to identify the most promising configuration. Then, using a weight estimate for the total power and propulsion configuration, the ESD requirements are compared in a Ragone chart, which plots the specific power and energy of the ESD. This comparison shows that the full ESD configuration with a battery as the ESD has the highest potential for the benchmark urban ferry. This configuration does not emit emissions locally. The full ESD configuration with battery is modeled in more detail, using the operational profile of the benchmark urban ferry as input. This configuration, however, is unable to sail the profile for a day due to the battery capacity being too small. Additional changes are proposed related to the battery technology, operational profile, and hull dimensions to allow for more battery capacity. When the battery technology is improved and changes are implemented in either the operational profile or the hull dimensions, the ferry is able to sail the profile for a full day, emitting no harmful, polluting emissions, at least locally.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","","",""

Deltares and HKV are developing new methods to quantify flood risk on a global scale. A Flood Risk Assessment Tool (FIAT) is used to performcalculations. The definition of risk is hazard x exposure x vulnerability. FIAT is able to combine these elements and calculate the Expected Annual Damage (EAD) for each city.<br/><br/>Currently two methods are used on a global and continental scale. For Europe a flood risk analysis is performed based on five land uses categories and five depth-damage functions, this method is referred to as the Multiple land use method. On a global scale an analysis is performed based on one land use and one depthdamage function, this method is referred to as the Single land use method. Nootenboom (2015) investigated the difference between the two methods for Europe. He described a good correlation of 0.97. Deltares and<br/>HKV want to extend the Multiple land use method to a global scale.<br/><br/>A flood risk assessment for Australia is performed with the Multiple land use method. Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney are reviewed. Recently derived depth-damage functions by Huizinga (2015) were used. Australian functions are available for residential and commercial land use. For other land use classes European functions are used instead. As a source for flood hazard the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model is used. Exposure maps for Australia are made with OpenStreetMap (OSM). Metadata from OSM was filtered and processed in such a way five land use classes were formed. A total coverage of 52% was achieved.<br/>The areas where no data could be recovered was filled in with ratios of the retrieved data. A sixth layer, named the no-data layer is formed. Visual analysis shows that the assumptions made in the no-data layer are most accurate in densely populated areas.<br/><br/>When the results of the Multiple land use method are compared to the Single land use method a correlation of 0.99905 is found. For every city there was a decrease in flood risk. The depth-damage function for Australia is investigated. Typical for the Australian function is the steep shape compared to the European function. A sensitivity research shows that each city reacts different to changes in the depth-damage function. Especially for cities with low inundation depths the risk is strongly influenced by the use of Australian functions. Cities with high inundation depths, such as Brisbane, are far less susceptible for changes in the depth-damage function. The use of European functions for certain land uses classes is therefore acceptable in Brisbane, as long as the dominant residential and no-data layer have continent specific functions.","Flood Risk; Land Use; Damage; GIS","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""
