The Port of Altamira is one of the fast growing ports in the world and is together with Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos one of the biggest ports of Mexico at the Gulf coast. It is an industrial Port with a lot of potential for expanding. However, the breakwaters of the Port extending into the sea caused severe erosion at the downdrift side of the Port (south side). This ongoing erosion is threatening a precious lagoon and some important land. The erosion can also cause a breakthrough of a dune row, which will result in a flooding of the hinterland. There has to be found a solution for this ongoing erosion. The definition of the problem and the goals of this project are identified in chapter 3. An analysis has been made in chapter 4 to get insight in the environment around the port, which eventually has a big influence on the erosion. Which coastal processes are causing the initial sedimentation transport and the quantification of the erosion is described in chapter 5. To determine which solution is the best for this problem, first the wanted situation has to be estimated. This is done by looking at storm condition and the actual situation at the beach in chapter 6. This way there is made an estimation of the requirements which the alternatives have to fulfill after they are constructed. The summary of the total of requirements is given in chapter 7.","port development; longshore transport; erosion","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Schrama, E.J.O. (mentor); de Goede, E.D. (mentor)","2006","The South China Sea's (SCS) seasonal, large-scale temperature cycle is governed to a large extend by the monsoon. This phenomenon modulates the large-scale circulation, transport and mixing as well as the exchange processes with the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea. Also, significant variations in net surface heat flux will contribute to the large-scale, seasonal temperature cycle. As a result, a seasonal mixed layer temperature cycle of over 6oC occurs in the northern SCS regions and between 2oC and 4oC in the southern regions. Over the central SCS temperature stratification is observed throughout the year, while over the shallow northern and southern regions atmospheric forcing and large-scale transport will attribute to a seasonal breakdown of the stratified system. The objective of this study is to assess the large-scale three-dimensional temperature cycle of the SCS and to develop a corresponding hydrodynamic model that is resolving the monsoonal response. Due to the significant spatial and temporal scales, sea level anomalies observed by satellite altimetry and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) observed by satellite radiometer play an essential role in this study, both to assess the SCS physical system and for modelling applications. The model is setup using the Delft3D-FLOW hydrodynamic modelling package and applies an orthogonal spherical-curvilinear and boundary fitted grid in the horizontal. In the vertical a sigma-layer approach is applied. In the deep SCS regions the model depth is truncated based on a reduced depth approach. For surface heating the so-called Ocean heat flux model of Delft3D-FLOW is used. At the open model boundaries water level and lateral transport forcing is applied. The model does not resolve tidal forcing. An extensive sensitivity analysis is performed, with model forcing and validation data both for a climatological year and for the year 2000. The models temperature accuracy is subsequently improved by assimilating remotely sensed SST data using a nudging method. On seasonal scales, the model represents the large-scale transport, surface heating and stratification with reasonable accuracy. Without SST nudging a mean difference of 1.75oC is observed with respect to validation data. By nudging SST the mean difference decreases with 15% to 1.5oC.","South China Sea; baroclinic temperature model; reduced depth model; altimeter data; radiometer data","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Astrodynamics and Satellite Systems","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2006","Mooring problems are one of the most important issues in port construction and port operation when harbours are facing the open sea. Operational standards usually define that cargo handling for large vessels is possible when significant wave height is below some level, i.e., 0.5 [m]. However, several ports have reported mooring problems when the wave condition is below the operational level. Many authors have related this problem with the action of long waves inside the port areas. Long waves are known to be the cause of mooring problems in the Saldanha Bay. These waves have periods between 50 and 500 s. This is a range of natural oscillation for the horizontal motions of the moored ships. Therefore, moored vessels at the jetty experience conditions of resonance for these motions during the occurrence of these long waves. Such ship motions can be up to several meters and cause adverse conditions, both for vessels and the fender system. Long waves have been noticed to occur usually together with the storm conditions and the passing of weather fronts. If the occurrence and magnitude of these long waves could be predicted, measures can be taken to mitigate or prevent conditions of large moored ship motions at the jetty. This specific study focuses on the generation of long waves generated by wave grouping inside Saldanha Bay (South Africa).","Surf-beat; swell; wave groups; Saldanha bay; mooring conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2006","The Port of Rotterdam has requested to investigate siltation problems and the silt trap in the Waalhaven. Before the computational modelling can be started it needs to be investigated whether the computational model, DELFT3D, is suitable to the problem. The Waalhaven is a relatively small area, compared to other DELFT3D problems. The final future goal of the model would be to analyse the working of a silt trap. There has been started with the simulation of the flow in a small scale model harbour to investigate the flow features and the way they can be modelled. Measurement data for this model scale harbour have been used for calibration. The value of the chosen horizontal eddy viscosity is of major influence on the resulting flow pattern. The application of two vertical grid-models, the -model and the Z-model, has been looked at. Harbours with entrance angles of 90 and 45 degrees have been modelled. For the Ã¢slantingÃ¢ harbour two methods for the calculation of the flow along staircase boundaries have been compared. With the Ã¢Cut CellsÃ¢ method the area of the cell is adjusted and the velocity is only calculated for the two non-boundary sides of the grid cells. For the Ã¢45 degrees closed boundaryÃ¢ method the advection terms are corrected as well. This method can only be applied to to 45 degrees boundaries with Z-model grids. This method shows the largest improvement of the flow along the boundary. The Cut Cells method only shows a small improvement compared to not applying any method. Both methods are also applied at a 1:1 scale model for the same harbour geometries and for a 71 degrees slanting boundary. The application of the Ã¢Cut CellsÃ¢ method shows a larger improvement than at scale 1:200. Especially for the 71 degrees slanting harbour improvement shows. With this knowledge a model has been made for the Waalhaven. Due to the lack of necessary data the model has also been calibrated with help of the scale models. This qualitative Waalhaven model shows that tidal filling and the mixing layer are both important exchange mechanisms. They can cause siltation in the Waalhaven. Sediment and density flows need to be investigated, they can be of major influence on these conclusions. It is possible to model the flow at the surface of the Waalhaven with DELFT3D. It is questionable if the flow along the bottom, which is important for modelling sediment flows, can be modelled representatively, because the boundary conditions are dominant. In a sequence to this investigation the major issues will be the gathering of data for the calibration of the model and to find out the dominant exchange mechanism.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
