(mentor)","2007","Road pricing is one of the policy instruments that can be applied in a road network to achieve specific policy objectives. The applied toll charges influence the travel behaviour of the different road users resulting in influencing the demand side. The goal of this smdy is to investigate the impacts of applying road pricing on the demand side and its resulting consequences. One of these consequences that this study is interested in is the resulted vehicle emissions. Road pricing will be applied in this smdy as the strategy to influence the demand side to achieve different objectives. Each strategy will be analyzed and evaluated. To be able to predict the impacts of applydng the different pricing strategies on the demand side, an appropriate model (the simulation model) is needed. This model should be able to consider the behavioural responses of the road users to the applied road pricing strategies in a correct and realistic way. This study introduces a model capable of predicting the traffic simations in a dynamic way considering three important behavioural aspects of road users: route choice, departure time choice and trip making choice (elastic demand). The network travel demand will be differentiated into three different user classes with different behavioural responses to the applied toll charges. In this study, another model (the emissions model) will be also introduced to calculate the expected vehicle emissions that result from applying the different pricing strategies. This model is capable of calculating different vehicle emission substances, for different vehicle types, using different kinds of fuels and driving with different speeds. The different strategies will be applied using a case study representing a simplified road network of the city of Delft. This will be further called the study area. Applying road pricing in this study, resulted in reducing network travel demands, compared to the reference case, which resuhed in reduced network delays and vehicle emissions. Each user class reacts in a different way to the applied toU charges. For instance users with higher value of time (VOT) are more willing to pay the toll charges and traveling on the tolled roads to reduce their travel times, while user with lower VOT (work) are more willing to prevent paying the toll charges and use longer (slower) routes in order to escape paying the toll charges. The impacts of a specific pricing strategy on the demand side and the resulting consequences depend heavily on the objective behind applying this pricing strategy. For instance tolling the whole network during the whole modelled time periods reduced travel demands the most resulting in decreased delays and vehicle emissions the most, and generating the maximum amount of toll revenues among all other pricing strategies. The outcomes of this study shows that road pricing can be used as a policy investment to influence the demand side. The magnitude of this influence depends heavily on the objective of applying road pricing. The results obtained from this study can be used to explain how road pricing affects the demand side (travel behaviour). These results don't give an exact magnitude that can be applied on each road network. To get more exact magnitudes of the expected effects of applying road pricing in a specific road network it is recommended to use more detailed network and to calibrate the simulation model based on the given network characteristics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Patients with foot deformation, cartilage wear or a badly healed calcaneus fracture often suffer from severe pain in the foot. After fixation of the subtalar joint, which stabilizes motion, most patients can walk without pain again. Because the curtent operation is an open approach, it is difficult to reach the entire joint space and to remove all bone and cartilage. To improve the operation technique, a minimally invasive technique was developed. Because the joint is curved and the current shavers are straight, the instrument has to allow for this. To this end, a new instrument was developed: The Tuijthof flexible instrument. The Tuijthof flexible instrument has anisotropic stiffness. It is flexible in the bending direction and is stiff in lateral direction, so the surgeon can stir the instrument. Tissue is removed by a drill. The instrument is promising, but still too flexible. In bending direction the stiffness is 10 N/m, a value between 83 N/m and 167 N/m is desirable. In lateral direction the stiffness is 1.90-10^ N/m, it should be larger than 2.5-103 N/m. Also during tests, glued connections between the wires and rings broke loose. The goal of this master's thesis is to design a single-piece compliant mechanism and to optimize the dimensions of the shaft.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""
