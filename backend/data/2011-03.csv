(mentor)","2011","Introduction and problem definition The IJsselmeer is located in the center of the Netherlands. For its relevance for the Dutch economy and society, it is often addressed as the Wet Hearth of the country. When looking into the future, the IJsselmeer is under climate threats. Wetter winters will bring more water into the system, in combination with sea level rise, and lower gravity discharge to the Waddenzee. This will generate safety issues. On the other hand summers will be drier, putting the satisfaction of water demand in danger. Research approach and research question The goal of the research is to define for the IJsselmeer a dynamic target water level which is variable through the whole year by means of an optimization approach. The optimization uses a single objective function considering dikes safety and water demand. Such approach has been chosen because follows a different path than the ones mainly used so far to tackle the issue. When management measures alone are not enough to define a climate-proof IJsselmeer, extra measures are taken into consideration: a pumping station at the Afsluitdijk and early storage in March. The main research question asks for an evaluation of the optimization methodology used to define efficient alternatives for the IJsselmeer. The sub-question requires the assessment of the flexibility of the IJsselmeer towards a climate-proof system, and the definition of extra measures, when needed. Methodology The definition of the optimum measures is achieved in several steps. Firstly the objective of the problem owner is defined. The Dienst IJsselmeergebied is the only problem owner. Its interests are safety and water demand satisfaction. Then indicators are derived from the objectives, and merged into the objective function. Classes of measures are selected, and a model of the system designed for their evaluation. Finally the optimization problems are defined in order to design the optimum alternatives. Results A different planning of the target water level alone is not able to satisfy the needs of safety and water demand on the long term. As it is now, the IJsselmeer is flexible on the short term, but not enough to accommodate the impacts of longer horizons: extra measures are needed in order to define a climate proof system in 2050 and 2100. Pumping station at the Afsluitijk is an effective measure to guarantee safety for all the scenarios. Early storage in March is effective in the medium horizon (2050) but need high target water levels along the summer for the long term (2100). This might generate safety issues. Even if applied on a simplified case, the use of an optimization methodology manages to define a realistic picture of the flexibility of the IJsselmeer, and retrieves efficient options for possible future strategies. For this reasons, the present research can be considered a successful implementation of an optimization approach for the IJsselmeer. Conclusions and recommendations For the short term it is recommended to use the flexibility of the system, implementing the changes in summer target water levels which would allow deeper satisfaction of water demand. For the medium/long term, options for early storage need to be investigated together with the summer target water levels needed. This would probably require reinforcement of the dikes. Options for safety can be then defined for the new reinforced system, considering combinations of pumping station and raise of the dikes. A more extensive and detailed optimization tool should be realized for the IJsselmeer, and applied for the definition of the measures above. In particular it is recommended to use a multi-objective analysis and include costs in the definition of the indicators.","optimization; dynamic target water level","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

This interrupt system is designed and implemented in four mechanisms to match different application requirements in terms of the hardware consumption and performance issues (interrupt latency). On the other hand, due to the fact that the VEX compiler is not an open-source compiler, extra requirements to the assembler are also considered to make our work feasible. Our interrupt system itself can also be parameterized to fit different applications. These parameters include the number of interrupt vectors, interrupt priority of each vector and Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) location address in the instruction memory. The testing results show that each version of our interrupt system takes reasonable amount of hardware usage. We implemented our interrupt system on a virtex-6 FPGA. Besides, the interrupt latency can be reduced to only 2 clock cycles which is even better than some RISC-based softcore processors like Microblaze. This project creates a prototype of interrupt system that could work on VLIW softcore processor which extends the functionality and capability of the processor such as running operating systems and establishing a multi-core system.","VILW; Reconfigurable; Interrupt; FPGA; VEX","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor); Vollers, K.J. (mentor); Grünewald, S. (mentor)","2011","The construction of free form building stagnated, due to the high construction cost of it. Double curved surfaces are only applied at projects with a high profile and projects above average budget during years. The problem with double curved surfaces is mainly the formwork. The present days used techniques to construct these formworks are statically. For example: wooden, steel or milled EPS formwork could only be used for one shaped elements. The lack of repetition and so the reusability of the formwork, which means that for a free form surface for every element a unique formwork is needed, makes the construction very expensive. A feasible way for mass production of unique shaped double curved elements could be achieved by a flexible formwork: a formwork that can be adjusted in every desired shape. It consists of a flexible layer that can be deformed into the desired curved surface by adjusting for example pistons, actuators or pins. Recently K. Huyghe and A. Schoofs have executed a series of experiments with a flexible formwork, build earlier by D. Rietbergen and Dr. Ir. K. Vollers. The purpose of this master thesis was to solve more aspects of the flexible formwork, and to make it a feasibly system. The main focus was the behavior of the flexible layer, at some places the flexible layer did not though the actuators. Predicting the behavior of the deformed flexible layer makes an accurate production possible. To be able to determine the behavior of the flexible layer some models are proposed. With these models the reaction forces at the supports could be determined, compression forces means that the flexible layer though the supports. The first model that is proposed, is for a single curved element. For the double curved mould surface two models are proposed, a plate model and a strip model. With tests at the Stevin Laboratory these models are verified, and some other aspects are tested, for example the flexible border of the formwork. Tests indicate that a plate is not suitable for the flexible layer, it buckles due to the plate stresses. The strip mould consists of two layers of strips, perpendicular to each other. The top layer of the strips is the mould surface. Tests showed that it is possible to produce double curved elements with the strip mould. Conclusions and recommendations. The models that are proposed in this thesis describe the behavior of the flexible layer well. A plate does not fulfil the function of a flexible layer. Tests have shown that it is possible to produce double curved elements with the strip mould as flexible layer. To cover the strips an additional layer is needed. In these tests polyether is used, as well for the borders. The protection of the polyether with sealant made the concrete element very rough. Another material has to be found as elastic layer, or to protect the polyether.","flexible formwork; concrete; double curved; elements; precast; flexible layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Luitjens, L.H. (mentor); Verhaeghe, R.J. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor)","2011","The study is to give suggestions on future developments of the Eemshaven. The port locates on the north coastline of the Netherlands, opened in 1973 as an indutrial port. It is in the charge of Groningen Seaports in the municipality of Eemsmond. By rail, road and inland waterways, the port connects to the rest of the Netherlands, Germany and other west European countries directly or indirectly. Now most port activities happen in the west part, most of which are shipping and warehousing related. The east part will soon be occupied by four power plants, namely Energy Valley. The construction of Energy Valley is considered as the most important development in the coming five years. The port has been through a rough time. Many nice ideas failed for all kinds of reasons. The developments in the past show that the activities will not be successful in the Eemshaven unless certain scale is reached. The connections with local industries and the help of the governments make the activities more likely to be successful, while enterpreneurship is another important factor. Compared to the neighbor ports, the Eemshaven has very low throughput. Hinterland connections, port facilties and especially the relation with local industries are not as good as the neighbor ports. Porter’s Diamond Model shows the Northern Netherlands is not a competitive region, compared to the nearby areas. Many trational strong sectors are no longer dominant. That means the region cannot give many supports for local seaports. The positive factors of the Eemshaven include space and energy supply, competitive price, easy acess to gas pipelines and cables. Lack of hinterland support is a serious problem of the Eemshaven. Besides, underdeveloped labor market, living circumstances, limited logistics facilities and shipping routes, lack of comprehensive development approach are negative factors of the Eemshaven as well. The Wadden Sea protected area is always one of the concerns, which gives limitations of the potential activities in the Eemshaven. Two scenarios are set for different situations. The first scenario focuses on a future 5-10 years, no port expansion is expected. The suggestions are developing energy related industries and improve landside accessbitlies. The scenario foresees a big expansion of the port, in the coming 20-30 years. The industries more than energy are expected to form a cluster in the port area. Upgrading the scope onto a regional level, having integrated plans and measures to avoid port competitions are suggested in this scenario. Energy consuming industries, fuel related activities, environment protection, clean energy and their related industries are chosen for scenario 1. Food industries and oterh agriculture related industries, chemical industries, materials, recycling, energy related industries , shipping and warehousing are considered as the suitable sectors for the port industry cluster in the second scenario. Eleven experts give their comments on the study. Most of the experts react positively to the study. Half of them think scenario 1 is more likely to be the future for the Eemshaven, which would be done in 10 years without expansion. The others do believe the aggressive scenario may partly happen. According to the experts, the most promising sectors are renewable energy and bio-based industries. Recycling can be very interesting as well. Shipping activities are considered to be the most difficult one to develop. To set the renewable energy, bio-based indstries and other energy related industries as a main development line, and to look for other opportunites out of this line but may have very positive economic impacts is a further remark on the study, after the consultation of the experts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Scholten, V.E. (mentor); Schonewille, J.P. (mentor); Leonor, J. (mentor)","2011","The situation of two companies in a merger presents unique challenges to IT network integration, because both companies have an existing IT network. These networks might not be compatible and would need to be changed to be able to support the combined business process after the merger has taken place. Research on mergers and acquisitions has been mainly focused on organizational and cultural aspects and many mergers seem to fail to achieve their expected goals. Moreover, no systematic research has been performed into the role of IT networks in M&A. As modern companies seem to be dependent on their IT assets and IT networks, failure to integrate those assets could also contribute to M&A failures. The literature suggests that proper preparation of IT integration could decrease the chance of M&A failure. Therefore, the focus of this research is to determine how to support the preparation process of IT network integration in a merger. Therefore, the main research question is defined as: “How can companies prepare and manage the integration of IT networks in M&A to enable the combined business process and achieve the expected M&A goals?” A design approach is performed in this research to design a tool that supports network experts in the preparation process of network integration. The methods that have been used in this research include a literature review of the relevant subjects, namely mergers and acquisitions, IT networks, IT network integration, decision support systems and decision support tools. Gathering qualitative data for this research has been done through interviews with network experts. In total 14 interviews were conducted with experts from within and outside Accenture, spread over two rounds of interviews. The results of the literature study and the interviews will be used to design the support tool that satisfies the goal of this research. This thesis report covers information about what mergers and acquisitions are; what the IT networks of companies are; what is important for the integration of those networks; and how decision support systems and decision support tools can be used to design a tool that assists with IT network integration in M&A. This thesis also provides a process model that describes the steps for preparing network integration in M&A. Moreover, the decision making process that is the most important part of those steps is provided in decision trees. For each of the common problems in IT network integration, the decision tree helps the decision maker to evaluate the most important decision criteria and subsequently results in an appropriate integration strategy. The process model and the decision trees have been combined in a design: the Network Integration Support Tool (NIST). In conclusion, merging companies can prepare for the integration of their networks by following several steps as described in the process model. The first step begins with thoroughly analyzing the starting configuration of the networks. From this analysis, it will become clear which parts of those networks are in conflict and need to be combined into an integrated whole, defined in step two. The third step is to determine the integration strategy for each of those conflicts. Determining the integration strategy is supported by a model in the form of decision trees that provide insight in the decision making process. The final step is the creation of an integration plan that can be used to execute the IT network integration in M&A. The network expert can be assisted in these tasks, by using the Network Integration Support Tool.","mergers and acquisitions; IT network; integration; process model; decision tree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

The creation of this new technology lowers the recycling time, giving the T4T partners an opportunity to do new businesses with series of products made with recycled textiles. The T4T partners have decided to introduce these products in different markets starting with the workwear industry, since it is one of the T4T partner’s expertise. Groenendijk Bedrijfsschoenen en -Kleding B.V. has ten years of experience in the workwear industry, they have establish its own factory and have a personal concern in sustainable issues. Dealing with sustainable products offers a series of challenges that have been studied and documented in literature research. The lack of motivation, the mistrust in the sustainable claims, the green brand-wash and lack of sustainable knowledge are some of the judgments that the recycled workwear will need to overcome. It is indispensable to understand Groenendijk customer’s motivations, since it is this motivation what allows them to comply with their client’s requirements. Workwear customers have the priorities like pricing, integrated services, supplier trustworthiness and sustainability, when is affordable and have confirmation of claims. The sustainable intentions vary according to the company’s public image and their manager’s personal commitment with the environmental causes. In general, the sustainable textile market is saturated with different variations of products that have no tangible manifestation of its sustainable origin. To distinguish the product advantages in the eco-products it is necessary to have an extensive knowledge of the ecological impact of the textile processes. Hence, to provide the general customers a precise purchase incentive, it is required to communicate tangible advantages of the recycled workwear. With a new brand, the T4T project and Groenendijk would give their potential customers all the information necessary to understand, adopt, commercialize and buy recycled products. Furthermore, it also provides businesses and users with incentives that will generate brand awareness and loyalty, hoping that in the future everybody will develop a sustainable textile consciousness.","branding strategy; sustainability; recycling; textiles; B2B; market strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Integrated nano photonic systems have a number of unique advantages and can be beneficial in a wide range of sensors, like optical strain gauges, pressure sensors and temperature sensors. Optical data transfer systems are taking over from electrical systems because the power (heat) dissipation is practically zero and the theoretical clock speeds are many orders of magnitude higher. But there is a challenge. Coupling an optical chip to its surroundings is very challenging compared to an electrical chip. This complexity is mainly caused by alignment and accuracy demands and is driving the cost price up to levels at which the commercial benefits of optical chips are no longer obvious, despite their many important technological advantages. Up to 80% of an optical system?s cost price consists of packaging, in which the coupling of the fiber to the chip is done per fiber, one by one: this method is time consuming and needs to be repeated many times, especially in mass production. Furthermore, this process is complex because the alignment of the fiber to the chip is done active? (i.e. with the device in operation and using optical feedback to control the actuation towards an efficient final position) instead of passive? (i.e. based on pure mechanical alignment features). This thesis focuses on reducing the packaging costs by improving the design of the assembly and its passive (instead of active) alignment. A number of methods are formulated and executed to accurately glue fibers in V-shaped grooves: this fiber-in-V-groove is a key element in many packaging methods, including the newly proposed concepts by this thesis. The results are positive and encouraging to continue further development of the proposed concepts, to create new passive aligned packages that still meet the challenging performance requirements from TNO and are commercially competitive.","Nano; Photonics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Compared to alternative approaches, such as model predictive control, our approach has three major advantages: a stability proof, ease of implementation, and minimal modeling requirements. The latter is especially important for control of flexible kites, which are hard to model accurately in a point-mass or rigid-body framework. Kites commonly have a single control input available for steering. We show how the differential-geometric notion of turning angle can be used as a one-dimensional representation of the kite trajectory, and how this leads to a single-input single-output tracking problem. In order to facilitate model inversion we linearize the turning angle dynamics in the steering control input, and apply energy methods to derive a stabilizing feedback law. We show how the zero-term of the linearization can be measured directly using on-board sensors, and how in this way the control law comes to depend on the control derivatives of the aerodynamic kite model only. The controller adapts the estimates of these control derivatives based on tracking performance. Repeated simulations with a point-mass model show our control approach to be robust against turbulence, and simulations with a multi-body model of a flexible kite validate our modeling assumptions.","control; kite; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Schoormans, J.P.L. (mentor)","2011","Dassault Systèmes (“DS”) is a leading company focused on 3D design and Product Lifecycle Management (“PLM”) software. PLM is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product starting from its conceptual creation, through design and manufacture, to its service and disposal. PLM integrates people, data and processes with business systems and provides the product information backbone for companies and their extended enterprises. The solutions offered enable client companies to introduce innovative products of higher quality into the market in a time and cost efficient way. Although PLM software is very popular among large firms such as car manufacturers and airplane factories, DS aims at targeting smaller firms, especially product design offices, in order to increase the market share of its solutions. In a market where the competition is getting more aggressive each year, DS needs to elaborate a new strategy to render it better equipped against its competitors. DS is addressing 11 different industries worldwide. Since the company intends to cover the whole life cycle of products, it is important to consider all participants influenced by the offered PLM solutions, in order to enhance productivity. The small product design offices, which define the life cycle of products, are typically using PLM software programs that are neither complex nor efficient enough. 3D design is carried out by competitors’ mostly through lower scale and less complex software tools. The purpose of this project is to detect obstacles in utilization and to recommend the right course of actions to enable a better rate of acceptance for the PLM software. During the execution of the project, the marketing strategies and organization of DS and the content of the offered software solutions will be investigated in order to improve the acceptance and adoption of the PLM software solutions by small product design offices. The project will be elaborated from three different perspectives and will be based on market in the Benelux countries which is the problem owner’s area of responsibility. Below is the general outline with respect to the perspectives within the project: (i) The first perspective is the marketing strategy and product development policy of DS itself. The structure of the offered PLM Software and marketing related issues will be analyzed within the company. (ii) The second perspective is the situation of product design offices in the Benelux and their motives in choosing certain products and possible modifiers of their acceptance. It is known that the demand from these design offices depend very much on their role in and their relationships to a product design process. (iii) The third perspective is the value added resellers in Benelux which are the companies that sell existing software and add its own value by delivering services such as trainings, technical support, methodologies and customizations. The activity of these resellers in and their motivation towards the PLM system application will be the main concern. In the analysis of these three issues, the efficiency of communication and the flow of information between all these parties will be analyzed in order to understand whether the appropriate language is being used. The general objective of the project is to identify significant factors that have a major influence on the company’s commercial and technical activities. The project will start with a situation analysis to understand the market and its dynamics. The situation analysis will consist of (i) a market research (ii) a competitor research and (iii) an internal company research including the product portfolio and the business model. The second stage will be an extensive literature research on PLM software acceptance in the context of product design offices to understand and discover the influencing factors of acceptance. The next stage will investigate the design market in the Benelux countries. The number of offices active in the field, their domain of activity, and their involvement in different tasks of design processes will be analyzed. During this investigation a series of interviews will be conducted by focusing on the previously elaborated acceptance factors. Then, this information will be used to understand the dynamics of design processes, the needs of designers and their expectations towards comprehensive PLM solutions. The conclusions will be used to create a strategy to improve acceptance of DS’ PLM products in Benelux product design offices. This strategy will contain recommendations which may cover new product proposals, a new system, a way of understanding and a marketing strategy.","design; design offices; software; CAD; strategy; market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The first module supports the main implant function, while the second module is responsible for secure communication with the outside world. In this work we have implemented the latter module: we have designed a 5-stage-pipeline RISC, application specific processor along with its compiler and optimized them to efficiently support the IMD security workload. The processor has been synthesized for a 90nm CMOS ASIC technology. The comparison between the base-line processor and its optimized version resulted in the following improvements: 41.4% decrease in execution time, 11.8% increase in the executed instructions per cycle (IPC) and 37% decrease in energy consumption. These improvements came at the slight cost of 8% increase in power and 7% increase in area.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Project introduction ASICS Europe B.V. is a technology and innovation driven company that wants to consider the environment by enhancing environmental initiative. In addition, ASICS wants to expand their apparel business globally. As industrial designer you learn to create products, combining user insight, sustainability and technology to serve the consumer. Consequently this project evolved, a cooperation between ASICS and the Delft University of Technology emerged and the goal of the project was determined: “Design a human-powered, not encumbering, wearable, safe, eco-friendly, and inexpensive running LED-light as an innovative and commercially feasible new product for ASICS.” Analysis To understand the project goal the different aspects of the context were analysed. Firstly the function of the final product was determined to create visibility of the runner in the dark and so enhance the runner’s safety. Human-powered products showed to be very suitable in terms of the application of a portable running-light. Additionally human-powered products have many significant advantages concerning environmental issues. LED-light aspects were considered. LED’s have a significant long lifetime. Characteristics influencing the visibility of a LED are its brightness that depends on the LED’s viewing angle, the illumination of the surroundings and the sensitivity of the human eye. Red light is best visible for the human eye and requires the minimum energy. Consequently red LED lights are most significant in terms of the developed running light. Although you have to bear in mind the minimum forward voltage and maximum current.In addition the environmental aspects were analysed. ASICS recently implemented and is now operating conform the environmental ISO 14001 norms. Other sport companies are also developing and implementing eco-strategies. The majority of trail companies are members of Bluesign®, which advises companies on new environmental textiles and fabrics. In regard to the environmental friendliness of the final product, a long product lifetime is preferred. Eventually the environmental burden of current running light and the designed product can be compared by calculating the Eco-costs of both products. Since the energy is harvested from the running movement it is important to understand running. When running each leap raises the center of gravity during push-off and lowers it on stance phase as the knee bends to absorb the shock. According to research on movement, running is determined to have a gait cycle frequency of 1.5 Hz. The shock reduction is affected by changes in stride length and frequency and is especially sensitive to stride length changes. In regard to running, the safety of runners is important. In particular in the darkness, pedestrians including runners are more vulnerable and accidents are more likely to occur. The crucial aspect on behalf of the safety of a runner is detection. Increasing the conspiquity of runners in the dark makes a substantial difference and makes runners less vulnerable to accidents. Flickering light and increase of luminance raises conspicuity and are therefore important to incorporate in the running light. In order to power the LED-light with human-power an appropriate energy conversion technique needs to be selected. From the reviewed literature two conversion techniques were most significant; 1. The piezoelectric PVDF foil technique and 2. The electro-magnetic technique. Because of the high power densities and specific power outputs the literature illustrated, the piezo electric PVDF foil technique is very interesting. Only current pricing and complexness of the technique withholds its viability in terms of the running light application. Assumingly, this technique will be more interesting after 5 years from now, as prices will decrease and the technique will be developed further. However, the electromagnetic technique also proved to have a relatively high power density and specific power, to be inexpensive, uncomplicated and proved to unobtrusively generate enough power to illuminate a LED form human vibration. Concluding, the literature showed the most relevant conversion technique in terms of this project is the oscillatory electromagnetic conversion technique developed by Saha et al. Consequently this technique is selected to further evaluate its preferred application. In order to verify the possibilities of the electromagnetic technique, first the method of A. Jansen (2011) was applied. The method provides first insights in the feasibility and efficiency of the human-powered electric system and determines the added value of the human- powered product. Concluding from the feasibility study the human-powered electromagnetic system would be able to power two red LED’s with a duty cycle of approximately 7%. To gain insights in the behaviour of the selected linear inertial electromagnetic generator of Saha et al., the system was modelled in MATLAB. The MATLAB model illustrating the systems behaviour is represented by its transfer function. After understanding the systems behaviour MATLAB Simulink models illustrated the possible applications of the system. Both sinusoidal and impulse excitation on wrist and chest were modelled. The results illustrated that the wrist impulse excitation produced the optimum energy outputs. Consequently this application was selected and a physical model was made to proof the illumination of two LED’s by using the human motion of running. Concept phase After selecting the right human-powered energy system, ideas on the running LED-light were generated in cooperation with ASICS. The ideas were evaluated by means of the preset list of requirements. The most interesting ideas were developed into three concepts; Eco-light, Clickin and the A-Led. Both the Clickin and A-Led were commercially attractive for ASICS since they included a docking station, which could be patented. The light could only function when the ASICS docking station is present. However the Eco-light has a larger viewing angle and consequently creates more visibility so safety. In addition the Eco-lights is superior, concerning all other preset requirement of the product. The Eco-light is comfortable and can be worn on other running bands. Together with ASICS the Eco-light was selected to be developed further. Optimization The Eco-light was optimized by reducing the size and the material of the design. Material and assembling processes were reconsidered. In terms of the branding an in-mold label was chosen. Besides a reflective band is incorporated in the final design. When the selected Eco-light was optimized a user test was conducted by means of the physical model. Deriving from the user test, the physical model proved to be sufficient in terms of this project. Yet, they experienced the Eco-light as comfortable. While running two of four participants experienced a ticking sound. However the conducted user test is not completely representative, since only four participants conducted the test. The produced sound could be reduced in several ways; the effect on the generated power should be examined. In the designed folder, ASICS can provide the consumer with user instructions and the main advantages of the Eco-light. The possibilities of storing the energy comprise a more complex electronic circuit ,resulting in more energy dissipation and higher costs. Therefore the desire of storing the energy should be reconsidered. Including the suggested packaging, the production costs will be less then 5,- when the produced amount is more then 12500 pieces. There are two interesting disposal options of the Eco-light which ASICS could consider and elaborate further; dismantling the product manually by ASICS and outsource the recycling or dispose them by the regular take-back system and consider the machine dismantling scenarios. Eventually the Eco-light will burden the environment anyway. However compared to ASICS current running light, the Eco-light is significantly more environmental friendly. EvaluationFinally the Eco-light was evaluated and proved to be an human powered Eco-light that is a comfortable, eco-friendly and commercially attractive, unique and innovative running light for ASICS. Conclusions ASICS as an Innovation and technology driven company wants to collaborate with the Delft University of Technology in order to design a human-powered running LED-light. Firstly the relevant topics concerning a human-powered running LED-light are studied, including a literature review of the different conversion techniques, that can convert the human energy to electrical energy. The electromagnetic conversion technique was chosen to be most significant in terms of this project. The selected system designed by Saha et al. was analysed and optimized by means of MATLAB and MATLAB Simulink modelling and simulations. Resulting in the system characteristics of the electromagnetic system enabling to proof the working of the generator by a physical model. After determining the human-powered electronic system creative sessions were held from which three concepts derived. In collaboration with ASICS one concept was chosen, evaluated and further optimized. Resulting in the final design; the Eco-light, a human -powered innovative, unique, commercially attractive,comfortable and eco-friendly running light. Recommendation Lastly recommendations are presented concerning the final Eco-light, ASICS Europe B.V. and to the Delft University of Technology. In terms of the Eco-light ASICS should further examine and measure the visibility and average illumination of the Eco-light,conduct a more profound user research to support the examined user test. Additionally ASICS should consider patenting, other applications or functions and costs. As well as conducting an Eco-costs/Value ratio assessment and examine the environmental promotion and strategy of the Eco-light within ASICS portfolio. In terms of ASICS Prospects, ASICS should consider investing in researching the promising PVDF foil technique and e-textiles. ASICS should consider cooperating with the Delft University of Technology.Consequently, the Delft University of Technology should consider cooperating with ASICS and enhancing sports in their education program. The Delft University of Technology should consider making sports and measurement material available for students,promote the electronic supporting department DEMO, and enhance A. Jansen’s method in its education program.","human-power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-03-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2011","IHC-Systems develops automation systems for dredgers. They assume the automation systems on board of trailing suction hopper dredgers are not always employed. Trailer suction hopper dredgers are a specific type of dredgers. Several automation systems can assist the operators for dredging. Some ships have dedicated operators and on other ships operation is done by the 1st mate, in combination with the navigation. The research question is: (1) Why are the automation systems on trailer suction hopper dredgers not always used. And (2) in what way this can be improved. The research consists of observations and of interviews with crew members on several trailing suction hopper dredgers, and with company staff. Also similar studies on the use of automation systems, found in literature, are consulted for the analysis. The factors that can influence the use of automation are sorted and their interrelations visualised. The main factors then are nominated. The major factor is addressed as the design goal for the concept generation. The assumption that the automation systems are not always used, is firstly confirmed. The identified reasons why operators do not use the automation systems, are: Lack of confidence, boredom, situation of dredging, annoyance, complexity of the system and the experience that the utilization does not form part of the routine. These reasons are the result of several influencing factors, that belong to one of three domains: a, the automation system, or b, the user, or c, the context. Such factors are: a lack of knowledge or awareness, bad experiences, risks, workload, type of project, signals from the system, implementation on the ships, and training. To improve the use of the automation systems, a design goal is formulated. Central in the concept is to increase the awareness of the operator on the automation systems. Knowledge is enhanced by adapting the signals from the workstation. This will give the operators a better awareness of the process and the process risks. The other part in the concept is to give the operators more control on the system and a safer feeling. This is achieved by giving more information about the automation system and providing this information structured intuitively. The feeling of control and safety will increase the operators trust in the automation system. He will be more confident to use the automation system and the use will become part of his routine. First solutions for separate aspects of the problem are generated. Integration, with a morphological map, of these ideas result in total solutions. The solutions are developed into several concepts. These are compared with the Harris profile method. And the selected design is combined with the best elements from the rejected concepts. The resulting improved concept is applied to one of the automation systems; the visor automation. The application is developed in cooperation with users. In an early stage the opinion of the operators on the concept realisation are solicited. The study revealed the kind of information they value for the visor automation. Later the users are involved for user testing. The resulting concept consists of adaptations to the interface screen and of added signals on the dredging console. Operators can select, on touchscreen, and view more easy the information about the automation system. The information is presented in pop-ups. Set-points can be changed, and warnings set. A green colour on the screen and a green light on the console, signals which automation system is active. The automation relieves the operator from routines, and enables to combine with other activities, such as doing paperwork, while monitoring the systems. Final user tests demonstrated enthusiasm by the operators towards the concept. Operators indicated that the concept would give them more control. They would also feel safe using the automation system. Also the usability testing proved that the new interface can be used without training, it is intuitive design. The concept can be taken further into application on the other automation systems. And further lines for improvements are proposed.","interface design; trust; dredgers; use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Keuning, J.A. (mentor); Van den Boomgaard, M.G.J. (mentor)","2011","This project focuses on studying and modelling the flow in the sailing area of the 2012 Olympic Sailing Competition, located partly in Portland Harbour and partly in Weymouth Bay, in order to provide accurate and reliable current forecasts for the Dutch Olympic Sailing Team. From literature it follows that the main flow in the area is the tidal flow. Wind- and wave-induced currents may have a significant influence on the flow as well. Since the available current data is considered outdated, sailed current measurements have been performed to obtain reliable current data. To provide for current forecasts, the two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical flow model FINEL2D, which has the finite element method (FEM) as numerical basis, has been used. FINEL2D adopts the discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the shallow water equations, complemented by a Riemann solver according to Roe to account for the fluxes trough the element boundaries. The TPXO model has been used to enforce boundary conditions on the model. A Nikuradse roughness of 0.035 m has led to model results which deviate least from the measured current. To overcome the phase shift that is still visible, the roughness around Portland Bill and the Shambles Bank has been increased to 0.25 m. By investigating the influence of wind and waves on the flow, it appeared that the wave-induced current in the area of interest is negligible. Wind does however have a significant influence on the flow. Since it is difficult to obtain accurate and reliable wind predictions, accounting for the wind in the current forecasts is difficult. In conclusion it can be stated that the flow in the sailing area of the 2012 Olympic Sailing Competition can be modelled well by means of the two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical flow model FINEL2D. The model results correspond well to the during the survey measured flow velocities and flow directions.","flow; numeric; sailing; current measurements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, J.D. (mentor); Schokker, R.P.H.M. (mentor)","2011","This report presents the investigation of the 3M pocket projector and a suiting advice for the Benelux market. The advice consists of a short and long term advice. Additionally, an advice for the context research applied by 3M is given, based on a comparative case study of two approaches. The latest pocket projector of 3M is the MP160: a small pass-through projector which easily connects to a laptop, smartphone or video device. With an illumination of 30 lumen, regular projector has at least 500 lumen, the brightness is lower due to its size. The advised retail price of the MP160 is  315. The knowledge of 3M in the filtering of light has nurtured the opportunity for developing a pocket projector. The engine of the projector is designed by 3M, all other parts are outsourced, but the projector is branded for 3M. The competition in the product category is tremendous: many brands familiar in the projector industry are entering different pocket projectors in the market. Traditional projectors, large flatscreens, laptops and also tablet PC’s are other indirect competitors, largely seen in the context where the pocket projector could be used. Altogether, competition is though, based on the standard used products and the busy pocket projector market. The market for the small projectors is forecasted to be large: for the coming years a tremendous growth in sales is expected which explains the heavy competition. Still, the sales of the pocket projectors remain low. The target markets for the pocket projector are divided in two segments: the business and the entertainment segment. The business segment is divided in two groups; the tech-savvy business professionals who embrace technology and the young professionals who probably use the pocket projector for entertainment too. The entertainment segment is also divided in two groups: the social impulse buyer and the social entertainment fanatic who loves to share information. The business and entertainment segment are the focus areas for the context research. The purpose of the context research, also referred as the Voice of the Customer within 3M, is to learn how the MP160 fits in the context of the business professional and the social entertainment fanatic. Interviews with both segments were translated into a map consisting of the most important, either positive or negative, elements concerning the pocket projector proposed by the participants. The mapping of the entertainment segment showed that the price for the pocket projector was too high to purchase. The price is not elastic for 3M, the margins are already low, and therefore targeting this segment is less interesting. The results of the mapping for the business segment contained values which do not correspond with the initial value proposition of the pocket projector: the proposition is revised. Compact, ease of use, two hours battery life, and design are the values which have been proved to be the most important and positive elements. The context research showed a higher potential in the business segment and the added value in their context is recognized, although the brightness still desirably needs to improve. Next to this potential, 3M is a business to business organization with more experience in this segment, making it more attractive for 3M to target at the business context. Hence, targeting a new market, like the entertainment segment, will need many resources for effectiveness. It is expected, since the core business for 3M is supplying business to business material that the engine of the pocket projector is going to be the core strategy. Selling the engine to other businesses, for example to Dell as an integrated part of a computer, is an attractive and potentially profitable choice. The pocket projector models have a short product life cycle and improvement of the technology is constantly taking place. There will be a point that the brightness of the engine in the pocket projector is satisfying for integration in other products. Though, it is difficult to determine when this point is reached. Besides, it is probable that the deals with other business will not occur in the Benelux, but internationally. Until this point, 3M Benelux is advised to benefit from the innovative and gadget image the pocket projector elicits and moreover reaches a breakeven point of the invested budget. Therefore three scenarios are proposed which derived from the gathering of internal knowledge at 3M and the context research which was conducted. The first two scenarios are based on a short term advice to benefit from the innovative image. The first scenario to take in action is the revision of the value proposition. The values of the proposition should be translate into promotional material, furthermore these values have to be an integral part of the strategy used by the sales representatives. Subsequently the existing distribution channels of the pocket projector need to be updated and it is advised to set up a selected set of new channels. The second scenario is based on making use of the attraction the pocket projector elicits and use this strength for attention in promotional material for the 3M Benelux organization. For this marketing tool promotional material needs to be centralized in order to let all departments profit from the innovative pocket projector image. Developing material is costly, using a small part of the budget from all departments diffuses the costs for the division of the projector itself and can stimulate or trigger other divisions to use the pocket projector for promotional activities. A low threshold feedback system for potential buyers, which can originate from the promotional activities, should be designed to follow up the leads. This ensures that the department can maintain the emphasis on its own business. The final scenario is more costly and therefore advised for the longer term when the first two scenarios have proven to be successful. 3M colleagues are approached to select a person who fits the tech savvy business professional and thus fits to the pocket projector. These people are selected and receive a pocket projector at their office. They are freely allowed to use the product and in exchange they are asked to give feedback and share their experiences on for example a website. A representative follows up the feedback and possibly the interest has grown for the company and the word of mouth has proved to be positive. The pocket projectors are quickly improving and therefore it is advised to use this seeding scenario when brightness is increased (important aspect for the buying decision). To finalize, the third advice for 3M concerns the process of the context research. 3M uses an approach based on Six Sigma, a business management strategy, called the Voice of the Customer. This approach is compared to another approach used at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering (IDE). It was assumed that the IDE approach would result in more valuable data, compared to the 3M approach. Eventually this could not be proven in the case study. Still, the Voice of the Customer framework is an extensive approach which is normally used for the development of new products. In the case of the pocket projector, where the context research was desired as well, the approach needs to be less intensive for the commercialization phase. Therefore the report ends with an advice for the adoption of a fast VOC.","strategic; advice; pocket projector; 3M","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-03-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, H. (mentor)","2011","Every company, successful or not, starts with one bright idea in an entrepreneurial mind. Through actions of the entrepreneur – let’s call these actions design - this initial idea transforms into a firm that did not exist before. Because the Delft University of Technology wants to improve its support to technology-based entrepreneurs, the aim of this Master thesis is to create a better understanding of how entrepreneurs design a new technology venture through answering the following main research question: How does the design of a new technology venture evolve until the firm reaches maturity? In order to discover how technology entrepreneurs design their new venture, an empirical approach was chosen that aims to develop a tentative theory about the evolution of the start-up’s design during the new technology venture creation process based on experiences in the field: the grounded theory method of Glaser and Strauss (1967; Glaser 1992). It is concluded that the new technology venture creation process consists of three main stages: 1) the exploration stage in which the entrepreneur discovers business opportunities and verifies the potential of these opportunities, 2) the realisation stage, in which the entrepreneur develops both the market and the value proposition and acquires all the required resources and capabilities for creating, manufacturing and offering the envisioned value proposition to the target market, and 3) the exploitation stage in which the new firm engages in exchanges with the created market in order to create true value from all prior efforts. Furthermore, it was found that throughout these stages the entrepreneur is creating an integrated business model, consisting of three main components: 1) the value proposition, 2) the target market, and 3) the competencies that enable the new firm to perform its business activities properly. This business model is not created in a linear fashion, as it is also found that entrepreneurs learn through reflection on their performed actions. This means that the entrepreneur iterates between the exploration, realisation and exploitation stage until the initial business hypotheses have been sufficiently verified, resulting in a well-functioning business model. This entire process in not happening in isolation. The entrepreneur should always be attentive to developments in the micro and macro environment, which enable or obstruct the functioning of the business model. Based on an integration of these insights, it is concluded that, firstly, the new technology venture creation process can be described as the survival of the fitting: to ensure its survival, the business model of the new technology firm should demonstrate a good fit between the firm’s solution and the problem in the market that this solution intends to solve. Secondly, the process of creating this problem-solution fit can be described as the co-evolution of problem (the market needs) and solution (the value proposition and required competencies). At the start of the new venture creation process, both the problem and solution are indeterminate. More information needs to be gathered to define what the needs in the market are and how the entrepreneur can satisfy them. Through iterative cycles, the problem-solution pair becomes gradually fixed, until the new product can be launched onto the market and the new venture can start exploiting the discovered business opportunity. During this new venture creation process the nature of the process changes. Where the exploration and realisation stages are focused on creating a good problem-solution fit through co-evolution of the problem and solution, the exploitation stage is aimed at maintaining and optimising this fit through rational problem solving. Finally, the entrepreneur who executes the new venture creation process has a large influence on the outcomes of this process. As the new venture creation process is not a linear process that flows from the problem to the solution, it depends on the artistry of the entrepreneur which actions are taken when in order to tackle the new venture design problem. These findings have several implications for the theory and practice of technology-based entrepreneurship. Technology-based entrepreneurs: As the creation of a new technology venture is in essence a design problem, technology-based entrepreneurs should learn from the approaches designers use to solve wicked problems: next to developing a technological product, entrepreneurs must actively frame the need in the market. An effective strategy to develop the product and gain insight in what the market needs, is through co-creation with prominent stakeholders in the targeted market. TU Delft: The results of this study indicate that the artistry of the entrepreneur by which the new venture creation problem is tackled, can be fostered by the accumulation of experience. The TU Delft should support this accumulation of experience through simulation games in which students encounter the real challenges of new venture creation.

It is developed as a hydrostatic free-surface flow model, which is currently being used by the KNMI and Rijkswaterstaat for predictions of water levels in the North Sea and Dutch estuaries. TRIWAQ has successfully been extended to the realm of nonhydrostatic modeling, TRIWAQ-NH, this allows the use of full Navier-Stokes equations. It has been validated to perform well for multiple processes such as dispersion and propagation. The goal is to assess the ability of TRIWAQ-NH for harbour problems. This has not been attemptedbefore and poses a new challenge. Before an attempt is made to simulate a harbour, methods of imposing reflection are tested. For that matter, the thesis is split in two parts. The current use of the model TRIWAQ-NH holds practical restrictions to the implementation of open boundary conditions. When such a definition spawns a length of more than grid cell, it needs to comply with the edges of the grid. For instance, a boundary under the angle of 77 degrees is only possible by creation of a multitude of smaller open boundaries, leading to human error. The thesis results in two recommendations. The first part covered reflections, from that segment of the thesis, it is recommended to further explore the option of a stronger and smaller grid sized sponge layer with either an open or closed boundary condition for future development as method for partial reflections. The second recommendation is of a more practical nature and does not emerge in the work. However, the current tools available for non-hydrostatic modelling are insufficient. The smaller wave lengths require smaller time frames then the current tools provide, which is in the order of hours, days and months.","non-hydrostatic; simulations; free-surface gravity waves; boundary conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Lemstra, W. (mentor); Tan, Y. (mentor)","2011","The research carried out had the objective to find additional means of income for the Hague Justice Portal (HJP), a website owned by the Hague Academic Coalition (HAC) which is composed of eight different members. The increasing dissatisfaction felt at the HAC (members) and the municipality of The Hague regarding the HJP’s failure to find other means of income, besides the funding from its members and the municipality, was the stimulus for this research. Several issues surround this objective with the main factors being the following; the HAC members have the feeling that the HJP adds little value to their organization, thus they provide little support. This leads to a level of inactivity resulting in the HJP having a static business model, resulting in no success of finding additional means of income. Furthermore the current subsidy to the HAC stops by the end of 2011 and how or if it is continued remains unknown. The HAC members are not the only stakeholders for finding additional means of income, the total network of content suppliers, funding agencies, visitors, technology providers and advertisers need to be considered to achieve this objective. For this reason the following research question has been raised and answered: How can a business model for the Hague Justice Portal be designed which fits and meets the constraints and objectives, and is feasible? After carrying out the stakeholders-, external business- and visitor analysis it followed that advertisers are most eligible to meet the goal of finding additional income. Visitors are unlikely to be a source of income since the majority are either still studying, doing an internship or just started a job and thus have little budget to spend. More so since the most popular services for this user group are the vacancies and event calendar, which can also be found elsewhere for free, although some aggregating needs to be done. Visitors have shown to be interested in certain parts of the HJP, and not use the HJP as a total product which greatly reduces chances of making them pay. Public organizations need to lower their expenditure, thus also for subsidizing organizations, and rather focus on cooperation. By understanding the limitations surrounding HJP, it became possible to develop design options with the intention to find income but also to enhance the HJP, acting as a catalyst for the income generating design options. A clear distinction could be seen between the design options requiring or benefiting from a new Content Management System (CMS) and those who didn’t. For many of the HJP improvement design options, not only the HAC (members) would benefit, on the contrary, those benefiting the most are the other stakeholders. This on itself is no problem once accepted that the HJP is there for the visitors who may also be the HAC (members) itself. Instead of pushing the HJP onto the market the demand from the various (paying) stakeholders should be central. The distinction between the design options led to the development of three scenarios; 1) keep the current CMS and do little with advertisements, 2) keep the current CMS and maximize advertisement income and 3) get a new CMS and realign the business and IT in order to achieve the objective of generating additional income. Scenario 1 will result in support dropping of visitor numbers within 1 to 2 years and possibly lead to the closure of the HJP. Scenario 2 (estimated yearly costs 108.750,-) tries to maximize advertisement income (estimated 15.000,-) by catering to advertiser demands but also by doing so for the visitors, the HAC (members) and the HJP. Although income generation will be likely, this will be depended on the amount of action undertaken by the HJP and HAC (members). Scenario 3 (estimated yearly and investments costs 100.150,- and 33.000,-) is the most desirable state since for the HJP when decided upon can last for several years and tackle many of the issues found and should lead to additional income (estimated 27.500,-) and added value for the HAC (members). Discontinuing the HJP will result in a tremendous drop in expenditure for the HAC, several pleased HAC members as they will no longer be required to fund the HJP and support for the HAC from the municipality of The Hague will go down. If the HJP wants to generate more income, the HJP, its editors, the HAC and its members will need, to adjust the mainly academic focus and also include a more commercial one. It is unlikely that HAC (members) would like to commit themselves of taking the step towards scenario 3 at once, considering the uncertainty of income being generated, them receiving added value, the commencement of the new Institute of Global Justice and the continuation of the subsidy from the municipality of The Hague. Instead a process is recommend by implementing the recommendations of scenario 2, and together with more clarity of the uncertainties and risks, use the outcome of this process as input for a ‘go / no go’ decision moment. Knowledge gathered prior to this moment could be used as input for a new HJP once a decision has been made. Other options besides continuing with scenario 3 are to continue in a ‘lighter’ version requiring less budget, cooperate with the IGJ or to stop.","business model; web portal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructures, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor); Visser, J.M.A. (mentor)","2011","Since in the finger most muscle-tendons cross multiple joints, moment arms (MA’s) of these muscle-tendons have a major influence on the distribution of joint moments over these joints. This is crucial for finger balance and therefore finger functioning. Recent developments in the technique of ultrasonic measurements have made it possible to accurately measure tendon displacements over a large range of motion in-vivo. The change in tendon displacement divided by the change in corresponding joint angle (dl/d?) was used to estimate joint angle dependent MA’s (MAest) of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) tendon at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the long finger. In addition, MA’s were obtained from the joint geometry for each individual subject (MAgeo). Two sessions of 3 repetitions of active flexion-extension motion of the long finger were conducted by each of the five subjects enrolled in this study. The intra subject repeatability between the two sessions at 0 degrees of flexion for the FDS and EDC tendon was good (ICC > 0.95, p = 0.004 and 0.101 respectively) but rather weak for the FDP (ICC = 0.630, p = 0.157). The obtained MAest values were underestimated in comparison to the MAgeo values. Thus, this method proved to be promising, but should be further validated and developed to yield sufficiently reliable results. Once fully developed, the in-vivo estimation of MA’s can be used to determine the subject specific muscle MA balances around the finger joints. These MA balances can be an important parameter for a musculoskeletal finger model. In addition, it can be a generic measure for finger pathologies where finger balance is disturbed.","ultrasound; moment arms; musculoskeletal; finger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BM","",""

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.J.M. (mentor); Dijkstra, J.W. (mentor)","2011","Prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) are used to accelerate drainage and consolidation of soft sediment. An effective functioning of these PVD depends on its capacity to drain water from the subsurface. Among other causes, the clogging of filter jackets is thought to be of a considerable negative influence on the functioning of PVD. Current regulations prescribe a minimum ratio between the filters aperture size and the grain size distribution of the soil to prevent this clogging. Objective: The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of filter clogging on the performance of PVD filter jackets, with regards to the soft soil conditions that are encountered in large parts of the Netherlands. Method: A literature review is performed on the principle of vertical drainage, soil types, filter types, clogging criteria, processes and testing methods. An experimental program was undertaken in the laboratory in which filter jackets were exposed to two different clogging phenomena, i.e. particle clogging and chemical clogging. Also filters from the field were evaluated. All filters were evaluated on their loss of permittivity with constant head measurements on filter pieces of three different filter types, the D165 and HS5417 from the Typar line of DuPont and the 30195 of Freudenberg. Particle clogging was evaluated by two different setups, the Oedometer and a long term filtration setup. Within the Oedometer tests the load and the moisture content of the clay sample varied. Chemical testing was done briefly, to see till what extend iron precipitation could induce filter clogging and if one filter would be more prone to clog than the other. Results: The permittivity tests on the filter pieces showed reproducible results. Repeated measurements on the same sample showed an average standard deviation of not larger than four percent of the samples mean. The initial permittivity also corresponded reasonable with the values provided by the filter manufacturers. With particle clogging, it was seldom observed that clogging ratios were higher than five. Relations between clogging and the applied load on the clay sample could not be found. Increasing moisture content showed a slightly higher clogging ratio. Another clogging indicator was found from work by Aydilek, initial permittivity. This is believed to be a better estimator; higher initial permittivity in general gave lower clogging ratios. In the chemical experiment it was observed that on the filter of Freudenberg large amounts of iron oxide precipitated. During filtration the filter seemed fully clogged. Permittivity tests on this filter showed an approximately four times larger clogging ratio, than that of the other ones. Conclusions: Based on literature and observations from both experiments and field data, it can be concluded that the permittivity reduction of filter jackets is always less than a factor of ten. Hence filter clogging is not a real issue, since the permeability of the soft sediments is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the clogged filters. Hence, the system permeability is mainly determined by the soil behavior.","geosynthetics; particle clogging; chemical clogging; ground improvement; prefabricated vertical drains; filter jackets; nonwoven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-22","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hicks, M.A. (mentor); Barends, F.B.J. (mentor); Sellmeijer, J.B. (mentor); Van Beek, V.M. (mentor); Kanning, W. (mentor)","2011","One of the failure mechanisms of a dike is piping. A water level difference between the two sides of a dike causes a groundwater flow in the sand layer under the (clay)dike. This flow can transport sand from under the dike to the exit point of the groundwater flow. The formula of Sellmeijer is derived mathematically from the equation of continuity, Poiseuille flow in the slit and equilibrium of grains on the bed of the channel, modeled with the equation of White. The influence of D70 on the critical gradient is linear in the Sellmeijer formula. However, coarse-grained sands are generally more permeable than fine-grained sands, which generally results in a net influence of the grain size on the critical gradient to be less than linear, but still positive. De Wit did experimental research and found that coarse grained sands have a higher critical gradient than fine grained sands. In the framework of Strength and Solicitation Flood Defences (SBW), experiments with piping were performed. It was found the influence of D70 on the critical gradient is less than is predicted with the Sellmeijer model. 1. Problem definition and objective of the research The objective of this thesis is to research the influence of the grain size and other sand characteristics on the critical head of piping, and to find an explanation for the difference found between SBW results and the Sellmeijer formula. Besides the mean objective of this thesis, a theoretical research to the velocity in the channel according to the current Sellmeijer model has been done. 2. Approach and results of the study of variables A study is performed to variables which are considered to have influence on the critical gradient. A multi variate analysis (MVA) has been performed successfully on SBW. The influence of the D70 is less than is predicted with the Sellmeijer formula. For fine sands, the Sellmeijer formula agreed quite well with the experiments, for coarse sands, it gives an unsafe prediction. Based on the MVA on SBW, an adapted Sellmeijer formula was formulated by Sellmeijer (Sellmeijer 2010a). The MVA was also tried on the dataset of de Wit, but was not successful. The data of de Wit was inserted in the adapted Sellmeijer formula. The outcome did not agree, this may be because the data of de Wit was possibly not corrected for the filter resistance, or because the range of variables in the de Wit dataset is different than the range of variables in the dataset of SBW. 3. Approach and results of research to the erosion mechanism In the Sellmeijer model, the equilibrium of grains is according to the model of White, which assumes individual grain erosion. It is researched if this is correct. A test facility was built to research the erosion process experimentally. It was found the grains are dislodged from the granular matrix as mass erosion, with a layer thickness of roughly 7 grains. The transport of sand in the test facility occurs in the pipe in mass transport, in waves, called slurry flow. It is not sure that the observed erosion of the grains from the sand matrix is normative for determining the critical gradient, as the observed erosion may be the erosion type that is present when the critical gradient has already been exceeded. This is still under discussion. The implication of the found dislodging mechanism is that the Sellmeijer formula may possibly describe the dislodging of grains and the piping process in an improper way, however more research is needed to validate if the observed erosion process is normative for determining the critical gradient.","piping; grain size; critical gradient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering + Geotechnology","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Introduction Daily approximately 150.000 individual travel movements are conducted by passengers and Schiphol-workers to and from Schiphol. For this they use cars, taxis, busses, shut-tles, trains, motorcycles, scooters and bicycles. As such Schiphol is Holland’s biggest mobility node. Understandably this makes accessibility of vital importance. Within Schiphol the Traffic & Transportation (T&T) department has the responsibility for the accessibility of Schiphol. Separated in several modalities (public trans-port/taxi/private transport/roads) the goal is to improve the accessibility for Schiphol’s customers (passengers/personnel/business partners/cargo). T&T has the ambition to become “Europe´s most accessible multimodal hub”. To achieve this the performance on the quality of accessibility will have to increase while facing an increased passenger volume and tougher constraints. Therefore increased insight in the performance of the accessibility operation is required. In short: the rele-vant performance delivered by T&T on airport accessibility has to be measured. Design tracks The objectives of this thesis is to (1) Design a method that can measure T&T´s perform-ance and (2) Create a system that uses the designed method to report on the perform-ance. To achieve these two objectives, two design tracks are undertaken Design Track I The first step is defining what is considered relevant performance for T&T. Through research and interviews, relevant performance is regarded as the quality of accessibility delivered to the client. This can be measured by the amount in which the demands of a client group on the quality of accessibility are met by the characteristics of a modality. To be able to measure the regarded performance, the offered accessibility is analysed. It is found that T&T can influence the quality characteristics of each modality based on the relation with the stakeholder that operates the modality. There are three levels of influ-ence: Control, Guide and Influence. To get more insight in the accessibility demand of the different client groups (Passen-gers and Schiphol workers) an experiment is conducted. This experiment indicates a different demand profile on accessibility between the client groups, especially towards price and information. A combination of literature on measuring accessibility and internal Schiphol documents is used to declare factors and criteria that determine the quality perception of the client on accessibility. Six factors (cost, time, reliability, quality, convenience and information) and 34 underlying quality criteria are declared. To measure these criteria there is a need for data points and sources that report on these criteria. A table of needed data points, sources and expected unities is created. As it is found that the unities of the data points differ greatly and it is unknown what levels of performance are considered adequate, a measuring method is proposed that states the increase or decline of performance on the criteria. This is done through indi-ces that are calculated by comparing performance on two different moments in time. The declaration of 7 formulates enables the design of a measurement method that puts weights on the calculated indices. These weights are based on the found demand pro-files. The criteria that are considered most important in the accessibility perception of a certain client group, are given a higher weight, resulting in a bigger influence on the overall index on airport accessibility. Combining all criteria, factors and weights on the different modalities and client groups with the seven formulas, gives the possibility to create an overall index on the delivered quality of accessibility of an airport. Design Track II As less than 40% of the needed data sources is available, it is not possible to implement the developed method in a Performance Measurement System (PMS). Therefore an alternative system is created. Based on an analysis of available data sources, supportive systems and existing KPI, a PMS System is developed. This system is based on Excel and can present indicators on a monthly basis. The PMS shows a comparison with the pre-ceding month and the same month one year ago. To enhance the insightfulness, coloured arrows are used to show high, medium of no decrease/increase between the periods. Also a graph is presented in the same fashion graphs are currently presented, for each indicator. Indicators are coupled for each mo-dality. This gives modality managers the possibility to quickly look for the most relevant indicators. As the developed PMS is not able to indicate the client perception of the current quality od accessibility, a second system is created. This system uses public messages on online social media (mostly twitter) to measure the sentiment on the accessibility quality of-fered on train, bus and taxis servicing Schiphol. The system is able to present the amount of positive, neutral and negative messages on a modality. This enables manag-ers to react on incidents and to see the change in perception over a longer period of time. Conclusion A first draft design of a method to measure the quality of airport accessibility is created. Implementation is not possible to a shortage on data sources. It therefore proposed to start developing the needed data points. If more than 60% of the needed data is avail-able, the designed measurement method can be implemented. It is advised to use the available Qlikview Business Intelligent system for an improved PMS. Furthermore both design steps are first ventures into creating a system to measure per-formance at T&T. Due to limitations in time and resources, several assumptions had to be done. To increase the validity of the indicators presented by the measurement method, several recommendations on improvement are done.","accessibility; PMS; airport; transportation; quality perception; multimodal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-18","Technology, Policy and Management","SEPAM","","ICT section","",""

The Superbus project is an effort to apply a new and complete conceptual approach to public transport. It consists of a vehicle, logistics and infrastructure. The positioning system for the vehicle is to have a horizontal position error, which will not exceed 5 cm in 95% of the obtained solutions. Secondary requirements included large (quasi-national) deployment area. Networked RTK positioning using GPS is shown to be a valid means to adhere to these requirements. Real Time kinematic (RTK) positioning allows for the required accuracy, while a base station network will allow for the required deployment area using Pseudo Reference Stations (PRS). UMTS is shown to be potentially effective for the required wireless data transfer using the NTRIP protocol. Testing con?rmed adherence of the Superbus Positioning System to the requirements in a variety of real world scenarios. Furthermore, the receiver is shown to perform to manufacturer speci?cations. Dif?cult environmental conditions, such as urban areas and multipath are con?rmed to have an effect on the position estimate in certain situations. It is however demonstrated that the receiver is capable of adhering to Superbus requirements in these situations, provided the initial ambiguity resolution is correct. Temporary signal loss of all satellites (for example due to an underpass) is shown to in?ict the need to reinitialise the ambiguity resolution algorithm, causing a temporary unavailability (around 20 seconds) of the precise RTK position estimate. Heading estimates are also established to be within speci?cations in good conditions. In high multipath conditions, or conditions with a low amount of satellites in view, the heading estimates exceed the manufacturing speci?cations with varying margins. This is possibly due to the fact that the ambiguities of the secondary antenna cannot be ?xed in this scenario. Material testing showed that carbon ?bre, the material that initially would cover the antennas in the vehicle, is highly un?t for this purpose. A thermoplastic counterpart shows no degradation of the satellite signal, and can be used for said purpose.","GPS; RTK; Superbus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mathematical Geodesy and Positioning","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","This Master Thesis presents a numerical model analysis of the response of the Rhine ROFI on wind direction and speed. The aim of this study is to gain a further insight in the physical processes of the Rhine ROFI. Previous work on the Rhine ROFI focused mostly on tidal effects (straining and mixing) and inertial motions (earth rotation). Other studies have focussed on the response of freshwater plumes to wind forcing alone. Recently, the combined forcing has been studied in an idealised model of the Rhine ROFI. The current study extends this research, however with the incorporation of the actual bathymetry and coastline of the Netherlands in a new, state-of-the-art three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. A sensitivity analysis of the number and distribution of vertical layers in the model found that 48 vertical layers is recommended under strongly stratified conditions The numerical results show that the effect of earths rotation on the wind-drive flow plays an important role in the stratification of the Rhine ROFI. Under neap tide conditions the Rhine ROFI exhibits periods of stratification. Due to a reduced eddy viscosity at the pycnocline in between, the surface layer responds more independently and is less affected by bottom friction. It implies that Coriolis force becomes relatively more important in the dynamics of the surface layer. Differential advection and depth mean advection make the size and shape of the freshwater plume highly variable. If the system is forced by an upwelling-favourable wind the freshwater plume is transported offshore, resulting in an increase of stratification. Downwelling-favourable winds transport the freshwater landwards, which results in a vertically well-mixed water column. An increased magnitude of the wind causes a more stratified water column for the upwelling-favourable winds and a more mixed state for the downwelling-favourable winds. Direct wind-induced vertical mixing of the plume is observed for an increased magnitude of the wind. The integrated potential energy anomaly is presented. It is found to be a powerful tool in analysing the interaction and competition of the wind and the ebb-flood tidal cycle in mixing and straining of the Rhine ROFI. The mixing and straining by the ebb-flood tidal cycle is found to be dominant over the mixing and straining by the wind. The influence of the wind on the Rhine ROFI is however clearly observed. The spatial changes in the potential energy anomaly show that for upwelling-favourable winds an increase of stratification occurs in the far-field. In the near-field a decrease is observed. For downwelling-favourable winds the opposite happens. The influence of the Ekman dynamics is observed in the results. For increased downwelling-favourable winds a reduction of the potential energy anomaly is found in both the near- and far-field of the Rhine ROFI.","Rhine River plume; ROFI; 3D numerical modelling; Wind; Potential Energy Anomaly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor)","2011","New Ways of Work is an organizational model in which the physical, virtual and behavioral environments are optimized to each other so that the organization can embrace time and location-independent working. Due to the holistic design approach of these environments, a situation is created in which the entire organization can function more effective and productive. Employees of these organizations will receive more freedom and responsibility to achieve the common goals of the organization. Due to these new circumstances, the organization needs to embrace different ways of thinking, acting and collaborating. The implementation of New Ways of Work can be guided and arranged by organization consultants. The implementation consists of different stages in which acquaintance, vision generation, analysis, concept generation, implementation and evaluation take place. By means of workshops and training courses, consultants try to improve communication, motivation for the organizational change, empathy, New Ways of Work awareness and the decision-making processes. Nevertheless, consultants have indicated that it is difficult to communicate the possibilities of New Ways of Work, involve motivated employees in the design processes or to have rich discussions that employees want to be actively involved in. Within this project, the possibilities of Augmented Reality and Serious Gaming are investigated in order to generate possible solutions for organizations and consultants who want to implement New Ways of Work as an organizational model. The ideation phase took place by means of an iterative game design approach. During the iterative design process, two different simulation games were developed and tested with two consultancy companies. Both games contained components from New Ways of Work and were tested to evaluate these components. The first game could be used in three stages of the implementation of New Ways of Work. Its goals were: -To facilitate the acquaintance with New Ways of Work -To facilitate discussion and the generation of feedback for office design concepts -To facilitate the generation of organizational arrangements The game consisted of two main parts were players had to design their office and perform tasks in this office. In the design part, they had to select workplaces and furniture, which they wanted to use in the office area. Depending on the productivity level of their new designed office, they could earn points. In the second part they had to fulfill tasks in this office. Players had to argue in which workplace they wanted to fulfill their tasks. Fellow players were able to judge these arguments by giving points to certain subjects. Five participants from a consultancy company tested the game. Various strengths, weaknesses and recommendations were found as a result of this user test. These were taken into account for the design of the second game. The second game mainly focused on the acquaintance of New Ways of Work. Players had to complete projects as soon as possible by using certain tools. The game focused on collaboration and discussion. The second game was tested by ten consultants and also concluded with various strengths, weaknesses and recommendations. Final recommendations mainly focused on merging both games into one. In the initial phase, the game should be used only during the acquaintance of the New Ways of Work. For subsequent developments, it is highly recommended to closely investigate the implementation processes and involved stakeholders. Based on the framework of the game dedicated games can be developed for specific user groups or organizations, such as a managers game or for example a game for the work field of healthcare.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

In our research we developed a software architecture which will help LHO to achieve responsive scheduling process. We defined the architecture in four steps. As the first step we proposed to separate the schedule into independent sub schedules. As second step, we proposed scheduling system object model which is suitable for handling of low-level scheduling processes in distributed, multi-user environment. Thirdly, we proposed a centralized scheduling system which can handle shared resources and high level organizational policies. In order to protect the consistency of the centralized schedule, we proposed to use data locks. We propose to use Area (or Team) as atomic locking unit in order to ease the maintenance of the software and to have responsive scheduling process. As fourth and last step of the architecture, we propose to break long taking software tasks into subparts so that the other software tasks can also be processed without waiting too long in the queue.","homecare; responsive; scheduling; distributed; multi-user","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F. (mentor); Aarts, P.M. (mentor)","2011","Cerebral palsy (CP) is a physical disorder that affects the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations. It is the most common physical disability in childhood with an incidence of 2-2,5 per 1000 live born children in the Western world. The Sint Maartenskliniek, department Toddler Rehabilitation, in Nijmegen, offers an intervention therapy to children of 2,5 to 8 years old that, due to brain damage (CP) at a young age, are inflicted with a less functional arm (hemiparesis). The children do not naturally use their affected arm in their daily activities, which counteracts the development of the arm and can even increase their disability. The aim of the graduation project was to design a product for the home context that stimulates children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy to incorporate and use their affected hand in daily activities and play. Over time it should become more natural for the children to use both of their hands in their activities. The design approach had an exploratory character as it has not yet been researched how products in the target area would be received by the children and parents. Children, their parents and their therapists were closely involved throughout the project. Besides literature research, observations and interviews, the daily life of the children was mapped by means of a contextual study. It is found that the children do not associate home with the use of the affected hand, like they do in therapy. Such an association should be brought to the home-context. Furthermore the children need external input as a reminder. But to break learned-non-use it is also important to motivate the children and raise awareness. This awareness could also help to build a positive self-image. The insights gained in the exploration phase were used as input to formulate a design vision and as inspiration throughout the rest of the project. It was chosen to design a concept that stimulates conscious competence and to follow a behavioral change approach. According to this approach the concept should consist of a behavior trigger and a motivator. The behavior trigger was characterized as an activating trigger. This trigger should attract the attention of the children and bring the message to act now! The motivator was characterized as reflective reward. The motivator should be fun and meaningful. It should persuade the children into action, but also make them aware of it. Overall it should offer the children an achievable challenge to empower them to feel confident and proud while feeling in control. Several concept directions were evaluated and prototypes were tested in a controlled setting and home-context, finally leading to the proposal for the concept ‘Kjoepie!’. ‘Kjoepie!’ is a package of products that together elicit the use of the affected hand at home. It consists of a tactile cue (vibration bracelet and portable sensors), a visual cue (activity pictograms) and a reflective reward system (reward boards, reward cards and treasure chest). The sensory cues are placed in the surroundings of the children to trigger the use of the hand for daily life activities like opening doors and drawers, switching light switches, dressing activities, eating dinner, playing with blocks or other play activities. When the children receive the trigger they can immediately act upon it. After performing the action or activity the reflective reward will follow. The product parts can be used and combined in a variety of ways. A custom program of use can be set up to match the children’s abilities and personality. This program of use will be set-up by the therapists in consultation with the parents. Development steps are recommended to finalize the design and to optimize the use.","children; cerebral palsy; tactile cue; visual cue; trigger; reward","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

Andere partijen hebben hun eigen belangen en proberen deze door strategisch gedrag te behartigen. Hierdoor ontstaat een dynamisch netwerk van actoren. Binnen dit netwerk vindt besluitvorming over stadionontwikkeling plaats. Het huidige onderzoek naar stadionontwikkeling heeft zich voornamelijk geconcentreerd op de economische rationaliteit die gehanteerd wordt door overheden wanneer zij betrokken zijn bij stadionontwikkeling. Maar de ontwikkeling van een stadion kan niet alleen economisch rationeel benaderd worden. Er zijn immers veel meer stakeholders betrokken, allen met eigen thema’s. De pluriformiteit aan wensen, belangen en thema’s van alle stakeholders bemoeilijkt de besluitvorming. Dit maakt de besluitvorming een complex proces. De stakeholders betrokken bij het besluitvormingsproces over stadionontwikkeling hebben echter beperkte middelen tot hun beschikking en willen deze zo nuttig mogelijk besteden.

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2011","Favela Fabric is a consultancy that enables companies to involve their customers in innovation through online co-creation. However, customer-generated ideas are often not the best solution to their associated needs and more important, they are seldom producible. Due to the complexity of the offer system, customers’ perception of the service remains restricted to their experienced interactions. As a consequence, regular customers possess too little knowledge of the functioning of this system to generate valuable ideas for innovation. However, customers do possess vital knowledge about encountered problems and needs (knowledge of use), whereas employees mainly possess knowledge about the functioning of the service (knowledge of system). Online dialogue between a company and its customers presents the opportunity to exchange both types of knowledge that are necessary for innovation. Still, two challenges are to be overcome. First, knowledge of use is often experience-based and consequently largely tacit. In other words, customers have difficulties expressing this knowledge or might take it for granted. Second, due to their dominant logic, employees disregard or misinterpret valuable information. Therefore, a method called the “Fostering Stage” is developed. This method enables customers to access and express tacit knowledge through experience-based ideation and facilitates employees to better understand customer needs through co-exploration of Problem and Solution Spaces. By facilitating a reciprocal learning process that enlarges the range of imaginable solutions and creates a better understanding of the underlying problems, online co-creation becomes a valuable tool for service innovation.","Co-creation; learning-process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kim, C.J. (mentor); Van den Berg, T. (mentor)","2011","Aircraft wiring is fast becoming one of the most essential subsystems in major civil aircraft programs. The tendency towards a large-scale integration of electrical systems means the amount of signals and therefore the size and magnitude of wire harnesses are increasing. For example, Airbus’ A380 passenger jet aircraft encompasses a vast amount of 100,000 signals and over 40,000 connectors. The result is a staggering total wiring length of 530km. Fokker Elmo is a world leader in wiring harness production. The wiring harnesses that are made by Fokker Elmo are designed in a 3D modelling environment. For practical reasons, the manufacturing of wiring harnesses is performed on 2D production drawings, so-called formboards drawings. The improvement of the ergonomics of wiring harness production at Fokker Elmo (both physical and cognitive) have been the focus of this graduation project. Proposals for improvements have been made in three ways. First, a new table design has been proposed. The design has been based on ergonomic literature, anthropometric data and interviews/observations of manufacturing staff. The proposed design consists of a modular system that allows different table configurations to accommodate the ergonomic production of both small and large wiring harnesses. An external company has been involved to develop the final table design. Four of these tables have recently been ordered for testing purposes. In the second part of the project the influence of the layout of formboard drawings on the ergonomics of production has been investigated. The results of this research have been used in the creation of formboard layout rules in the form of an ergonomic scoring system. This system can be used to evaluate the expected ergonomic impact of a proposed formboard drawing layout. The scoring system will be used in the PhD. research of Tobie van den Berg. His project, in which the TU Delft and Fokker Elmo cooperate, involves exploring the possibilities of creating an automated formboard drawing design tool. The third and final part of this project focuses on cognitive ergonomics. The production of wiring harnesses is a very complex process. The amount of information that is presented on the formboard drawings often confuses the manufacturing staff. After several interviews and focus group sessions, a set of design requirements for information design has been developed. Based on these design requirements, a redesign of formboard information has been proposed. The redesign should help to increase the consistency of information presentation and help to decrease mental loading. The newly designed formboard information will be integrated with an improved instruction system that will soon be introduced at Fokker Elmo. Together, the three parts of this graduation project will form a good basis for the improvement of physical and cognitive ergonomics of wiring harness production at Fokker Elmo.","wiring harnesses; cognitive ergonomics; physical ergonomics; production furniture; information design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2011","Every day ING receives thousands of digital or hardcopy requests from their customers that need to be processed and answered. A lot of these forms are rejected for various reasons every day. This causes not only huge paper flows and high turnaround times, but unsatisfied customers as well. One of these incoming requests is a hardcopy form to apply for the Interbank Switch Support Service (ISSS). This free service provided by the Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken (NVB) ensures a convenient way of switching from one bank to another, while all payments continue. Thirteen months in a row all payments, including direct debits, of the ‘old’ bank account will be rerouted to the new account. The ISSS will automatically inform companies and organisations which collect money from the old account, e.g. Nuon and T-Mobile, about the new account. So, when a customer decides to switch to another bank, a new bank account must be opened. Thereafter the customer has the choice to apply for the ISSS to ease the switch. If desired, the customer has to fill in a hardcopy form and deliver this form at the new bank. The new bank will check all data and send the form to the old bank, which will check the data as well. When all data matches with the systems and both banks approve, the ISSS will be started. In 2010 ING received thousands forms from private and business customers that wished to switch to ING. A lot of the private forms and even more of the business forms were rejected. A sample performed showed that improving the application form could significant reduce rejection reasons. Based on literature and input form all Dutch banks using the ISSS, the current form was redesigned as part of this master thesis (figure 1 and appendix H). Tests with the new designed form showed less frustration and failures and a higher ease of use. The plan of the NVB is to implement this new form at all Dutch banks within three months (June 2011). This means more than 100.000 Dutch customers will fill in this form every year from that moment on. In order to gain competitive advantage for ING at the same time, several ideas on how to improve the intern ISSS process were generated (bold text)and placed in the following two scenarios: Scenario 1: Application process with ING as new bank First of all the ISSS form should be integrated in LISA*. When a customer opens a bank account at the branch office, employees sometimes forget to ask if the customer wants to make use of the ISSS. By integrating the ISSS application in LISA, employees cannot forget the ISSS anymore. Integrating the application looks more professional than filling in a separate form as well. When a customer is interested in switching or hesitates, several tools must be available at the branch office to help the employee explain the ISSS and remove the obstacles faced by the customer. This could for example be a visual hardcopy map or a short instruction movie. Thereafter, one-on-one switching should be provided. At present, when a customer opens an ING bank account, a payslip has to be brought or a certain amount of money has to be deposited for 3 months in a row before a credit card or an authorized overdraft can be requested. This rule retains some customers from switching. Therefore, one-on-one switching should be provided: when the customer has a credit card or authorized overdraft at the old bank, ING allows the customer to have this immediately as well. So, when the customer decides to switch, the employee fills in the form online together with the customer on www.ing.nl, or when busy, the employee is able to send the customer to the Blob** in order to apply. Applying for the ISSS online has a lot of advantages. First of all, the system is able to give instant feedback, whereby the customer is able to revise the wrong entered information. This feedback could for example be the notification of a wrong filled in account number by performing the 11-test***. Second, instructions can easily be given and the application can only be send if all fields are fulfilled. Finally, the question whether it concerns an and/or-account can be asked. If answered ‘yes’, the names of both account owners need to be filled in, if answered ‘no’, just one field needs to be fulfilled. When the application is signed, the customer receives a manual on how to fill in the stopped Periodic Transfers of the old bank in ‘Mijn ING’. Prefilled switch cards, which the customer merely has to sign, are sent to the customer as well. These cards can be send to all necessary agencies to inform them about the new account number. Scenario 2: Procedure when ING is the old bank At the same time, when customers want to leave ING, all Periodic Transfers (PT) of the old ING account will be stopped. At present, ING sends an overview of these stopped PTs to the customer before the start of the ISSS, so they can be filled in at the new bank. ING should take advantage of this opportunity by at the same time trying to convince the customer to stay. This could for example be by mentioning all advantages of ING and offering a product for free (or with a discount) for a certain period. When the customer decides to stay, ING kills two birds with one stone: the customer stays, and an extra product is sold. However, if the customer still wants to switch, ING should send a survey to find out the reason of the switch. This information could be used to improve current processes. * LISA is the ING computer system used by the branch offices ** A Blob is a self-service computer in the branch offices on which the customer is able to visit all websites covered by www.ing.nl and use Internet banking *** The 11-test is a test performed on nine and ten digit Dutch bank account numbers to see if the bank account number is valid.","ING; Interbank; ISSS; switch; service; application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor); Soudarissanane, S.S. (mentor)","2011","A Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) is a powerful tool for surveying. Tens of millions of points are acquired with a high accuracy and within a short time. The resulting point clouds can be used to find changes and deformations. For this project, four point clouds of the metro station and tunnel at Rotterdam central station are available. The processing of the Laser Scanning data can be a time consuming task. Depending on the desired end product, various steps are required. During this graduation project, a method is proposed to find changes and deformation in the repeated TLS point clouds. A key step in this method is to distinguish surfaces in the point clouds that are changed from unchanged surfaces. The unchanged surfaces are investigated in more detail to find deformations in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The proposed method consists of three processing steps. The first step is to transform all the scans to the same (absolute) coordinate system. The second step is to divide the point clouds in segments. These segments are planar surfaces in the metro tunnel. During the segmentation matching, corresponding surfaces sampled at two different moments are identified, which is the third step. These matching segments are compared in more details during a deformation analysis. Segments without a match are subject to a change detection. The proposed method is applied to three case studies, using real data from the metro tunnel. The first case demonstrates the use of the method to research the registration accuracy and find occlusions between two scans. The two other cases demonstrate the change detection and deformation analysis. The results are validated using total station and joint meter measurements.","terrestrial laser scanning; change detection; deformation analysis; Rotterdam metro tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2011","This graduation project explored the design and application of interactive tangible products as extension of existing social media. Products called awareness systems are developed to help people create a peripheral awareness of each others’ activities, context or status. Awareness systems aim to bridge the gap between face-to-face communication and the current mediated communication. Awareness systems have been mainly developed working standalone and to provide communication between intimate socials. When linked to an existing social networking site (SNS), awareness systems could possibly facilitate communication within a network of extended socials, which were not yet addressed in literature. This formulated the following research question: How can awareness systems applied to social networking sites make a network of extended socials feel more connected? During this project Facebook was chosen as a platform for intervention. FACEBOOK USER INVESTIGATION In order to develop a design, a sense of motives and behavior of Facebook users was required. Therefore semi-structured interviews with six Facebook users were conducted from which two types of Facebook use were identified: * The use by which personal life is extensively shared on Facebook: exhibitionism. * The use by which the life of others is being monitored: voyeurism. Both can be specified by being productive or consumptive; while being productive, content is provided to the SNS. FIRST DESIGN PHASE Several ideas were generated within the design space defined by the current Facebook use, goals of the assignment and findings from literature. One of the ideas was about sharing daily life with the social network by the use of sound; samples of sound should reveal information about the location and activities of a specific member. From a metaphor, illustrating the ‘voyeurism’ Facebook use, the functioning of the design was specified: * Exhibitionism: enabling the user to record and instantly share a 5 second sample of sound. When keeping this function active it will automatically record and share samples at a fixed interval. To avoid privacy issues a percentage of the sample can be scrambled with noise. * Voyeurism: enabling the user to playback samples shared by the social network. The design was build into two working prototypes and tested in a field setup. FIRST SERIES OF TESTS The goal of the first series of tests was to find out how participants are using the prototype, what usability problems they are facing and how the prototype is contributing to a feel of connectedness between the different users. The results should serve as input during the second design phase. Two tests, lasting about a week, were conducted with the participation of two prototype users and one non-device user each test. Each group consisted of extended socials connected through Facebook. Before and after the test the device using participants had to complete the overall connectedness questionnaire (OC-Q ) (van Bel et al., 2009) and the affective benefits and costs of communication questionnaire (ABC-Q) (IJsselsteijn et al., 2009). The test was concluded with a guided conversation. The non-device using participants were only subject of a guided conversation afterwards. The main findings were: * Participants were using the device to record and share specific sounds intended to be humoristic and easy accessible. * Although the samples were shared with the social network the communication between device users was considered and mainly used as a public 1:1 communication. * Non-device users marked the samples as an attempt of the others to share some of their surroundings or something humoristic and used them as another way to get insight in the life of others. Non-device users did not comment on the samples. SECOND DESIGN PHASE Due to the public 1:1 communication and lack of participation by non-device users; part of the research domain, a network of extended socials, was not covered yet. Therefore the goal of the second design phase was to have the non-device users to “participate” in the use of the device. Therefore the design was modified to communicate activities on Facebook regarding the shared samples. This should create awareness of non-device users and change the behavior/sharing of device users. Next to this modification also shortcomings in “product properties” noticed during the tests were improved. The design was build into three interactive prototypes. SECOND SERIES OF TESTS The goal of the second series of tests was to find out how the participants (including non-device users) are using the prototype, how the prototype is contributing to (a feel of) connectedness and how this is experienced between the different users. Three one week lasting tests were conducted with the participation of three prototype users and one non-device user each test. Each group consisted of extended socials connected through Facebook. Before and after the test the device using participants had to complete the inclusion of other in self scale (Aron et al., 1992) and the ABC-Q. The test was concluded with a guided conversation. The non-device users were only subject of a guided conversation afterwards. CONCLUSION The main findings of the second series of tests resulted in the conclusion of this project: * Samples of a rich medium (sound), containing contextual cues, shared on a SNS create a sense of involvement and sharing (van Bel et al., 2009) and contribute to the feel of connectedness of the (non-device using) audience. * Feedback about the activities concerning ones shared samples on the SNS create social awareness (IJselsteijn et al., 2009) of the audience and contribute to the feeling of connectedness of the device users. * A lack of response by the audience one is aware of could lead to a negative appraisal of the social bond(s) (van Bel et al., 2009) and negatively contribute to the feeling of connectedness of the device users. * Possible appearance of the samples on the SNS results in an increased and continuous awareness of the device users. * Application of an awareness system, allowing asynchronous communication by means of a rich medium (sound), to a SNS provides another means to share experiences and contributes to the feeling of connectedness within a group of extended socials.","awareness systems; research through design; social connectedness; social media; social networking sites; tangible interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Blijlevens, J. (mentor)","2011","The mail business in the Netherlands is subject to accelerated volume declines driven by substitution through new media (digitalization) and competition. This development and its accompanying consequences for the value proposition of TNT in the unaddressed advertising mail market, together with the increasing number of ‘no’ stickers laid the foundation for this graduation assignment; develop a concept that makes ‘folder information’ online available to the consumer, strengthens the competitive position of TNT in this market and provide the retailer with an additional communication channel to enlarge the reach of folder information. To provide an initial insight in the compatibility of the online world with the physical folder delivery, the media: unaddressed advertising mail, banner advertising and folder sites were scored on eleven qualities: reach, targetability, control over media, findability, attention value, search and compare potential, costs, measurability, time to market, user generated content and customization. These qualities were identified and considered relevant based on literature, interviews with experts and extensive study on the folder sites. Based on the assigned scores, strengths and weaknesses were determined. The complementing strengths and weaknesses the different media turn out to employ provided the first indication for TNT to extent its product offering to the online world. Three different parties were involved in the development of the online folder concept; TNT as service provider, the retailer as content provider and the consumer as potential user. At first, it should be noted that the research is focused on the builder’s merchant’s branch. Subsequently, by means of a quantitative consumer research performed at the builder’s merchant chain Karwei, the notion ‘consumer’ was specified to 35 to 54 year old mothers whose child(-eren) live at home besides she is able to live (very) comfortable on her income. The performed qualitative researches by means of a focus group and interviews ultimately resulted in consumer and retailer insights with regard to unaddressed advertising mail. The gained insights have been used to develop design goals and requirements in light of TNT, the consumer and the retailer. The developed online folder concept enriches the product offering of TNT with two additional communication channels; the folder site ‘bouwfolderwereld’ and the online delivery option, which exploits banner advertising to deliver the online folder in a targeted manner to the consumer. The online delivery option ultimately ensures that the consumers could run into the folder online. In addition, the short time to the market relating to banner advertising makes it possible to forward tactical variations in the details of the message communicated in the banner. Below, the important and differentiating functionalities of the folder site bouwfolderwereld are presented: Thematic approach: personal situations of the consumer are reflected (move, renovation and renewal of interior) to improve relevance of the product offering presented and provide the retailer with multiple gateways to present its folder; Search function: minimizes time required to sort out best alternatives without jeopardizing the umfeld as intended by the retailer; Scroll up/down folder: improves the ease and speed of glancing through folders online; First mover benefit: the clearly communicated, on-time appearance provides the consumer with the first mover benefit over the physical folder reader. To gain insight in the economic feasibility of the online folder concept the costs and revenues with regard to the implementation were mapped out. From this economic perspective the implementation of the online folder concept is considered worthwhile; the payback time is less than one year and the positive net present value implies that the investment adds significant value to TNT. In addition, bouwfolderwereld was evaluated by its target group to gain insight in the judgement on the previously defined requirements. In general, bouwfolderwereld was positively evaluated by the target group; around 70% of the respondents intend to employ the site in the future. Consequently, TNT is advised to continue the development of the online folder concept in order to prepare TNT for the future and thereby ensure the positioning of TNT in the unaddressed advertising market.","unaddressed advertising mial; digitalization; folder; online","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor); Van der Woude, S. (mentor); Ruitenberg, J. (mentor)","2011","The space in the Port of Rotterdam is getting scarce due to the growth of the port. This is the reason why the port authority shows the ambition to intensify the space in the port. The EMO-peninsula on the first Maasvlakte is one of the areas in the port where there is a lack of space. There are three companies who are based on the peninsula. These are: EMO (dry bulk terminal), Electrabel (new coal/biomass power plant) and Gasunie (small LNG-storage). The lack of space on the peninsula is caused by: enlargement of a port basin, the new coal/biomass power plant and the expected growth of EMO. A capacity analysis shows that the EMO-peninsula is indeed short of space. The focus, of the intensification of space, is laid on the dry bulk storage of EMO and the handling and storage of biomass on the peninsula. All the alternatives to increase space capacity are generated by a brainstorm. The alternative keerwand (see picture) is elected as the best solution for the dry bulk storage problem of EMO. For the handling and storage of biomass, the best alternatives are the same as the current ideas. That is why only the alternative keerwand is developed and looked at in this study. Alternative keerwand The alternative keerwand contains of a retaining wall on both sides of the storage to enlarge the volume of the storage. Moreover, the volume will also be increased by adjusting the machine that is used for stacking and reclaiming the dry bulk, this machine is called the kombi. This will lead to more storage volume on top of the storage. The alternative shows benefits on different levels. These are: gain in space, financial positive, technically feasible and environmental attractive. The keerwand alternative results in a gain of space of 15,3%. The investment and the operational costs are relatively low. The construction of the retaining wall and the transformation of the kombi are technically feasible. Because of the relation between the surface and the volume of the storage is small, dust will be reduced to a minimum. A disadvantage of the alternative is the freedom of movement of shovels and dumpers. They have to drive around the construction to reach their destination. In comparison to many other alternatives to increase storage capacity in the port, this study proves that space intensification (keerwand) is really interesting for a dry bulk terminal. It is even more attractive than expanding or move the terminal to a new location. Especially the financial benefits are very positive. The investment and operational cost are considerably low. The most important argument against this alternative is the limited freedom of movement. Space intensification EMO-schiereiland The main conclusion of this study is that space intensification on the EMO-peninsula is feasible and interesting. By the use of space intensification there is no necessity for companies to expand on another location outside of the peninsula on the first Maasvlakte. The study “Space intensification EMO-peninsula” contributes to the ambition of the port authority of Rotterdam to intensify the space in the port.","dry bulk; droge bulk; opslag; storage; biomass; biomassa; kolen; coal; ruimte-intensivering","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The assignment of this graduation project is to design a product as a therapy intervention that could be used in one of the addiction care programs at Mistral treatment clinic of Brijder. The product has to be based on a tangible interaction driven by a game element. Furthermore, it should fit the context of the clients as the target group. These are youngsters between the 12 and 21 years old, who are in therapy for their drug depency. The main goal of the product is to motivate these youngsters to create a high therapy adherence. The final design concept is the ‘Totem Pole’. The Totem Pole was designed to be used as a therapy intervention for the youngsters of Mistral. The Totem Pole includes five parts of interaction between the user and the design product that are used in several sessions. These sessions are integrated in the current therapy program of Mistral. The first part of interaction is (1) to create a ‘Personal Avatar´ that has supernatural powers. This is a representation of the user on a wooden box, which can be placed in the Totem Pole. This Personal Avatar represents who they are, who or what they wish to be or what kind of supernatural powers they want to own. The second part of interaction is (2) to find and add a ´Power Object´ to the Personal Avatar. At every start of a new phase the user get the opportunity to bring in a personal Power Object, and to add this to their Avatar. The Power Object is an object that feeds, gives support, motivates, gives power, or gives value to the Avatar. In this way the Personal Avatar can evolve. It represents their personal motivations to follow the therapy. The Totem Pole is also designed to be used for in the Living Group session. (3) When the user wants to bring up a certain subject at this session, a piece of clay needs to be delivered in their Personal Avatar box. Before doing this, the user has to express his or her irritation, concern, negative feedback, positive feedback, motivation, or any other emotion or subject in the piece of clay. (4) The youngsters will bring their Personal Avatar to this session, where the person with a piece of clay in his or her box can start to communicate the desired subject. At this moment, the piece of clay functions as a communication tool or communication support. (5) After finishing the subject, the person can close this subject by taking a small piece of the delivered piece of clay. This should be added to the ‘Group Totem’, which is will be created on the wooden plate, located at the front surface of the Totem Pole. By adding a piece of clay, the subject has closed. During time, this ‘Group Totem’ will be built up by all the members of the group that brought up a subject at the session.","totem pole; therapy intervention; drug dependent youngsters; addiction care; therapy adherence; social bonding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

SoC-TLS enhances interconnect (bus/Network-on-Chip) interfaces with a hard crypto core containing enciphering/deciphering and keyed hash functions. This thesis particularly focusses on the design and implementation of an appropriate crypto core to mitigate specific threats concerning intra SoC communication. A lightweight stream cipher and keyed hash function are proposed after a survey of existing stream ciphers and pseudo random number generators. The proposed functions are analyzed to determine their cryptographic strength. Two reference designs are implemented; a single channel design for point-to-point communication and a multichannel design that supports secure connections between 15 secure cores. Implementation results for area and throughput are related to results for Æthereal NoC NI to determine the effects of hypothetical integration.","SoC; Security; Interconnect; NoC; System on Chip; Network on Chip; SoC-TLS; Cryptography; Message Authentication Code","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Master Embedded Systems / Circuits and Systems","",""

When several packets demand access to the same link, some of them maybe delayed waiting for other packets to move first. The short term or longer term delay causes degradation in the throughput of a certain network. When a link, route or destination is overloaded, while the demand on it is still increasing, congestion appears and latency increases. This will simply increase the demand of the link, route or destination beyond its capacity and show degradation in throughput and performance. This thesis investigates the handling of a classical and hard problem congestion management, reaching the suggestion of an alternative solution. In this work, a solution for congestion caused by head of line HOL blocking is proposed. An extensive taxonomy on available solutions is offered to the reader. We are able to present a solution with a feedback queue added to the input queue on a given switch in the network. A series of multiplexers control the routing of packets within the input, output, the main and feedback queue. We present an algorithm that controls the function of the multiplexers in order to eliminate the Head of Line blocking. The proposed algorithm proves to be a promising method as with the low cost of one additional queue, results close to the best case scenario have been achieved, performance improved and packet latency lowered to a margin close to the best case scenario.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

A special form of barrier options called ‘Parisian options’ will be treated in detail. A binomial tree is used to model possible developments of the price of the underlying. By using so-called risk-neutral probabilities it is possible to view the option price as an expectation. The binomial coefficient is used to calculate the amount of different paths ending in the same node. In the case of barrier options this becomes more complicated but a relatively easy formula that replaces the binomial coefficient can be found. For Parisian options it is not possible to find a direct formula and instead we must use a recursive algorithm.","options; financial mathematics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Probability Theory","","Financial Mathematics","",""

Therefore, Delft University of Technology seeks to construct a model of this plasma actuator for use with CFD. The advantages of having a plasma actuator model for CFD purposes is clear: It facilitates the prediction of flows over different configurations and ow properties of interest for aerospace purposes. There are currently two groups of plasma actuator models: Simplified models and First-principles based models. Although the First-principles based models are more accurate than simplified models, they are more complex and therefore computationally intensive. Because this is the first attempt at Delft University of Technology for the implementation of a plasma actuator model, simplicity is an essential starting point. The simplified model of Suzen & Huang is simple, fast and easy to implement and is therefore the first model considered. The implementation is done in the commercial CFD-software Fluent, by using the User-Deffined Scalar transport equations (UDS). Two separate UDSs are computed: one for the electric potential and one for the net charge density c. The code is verified by means of the Method of Manufactured Solutions. The code is validated by comparison with the results obtained from the model of Suzen & Huang. The electric potential field, net charge density field and the corresponding body force field proved, although with minor differences, to be accurately modeled. The resulting ow field in quiescent air was qualitatively correct, however differences were found in the results obtained by Suzen & Huang and the results of the current simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2011","The focus of this graduation assignment is on healthy elderly who have just retired from work and are willing to spend money on products that create comfort and ease in their homes. In the context of Health & Wellbeing, propositions should be focused on improving the quality of life of the target group, such as improving comfort due to age related ailments. Medical products, used under supervision of a doctor or medical specialist, are not in scope of this assignment. Furthermore the proposition should be based on the Philips brand pillars: easy to experience, designed around you and advanced. This means that it should be driven by consumer insights and based on end-user research. Also the solution should be accessible to the target group, regardless of their familiarity with technology. The target group of this project contains young seniors between the age of 55 and 70 years. They are healthy or have little limitations only (depended seniors are excluded). At this moment the average age of retirement is 62 years, but will increase in the future. The largest amount of retirees, 4.3 million people, will be reached in 2038. Here, the focus will be on the Baby boom generation born between 1941 and 1955, who are the seniors of the future. On psychological and social field, the emphasis will be on hedonists and inquisitives. These people live in a social environment and are open to new ideas. Most retirees live together with a partner in a single-family dwelling. Most retirees feel fit, although they suffer from little ailments, such as deterioration of hearing, vision and mobility. New technology will be accepted by them when a product is useful, safe, payable and easy to use. They spent most of their money on their homes. Favorite hobbies in home are; internet, reading, cooking etc., however they also spent a lot of time together with their grand(children), family and friends. The product should make life easier and provide a better quality of life. Sense plays an important role in this ambient experience. The five senses are; hearing, taste, smell, touch and sight. Philips has the philosophy: “What’s good for seniors is also good for young people.” This means they choose for a ‘design-for-all’ concept. Seniors do not want to be seen as old seniors and prefer a truthful quality product which is easily accessible. After performing the exploratory phase, the scope of the project is to design a product for healthy retirees between 55 and 70 years. To get insight in the target group a context mapping study is performed, consisting of two parts; sensitizing package and observations & interviews. In total twenty participants contributed to this research. The research focused on activities in the kitchen such as cooking, guests, accidents and special moments. Statement cards are made of the observations and interviews. These are grouped into different themes, thereafter these themes are categorized into three possible design directions. The first direction is; ‘switching between lights’ in the kitchen. It turned out that retirees have difficulties with controlling the different lightings, for example while cooking. ‘Creating atmosphere’ is the second directions. Retirees try to create an ambient environment, especially for their grandchildren, family and friends. The third direction is ‘being in control’. Retirees encounter physically disabilities or are distracted while cooking, which causes accidents. However, they want to keep control. Many ideas were created for these three directions. Ten best ideas are chosen afterwards, according to twelve criteria such as; ambient, interactive, market opportunities etc. The three developed concepts are; 1. Anti-boiling over device, 2.Luminous tile, 3. Smart light. The anti-boiling over device prevents a pan from boiling over. The luminous tile provides functional as well as atmospheric lighting and is easy to control. The Smart light is a combination of the first two ideas but is integrated into the cooker hood. Investigation has shown that the ‘luminous tile’ has the best opportunities, according to the present technology, competitors, opinion of target group and specialists. Using the research results and the literature, the luminous tile is further developed. Finally a prototype is made to test the functionality with retirees. Their opinions and findings are used to finalize the product idea. These adjustments have led to the final product; the Ambitray. The Ambitray is a luminous serving tray in combination with an armature. The luminous serving tray contains a special lighting effect that provides an ambient atmosphere. Serving coffee on this luminous tray will surprise guests. Summer evenings and winter months will be even more cozy by using this product. While having dinner the luminous tray creates an ambient background lighting when standing in the armature. It gives an everyday dinner something extra. Besides the charging function of the armature, it provides a functional lighting too. This lighting can be pointed in each preferable direction and reacts on hand gestures. Without touching the desirable light intensity can be set. The product will never keep you in the dark with the automatically motion and light detection.","ambient experience; retirees; home; lighting; tray","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis presents the results of a research done on the agricultural situation of Kilole. Kilole is a small Kenyan village located between Mombasa and the Tanzanian border. Looking at the annual rainfall, it can not be said that there is a lack of it in Kilole. However, because of its poor distribution the year is diverted in two rain seasons and two dry seasons. This has great influence on agriculture, because most crops can not withstand drought very easily. To understand the agriculture, a rainfall analysis has been performed first. With daily rainfall data from over thirty years, all kind of analysis have been performed. A trend analysis showed that there is no trend in the annual rainfall data. The long rain season onset has been determined, which is on average the 112th day of the year. Also a dry spell analysis has been done to see in which way drought occurs within the dry season. This showed that most rain falls within a very limited number of days and that the chance of having no rain for a week is already 78%. After an idea how the rain behaves was obtained it was time for a field trip. During two weeks the village of Kilole and its surroundings were visited in order to gather as much of relevant data. With the help of some semi-structured interviewing techniques it was tried to get an idea of the situation Kilole. It turned out that Kilolean farmers mainly grown maize, cassava and tomatoes. A lot of farmers use irrigation techniques to increase the yields of these crops and to make sure multiple crops can be grown each year. About half of the farmers in the village use irrigation, from which surface irrigation is most popular. Everybody digs holes to gain access to the groundwater. This is generally located thirty to one hundred centimeters below ground level, throughout the year. This means that that is always sufficient water for irrigation and that most crops can flourish, even in the dry season. Some people have the idea that the situation in Kilole should be improved. Improved in a way of higher yields, more crops and more irrigation. A number of initiatives have been seen from which three where pointed out to be of the most influence. The first was a dam that the government built a couple of years ago, together with the village. In the river bed paddy rice is grown in the wet season. The Kenyan government is campaigning for more rice production in the country and therefore financed a dam. This dam created a reservoir from which water could be used in the dry season to produce another harvest of rice every year. Due to a poor constructed dam it did not last long. Farmers were very content with the system, but since it does not work anymore and there are no funds, it is no longer used. The second initiative was a farmer which invested his profits in a well which now can be used freely by the villagers for drinking and irrigation. This shows that many people are willing to invest in the village in order to get higher yields and better welfare in general. The last imitative was a group of farmers which got funded with a micro-credit from abroad. This showed that many people are definitely eager to improve their lives and the village, but that a lack of funds often barricades the road to success. It was concluded that there is a general willingness to invest, produce and put effort to gain more. The only thing that withholds most farmers is a lack of knowledge, awareness or funds. Together with the Kilole Primary School it was concluded that one of the things to get this improvement is to start a educational program on irrigation. Hereby it is hoped to get rid of the lack of knowledge and awareness on agriculture and irrigation. Furthermore, this irrigation project would be a new (small) source of income for the school, which can be invested in better overall quality of the school. To achieve this a small-scale irrigation system was designed. Using harvested rainwater, the system is gravity run. This means that to external (mechanical) energy is needed to keep the system running. The only problem is the transport of water from the rainwater storage tank to the small polytank this is located 10 meters further and 1.5 meters above ground level. The solution is to use the energy of the pupils. Every week one of the three highest classes will have duty and with the hole class water is transported with buckets every day. Having the tank emptied twice a day will make sure the tomatoes will grown their best. Tomato crops are located in a greenhouse, to prevent pests, animals and extreme weather to ruined the harvest. Calculations and models showed that the system worked and that a small profit will be made every year. It can be concluded in the end that there are possibilities for Kilole to improve. People do want this and are willing to. The only problem is the lack of knowledge, awareness and funds. The first two will be taken away in time by the irrigation system at the primary school. Only the lack of funds is still a problem which has to be tackled. Though it is shown that there is a proper solution, micro-credits can only solve this problem completely when more people are willing to invest their money in villages like Kilole.","agriculture; hydrology; irrigation; Kenya","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2015-04-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Sepers, M. (mentor)","2011","The progression to a programmable graphics pipeline using shaders adds numerous possibilities for realistic display of real time rendering. It is a huge amount of work to let software make full use of the capabilities of shaders, so it has to be investigated well what is possible and what can make benefit of shaders. We investigated what has been done and thought about new ways to implement certain effects for a big part of the given research areas. When starting with this project we thought we could address all aspects and implement a good deal of the desired shaders, and have them working happily together in a simple OSG demo application. This however turned out to be too optimistic and it was hard to get even a simple normal map shader working correctly in the whole environment. Apart from the numerous issues with the developing environment the theory behind the deeper computer graphics generation took a lot of time to settle down in our brains. We have learned an awful lot of this project, much more than we can put in a single document. This is mainly because of the big range we’ve worked in, that caused us not to focus on one part but keep looking at many parts, so we never really came out of the research phase. As stated in the report the shaders can be divided into three different categories, each of which actually deserves its own project. One problem is that the whole shader technology is quite young, so standardization isn’t very well spread. Especially GLSL is not extensively used and it will take some years before it is. Cg is a bit more ready for work because its design is based on adjusting the shader to the environment it must run in, instead of handling the shader source itself to the OpenGL driver. Many programs like OSG are boycotting Cg for its proprietary nature and because they would like to see a standard being well implemented instead of a software tool that compensates for lack of well implemented standards. Both shader development tools and OSG are in heavy development now. In the few months this project has taken a major new version of OSG was released, and also a major version of NVIDIA FX Composer. The first shader model 3 cards are released this year, and many experiments are going on with them. This is all very nice for research work, but isn’t easily combined with the creation of stable software. Overall we can say the shaders can be used for a lot of different aspects of visualization. From simply enhancing the visual appearance of textured models to render lunar surfaces realistically and physically correct. It is all possible.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","","",""
