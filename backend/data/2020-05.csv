There are several reasons behind this, such as lack of funding to the healthcare department, below par maintenance of the available devices, poor infrastructure and most importantly high cost of the surgical equipment necessary in an operating room. A bipolar vessel sealing system is one of the many devices which is required for laparoscopic surgery and new innovations in the vessel sealing technologies have transformed the ways of electrosurgery as these devices perform surgery in a safe, reliable and efficient way with minimum operating time and reduced blood loss. Unfortunately, these units have been extensively designed and developed for High Income Countries but not so much for LMICs. The department of Medical Instruments &amp; Bio Inspired Technology at TU Delft is currently working on a solution to produce a vessel sealing system which is safe and reliable to be used in LMICs. Electrosurgery is a type of surgery where high frequency alternating current is used to obtain a desired tissue effect like cut, coagulate, desiccate and fulgurate by converting electrical energy into thermal energy. An Electrosurgical unit is a generator which provides energy for many such surgical procedures and is available in every hospital. The aim of this project is to provide an additional module which can be attached to the ESU and generate energy of a bipolar vessel sealing system. The module will have a simple circuit design for easy maintenance and will be made of easily available, replaceable and inexpensive components. This will provide a possible solution to use bipolar vessel sealing in low cost setting. The list of requirements for the circuit of this module is collected from technical details in user manuals and experimental studies for both conventional ESUs and bipolar vessel sealing systems. It also determined the input and output characteristics of the module. The circuit design of the module is based on the block diagram of a common ESU and similar components have been used to establish a connection. The circuit was designed and simulated in a software and the outcomes were matched to the output of a bipolar vessel sealing system already in use (LigaSure vessel sealing system).Further investigation and research are required to make this module functional for clinical applications as the module does not perform all the functions of a bipolar vessel sealing system, but it does fulfil the basic purpose for which such a system is used in electrosurgery.","Electrosurgical unit; vessel sealing; LMICs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Specifically, the neighbourhood ""Karwijhof"" in the city Nagele which is transitioning to a collective renewable district heating network incorporating 24 users. The emphasis of this study lies on the technology for storing thermal energy and two different heat collection technologies. The storage of heat is done using an underground seasonal thermal energy storage (USTES), in this case an underground sensible heat storage tank using water as storage medium. The system relies on a small scale district heating network (DHN) for the distribution of heat. For this research two heat collection technologies are considered resulting in two systems to be compared, both incorporating the USTES as main system component. The first system relies on heat collection by solar thermal collectors, the second on an air-water heat pump. Both systems are modelled in the Matlab-Simulink software environment and back tested on historic (publicly available) weather data provided by the Royal Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI). Different system sizes are tested on their key performance indicators through an iterative process. System sizes depend on the capacity of the main components which include: volume of the USTES, surface area of the solar thermal collectors, and air-water heat pump capacity. Key performance indicators include the levelised cost of heat (LCOH) and the seasonal coefficient of performance of the system which gives an indication on the autonomy of the system. To increase the autonomy of the systems a photo-voltaic (PV) array is considered for both systems to offset the electricity use. However, the systems are allowed to exchange electricity with the grid translating into the goal of ""zero on the meter"" autonomy. The model results show a mismatch between heat demand and generation. Demand peaks during winter from December-March while generation peaks during the summer months May-August. The USTES is needed to overcome this mismatch and ensure access to heat throughout the year. The results show that both systems can ensure heat throughout the year for the users considered during this study. However, systems cannot compete with traditional natural gas heating systems based on the LCOH. This is partly due to the high cost of the district heating network. The systems including a PV array show a LCOH that can compete with the traditional natural gas HR-boiler but are constraint by the rooftop area available during this study leading to a non competitive LCOH. Though, even with enough rooftop area for a PV array the systems cannot pay them self back relative to the base scenario due to the financing costs. During the study no subsidies were taken into account. Subsidies will be needed to make the renewable energy systems presented in this study financially more attractive in the short term. When considering the environmental benefits it can be argued that the systems are already competitive to the traditional natural gas heating systems. Further studies should focus on efficiency gains in the district heating network and the control mechanism of the air-water heat pump. It is expected that the LCOH of systems as proposed in this study will decline in the future as a result of cost reductions and/or efficiency increases of the system components. Also, a lower LCOH is deemed achievable for neighbourhoods with simpler district heating networks (i.e. less meters of DHN piping per user).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-29","","","","","",""

With the integration of a bias circuitry, the already versatile resonator will become even more so. However, applying a DC voltage or current bias to the resonator without significantly degrading its quality factor <i>Q</i> is no trivial task. One of the first superconducting microwave resonators with the ability to allow for the application of a DC bias, made use of symmetry points. In order to not rely on those symmetry points, our group came up with a different design that used a shunted capacitor instead. However, this design needs a more extensive and in particular more complicated fabrication process. As the groups focus is now completely away from the original design, we go back in this thesis, to honestly evaluate such a resonator by applying a bias to its center. We present a design with the cavity length <i>l</i> to be a full wavelength (<i>l</i> = λ) terminated on both ends to ground, fed in by a capacitively coupled AC-feedline at λ/4 and a DC-bias line at its center (λ/2). After the first fabrication trial we were unable to successfully judge the performance of the microwave resonator as it suffered from bad internal loss, leading to a low internal <i>Q </i>~ 300 at 4 K. The only thing that this showed us, is that its design is perhaps not as straightforward. On the other hand, interesting results specific to the design were obtained from QUCS simulations (using a combination of lumped and distributed elements). These simulations showed that the quality of the resonator is highly sensitive to the position of its galvanically connected bias line, with respect to the center of the cavity (voltage node). Where <i>Q</i><sub>int</sub> drops down to 10 % of its maximum for &lt; 0.1 mm (= <i>l</i>/320) away from the center. Furthermore, we saw that asymmetry in the ports causes the maximum <i>Q</i><sub>int </sub>(voltage node) to be off-center by 9 μm, and that adding an extra feedline in symmetry to the existing one puts it back on-center. Demonstrating the voltage node susceptibility to asymmetries of the cavity mode. Despite the unpromising signs the results show, suggestions have been put forward about better isolation of the bias line that have the potential to still make the design attractive. While these isolations still baring the traits of a faster and less complex fabrication.","microwave resonator; quality factor; DC bias; coplanar waveguide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study this linkage, one study in particular used an idealized model of the Labrador Sea where the density variations consists only of temperature variations. In this study, it is questioned whether the assumption of neglecting salinity is appropriate, by analysing the pathways of water mass and water mass transformation in the Labrador Sea.<br/>This is investigated by using that same idealized model (here called the reference run) and comparing this to a model where salinity variations are added whilst keeping density variations the same (Sconstant) to produce a similar circulation pattern. Furthermore, a model configuration is created which investigates if a seasonal cycle in salinity impacts the circulation pattern of the Labrador Sea (Sseasonal). The pathways of water masses in these model configurations are analyzed by Lagrangian particle tracking from A to B. <br/>It was found that with the same initial density variations the maximum surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) increases by 41 % when salinity is incorporated in the model. An increase in EKE is often associated with more water mass leaving the boundary current (BC) due to an increase in instabilities. Surprisingly, the opposite was found: 7.02 and 8.22 Sv are transported through the BC for the reference run and Sconstant, respectively. Furthermore it was found that most of the water mass leaves and re-enters the BC near the maximum EKE for each model configuration. An increase was found in maximum overturning in density space from an Eulerian perspective: from 3.9 to 4.8 Sv for the reference run and Sconstant, respectively, where about 10 % so called density compensation occurred for Sconstant. No significant annual changes are found when adding a seasonal cycle to the model. For all model configurations a large discrepancy exists between Eulerian and Lagrangian calculations in downwelling. This discrepancy is due to Lagrangian particles that reside in the models at the end of their simulation duration Thus the overturning in the Labrador Sea is significantly influenced by particles that have a long residence time (longer than 4 years in these model simulations). Between 22 and 25 % of the Lagrangian volume transport does not reach the outflow of each model simulation.<br/>There are also properties that salinity did not influence: no significant changes were found between the model configurations for the overturning in depth space, the annual MLD and barotropic streamfunction. In conclusion adding salinity to the idealized model showed only minor changes in the pathways of water mass and water mass transformation: the order of magnitude of all analyzed properties stays the same. Density compensation however is neglected when no salinity variations are added in the model. This means that for a highly idealized model of the Labrador Sea, salinity variations can be neglected, when density variations due to salinity variations are represented by temperature variations.","Labrador Sea; Overturning; Lagrangian particle tracking; eddy kinetic energy; mixed layer depth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this procedure, the optimal hip prosthesis should be chosen and placed in the correct orientation to achieve a stable hip joint. Failure to do so can lead to dislocation, mechanical failure or infection of the hip joint. To improve the outcome of the THA, range of motion (ROM) of the hip joint can be evaluated during the surgery after placement of the hip prosthesis. Current methods of measuring hip ROM have some limitations. For example, there is a low intra- and inter-test reliability between identification of the bony landmarks and goniometric alignment. The goal of this project was to develop an instrument that can measure the ROM during THA without the limitations of current instruments. An instrument was developed that determines its orientation via an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The IMU is connected on the upper leg via a strap and aligned with the bony landmarks via laser beams. A test has been performed to validate the usage of the instrument. The ROM of the hip for flexion and abduction motion was measured with the instrument and compared to a reference measurement made with two video cameras. A significant difference was found: the instrument did not stay aligned with the hip joint. For further development of the instrument, the drift should be minimised and multiple straps should be tested to allow a better fixation. Additionally, the added-value of the laser requires further research.","Total Hip Arthroplasty; Range of motion; IMU; hip prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

These small-scale actors were formerly excluded from the energy market, as legislative restrictions about generation size and legal stipulations prohibited them from actively taking part in the bidding process. While DERs of intermittent nature, such as PV installations already constitute a significant part of the generation mix, the wholesale electricity markets have not been designed taking their characteristics (production variability, low predictability, zero marginal cost of generation and strong site-specificity) into account, thus making their market integration harder. Local electricity markets (LEMs) solve this issue by providing a local market platform to residential actors within a community. They empower small scale electricity producers, prosumers, and consumers and offer economic incentives for creating local electricity balances. Yet, definitions of LEMs, their concepts and market mechanisms are mostly case driven instead of comparative. Furthermore, mechanisms which induce truthful bidding from market participants have received little attention within the context of residential LEMs. This thesis attempts to address these gaps by comparing several truthful double auction mechanisms and proposing a market mechanism framework suitable for residential LEMs. A Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to compare mechanism performance indicators under various LEM scenarios. Main performance indicators include the quantity of energy traded locally, gains-from-trade between market participants and total revenue received by the market operator. Finally, recommendations on capturing the value of implementing truthful mechanisms are made for potential LEM stakeholders.","Local Energy Markets; Mechanism Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The robots do not have a rigid grasp on the object. Instead, they use friction to lift the parcels. First, a controller calculates the desired force to make sure the parcels do not slip. The required force, as well as a trajectory are then sent to a hybrid force position controller, which controls the force the robot is pushing with in the direction perpendicular to the contact surface, while controlling the position in all other directions. The control scheme thus controls both robots separately given a desired force and position. That way the controller a lot simpler compared to closed kinematic chain controllers, which aim to control the entire system as a single robot. Since the parcels weight is unknown for an actual system where the robots pick and place parcels, the controller is extended with an adaptive part, that estimates the weight of the parcel. The estimated weight can than be used to improve the feedfordward controller, making the system less reliant on feedback. The estimator works by calculating the difference between the predicted forward dynamics and the actual dynamics of the system. It is shown that the estimator yields good results for estimating the mass of parcels.

The battery was to be replaced by a fuel cell system in order to extend the range threefold to 180km. Unfortunately, the ultimate design is likely unfeasible. Agriculture requires healthy soil and monitoring soil health is fundamental to its maintenance. Soil organic carbon in particular provides energy to the soil’s microorganisms, and is beneficial to water and nutrient retention. In addition, storing carbon in the soil is a form of carbon sequestration, which has become interesting due to the rising levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Monitoring soil organic carbon is therefore the goal of the drone design. The fuel cell system is a 650Whydrogen fuel cell by Intelligent Energy with a mass of 1290 g, which will be replacing the battery in the base design. Fuel tanks that were considered suitable are the 450 g, 0.5 L, 500 bar and 1350 g, 3 L, 300 bar fuel tanks by Meyer. It was found that one 1350 g and two 450 g fuel tanks were necessary to achieve the desired range of 180 km. However, after more careful drag estimates, this configuration turns out to be too heavy. 4 450 g fuel tanks remains feasible. Results below are based on this amount of fuel tanks.

Studies have found that known reserves of oil and natural gas will last another 50 years. Coal will last another 110 years, which points towards dire consequences. The experience will not be that of a car slowly running out of gas, but rather like driving off a cliff, since we innately depend on these resources. The realization of these concerns has lead to a rise in the investments all over the globe for Sustainability. The right questions are now being asked. How can we fulfill our demands without compromising the demands of our future generations? One of the keen areas of interest is the conversion of power into fuel. Synthesis of hydrocarbons from sequestrated carbon can produce carbon-neutral fuels that can replace some of the conventional fossil fuels. Methanol has been actively wiping the floor with the research community due to its simplicity of production and less toxic nature. While there are quite a lot of ways of producing methanol, very few of them are carbon neutral. Zero Emission Fuels B.V. has embarked on a venture to produce methanol by a totally carbon neutral process. They begin by capturing carbon dioxide and water from air and splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar power. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen are then combined in a reactor to form methanol, making a truly carbon-neutral process. They aim to make fuel consumption, a completely circular process while keeping it economic. An experimental characterization of ZEF’s methanol reactor under varying pressures and H2/CO2compositions was done. The new reactor design focuses on heating the feed gases before catalyst bed, more heat integration, reliable sensor data, and the ability to mix gases in desired compositions. Methanol yield, quality, energy efficiency, reactor inlet and outlet temperatures, power requirements were experimentally determined in a transient analysis. It was seen that the reactor produces 4.84 mmol/gcat /hr of methanol at 50 Bar and reactor wall temperature of 250◦C with H2 : CO2 = 3:1 mol% feed gas. The catalyst exhibited partial deactivation during night after shutdown. Contrary to expectation, the reactor produced more methanol at lower pressure. The production was reported at 5.96 mmol/gcat /hr at 35 Bar. Although, only 4.36 mmol/gcat /hr at 25 Bar. Moreover, the pressure reduction caused the natural circulation to slow down, and increase the inlet temperature from 208◦C at 50 Bar to 234◦C at 35 Bar, which is the reason for the observed increase in yield. It can be concluded that the reactor yield under these conditions is limited by kinetics and not thermodynamics. The reduced mass flow rate allowed the reactor to consume less power and show higher energy efficiency. It increased from 34.7% at 50 Bar to 43.2% at 35 Bar. The rate of pressure decline in the reactor was correlated with the methanol yield using gas law by accounting for non-ideality with the compressibility factor. The predicted yield was seen to be in good agreement with experimentally determined. The methanol yield of the reactor with variable feed gas composition was obtained for 50 Bar and 250◦C reactor wall temperature and seen to decrease on either side of the ideal composition. It was concluded that the yield becomes both stoichiometrically and kinetically limited. <br/>It is recommended that similar experiments be done at increasing temperatures and equilibrium yield be determined experimentally. Additionally, the reactor needs to be operated with varying compositions and higher reactor wall temperatures at constant pressure, to obtain the operating line for maximum production of reactor.","Methanol synthesis; Energy Storage; Reactor design; Experimental Characterization; Power to fuel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Cardiovascular disease is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a kind of disease where the inside of the artery gets narrow due to the build-up of plaque. Plaque is an abnormal accumulation of material in the inner layer of the arterial wall. A swelling can be formed by the accumulated material. The swelling may intrude into the channel of the artery wall, which will make the channel get narrower and restrict blood flow. Based on current medical technology, images of the plaques can be taken. However, there are no efficient simulation tools for plaque rupture. In order to set up sufficient simulation tools, a good representation of the material behaviour and the progression of the failure is needed. There are material models for the arterial wall accounting for large deformations (hyperelasticity) and anisotropy in the material response. And, there are also failure models. However, the material models and the failure models have not been combined. In this thesis, three material models and one failure model are included. The three material models are Neo-Hookean material model and two anisotropic models developed for arterial wall tissue developed by Holzapfel and Gasser. They are combined with anisotropic damage model to obtain three new constitutive models for failure of hyperelastic material. After the three constitutive models are set up, a parameter study is performed to explore the material properties of the new constitutive models. Verification of the material models is also included. Finally, the performance of the model is demonstrated with failure analyses on different geometries: a simple plane, a bar, a plane with an imperfection and a plane with a rectangular hole in the middle.","anisotropic; Hyperelastic material modelling; damage; arterial wall tissue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usage data can help create playgrounds that better fit with the residents' needs by identifying what elements of a playground are the most popular, and which do not get used. The AMS Institute and municipality of Rotterdam have asked us to develop a system to collect usage information of playgrounds without recording personally identifiable information. The system requirements are to record the locations of individual users and to estimate if a user is a child or an adult. It must do this without requiring an external power source and without a broadband internet connection. After considering different types of sensors (including computer vision, radio, sound, and mechanical acoustic signals), We decided to use a mmWave radar sensor due to its ability to provide accurate localization, easy installation, and low energy usage without recording identifiable information. We use a commercially available mmWave radar sensor that we configure to localize people in a 30m by 20m area when placed at the perimeter. We use the radar point cloud output from the device for classification by calculating statistics that we use as features for our classifier. We evaluate classifiers based on SVM, Random Forrest, fully connected and recurrent neural nets. We also analyze different methods for combining radar point clouds captured over time from the same person. We collected 100.000 radar point clouds of adults, children, and bicyclists at real playgrounds, split into a training and validation data set. We show that our SVM classifier achieves an accuracy of 79% on single radar frames, and 93% on the combined results of 10 second long sequences of our validation dataset. The classifier requires &lt;1KB of memory and little processing power. Meaning it can execute on an embedded platform powered by a solar panel.","people detection; classification; mmwave; playgrounds; machine learning; neural network; embedded systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

This method speeds up the optimization process without fine tuning of the surrogate parameters for every individual case. The computational cost of obtaining training data was identified as the main limitation when using Machine Learning methods for this purpose. Therefore, the surrogate was built with an Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine Multi-Agent System (OS-ELM-MAS) due to its theoretical good performance when the training data is limited. A high-fidelity global optimization problem was implemented, and a method to include the surrogate during the optimization process was designed. This method does not require specialized optimization algorithms. The parameters that control the interaction between the surrogate and the optimization process were identified and a procedure to obtain the best values was designed and applied. The final results show that the use of the surrogate improves the optimization results when evaluations of the cost function are computationally expensive. However, the values of the parameters that control the interaction between the surrogate and the optimization algorithm had to be carefully selected. The search for a general procedure to obtain these parameters without repeated tests is proposed for future research.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Part of the goal of Europe’s Strategy Vision Zero is to eliminate all severe cycling accidents in Europe by 2030. The majority of cycling accidents are single vehicle accidents; this term indicates the absence of collisions with other road participants and implies a fall of the cyclist. Research has shown that mainly elderly cyclists are victim to those accidents. An untested hypothesis is that their slowed motor responses are one of the main reasons behind this. This study aims to address this hypothesis by studying the influence of neural time delay on the lateral stability of bicycle-rider systems. In this study, the slowed motor responses are represented by single neural time delay values. The influence is quantified by the sizes of the identified basins of attraction of stability (BoA). The BoA contains the set of finite lateral disturbances for which stability is<br/>retained and is acquired via numerical integration. Binary threshold criteria are used to determine the stability of the solution. The bicycle-rider system consists of two components: a bicycle model and a rider model. The bicycle is modelled using the Whipple(-Carvallo) bicycle model with the set of non-linear equations derived by Basu-Mandal [2]. The rider is modelled using an implicit experimentally validated model from literature [31]. This model consists of a PID controller with full state feedback, neuro-muscular dynamics and, in this study, is extended to include nonzero time delay. The neural time delay value of a young cyclist has been based on literature [4]. The value is doubled to model an older cyclist. The control strategy of the young cyclist is identified using system identification techniques. The basins of the young and old cyclist are compared to study the detrimental effect of time delay on lateral stability in cycling. It declined over 80% when the time delay was doubled. The human’s ability to adapt its control to circumstances has been considered by repeating the control identification process for the rider which suffers from double the time delay. With respect to the young cyclist, a decline of over 50% was observed. Therefore, the results strongly support the hypothesis. Further research should focus on increasing complexity of the rider model to include preview and prediction. In this way, the influence of slowed motor responses can be mapped more clearly.<br/> A secondary objective of this thesis is the preliminary development of a steer assist control model to aid the elderly cyclist balance during cycling. This development builds further on a simple control model from literature [29] which uses roll angle feedback. As a result, a nonlinear velocity dependent roll rate feedback control law was developed. This control law yields a constant basin height over the commonly used velocity range of cyclists. This height indicates the maximum allowable steer rate perturbations the bicycle-steer assist system could handle and is approximately the same height as what was identified for<br/>a young cyclist. Future research is required for improving the steer assist. This means adding maximum allowable control torque, sensorial time delays and trajectory tracking","Bicycle; stability; Basin of Attraction; neural time delay; steer assist","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-29","","","","","",""

Here questions arise about the role that a designer can fulfill in the development of such novel materials. What new skillset does he/she need to obtain? How will a collaboration with biologists take place? In order to get a better understanding of the potentials of materials grown by bacteria and the subsequent role of a designer, a Material Driven Design (Karana et al., 2015) project was performed in collaboration with scientists from the Aubin-Tam research group, part of the Bionanoscience department of the Delft University of Technology. The starting point of the design project was a composite material consisting of three ingredients that are grown by three separate species of bacteria. In order to gain an understanding of how this material was grown and produced, the designer performed a plethora of experiments investigating; the growth of the organisms and the amount of material they produced; how the ratio between the three ingredients influenced the resulting material; how the way in which the material was processed resulted in its final form and properties. This led to the understanding that this material is highly programmable in its form and properties such as its flexibility, strength and surface roughness. With this in mind, user studies were performed in which it was found that the versatility of the material was considered interesting and intriguing by participants. They wonder what it is and how it is made, finding it hard to believe that bacteria grew such a material. This led to a material concept in which the designer proposes to play with these varying properties of the material, resulting in contrasting material experiences and highlighting the material its ability to appear as something that is both natural and man-made at the same time. This was done by exploring various processesing potentials of the material and analysing how different parameters of these processes influence the resulting material its properties. In doing so, the designer provided a framework by which future designers can program and explore this bio-based material that shows a lot of different potentials.","Biofabrication; Bacteria; Composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore essential to estimate the amount of infiltration, to design a suitable heating and cooling system in a building. Empirical relations which are used to determine infiltration, generally overestimate the infiltration rate, since the effects of weather, mechanical ventilation and building geometry are not taken into account. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to determine the pressure distribution around a building along with an airflow network model to determine the infiltration flow rate. Validation studies of the LES model show that the pressure data at the front and back faces of a surface-mounted cube are accurately captured, whereas, the pressure at the top and side faces slightly deviate from reference data with an error of 16%-20%. This occurs due to a shift in the recirculation region at the top towards the leeward part of the cube surface. The reattachment of the flow is not observed at the top and side surfaces, which explains the deviations in pressure. The infiltration rate is analysed in the Matrix VII building using the in-house model, which combines the LES model and the airflow network model. It is then compared with other relevant standards and models like the NTA 8800 and an energy balance model. The comparison is made in terms of the cross-correlation between the models and the heat loss associated with infiltration. The in-house model shows good cross-correlation with the NTA 8800 model, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8454. The building standards which employ empirical relations, overestimate the heat loss by a factor of 10 compared to the in-house model. The in-house model is then used to develop a database of infiltration values for different building heights and airtightness values. The specific infiltration rate is observed to decrease in buildings taller than 120 m due to the minimal changes in velocity higher up the atmospheric boundary layer. The database is observed to provide values of infiltration with reasonable accuracy, compared to the existing database in the ISSO standard.","LES; Infiltration; airflow network models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These enhanced service provisions resulted in new challenges to the sustainability of the railway systems. Insulated rail joint (IRJ) is one of the crucial structural components of the railway track with the function of serving the signaling control by securing the occupancy of the track with one and only train in each divided block. An IRJ includes the application of two joint bars being bolted with the purpose of connecting two adjoining rails. In addition to the insulation layers between the joint bars and the rail, the end post which is positioned between the end-to-end rails, assure the disruptions of current flow between two blocks. The emerge of discontinuity in the stiffness and geometry at IRJs influence the service life of this component due to the introduced high dynamic forces. Subsequently, the IRJ is considered as one of the weak spots of the railway tracks which requires the allocation of great concern in their maintenance. In order to attain understanding of the wheel-rail dynamic interaction at IRJs, various analytical, experimental and numerical studies have been conducted in the past few years. The application of the finite element method (FEM), as a flexible numerical tool, reveals distinct advantages for understanding the behavior of the track structure under the pass-by wheel. This M.Sc. thesis utilizes an explicit finite element analysis to investigate the influence of the sleeper spacing and traffic speed on the impact force and vibration of the track. The FE model includes the detailed demonstration of the rail, joint bars and sleepers while simulated spring and damper elements are preferred to the rail pads and ballast to reduce the complexity of the model. Besides, the detailed illustration of the wheel and axle as well as the effects of the carbody and bogie are considered in the FE model. Based on the parametric studies conducted in this thesis, the impact force as well as the low (0–3kHz) and high (3-10kHz) -frequency vibrations are prominently influenced by the application of non-uniform sleeper spacing and various traffic speed. With considering the two factors; sleeper spacing and traffic speed, a typical statistical approach -Design of Experiment- is implemented to attain an optimized track model with the aim of reducing the impact force and the impact vibration of the track, and thus to reduce the maintenance necessity and noise generation as well as to increase the passenger comfort. The performance of the nominated optimized model has been observed under the application of two typical trains operated on the Dutch railway network. Finally, the conclusions are presented and recommendations for future research are proposed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This is due to their special characteristics such as lightweight, flexibility and reduced resource consumption. HyET Solar is a Netherlands based company that makes thin film amorphous silicon modules using a novel processing technique. This construction philosophy involves using a temporary Al substrate to deposit the solar cell layers. In the final step a permanent plastic carrier foil is encapsulated, and the Al foil is removed. HyET Solar has partnered with TU Delft under the FlamingoPV project to produce a-Si:H/nc-Si:H tandem solar cells with efficiencies up to 14%. A starting point for the micromorph cell is a single junction nanocrystalline silicon solar cell on Al foil which has never been attempted at TU Delft. A key concept of cell construction is the use of modulated surface textures (MST) to improve light trapping and growth of high quality nc-Si:H material. MST are optimised on Al foil and used to deposit nc-Si:H layers. The quality of the layers is characterised using various techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, XRD and SEM images. Hydride stretching mode signatures are a non-intrusive way of characterising device grade nc-Si:H layers without undertaking the arduous fabrication process at HyET. Investigations show the substrate texture features have an influence on the material properties. Results on Al foil show both different and similar trends compared to glass substrates. The silane concentration is an important parameter which influences the nature of deposited material. By tuning this parameter, different signatures of the hydride stretching modes are observed. Initial results suggest that just any seed layer is non-conducive to growth of the nc-Si:H material. Seed layers are deposited using silane concentration grading technique. These graded seeds show excellent microstructure homogeneity and reproducibility. The seed layers also enhance the (220) preferential growth orientation of nanocrystalline grains. The graded seed layers are incorporated into p-i-n cells which will serve as good p-i interface, this resulted in high quality material with good thickness homogeneity and high crystalline fractions over 75%. The nc-Si:H solar cells show high shunt resistance values that are orders of magnitude higher than HyET’s modules. This indicates high quality material with limited shunts and cracks which were developed using graded seed layers and MST. When completing the cells at HyET, several challenges were faced due to lack of experience with nc-Si:H solar cells. These include but are not limited to, laser scribing settings and final etching of the Al foil. These issues need to be ironed out at HyET before processing new samples which is out of the control of PVMD. To overcome this bottleneck, an alternate finishing process is researched at TU Delft, despite first results of this alternative approach being unsuccessful, we are confident it can be perfected with more dedicated research.","Thin-film silicon solar cells; Flexible substrates; Aluminium substrate; nc-Si:H solar cells; Flexible solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, the use of fossil fuel energy has resulted in disadvantageous impacts for humans and the Earth. This condition becomes a good momentum to find a clean and more sustainable energy resources, given the fact that fossil fuel energy is a non-renewable resource that someday, in the future, its availability becomes scarce. Additionally, environmental awareness concerning energy-mix use and combating climate change also increases globally. Geothermal energy is one of the better alternatives for energy sources, as it is renewable as well as clean and green. A study from the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) says that deeper Triassic sandstones, with possibly higher temperatures, could also potentially contain geothermal reservoirs. Therefore, this condition has paved the way for the exploration of the deep reservoir. The assessment of geothermal production usually faces considerable uncertainty due to, among other things, lack a comprehensive geomechanical model. Therefore, knowledge of the current state of stress is essential to address a wide range of problems that might arise during geothermal exploration and production—those problems such as wellbore stability, fault reactivation, induced seismicity, and deformation in depleting reservoirs. This study aims to construct a 3D geomechanical model in the Lower Germanic Triassic group, in De Lier field. By using the effective stress ratio concept, a 3D geomechanical model is constructed to describe the principal stresses distribution. The principal stresses distribution determines how the faulting stress regime will be formed. The vertical stress, as one of the principal stresses, is controlled by depth and density. On the other hand, the minimum horizontal stress is controlled by Poisson’s ratio. Four models are constructed based on several assumptions. In the model where gravity is the only source of stress, the maximum principal stress σ1 is always vertical. Whereas, in the models where tectonic stress is included, three depth intervals related to the faulting stress regime are observed. Imposing greater tectonic stress to the model will shift the depth of transition downward. Cross-section analysis shows that the local principal stresses variation due to the presence of different stratigraphic units and geological structures (faults and fractures). Fractures and faults at particular depth are inactive under the current stress field. Furthermore, pore pressure and friction coefficient have a significant impact on faults and fractures stability.","stress field; the west Netherlands basin; geothermal; 3D geomechanical model; geology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

During this lateral berthing manoeuver a resistance force can be noticed counteracting the lateral manoeuver to the quay which acts as hydraulic damping. A large force is needed to overcome this hydraulic damping which is known as the water cushion effect. There are a handful of circumstances that are suspected to enhance the effect of hydraulic damping, but a substantiated conclusion is not yet drawn.

To overcome this, multi-junction devices are generally fabricated with two or more junctions, so as to achieve better energy conversion efficiency by optimum spectral utilization.

The photons in the range of 0.7-1.1 eV, have an available current density of 15.9 mA/cm^2. A fraction of this current density would be large enough to not limit the output current of these thin-film Si-based multi-junction devices. Ge, belonging to the same group IV as Si and being heavier than it, forms weaker covalent bonds. Hence, it has a lower bandgap energy, making it the preferred choice of material.

This thesis will focus on the influence of a set of deposition parameters on the various properties of the Ge:H films. This will result in a set of Ge:H films from which a specific few are used as absorber layers to analyze the performance of a single-junction cell. The fabrication of the Ge:H films is carried out on a CASCADE setup which is based on the RF-PECVD technique. A processing range is identified to be in the range of 1-5 mbar pressure with RF powers ranging between 5-25 W for a fixed electrode distance of 20mm. nc-Ge:H are processed in the range of 20-25 W for pressures of 2 mbar and higher at a high dilution of 400. A strong correlation is found between the refractive index of the films and the presence of GeOx. The films with low refractive index possibly indicate a porous network with high void density show substantial oxygen contamination and vice-versa. Water vapour in the ambient is responsible for the oxidation. The oxygen contamination significantly impacts the properties of the films. The E04 optical bandgap increases with oxygen contamination which hinders the development of a low-bandgap absorber layer, while the Eact decreases to values as low as around 50 eV . Generally, the pre-exponential factor (sigma_o) decreases significantly by 1-5 orders of magnitude which outweighs the decrease in Eact, resulting in the decrease in dark conductivity by 1-3 orders of magnitude. Consequently, highest photo/dark conductivity ratios of 5-6 are obtained for these films. Amongst the films without oxygen contamination, the lowest E04 optical bandgap reported is 1.2 eV, with a Etauc bandgap of 0.93 and a photo/dark conductivity ratio around 3.4. Most of the single-junction cells processed at absorber layer thicknesses of 100nm and above show resistor-like behaviour. The substantially high values of Rs losses associated to the Rsh degrade the cell parameters significantly. Although, for low absorber layer thickness of around 50nm, the closest resemblance to a cell-behaviour is observed. Therefore, there is a scope for improvement with regards to processing of these single-junction cells.","a-/nc-Ge:H; thin film solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The shift from open surgery with one large incision to less invasive techniques with multiple small incisions brings benefits such as less trauma, less scar formation and a faster recovery for the patient. However, in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), surgeons struggle with basic tasks such as applying sutures and tying nots. Clip appliers have been developed to take away the need to apply sutures. From the literature research preceding this thesis and a state-of-the-art investigation, it turned out that current clip appliers do not combine simultaneous steerability and the ability to apply multiple clips. Reaching the surgical site can be difficult or impossible with conventional non-steerable clip appliers, and the reinsertion of a clip applier after every clip application is time consuming and can lead to damage to the instrumentation and patient. The goal of this thesis is to develop a reusable minimally invasive steerable clip applier that can bend clips at the surgical site to close ducts and cuts during laparoscopic procedures. Design requirements and obstacle points are determined for the laparoscopic instrument components by taking the SATA mechanism as a starting point in the design process. Possible solutions to the obstacle points are gathered in a morphological chart that is used to come up with six distinct concepts. A concept choice is made by experimentally finding the required torque to cut and bend a titanium clip and by verifying the ability of concepts to reach this torque by creating a simplified instrument tip on the same scale as the to be designed tip. The worst-case required torque to cut and bend a medium sized titanium clip of 0.5 by 0.8 mm turned out to be 0.6 Nm and 0.03 Nm respectively. During this experimentation it became clear that clips should be supported over the whole length and not just at the ends during the bending process to secure appropriate closing and compression. Several experiments are performed to find a cutting blade attachment that could transmit the worst-case cutting torque while remaining as bendable as possible.<br/>The concept in which the clips are formed in the tip by cutting off a piece of titanium wire and then bent into a clip turned out to be the most promising because it has a theoretically unlimited number of clips at the implantation site without a cartridge, is sterilizable, relatively easy to fabricate due to its simplicity, and can be modified to produce clips with other dimensions. The concept is 3D printed on a 500% scale to verify functionality. This prototype showed that a revision of the actuation mechanism was required and that a few minor alterations could make the instrument easier to sterilize. 3D printing the new design on a 500% scale verified the functionality. The final functional prototype is also 3D printed at a 200% scale, which is the smallest scale that could be achieved with the available resources. The experiments showed that all the required actions could be performed and the prototypes showed that the mechanism functions as required. It is therefore achieved to design a Bend On Site Steerable (BOSS) clip applier that can make and bend clips in the tip from a continuous titanium wire. The instrument is easy to disassemble and sterilize due to the simple design and the small amount of parts. This simple design makes it also possible to make adjustments so that other sizes and shapes of clips can be made.","Clip Applier; Steerable; Minimally invasive surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

After modifying the agent teams, so they no longer waste limited resources, the experiment is repeated. The different communication strategies are affected to different degrees by communication failure. While the teams perform better than a single agent without failure, slowdown with communication failure can make the teams perform worse than the single agent.

Truck platooning is one of those emerging technologies with high potential. In one way or another, truck platooning will also have an impact on our current infrastructure and the way in which the motorways are managed and maintained.Trucks have the greatest effect on the occurrence of road surface wear unlike smaller vehicles (Mallick &amp; El-Korchi, 2017). The pavement structure is designed according to the amount of truck axle load repetitions that occurs in the design life of the motorway.The current traffic flow is normally distributed on the traffic lane, which is called lateral wander and has a positive effect on the service life of the road structure. Driving in a platoon will influence the wandering effect of trucks which will have a negative effect on the pavement structure. Lateral wander results in the distribution of pavement damage allowing more load repetitions on the lane.Different professionals from Rijkswaterstaat and TNO (research institute) were approached and search engines like Scopus, Elsevier, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect and the library of Tu-Delft were used to obtain scientific papers on truck platooning, pavement structures and the current maintenance strategies. It can be concluded that little to no research has been done into the impact of truck platooning on the pavement structure. This means that there is a knowledge gap in the scientifically area and in the practical area. This resulted in the following objective of this research, which is to fill the scientific knowledge gap and to contribute to the current practise. The resulting main research question has been developed, based on this objective.What are the potential impacts of Truck Platooning on the road infrastructure and how could this affect the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements on motorways?Research approachA mix of qualitative methods and quantitative methods were used to find an answer on the main research question regarding truck platooning and the pavement structure. First, a literature study was conducted in order to collect the necessary data to identify the characteristics of truck platooning and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the pavement structure.The literature study identified three failure mechanisms which are effected by lateral wander. The literature study also resulted in three basic models, which are used to analyse the failure mechanisms. During the desk research, the models were adjusted to fit the needed situation of truck platooning on the Dutch motorways. After this, the impact of truck platooning on the pavement structure is determined.Next interviews were conducted with the purpose to obtain and evaluate data regarding the failure mechanisms of the pavement structure in relation to truck platooning and their impact on the maintenance strategy. As such, the obtained data is incorporated into the study.ResultsThree possible platooning scenarios were identified, based on the interviews. The impact of truck platooning will depend on the way on which the platoon will be configurated.• The trucks can be connected to each other only in the longitudinal direction.• The trucks can be connected in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, with an independent leading truck.• The trucks can be coupled in both the longitudinal and transverse directions while the leading truck drives in the exact same track as the previous truck platoons. This scenario applies when the trucks start to drive autonomous.The impact of truck platooning will depend on the way on which the platoon will be configurated. As a result of the interview with the professionals of Rijkswaterstaat, it was concluded that only the third scenario will have an impact on the pavement structure. Today's vehicles are getting smarter and are equipped with a lot of technology. The European Uni encourages the use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and even made a number of core systems mandatory for vehicles (Dijsselbloem, Asselt, &amp; Zouridis, 2019).The third scenario represents the most negative setting of truck platooning. The trucks in this setting are coupled in both the longitudinal and transverse directions while the leading truck uses a form of cruise control letting it drive in the exact same track as the previous truck platoon. This situation arises when the trucks start using technology to drive. The strains on the pavement structure can be two times as large in case of fatigue failure. The structural damage on the pavement will increase as a result of rut development and of fatigue.The second part of the literature review resulted in three failure mechanisms and three models were identified.• The first failure mechanism is permanent deformation; using the Rut development model.• The second failure mechanism is raveling; using the Raveling prediction model.• The third failure mechanism is fatigue failure. The Dutch Design Method includes a model in order to predict the acceptable amount of load repetitions on the pavement structure,The following findings have been made with regard to the impact of truck platooning on the failure mechanisms:Permanent deformationA maximum rut depth of 18 mm is commonly used on Dutch motorways. It is generally assumed that this standard will be achieved within 30 years without platooning. In most cases, maintenance is already planned when the rut reaches a depth of 16 to 17 mm. The model used to predict the rut development indicates that the rut depth increases with the amount of platoons on the motorway. This development could impact the current maintenance strategy if more than 50% of the trucks drive in a platoon. The maintenance strategy of Rijkswaterstaat will have to be adjusted, because the critical failure mechanism shifts from raveling to deformations of the road surface. Permanent deformation will have to be maintained in a different way than raveling. The critical point of permanent deformation could be reached within 10 years, if all the trucks that participate in traffic on the highways start to drive in a platoon.RavelingRaveling is the loss of aggregate material from the top layer. Literature research shows that, in case of young asphalt, raveling depends on the asphalt composition and traffic characteristics. However, it was also concluded that the impact of traffic decreases and that the impact of climate increases on older asphalt. It was therefore determined that the characteristics of truck platooning won’t lead to an increase of raveling, which means that the same maintenance intervals as in the current situation can be maintained.Fatigue failureMotorways are designed with a lifespan of 20 years based on a certain number of load repetitions and with fatigue failure as criterium. After this, improvements will be made which will extend the service life by another 20 years and so on. Based on desk research and interviews, it is assumed that, in the current situation without platooning, the pavement fatigue life of motorways approaches 25 year. The results in this research show that the acceptable amount of load repetitions will be exceeded within 20 years if 50% of the trafficking trucks autonomously drive in a platoon and nothing is done. When 100% of thetrucks drive in a platoon the acceptable amount of load repetitions will be exceeded within 10 year.Main findingsOverall, it can be concluded that the scale of damage done to the pavement structure depends on the percentage of platoons on the motorways. The current maintenance strategy will be negatively affected if 50% of all freight transport uses a form of truck platooning. The current maintenance strategy, without platooning, mainly focuses on restoring the top layer of the pavement structure due to the loss of aggregate material or raveling. With truck platooning, the other failure mechanisms like fatigue cracking and permanent deformation will change the current maintenance strategy of motorways. The principal design of a pavement structure is based on the criterium fatigue failure, because this is the most expensive maintenance intervention. Especially because motorways are designed for a lifetime.RecommendationsThe development of truck platooning needs to be dealt with in a timely manner. Data needs to be collected with regard to the failure mechanisms in order to determine the impact and to develop a strategy. This can be done during the first use of the technology and during the regular maintenance intervals used for the current motorways. Rijkswaterstaat lacks the data required for predicting rut development in the current situation, because this failure mechanism has no priority.The impact of truck platooning on fatigue failure will result in maintenance in the form of structural interventions, if no measures are taken. Maintenance interventions in the deeper layers of the pavement structure are the most expensive ones. Applying Smart Lanes could be a solution for simulating lateral wander and organizing maintenance more efficiently.Performing a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) to determine whether the required interventions yield more than the costs that must be incurred for upgrading the infrastructure. This not only gives the government a clear overview of future costs as a result of truck platooning, but also a tool to determine whether truck platooning can be permitted on the roads. A positive result of a CBA analysis can therefore be used to get support from various stakeholders, to promote cooperation with different manufacturers and with the Market.DiscussionThree models were used to determine the impact of truck platooning on the pavement structure. The models were obtained through literature research and desk research.The rut development model is based on a number of measuring points generated during the LINTRACK tests on a full scale pavement structures. This tests contains a couple variables like temperature, speed of the tire and wheel load, which differ from practice. A correction has been made for the difference in the variables. The LINTRACK tests produced nine measuring points ,from which a regression line has been developed. More measuring points could be used to increase the accuracy of the regression line.The model which predicts raveling was developed by the New Zealand Transport Agency. As a result, this model does not fit perfectly on Dutch motorways. The model was developed for porous asphalt, but the wheel loads had to be adjusted. This research was conducted for motorways in the Netherlands with limited data.","truck platooning; Pavement; Failure mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This research provides a methodology on how to model, verify, calibrate and validate the humanitarian relief operations at an airport in an agent-based model, based on a case at the island of St Maarten after hurricane Irma in 2017. As the first step, domain knowledge was gained on the subject. This was done by interviewing people that were directly and indirectly involved, and by consulting media sources. Based on this domain information, the scope of the study was determined, including the airport, the organizations, the actors, and the operations and their bottlenecks. The model was then conceptualized based on this domain knowledge. The conceptual model was built by defining the environment, followed by the identification of actors and their responsibilities, internal processes, coordination of operations, and interactions. The next step was model formalization and implementation. This was a step-by-step process that also accounted for verification by analyzing emergent behaviour. Calibration and validation was done in an iterative manner to identify correct parameter settings by sensitivity analyses. These parameter settings result in model behavior that corresponds to real life scenarios. The performance indicators, parameter settings and emergent behaviour have been validated. This first step in the research domain of airport operations, humanitarian aid, and agent-based modelling provides insights that can be used for further research in understanding and improving complex operations at airports serving as a humanitarian hub.","agent-based modelling; humanitarian disaster; airports in disaster; airport operations; multi-agent systems; socio-technical systems; target prioritization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The electrolysis unit represents one of the largest financial and energetic costs in the system and is required to operate at 166 mA/cm2 under 2 V. In order to decrease the costs, ZEF is looking to synthesize highly efficient nickel-based electrodes to avoid using expensive noble-metal ones.<br/>The objective of this work was the synthesis of efficient and stable nickel-based electrodes. Two electrodes were synthesized through electrodeposition (Raney nickel and NiFe) and one was synthesized through hydrothermal treatment (NiFe-LDH) and were compared to a RuO2-containing (Permascand) electrode and to a smooth nickel electrode. On/off cycles for 2.5 hours were carried out to measure the stability of the electrodes. Additionally, performance tests in a pressure range of 1-5 bar were carried out to measure the effect of increasing pressure. The experiments were carried out in an in-house designed and built zero-gap alkaline electrolysis cell. <br/>Raney nickel, with a measured roughness factor of 150 was the best performing of the synthesized electrodes. After the stability tests, it was able to produce 166 mA/cm2 at 1.9 V (1.73 and 2.12 V for Permascand and smooth nickel, respectively). Raney nickel as anode material presented significant degradation. Raney nickel is the most promising material for HER, none of the synthesized materials presented significant stability for OER.<br/> From the nickel-iron electrodes, NiFe with a roughness factor of 19.5 presented the best performance of the synthesized materials with 2.04 V for the mentioned current density. NiFe presented significant degradation, especially as anode material. NiFe presented a relative high performance considering its low electrochemical active surface area attributed to the presence of highly efficient active sites. NiFe-LDH was quickly degraded during the tests as cathode and anode material.<br/>The pressure tests showed an inverse relationship between voltage and pressure. This hints that a decrease in bubble size with pressure is the cause behind the decrease in voltage. A simple model, based on experimental data and thermodynamic considerations, estimated that operating the cell at 50 bar reduces the voltage by 0.25 V compared to operation at 1 bar. The estimated reduction in voltage at a pressure of 50 bar would allow to operate the electrolysis cell under 2 V even with smooth nickel mesh as electrode.","Alkaline; Electrolysis; Nickel-based; electrodes; pressurized","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

One of the failure mechanisms which should be checked is the check on global buckling. This is a mechanism in which the deformation of the pile is enlarged due to the normal or vertical force. With the enlargement of the sheet pile, the soil must be displaced as well, which results in extra resistance against global buckling. However, the check to this mechanism stated by the Eurocode is based on the so called critical global buckling load, which is currently based on the stiffness of the sheet pile. The resistance delivered by the soil is fully neglected in the check on global buckling, which gives that it is thought that this check is too conservative. It is studied how the influence of the soil can be taken into account to the global buckling mechanism. This is done by describing the background of the current check, followed by stating possible methods to determine the influence of the soil. By the use of calculation program’s D-sheet pilling and Plaxis 2D, some examples are calculated in which the proposed methods are compared with the current method. From those examples, it was found that the check on global buckling might be significant lower if the influence of the soil is taken into account.","Global Buckling; Sheet piles; Influence of soil; Euler buckling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Air pollution is one of the contributors, CO2 emission is recognised as the biggest contributor to the increasing temperature of the Earth. Global warming is a controversial topic and actions are taken to reduce further rising of the temperature on Earth. The IMO has set limits for vessels on the emission of NOx and SOx. Currently, the IMO is negotiating on how to limit the emissions of CO2 to reach a reduction of 50% in comparison to 2008. The purpose of this research is to provide an emission model for TSHDs showing an emission profile (CO2, SOx and NOx) per cycle of operations, and present emission reduction methods. Within the emission model there are eight main parts that are connected and create the results. The results are shown per cycle of operation and are calculated per phase. The six main phases of a cycle of operation are: Loading, transit loaded, connecting, discharge, disconnecting and transit empty. The first part of the emission model determines the hull resistance. The second part consist of the trailing resistance. This part is split up into three more detailed segments: the calculations for the cutting force, cutting depth and trailing force. The trailing and hull resistance together form the total resistance within the loading phase. For the transit phases, only the hull resistance is used for the total resistance. With the total resistance known, the propeller is matched to the main engine in the third part. The fuel consumption and emitted emissions are calculated in the fourth and fifth part. The power requirement for the other engines, pumps and auxiliary equipment are calculated in part 6th through 8th. For each job, specific input is required for the calculations. Combining this input and the calculation parts, the emissions, fuel consumption and fuel cost are given per dredged m3.<br/>Five methods to reduce the emissions for TSHDs are researched. First, the type of power arrangement is researched. A mechanical power arrangement with a combined drive and a direct drive, an electrical power arrangement and a hybrid power arrangement are investigated. The variations of power arrangements are implemented on the Dodge Island. Second, the difference between a fixed (FPP) and controllable pitch propeller (CPP) is researched. Most modern day TSHDs use a CPP, as the efficiency during the wide variation of operating conditions is greater than a FPP. The third method to reduce the emissions is to find the optimal loading speed. The optimal speed is researched for a floating visor and a fixed visor. The most common solutions to comply to the limit of the SOx emission is using ultra low sulfur diesel or installing a scrubber. The fourth reduction method is focussed on the use of scrubbers. The most used types of scrubber are the dry, open loop, closed loop and hybrid scrubber. The last method to reduce the emissions is shutting off the engines when not in use. The trade-off is the wear of the engine. To verify the results of the emission model, the fuel consumption of multiple completed jobs is compared with the predictions of the emission model.","tshd; Dredger; emissions; model; reduction; Trailing suction hopper dredge; Methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-12","","","","Marine Technology","",""

It is the successor of the Xbloc. An important advantage of the XblocPlus is the relatively high construction speed compared to the Xbloc. The increased construction speed is caused by the possibility to place XblocPlus in a uniform pattern and the relatively large surface area that can be covered with a small number of blocks. A disadvantage of XblocPlus is the limited block stability at the top armour rows of a low crested structure. The limited stability is caused by the reduced interlocking capacity of the blocks on the top armour row. In previously performed studies, a back support is placed behind the blocks to stabilise the top armour row on the front slope. The back support of a concrete element significantly improves the stability of these armour blocks. However, at normative wave conditions, the stability of the top armour row on the front slope is still insufficient to meet the target stability (Ns,c = 3.0). The stability of the top row on the rear slope is not investigated in other studies. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn about the stability of the crest blocks on the rear slope. In this study, physical model tests in a wave flume were performed to assess the effect of crest modifications on the stability of the top armour rows on the front and rear slope. The main objective of this study is to design a stable breakwater crest that has the best hydraulic performance with respect to the economically most feasible breakwater dimensions. After an exploratory study into the meaning of the main objective, it can be concluded that a relative crest width of 1 is desirable. The relative crest width is determined as the ratio between the crest width (B) and the significant wave height Hs. The principle of previous studies is used to set a reference situation. This crest configuration contains a concrete element between the top armour rows that functions as a support. This is a rather wide structure with a relative crest width equal to 2.7. After testing the reference situation, the top row on the front slope turned out to be normative for the crest stability. The found stability at failure coincides with the stability found in previous studies. The blocks on the top row of the rear slope remained stable. Also after reduction of the crest width to a relative crest width of 1.9, the crest blocks on the rear slope remained stable while the crest blocks on the front slope failed. It can be concluded that the blocks on the top row of the front slope are normative for the crest stability. The weight of these blocks is too limited to meet the target stability. By application of modified XblocPlus blocks is attempted to obtain stable blocks on both top rows. The adjusted blocks are much bulkier and consequently heavier than the original XblocPlus blocks. The blocks shape is modified in such a way that the crest blocks on the front and rear slope can be placed back to back without the support of a crest element. As a result, the relative crest width is reduced to 1.1. Several variants of modified crest blocks are tested to acquire information about the stabilising effect of the applied modifications. Modified blocks with an increased permeability, an increased interlocking capacity and a relatively large resistance against rotational instability were tested. Overall, the bulky block shape, the block's permeability, and the interlocking generated by the almost vertical back of a block, appear to be very important for the crest stability. The acquired information of this first test series is used as a foundation for further optimisation of the permeable block. An attempt to optimise the modified block is done by reducing the volume at places that have the least impact on the block stability. Application of measures that streamline the block shape in flow direction and further increase the block’s permeability were applied in this optimisation phase. Finally, a block with a 44% larger volume than the original XblocPlus block is obtained that meets the target stability of Ns = 3.0.","Coastal Engineering; Breakwater; XblocPlus; Xbloc+; Crest; Stabiliteit; stability; Physical model tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Theforce of the muscle is dictated by the recruitment and the force output of the different motor units. The recruitmentis physiologically determined by the recruitment thresholds of the motor units, where motor units with a higher forceoutput are thought to have a higher recruitment threshold, conform Henneman’s orderly recruitment principle. Thegoal of this study was to predict the effects of the MU-threshold and MU-force output distributions on the excitation-force relation of a muscle. Assuming that a muscle’s excitation-force relation depends on the values of the motor unitproperties present in the muscle, the recruitment threshold and maximum force distributions among the motor unitscan be derived from muscle force recordings. To achieve the goal a computer model was build to simulate motor unitrecruitment and force production of a group of MUs with different (combinations) of MU-threshold and maximum MU-force output distributions. Both MU-threshold distribution and maximum MU-force output distribution of the musclewere mathematically varied between linear and exponential curves. Input of the muscle model was a linear increasingneural activation profile and the force output profile of the muscle was simulated. The resultant MU-activation andforce patterns were compared with published results of simultaneous MU-recruitment and force recordings obtainedfrom literature. The simulation results showed that the excitation-force profile does not show characteristics thatcan be linked to either the MU-threshold distribution or the MU-force output. As a consequence, force recordingsalone are not sufficient to estimate the recruitment threshold and maximum force distributions. However, the use of acomputer model in combination with additional recorded data such as (surface) electromygraphy (EMG) is expectedto show results from which estimating MU properties is possible.","motor unit; recruitment; force; distribution; excitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The radiation should target the tumor as visible in images, also called the macroscopic disease. There is, however, a risk of small, invisible groups of cancer cells in the area surrounding the macroscopic tumor, the microscopic disease. For an optimal clinical outcome of radiotherapy, the microscopic disease needs to be irradiated as well. In current treatment planning, the macroscopic tumor is extended with a margin to better ensure full disease coverage. Because there is uncertainty in the extent of the microscopic disease, also the margin definition is uncertain. Moreover, in current planning, the same margin is used for all patients, and there is no patient-specific exploration of the trade-offs between dose extensions to cover potentially present microscopic disease vs radiation-induced toxicity because of enhanced dose in organs at risk (OARs) surrounding the tumor. This study aimed to explore whether the margin concept could be replaced by more advanced, individualized approaches for irradiation of volumes just outside the macroscopic tumor. All plans were generated automatically to avoid bias by human planners and to reduce workload. Two novel treatment planning approaches were investigated. The first focused on increasing dose coverage of the microscopic disease while at the same time controlling the resulting increased dose to the healthy tissues surrounding the macroscopic tumor, including OARs. Several treatment plans were generated to explore a range of trade-offs between dose in microscopic disease and dose in OARs. The results showed that for optimal microscopic disease irradiation, both low and high OAR doses needed to worsen. However, the most significant increase in microscopic disease coverage could be obtained when accepting higher OAR low doses, that is generally less important for induction of negative side-effects.<br/>In the second approach, an expected Tumor Control Probability (expected TCP) cost function was used to control dose delivery in areas close to the macroscopic tumor. Basis of the expected TCP model was a function describing the probability of finding microscopic disease at a specific distance from the macroscopic tumor. The results again demonstrated opportunities to increase dose to areas close to the tumor, at the cost of enhanced doses in OARs. In conclusion, both approaches had a positive impact on microscopic disease dose coverage. However, improved irradiation of the microscopic disease was always at a price of enhanced dose in OARs. Complementary studies, involving clinicians, need to be carried out to investigate if and how the approaches could be used to replace the current planning with fixed margins.","radiotherapy; CTV margin; microscopic disease; tumor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Repair has become rare in societies with an abundance of cheap goods. However in recent years repair is making a gradual comeback in western culture. Citizen repair initiatives such as Repair Cafés have popped up in cities all over the world. They support people to fix their broken things. The increasing popularity of the ‘Maker Movement’ and 3D printing has allowed skilled individuals to create, share and produce their own spare parts for repair. While most modern makers also repair things, most repairers are not capable of making things using digital fabrication methods like 3D printing. To analyse why most repairers can’t use 3D printing and how the 3D printing process can be changed, the context of repairers, makers, 3D printing and reverse engineering was explored. The main findings were translated into design requirements that were used as guidelines in a conceptualisation process. During this phase multiple ideas were tested and iterated on in three different layers: information for repairers, physical tools for part measurement and communication with makers. After a number of iterations a final concept was proposed that enables repairers to ‘manually’ 3D scan an object, using a caliper, and digitally share it with makers so that they can support them in replicating the object through CAD modelling and 3D printing. The system was tested with a small group of repairers and discussed with experts. After implementing those insights, the final design is proposed. The final design is a product service system that consists of a toolkit for repairers and an online platform through which repairers can collaborate with makers on 3D printing for repair projects. The toolkit contains a CyberCaliper, which is a special caliper that makes it easier for repairers to ‘manually’ 3D scan their desired part and post it on the platform. The platform is designed to become the place to be for requesting 3D printed spare parts online.

It is an important challenge to save this data in a cheap and environmentally friendly way. The current methods to save archival data are sufficient, but improvements can be made. Synthetic DNA based data storage is a great choice to do so. DNA is (roughly) made out of four nucleotides, Adine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T). To save data using DNA the binary data is encoded to quaternary data and later DNA strands are created using this quaternary data. During the process of saving the data errors can occur. Previous research [3] has found that some errors can be prevented by taking two constraints into account.The no run-length constraint, which states that no DNA word can have two repeated symbolsand GC-weight constraint, which states that every DNA word must have a fixed number of G and C nucleotides. These constraints reduce the number of quaternary data sequences that can be used to save data. The aim of this thesis is to improve the lower bound on the maximum number of quaternary data sequences that satisfy the no run-length constraint, the fixed GC-weight and a minimum distance. Limbachiya et. al. [1] gave an algorithm to compute a set with a given minimum distance of quaternary data sequences that satisfies the constraints. The size of this set is the lower bound that we aim to improve. We do so by introducing two other algorithms that also compute a quaternary data sequences that satisfy the constraints and a minimum distance. The size of each computed set gives a lower bound on the maximum size. The lower bound computed with these two algorithms is always better or equal to the lower bound computed by Limbachiya et. al. for certain parameters. When the minimum distance of a code is 2 we know this maximum size. The formula for this maximum size is given in this thesis together with a proof for this formula.","Constant-weight codes; DNA-based data storage; runlength-limited sequences.","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Internal fixation is a ommon orthopaedic procedure that requires drilling to improve healing of bone fractures. Tight spaces around hard to reach bone fractures impede the surgeon during the procedure. As a result there is an increased risk of complications such as thermonecrosis, overshoot into soft tissue, micro-crack formation and drill bit breakage. Therefore, a novel procedure is proposed, where drilling is done using a compact Self-Feeding Angled Drill Attachment (SFADA). The SFADA is a crucial part of the new procedure, because it can generate a controlled feed in a onfined space. Four concepts were developed that met these functionalities. Based on the design specifications a final concept was selected. The concept based on a differential thread and a lead/lag bevel gear was deemed the most feasible. Materials and dimensions were assigned to the mechanism based on an analysis of the critical components. A compact demonstrator of 80x40x36 mm was built. Measurements were performed and the results showed the SFADA’s ability to perform controlled drilling in a confined space. Furthermore, the SFADA can generate a speed of 1500 rpm and feed of 1.5 mm/s, with load forces and torques up to respectively 20 N and 0.2 Nm. The design of the SFADA is an important step in the improvement of bone drilling at hard to reach bone sites.","Medical; Bone; Drilling; Mechatronics; Complications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The main purpose of this project is to get deeper understanding of sleep in cabin from passenger’s perspective, and try to use interactive design help them throughout the flight journey. This thesis project consists of five phases, context exploration, research, project redefinition, conceptualisation and verification. Most research activities were executed in the first two phases. During the context exploration phase, the goal is to gain basic knowledge and comprehensive information in aviation field, including the market trend, the stakeholders, and the contextual constraints. Therefore, the scope is relatively broad and literature research is the main method.<br/>After that, the research scope was gradually narrowed down based on the findings from the previous research, and the focus now is on long-haul flight passengers and sleep in various environment. Through desk research, several theory models were analysed. In order to gather opinion from different types of passengers, several user-centred methods were also used, like co-creation, online survey, field research. The insights from this phase benefit the next phases as solid evidence. Combining insights gathered from these research activities, a concrete project definition was obtained. The design goal is “to make passengers who want to have a nice sleep feel more in control during different phases in long-haul flights”. An interaction vision was also defined as “being in control”. Additionally, the specific requirements were listed as the evaluation criteria of concepts. In conceptualization stage, several rounds of ideation were performed to generate initial concepts. According to the requirements and the difficulty of the implement, one concept was chosen for further development. Then a low-fidelity wireframe was used to fast-iterate the concepts by walkthrough. The final concept was then concluded in the final phase of verification. The digitally interactive prototype was built for evaluation of the effectiveness and usability. The evaluation results were analysed to see whether the final design meets the design goal and how participants experience the design. Due to the restriction of the social distance policy, most offline activities were prohibited, more than half of the evaluation tests were done via internet. The future recommendation has also been proposed in the last stage. The design of phone application could be the starting point for the future development of the digital platform, connecting different journey phases for passengers. And the improvement on in-flight entertainment system might also be applied in the near future.","User experience design; In-Flight; Interactive Design; User-centred design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

With the sEMG system, we can research whether EMG signals can be used to measure muscle fatigue and how this relates to injury risk. This thesis aims to build a sensor node for sEMG to detect local muscle fatigue. An sEMG system is built for this purpose, and a physiological experiment is designed to collect sEMG signals from human muscle (Vastus Medialis) using the sEMG system. Both isometric and isotonic exercises are studied. The data analyzing method is calculating mean power spectrum frequency (MNF), median power spectrum frequency (MDF), and muscle fiber propagation velocity (MFPV) of the collected sEMG signals, because local muscle fatigue is related to MNF/MDF decrease and MFPV decrease. 5 groups of isometric exercise, wall-sit and 2 groups of isotonic exercise, cycling, are recorded. All the athletes are healthy males, around 25. The data analyzing result shows that MNF/MDF decrease is related to muscle fatigue, and MFPV changes similarly with MNF/MDF.","surface EMG; muscle fatigue; mean power spectrum frequency; median power spectrum frequency; muscle fiber propagation velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new category of recipes to be found on this website is the category of bio-based 3D printable materials. The first 3D printable material recipe to emerge in the database was developed at the TU Delft. Since then the recipe was further developed into an alginate mussel shell composite. It was time for the next step: How can more of these kinds of materials be developed? Are there any ‘universal truths’ to be found in developing these materials and how can makers/designers be guided in this process? To tackle this problem a multileveled analysis was performed. A literature review of 3D printing with bio-based materials showed that in different fields of expertise, ranging from the medical field to the field of food, the first steps had been made into printing with bio-based materials. Printing experiments were then performed with a selection of binder materials mentioned in these papers. With iota-Carrageenan and kappa-Carrageenan in combination with different kinds of fillers such as rice starch and ground cacao shell, succesfull prints were made. Furthermore, interesting hand-printing results were obtained with chitosan and alginate. More importantly, however, an indicative range of material ratios was found that could help future material developers save time in their search. Finally, some basic guidelines for the printer set-up regarding nozzle size, print head speed and extrusion speed were formulated based on the findings in the experiments. These results led, together with the insights gained from analyzing makerspaces, cookbooks and the Materiom website, to a design proposal for an online material development tool. Currently the Materiom website provides ready-made recipes. As noticed during the analysis phase, however, not every experiment leads to a complete recipe. Also, based on the experience of a material developer, complete recipes are not always what is needed. Recipes can be inflexible and hinder experimentation and innovation. The material development tool provides therefore room for data on different levels. This means that the community can share a larger amount of data and it leaves room for more experimentation and innovation. This idea is brought in practice by dividing data into three different parts: Material information, material compatibility information and complete recipes. Together with a formulaic recipe that gives a starting point for experimentation and printer set-up guidelines, material developers have a range of tools that they can use according to their needs and likings for new material development. And when the experiments have been carried out, the data can be shared with community even when the results were not satisfying and thus saving time of their successors.","bio-based; circular; makerspaces; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

One code snippet included the confusing pattern, while in the other, the pattern is avoided. Results showed us that these students also perceive the atoms of confusion as being more difficult to understand.

To restore the ecosystem and protect human livelihood this load should be reduced drastically. The enormous pollution rate is largely due to the massive amounts of mismanaged (plastic) waste at household level. This is the part of the waste that is either burned or dumped by the households, rather than collected or brought to a recycling facility. Extensive mismanagement of waste is an indication of an inadequate functioning waste management system. In Bali, and this watershed specifically, the existing system is decentralised and its waste management strategies rely heavily upon public participation. As a result, in some areas households have limited options regarding waste handling due to a lack of a collection system and other waste services. At the same time, households need to pay for those services. In order to improve the current waste management, it is therefore important to understand the trade-off made by the households between the environmental impact of plastic waste and cost of the waste management system.<br/><br/>In this report, this trade-off is studied by creating a real-world, coupled economic-environmentalmodel, of the Petanu’s watershed in the Gianyar regency. The model consists of two parts: 1) a production possibility frontier (PPF) and 2) a utility curve. The PPF is an arc curve that visualises the relation between the plastic waste load originating from households and the average impact on the monthly purchasing power of a household. The purchasing power is impacted since users of the waste management system need to pay for the services. The utility curve, on its turn, visualises a households trade-off between plastic waste load and impact on monthly purchasing power. Coupling these curves gives insights in how well the current waste management system satisfies the preference of the households regarding cost versus pollution rate. If the current waste management matches perfectly with these preferences, the point of tangency of both curves would be the location on the curve representing the current plasticwaste load and impact on the purchasing power. If the point of tangency has a lower plastic waste load and hence higher impact on purchasing power, households are willing to invest more in their waste management to improve the environmental quality of the Petanu river. <br/><br/>To gain insight in the trade-offs people make regarding four disposal methods (Self-Service, Pick-Up, Burn and Dump), cost and time, a stated choice experiment was set up. This is done by means of a questionnaire in which respondents were asked to make choices between hypothetical choice situations. The choice sets consist of different combinations of the disposal methods with varying attribute levels for cost and time. The survey has been conducted under 300 respondents from six different villages, located in the watershed of the Petanu river. With the help of data analysing program Biogeme, an open source Python package, the stated choice data has been transformed into the utility curve. Besides a general utility curve for the whole population living in the watershed of the Petanu river, also utility curves have been established for certain segments of the population, based on age, educational level and currently used disposal method. Hence, the questionnaire contained also questions about socio-demographic characteristics, the currently used disposal method and the corresponding cost. The latter two are not only used for the segmented utility curve but also for the creation of the PPF. The PPF is built-up by defining five different scenarios, i.e. the current situation, three scenarios with an improved waste management system and a scenario without a waste management system. The scenarios with an improved system have an increasedwaste collection rate or additional locationswhere recyclables can be handed in, in exchange for money. For all scenarios, the corresponding average cost per household and the plastic waste load in the Petanu river have been calculated. The quadratic best fit to these data points gives the PPF.<br/><br/>By combining the PPF with the general utility curve it was found that an average household in the watershed of the Petanu is willing to pay more for the waste management system than they are currently doing in order to decrease the plastic waste load in the Petanu river. It was even found that households want to achieve very low plastic waste load values and are willing to invest 47,400 IDR per month to reduce their contribution to plastic waste load by 100 grams per day. An exact equilibrium point is however not found as the PPF entails to many uncertainties at very low plastic waste load values. Nevertheless, the model gives a good indication and it is therefore recommended to increase the current collection rate of household waste. Furthermore, it is recommended to invest in TPS3R facilities in which waste is sorted and send to recycling facilities. Moreover, the combination of the PPF with the segmented utility curves gave some very interesting<br/>insides. First of all, the younger generation (· 31 years old) has a higher willingness to pay for the reduction of plastic waste load, than the older generation. This is likely the result of the awareness programs on waste management at schools. Hence, it is recommended to expand this educational program. Secondly, educational level is positively correlated with willingness to pay. Remarkably, income level and gender did not have a significant relation with willingness to pay. Lastly, time is a significant determinant for the choice of disposal method, which corresponds to a certain plastic waste load. Therefore, it is recommended that waste management at household level should be as time-efficient as possible. This means the collection should be as much as possible be done at the doorstep of the houses and recycling bins should be located close-by. <br/><br/>All in all, it has been demonstrated that the households in the watershed of the Petanu river are very willing to pay for the waste management services, however, current waste management options are too limited. It is now the task of the governmental institutions and community leaders to enable collection of waste for every household in every village.","Plastic Pollution; Utility Curve; Production Possibility Frontier","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering Consultancy Project | CIE4061-09","-8.335,115.088056"

Sea level rise, coastal flooding and shoreline erosion are contributing to loss of land, damages to infrastructure, ecosystem changes and exposure of historic sites with cultural value. The TWN are a First Nation, a recognized group of aboriginal people in Canada, and have lived in harmony on the lands and waters of the Burrard Inlet since time out of mind. As TWN has a sacred obligation to be caretakers of the land, they retained Kerr Wood Leidal (KWL) to conduct a climate change hazard and vulnerability assessment and to design a ten year climate change adaptation action plan. The existing conditions in the area are investigated from a technical, environmental and sociological point of view, including a study of the community context of the TWN. Climate change exposes the project area to hazards such as sea level rise, acidification and water temperature changes among others. After conducting a hazard assessment, the following climate change induced hazards are evaluated: Coastal flooding, coastal erosion, intertidal area change, ocean acidification, harmful algae blooms and other ocean conditions (water temperature, e.g.). The impact of waves and rising sea levels are assessed through an Xbeach model. The impact of harmful algae blooms and other ocean conditions are evaluated though literature research. The potential of four different approaches, varying from traditional to building with nature-based solutions, to mitigate the identified hazards are discussed: a rip rap, a nourishment, a salt marsh and a clam garden. They are evaluated based on technical, environmental, economic and social feasibility. For each alternative a trade-off exists between protection against the identified hazards – mainly between the ability of each of the solutions to prevent or mitigate coastal flooding and erosion while preserving the local ecosystem and intertidal area. All alternatives help the TWN in their own way and although further research has to be done, this report provides an insight in four possible alternatives that could support the process of developing a satisfactory solution for the coastal hazards that cause problems for the TWN people and their reserve.","Hydraulic Engineering; Coastal Engineering; Climate Change; Climate Adaptation; Building with Nature; Indigenous community; Environmental Engineering; Coastal erosion","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Project","49.309330, -122.988365"

These documents are a source of information on what aspects of a discussed product can be improved upon. These aspects are named drivers. CQM, the company in which the internship for which this thesis was written took place, has developed a tool in which reviews are manually annotated for a fixed set of drivers. The result is that for each driver, each review can be assigned a driver score. The driver score can be a positive or negative number, indicating with what sentiment the reviews discusses the driver, or left blank, meaning that the review does not discuss the driver. The goal of this work is to (partially) automate this process, so that, given the review, the driver scores can be predicted. The first step towards achieving this is creating a binary classification problem for every driver, where a binary variable can, for example, indicate whether a review discusses the driver or not. A step further is multinomial classification, where one can also distinguish whether a driver is discussed with positive or negative sentiment. The reviews are represented as variables, with every variable representing the use of a word. In this thesis, different forms for these variables are experimented with. With every variable representing a unique word, a large number of distinct predictors is offered for the classification problem. Given these predictors, two types of models are considered to solve the classification problem: Elastic net models and random forests. Both types of models need to be adapted for the class imbalance before they can be used for the classification problem of predicting the driver scores. The results of these models are evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and for the multinomial problem a multinomial generalisation, the AUCμ. These measures are chosen, because they are effective at evaluating the performance of our models in the context of the class imbalance. The results were ultimately evaluated for various variable forms and models. For the model we found that a random forest adapted to use stratified bootstrap samples to grow decision trees gave strong performance, especially when combined with variables that were given an indicator function form or normalized tf-idf form.","document classification; topic detection; sentiment detection; imbalanced classification problems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-26","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Considering the fact that 97% of water sources are these dams/reservoirs, it is obvious that İstanbul is vulnerable in terms of water supply without any alternative water supply. It can be indicated that the water that is supplied to the city is not being used efficiently. Even though the water comes from the taps are drinkable, according to a study made by Kanat (2017, 526-527) the use of tap water as potable water is 4% in the city. Furthermore, the treated wastewater is discharged to the Marmara Sea, and the Black Sea through Bosphorus Strait. Because of low water regeneration caused eutrophication of the Marmara Sea, higher effluent quality wastewater discharged in there, while the less advanced treated wastewaters are discharged to the Bosphorus Strait to reach the Black Sea by the currents (van Leeuwen &amp; Sjerps, 2016, 7-8). It can be concluded that the current water management of Istanbul has many technical problems that affects and will be affecting the everyday life of its inhabitants. Examples can be given to these water related problems as drought due to lack of available water, or nuisance due to precipitation. If these current practices continue, with the effects of climate change and the fast, uncontrolled urban growth, problems affecting daily life will get worse in future. ‘Modern Water’ understanding of today sees water as a service to be provided and makes it invisible to users, thus, causes lack of awareness, responsibility and loss of a socio-cultural value which is the meaning of water. While these problems could be answered by spatial solutions, lack of integration between infrastructural and urban design only enlarges the deficiencies. This research aims to discover the relation between the modern water understanding and the unsustainable water practices that currently exist in İstanbul. This is aimed to be done through questioning ‘Modern/Rationalized Water’ and discussing how this caused the abstraction of the socio-cultural aspect of water. The thesis mainly studies the spatial manifestation of this rationalized water that is reduced to be only a natural element of H2O especially in public spaces. This is done by creating a new approach to water related problems in cities, which is inspired by the newly introduced fields of Hydro-sociology and Socio-hydrology. This new approach that aims to preserve the cultural and the social meanings of water while understanding the hydrological cycle of a city is later combined with Urban Water Mass Balance analysis that provides the quantitative examination of the water cycle. After concluding that the natural drainage network of İstanbul is damaged and is under the pressure of the fast urbanization of the city while the trends in the planning still using outdated methods and technologies to control the situation. The needed new approach is studied in the scale of the Kagithane Creek Basin of the Metropolitan Area of İstanbul. The study continues with a proposed design for a specific location near the Kagithane Creek to discuss how this new approach can lead to design activities and change locals everyday experience of water in the city.The thesis concludes that changing the perspective on the water management by including social and cultural aspect to it, changes the way of finding solutions to the technical water management problems by making more integrated management principles necessary.","Urban water management; Istanbul; socio-hydrology; urban water metabolism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","41.097888, 28.979126"

However, its ability to deal with moving targets is known to be limited, as beam motion and target motion can reinforce each other, deteriorating the planned dose distribution in what is called the interplay effect. Literature concerning breathing motion usually investigates regular patterns. This work aims to investigate the magnitude of the interplay effect when considering irregular breathing signals. In silico calculations of dose distributions were made in the treatment planning system RayStation (version 7.99), using an XCAT phantom with 50 CT phases to model moving patient anatomy. An interplay calculator was included in RayStation, allowing calculation of disturbed doses based on a treatment plan and an irradiation time model for a proton therapy accelerator. The target investigated was a spherical liver tumour with 5cm diameter, irradiated with two beams delivering a prescription dose of 63 Gy. Plans without and with 5x layered repainting were created. Clinically realistic regular breathing patterns were generated to establish a baseline, after which irregularities were introduced. The basic form for all patterns was a sin^4 signal, with regular signal amplitudes ranging from 6 to 18 mm, period ranging from 3 to 4 s and phase between 0 and 2π rad. Considered irregularities were baseline shifts up to 34 mm, changing amplitudes between 6 and 18 mm, changing periods between 1.6 and 5.2 s and combinations. Evaluation was done by looking at dose homogeneity HI_5 and the fraction of the CTV volume that received a dose outside of the clinical limits of 95% and 107%, V_107/95. For the regular patterns, both a systematic and a randomised analysis were carried out. For irregular patterns, only a systematic analysis was carried out. The mean HI_5 was found to be 31% for regular patterns; the means of all irregular patterns stay below this, even though the size of the irregularities for some breathing patterns was very large. The mean V_107/95 was found to be 0.7 for regular patterns. Irregularities did not cause further deterioration. Five times layered repainting causes a statistically significant decrease in magnitude of the interplay effect across all breathing patterns by 50-80%, but is approximately 50% less effective against baseline shift than against other types of breathing. Interplay effect size correlates strongly with amplitude, but this correlation can be obscured because period and phase introduce very large variance. The interplay effect in general is large for investigated target size, prescription dose, beam configuration and machine performance. It can cause up to 100% of the CTV to receive a clinically unacceptable dose and lead to large inhomogeneities. Irregular breathing was not found to be notably worse. Repainting is effective, even against irregular breathing, but baseline shifts can undermine its effectiveness. Separately considering breathing irregularities for tumours similar to that investigated here is deemed of low importance; it is more important to properly model the magnitude of the interplay effect using an accurate, individualised breathing pattern.","Proton Therapy; Irregular breathing; Pencil beam scanning; Interplay effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Almost all CASs studied in literature are decentralized and developed for passenger vehicles or aviation applications. That makes them unsuitable for the mining environment. A centralized system can ensure optimal control, which means scenarios like intersections can be managed much better. This results in a decreased impact on production. It also increases acceptance, which means operators will be less inclined to turn off the CAS. For this reason, a centralized CAS for mining vehicles was developed. Literature shows that \ac{MILP} can create relatively accurate models that can be solved very fast. Since only linear constraints can be used, a new geometric model was formulated using four squares that are equally spaced on the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The vehicle dynamics are described using a linear model. When the optimization problem becomes infeasible, no control is issued to the vehicle. The construction of three different operation modes for the vehicle allow the algorithm to deal with the non linear event of a collision which would otherwise result in an infeasible problem. Weight can be assigned to individual vehicles to determine which vehicle should be prioritized or to model traffic situations. Simulations of six scenarios commonly encountered in mines, involving two vehicles, show that the system is able to avoid all collisions. When a third vehicle is added, collisions are still avoided but solution times increase exponentially. As simulation results were promising, the system was implemented on two test vehicles. Quantitative tests show that the optimization runs as fast using noisy real world data as it does using clean, artificially created data.","centralized control; collision avoidanec; MILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

With high water level at the toe, the sea embankment is likely to be overtopped and breached, finally resulting in inundation inland.  The objective of this research is to study climate change and land subsidence effects on Shanghai inland inundation due to dike overtopping and breaching under extreme weather condition.  A hydrodynamic model and a wave model have been established by Delft3D-FM and Delft3D respectively. Through validations on historical events, the hydrodynamic model and wave model are proved to be valid. The water level and wave condition along the coast, which are concerned as the results of these two models, are also essential inputs for overtopping and breach discharge calculation. In overtopping and breach discharge calculation, the threshold of breaching is estimated as an overtopping rate of 0.1 m3/m/s. The resulting overtopping and breach discharge gives the boundary condition of the overland simulation. The inundation map over Shanghai area can then be achieved by the overland simulation. A sensitivity analysis of the breach widths is also done.   Ten hypothetical typhoon events are provided by the Met Office Hadley Center under past and future climate conditions. These cases are applied to the whole process to study the effects of climate change on coastal flooding in Shanghai. The relative sea level rise is also considered for both past and future climate conditions.   The results show that places with high water level and low sea dike elevation are more likely to get high overtopping that can finally result in breaching. For Shanghai city, such vulnerable places can be found along Hangzhou Bay, especially in Jinshan District and the south-east corner of Shanghai. Besides, the entrance of Shanghai Yangtze River Tunnel is also vulnerable due to land subsidence. For some extreme cases, the whole Shanghai coast is in danger.  For the past climate and land elevation around the year 2000 with the wind speed return period of 1.3 yr and the breach width assumed to be 300 m, it is simulated that the maximum inundation area in Shanghai can be 1,805 km2 (33.3% of the simulated area in Shanghai). In the future, given the challenge of climate change and land subsidence, the sea level is relatively rising. The intensity of typhoon will generally strengthen. For the future climate and land elevation around the year 2100 with the wind speed return period of 4.5 yr, it is simulated that the inundation area in Shanghai can be 3,388 km2 (62.4% of the simulated area in Shanghai), which is almost twice of the inundation area around the year 2000.  The breach width also affects the inundation situation. If the breach width becomes larger, the inundation situation will be worse. However, as the breach width grows, the increase of the inundation area decreases.","Coastal flood modelling; Embankment breaches; Delft3D-FM; Shanghai; Climate change impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","31.23，121.47"

Profitable operation at an industrial scale requires high CO partial current densities, producing a CO-rich output, while keeping the energy consumption and the price of the electrolyser low. Conventional \ce{CO2} reduction (\ce{CO2}R) to CO electrolysers suffer from the competing hydrogen evolution (HEV) reaction and mass transport limitations. Therefore, they can produce a maximum CO partial current densities of 20 mA cm$^{-2}$. The current densities can be increased by working at higher pressures or using gas diffusion electrodes, but to date, both require high energy inputs. Therefore, we investigated the potential of using a flow-through electrolyser (FTE) to produce \ce{CO} partial current densities exceeding the 20 mA cm$^{-2}$, while keeping the potential attractive. Porous flow-through electrodes can overcome mass transport limitations by their large reactive surface area and their ability to decrease the diffusion boundary layer thickness. To obtain suitable porous electrodes, we electrodeposited Ag on microporous Ti substrates. We used an aqueous \ce{CO2}-saturated \ce{KHCO_3} solution, as a well-proven electrolyte for \ce{CO2}R to \ce{CO} on a Ag catalyst. Our FTE was capable of overcoming the mass transport limitations. In a one-off test, it produced a \ce{CO} partial current density of 100 mA cm$^{-2}$, at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 55 \%. We could reproduce \ce{CO} partial current densities of 60 mA cm$^{-2}$ at a FE of 25 \% in a 0.05 M \ce{KHCO_3} solution. We experienced a decrease in activity towards CO when using more concentrated electrolytes. However, high cell potentials of more than 5 V, were required to exceed \ce{CO} partial current densities of 20 mA cm$^{-2}$. The required high potentials can be ascribed to ohmic losses and low selectivities towards CO. We believe that the insufficient deposition of the Ag on the microporous Ti electrode was the main reason for the low selectivity. Implementing the improvements, that are mentioned in the report, could contribute to make the FTE a promising candidate to reduce \ce{CO2} to CO at an industrial scale effectively. ","Carbon dioxide reduction to carbon monoxide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been hypothesized that micropatterned adhesives – that contain features (e.g., pillars) separated by channels on their surface – have a better drainage capability compared to unpatterned adhesives. Nevertheless, the fluid flow behavior on micropatterned interfaces has not been analyzed before. In this work, the fluid flow on wet adhesive-substrate interfaces was captured on three focal planes and analyzed in terms of flow direction, flow trajectory and flow velocity. The aspect ratio and spacing ratio of the features on the micropatterned adhesives as well as the stiffness of the substrates were varied. Ultimately, the fluid flow velocity was related to the pull-off and friction forces of the adhesives on the substrates. From the results it appeared that the initiation of drainage through the channels of micropatterned adhesives is likely not the direct cause of changes in flow direction. A straight flow path and a semi-wave flow path are distinguished as the two main flow trajectories of the fluid flow. The flow velocity depends on the flow path width and the separation distance between the adhesive and the substrate: the flow velocity increases with a smaller flow path width, and is higher before than after adhesive-substrate contact was established. The flow velocity did not differ among the substrates, which could be the result of the effects of the stiffness and the wetting capability of the substrates cancelling each other out. Moreover, our results suggest that shear forces increase with a larger channel area and a smaller fluid volume, whereas this is not necessarily the case for pull-off forces. The outcomes of this study can be used to develop surfaces for the generation of strong grip under wet conditions.","Grip; Drainage; Pull-off; Friction; Wet interface; Micropatterned adhesives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The clothing supply chain is currently both complicated and polluting. Paired with rising quantities of clothing sales, technological solutions will only temporarily tackle the symptoms of a deeply rooted issue, namely mass-consumerism and underutilisation. How can fashion companies encourage consumers to use their current clothes more often whilst consuming less, in a way that’s also attractive from a business perspective? This project investigates the behavioural implications of creating such a sustainable clothing service. Research is conducted in the context of King Louie: a Dutch, vintage-inspired womenswear brand.<br/><br/>In-depth interviews and surveys focussing on women around their 30s have revealed the following:<br/>- Clothes can be appreciated due to functional needs (practical value or monetary/material value) or psychological needs (the value of self-expression, social levelling, having a hobby or aesthetics).<br/>- Most women reorganise their wardrobe bi-anually; this makes them reflect on clothes.<br/>- Friends and relatives can highly influence how clothes are valued and when new clothes are sought.<br/><br/>For most of these women, having and using clothes is part of a hobby and their identity, which increases the desire to own more clothes. These ‘Experiential clothing users’ would benefit from a clothing service that renews their clothes’ self-expression value through a social, qualitative experience... starting with a wardrobe re-organisation.<br/><br/><br/>Based on this, Re:Create was developed: a digital wardrobe and peer-to-peer styling app. This service was designed by using an interdisciplinary method, combining service design with behavioural science (using the Behaviour Change Wheel approach).<br/><br/>The behavioural science behind Re:Create focusses on the use of ‘Persuasion’, Modelling’ and ‘Training’. Furthermore, it taps into women’s sense of identity and takes them on an emotional self-discovery journey that emphasises on the value of self-expression.<br/><br/>The sustainability vision behind Re:Create is that women can ‘shop in their own wardrobe’ before purchasing something new; this stimulates product-life extension and the reduction of consumption. If ‘new’ garments are needed, Re:Create’s second-hand webshop encourages re-using someone else’s clothes as a means of collective product-life extension.<br/><br/>The business value of Re:Create is that it helps a cluster of high-quality, sustainable brands gain brand exposure and possibly meet new consumer segments through its ‘network effect’. In the future, revenue from a self-controlled second-hand market can elevate circular business model implications.<br/><br/>Testing the behavioural principles of Re:Create reveals that the app can indeed be an enjoyable and valuable service. Participants learned to re-value clothes they hadn’t worn in a while, by matching<br/>them in a different way. Although digitalising one’s wardrobe requires effort, women were willing to do this again in retrospect because the experience with Peer Stylists has given them a new perspective on their own wardrobe.<br/><br/>From a business and sustainability point of view, more research must be done in terms of viable partnerships that could help raise Re:Create to a fully sustainable yet financially-attractive level.<br","sustainable fashion; Circular Economy; Circular Business Model; Sustainable behavior change; Behavioural design; Behaviour Change Wheel; COM-B","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, in part due to these properties, spiking neurons possess high computa- tional power and high theoretical energy efficiency. This thesis introduces an online, supervised, and gradient-based learning algorithm for spiking neural networks. It is shown how gradients of temporal signals that influence spiking neurons can be calculated online as an eligibility trace. The trace rep- resents the temporal gradient as a single scalar value and is recursively updated at each consecutive iteration. Moreover, the learning method uses approximate error signals to simplify their calculation and make the error calculation compatible with online learning. In several experiments, it is shown that the algorithm can solve spatial credit assignment problems with short-term temporal dependencies in deep spiking neural networks. Potential approaches for improving the algorithm’s performance on long-term temporal credit assignment problems are also discussed.

One of the many efforts to reduce the increase of carbon dioxide, is to decarbonize the gas network by replacing natural gas with renewable gasses like green gas. Since the current gas network is not always suited for the injection of big green gas volumes, especially during summer periods, the process of decarbonizing the natural gas network requires adjustments of the current functioning of the gas network. Several technical adjustments for obtaining an increased green gas injection capacity exists, although, up to now, the potential green gas injection capacity obtained per solution was not known. Within this study, a dynamic gas network simulation model was developed wherein different gas network function strategies can be explored to obtain the potential green gas injection capacities. With the developed dynamic gas network simulation model one is capable to implement and simulate different gas distribution network configurations, specify green gas suppliers on the location of choice, simulate different gas demand scenarios and consumer profiles, adjust the city gate station pressure used for simulations of static- and dynamic pressure management, and to model the injection of excess green gas into a storage- and from the storage into the network. Within this study, the gas distribution network of Northeast Friesland, The Netherlands was analyzed on its green gas injection capacity after applying static pressure management, dynamic pressure management, and a pressure management strategy combined with storage. The gas network of Northeast Friesland was explicitly chosen since currently, green gas injection problems are experienced within this network. Following the results obtained from the simulations, a city gate station inlet pressure - demand table was defined. Within this table, the total gas demand measured within the network was plotted against the minimum city gate station inlet pressures, while still in compliance with the lower pressure boundary condition. Using this table, the optimal period to statically decrease- and increase the city gate station inlet pressures from 8.3 to 6.5 bar and from 6.5 bar to 8.3 bar, appeared to be respectively 1 May and 1 October. By changing the pressure to 6.5 bar, a safety margin of 1.5 bar was taken into account. For both static- and dynamic pressure management, green gas injection capacities ranging from 400 to 1600 m³/h, divided over three green gas suppliers, were analysed. The results were depicted against the total injectable hours, providing insight in the maximum green gas injection capacity while remaining eligible for the Stimulation of Sustainable Energy Production (SDE+) subsidy. Since with dynamic pressure management the city gate station can inject at lower inlet pressures, dynamic pressure management results in a greater green gas injection capacity. To point out, static pressure management provide 450 m³/h green gas injection capacity, whereas dynamic pressure management provides 650 m³/h green gas injection capacity without experiencing any injection problems.","Green gas; Gas network; Dynamic simulation; Biomethane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Shrinkage reducing agents (SRAs) can reduce the amount of drying shrinkage and improve the durability of the concrete structure. The mechanism of shrinkage reduction and the influences on the hydration process and development of mechanical properties of the SRA Sika Control 40 were researched. Shrinkage reducing agents lower the surface tension of water which reduces the capillary tensile stresses and ultimately reducing the drying shrinkage. Experiments were performed on cement paste samples to investigate influences on the hydration process of cement (surface tension, rate of hydration, porosity, shrinkage, flexural and compressive strength). In addition experiments were performed on concrete samples to investigate the influences of applying shrinkage reducing agents on the mechanical properties of concrete (compressive strength, shrinkage, elastic modulus). Overall, the experimental results showed that applying Sika Control 40 is an effective method for reducing drying shrinkage when concentrations of 1.56 w% and 2.61 w% are used. The shrinkage reducing agent has positive effects on the surface tension, weight loss and drying shrinkage for concentrations of 1.56 w% and 2.61 w% of cement. It has negative effects on rate and degree of hydration, porosity, pore size distribution, compressive and flexural strength for concentrations of 1.56 w% and 2.61 w%. The elastic modulus lacks adequate data to observe a trend, however the results are within the range of expected values for concrete for mixtures 156 and 261. , An SRA concentration of 0.52 w% of cement resulted in unpredictable and contradicting results.","Shrinkage reducing agent; Drying shrinkage; Concrete; Sika Control 40; SRA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

We propose a novel Privacy-preserving Model Predictive Controller (PMPC) where multiple agents are controlled by an untrusted external coordinator. By using the Paillier additively Homomorphic Encryption (HE) scheme, our PMPC allows the coordinator to solve a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem over encrypted data. The PMPC is based on a Projected Gradient Scheme (PGS) on the Lagrange-dual, which enables the use of quadratic<br/>cost functions with complicated constraints (e.g., constraints on linear combinations of states and inputs). Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed controller protects not only the states and inputs of the agents, but also the system models, cost function and constraints. Optimization problems with quadratic cost functions and linear constraints, form the basis of a wide class of Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. Examples of applications are smart-grids, large industrial plants and robotics. To test our PMPC, we focus on the application in self-driving vehicles. Motivated by the AUTOTRAC 2020 competition, we formulate a controller for multiple vehicles in a platoon. An external coordinator controls the longitudinal velocities of up to ten vehicles, while complicated constraints on the positions prevent collisions. By using our PMPC, the external coordinator does not gain access to the private data of the vehicles, protecting their privacy. Because of the wide application domain of MPC, we would like to extend this research in the future by testing the MPC on other applications as well.","Model Predictive Control; Homomorphic Encryption; Privacy control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

At this moment the wrist is mainly scanned and reviewed statically in 3D. However, it is desirable to see what happens on a CT scan during movement (the fourth dimension) of the wrist, as many clinically significant, debilitating and painful wrist pathologies are dynamic in nature and cannot be fully appreciated statically. Recently it has become technically feasible to have patients actively move their wrists in specific directions (e.g. flexion/extension or ulnar-/radial deviation) to create the fourth dimension, so that the wrist can be reviewed dynamically. However, according to S. Buckens (2019) active movements of the wrist are less desirable than passive movement as patients are typically able to (partly) compensate for wrist instability using forearm muscles, masking potentially significant pathology. During this project a suitable solution is designed to passively move the patient’s wrist in a precise and safe way in the gantry during scanning. Within the analysis phase, a context analysis and state of the art research resulted in six focus areas. Subsequently, in the research phase these focus areas were used to obtain optimal understanding of the product’s solution space and to create and evaluate possible solutions for the design problem. For the focus areas market- and literature research was conducted, various experts were consulted and prototypes were developed and tested. Based on the outcomes of all focus areas a set of design decisions was made throughout the project, eventually leading to the final design of the product. The product makes use of a cable-pulley system in combination with stepper motors which facilitate the desired passive wrist movements. Patients are able to place their arm on top of a standard, where special 3D printed parts (with an integrated adjustment mechanism) are able to fixate their forearm. Additionally, velcro straps are used to account for the variation in arm size. Furthermore, the patient’s hand can be fixated by another 3D printed part; again a velcro strap is used to improve fit and fixation. Electronic parts are integrated in the system to automate the movement, while at the same time allowing the radiologist and laboratory technicians to operate the product. A first evaluation showed that the product is able to facilitate the desired passive wrist movements and is able to fixate both the patient’s forearm and hand well. However, concerning future development the product should be improved on several aspects. Therefore, a set of recommendations is given together with a testing- and implementation plan for the hospital.","CT scanning; wrist pathology; passive movement; 4D CT scans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Defining what is healthy is person-specific, depending amongst others on a person’s health and responses to food. Supermarkets, which are considered highly influential in shaping the diet of customers, are starting to serve customers based on their health needs. This thesis explores how the Dutch supermarket chain Jumbo can tailor their service provision to the health-driven dietary needs of their customers and what implications and strategic advices are connected to this. The thesis focuses on customers with pre-diabetes. In pre-diabetes, blood glucose levels are elevated. People with elevated blood glucose levels have a high risk to develop diabetes type 2, which causes them to live in suboptimal health and simultaneously puts pressure on the care system. Although food is part of the cause to develop pre-diabetes, this thesis emphasizes the role food can play in the solution, namely: a healthy diet can prevent, delay, improve and reverse diet-related diseases. However, adopting a healthy diet is seen as complicated. Through a service design study, which involved participants who adopted a carbohydrate-restricted diet to manage their blood glucose levels, thoughts and emotions during the process of dietary change were translated into a customer journey that reveals multiple opportunities for service delivery to support healthy eating. In co-creation and co-reflection with participants, these opportunities led to the construction of a portfolio of concepts. Based on the insights of literature research, fieldwork and these co-creation activities, the work outlines several strategic advices and considerations for businesses that support healthy eating to establish services related to precision nutrition. The work concludes by emphasising the view of food-as-a-solution and describing how personalized services, by means of precision nutrition, are suggested to positively impact people, society and the business results. Therefore, the service design approach and outcomes outlined in the thesis inspire and stimulate Jumbo, and other businesses that support healthy eating, to take social responsibility by utilizing diet-as-a-solution to reduce and prevent diet-related diseases, and thereby contribute to the health of society, via group-based and personalized services.","precision nutrition; healthy eating; supermarket; diet; service-design; customer journey; pre-diabetes; health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

This was also the case for TMPs implemented in ‘Beter Benutten Vervolg’ (BBV), which was a program that executed hundreds of policy measures to get car users to avoid peak. That is why the research objective of this study is to gain insight into the impact of TMP configuration on the performance outputs of BPMs. The research methods for this study included a literature study, a practical knowledge study, a travel behavior questionnaire analysis and a data analysis of BPM data from BBV. The insights gained from the literature study and the practical knowledge study led to the formation hypotheses on a TMP configuration that could positively impact the performance outputs from a BMP within that package. These hypotheses were then tested using both the travel behavior questionnaire data and BPM data from BBV. Performing the two data analyses on the hypotheses, it is likely that when a BPM interacts with an IPM that incentivizes a switch to the same alternative mode, that BPM would have a higher degree of participation than an independently implemented BPM. It is also possible that a BPM in such a TMP configuration has a higher activity than an average BPM. Due to both performance outputs being positively impacted by the TMP configuration, it is assumed that the effectiveness from such a BPM would also be positively impacted by such a configuration. For the second hypothesis it is likely that when a BPM interacts with another BPM that incentivizes the switch to a different alternative mode, that BPM would have a lower degree of participation than an independently implemented BPM. It is however probable that a BPM in such a TMP configuration has a higher activity than an average BPM. Due to the degree of participation being negatively impacted and the activity being positively impacted by the TMP configuration it is not yet clear if the effectiveness of a BPM would be positively or negatively impacted by such a configuration. The results of this study led to two main policy implications. First, accompany a BPM with an infrastructural improvement that incentivizes the switch to the same mode.<br/>Car users would be more likely to participate in such a BPM and when they participate there is an indication that the activity in avoiding peak is also higher. Both of these performance outputs being positively impacted would also lead to a higher effectiveness of this BPM. Second, offering multiple options for the car users to avoid peak. Less car users would probably participate in such a BPM. The car users that do participate probably have a higher activity in avoiding peak. It is still unclear if how the effectiveness of such a BPM is impacted.","Traffic measure packages; Behavioral policy measures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The next Summer Olympics (postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 outbreak) will be held In Tokyo. The average heat and humidity during this period is respectively 35°C and 70 to 80%. This will put the athletes in risky situations due to the rise of the body temperature during the exercise. Goalkeepers in field hockey are especially prone to the heat since they have to wear thick insulating protective gear to keep them safe. A rise in body temperature can deteriorate their responsiveness, raising the chance of letting opponent score. The context of the goalkeeper has been analyzed for this specific weather situation. A set of cooling packs has been produced that can be placed under the trunk and spine area of the body protector, and under the sweatband inside the helmet. Compromises had to be made to satisfy the comfortability, mobility, cooling duration, safety and ease of use. The mobility of the goalkeeper had to stay as high as possible, therefore only spots were chosen that were already covered by an existing piece of protective gear. Insulating material has been added to one side of the cooling packs so that the user can choose for higher or lower intensity cooling depending on their preference. The active cooling duration for each cooling pack is no longer than half a match in order to keep the packs as light as possible. The packs thus had to be easily replaceable since they have to be replaced during halftime. The compartments of the cooling packs had to be connected to the surrounding compartments, allowing the cooling liquid to flow away during impact, resulting in higher durability of the product. The holes that connected the compartments could not be too wide, since the liquid would flow down due to gravity, resulting in uneven distribution of the cooling liquid throughout the pack. To help resolve this last issue, a thickening agent has been added to keep the cooling liquid distributed evenly. All materials inside the cooling packs are non-poisonous in case the cooling pack would fail for any reason. Multiple phase change materials have been tested. The final designs are filled with a mixture of ethanol, water, carboxymethyl cellulose (for an increased viscosity) and an edible blue coloring agent to give the perception of cooling. The trunk and head packs are sealed using a heated aluminum mold. The back cooling pack is sealed using a laser engraver. The trunk and head cooling packs have been tested on impact under the protective gear according to European regulation and could be manufactured and used immediately. The Back cooling pack has not been tested on impact since there is no regulation to protect the back of the goalkeeper. Under normal use this pack would also not fail.","Cooling; Sports; Equipment; Temperature and Humidity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-20","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Additive manufacturing presents a versatile, low-waste manufacturing method for functional materials. Self-healing polymers are a type of smart polymers that are able to mend damage, either by the incorporation of an encapsulated healing agent or by intrinsic polymer design. Beside this ability to repair damage, certain types of self-healing polymers have also shown to improve interlayer adhesion of 3D printed parts due to the formation of reversible cross-links. This thesis demonstrated the additive manufacturing of a self-healing polyurethane (CR1) by fused deposition modelling. A protocol was established in order to print with this self-healing polyurethane while minimising material loss. Measurable polymer properties that were relevant to fused deposition modelling were identified and measured in order to establish the processing window of the polymer. CR1 was synthesised, processed into a filament using a commercial filament maker and successfully printed using a modified commercial 3D printer. The elastomeric nature of the polymer combined with its high sensitivity to temperature, resulted in a narrow printing window. Beside the ability to 3D print the polymer into rectangular bars, the self-supportability of the 3D printed CR1 was demonstrated by the printing of a single-wall structure. Printing at 230 °C and 20 mm/s resulted in the most regular sample, with a very low void concentration in its cross-section. The mechanical response of 3D printed CR1 showed good resemblance to that of the bulk. Furthermore, the test showed that the polymer retained its self-healing ability after printing.","additive manufacturing; self-healing; polyurethane; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-20","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Obtaining accurate predictions of crack path and fatigue life assessment were the main objectives for this thesis. As 3D crack propagation modelling in orthotropic steel decks is an arduous task, simpler studies were examined first in order to obtain confidence for the task at hand. These studies are comprised of a through thickness crack in an asymmetrical four point bending specimen and a semi-elliptical crack in a centre cracked plate. Furthermore, studies on computational fracture mechanics and the integration of Python scripting language with Abaqus were conducted for numerical analysis of crack propagation in complex structures. The extended finite element method was used for evaluation of contour integrals of a crack with a constant mesh throughout the propagation analysis. Post-treatment of the results was applied by smoothing stress intensity factors and the shape of the crack front. Moreover, inaccurate contour integral results were excluded from analysis through extrapolation. A Python code was developed for updating the crack front for a given number of loading cycles integrated in Paris' law. The investigated crack was located at the rib-to-crossbeam joint of an OSD. Here, crack propagation occurs along the lower weld toe and in the longitudinal direction of the rib. Validation of results was obtained through experimental studies conducted at the TU Delft laboratory. The weld geometry was incorporated in the model from measurements in order to identify local stresses. Finally, results of strain gauges were used to validate the model. Measurements of the experimental crack growth were obtained at the surface of the crack only. Consequently, assumptions were made of both the depth and shape of the crack in the thickness direction of the rib. A semi-elliptical crack shape was selected with an initial crack depth of 1 mm. Initially, Paris law parameters C and m were selected as recommended by BS7910. The numerical results of crack path complied with those of experimental results, with deviations of no more than 1 mm. Both data sets show that the propagation rate remained somewhat constant. On the other hand, fatigue life assessment results showed stronger deviation. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of the initial crack depth. Three different cases were examined for which the initial crack depths were selected as 1, 2 and 3 mm. Varying the initial crack depth did not lead to a significant change in crack path at the surface of the rib, while the depth in the thickness direction was affected. Regarding the fatigue life assessment, the results with respect to an initial crack depth of 1 mm, complied best with experimental results. Given the strong correlation between experimental and numerical results, the methodology followed in this thesis has proven valuable regarding fatigue crack modelling. As the methodology is based on fracture mechanics, an initial crack is required prior to evaluation. Consequently, the application in engineering practices lies in re-evaluation of structures. Moreover, as the parameters in crack propagation relations have a significant influence on the fatigue life assessment, these should be carefully chosen. Therefore, more insights must be obtained regarding the selection of such parameters.","Fracture mechanics; OSD; Orthotropic steel deck; Crack propagation; Crack growth; LEFM; Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

(graduation committee); Kleijn, C.R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Welding is an extensively used technology by different industries such as aerospace, automotive and marine industry. Welding involves the temporal melting of materials in order to join them together. The quality of the weld is known to depend on the fluid flow and heat transfer in the material. A way to influence the heat transfer and fluid flow, and thus the quality of the weld, is by using different power-density distributions. However, the current literature falls short when combining the different power-density distributions with weld pool behaviour. The aim of this thesis is to study the effects of laser power-density distribution on heat and fluid flow in molten metal melting pools. This will be done by running weld pool simulations using a 2D axisymmetric, flat surface model. These simulations use a top-hat, Gaussian or doughnut laser power-density distribution. Besides, the cases have been simulated for a 20 ppm and a 150 ppm sulfur concentration. That the sulfur concentration has an influence on the weld pool shape was already shown in previous studies. However, it was not known how much the influence of sulfur concentrations varied for different laser power-density distributions. The laser power-density distributions are found to have a significant influence on the weld pool shape. The doughnut power-density distribution created a three times deeper weld pool than the Gaussian and top-hat power-density distribution. The maximum temperature of the weld pool was also influenced by the power-density distribution. In the case with a sulfur concentration of 20 ppm a discrepancy of 1000 K has been found between the Gaussian and doughnut distribution. The influence of sulfur concentrations varied for different laser power-density distributions. This influence of the sulfur concentrations has been measured through the difference in aspect ratio for different sulfur concentration cases. For both the top-hat and Gaussian power-density distribution, the aspect ratio differed 0.02 when using a 20 ppm versus a 150 ppm sulfur concentrations. The doughnut power-density distribution reached a higher difference in aspect ratio of 0.1 when using a 20 ppm versus a 150 ppm sulfur concentrations. The use of different power-density distributions in weld pool simulations results in different weld pool behaviour. Besides, the combination of different sulfur concentrations with power-density distributions largely influenced shape, temperature and fluid flow of the weld pool, which results in a great variation of weld pool shapes and sizes. Because there are different requirements for different welding cases, these results are useful in order to construct a quality weld.","Welding; ANSYS; Power-density distribution; Sulfur concentration; heat transfer; Fluid flow; Computer fluid dynamics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","","","","","",""

A proven relationship between the muscle activation around the elbow joint and its capacity to compensate for the external valgus moment during a baseball pitch allows predicting the likelihood of a UCL injury within pitchers in the future.<br/><br/>The present study establishes the generic muscle activity around the elbow joint during a fastball baseball pitch to investigate the capacity of the muscles to compensate for the external valgus moment actively and thereby prevent a UCL injury.<br/>Six uninjured, experienced recreational adult pitchers, participated in this study (age: 25 ± 2 years; body height: 188 ± 10 cm; body mass: 77 ± 15 kg). 2000 Hz surface ElectroMyoGraphy (sEMG) was used to measure the muscle activity around the elbow joint in 15 fastball pitches for each participant. Before the pitch measurement, participants had to perform maximum voluntary contractions (MVC).<br/><br/>The signals were corrected to an electromechanical delay of 50 ms and normalized to either MVC, or to the maximum of the signal itself. After that, the mean values were calculated for the instance of foot contact, maximum external rotation and ball release separately over the participants. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to observe whether the mean activity is significantly higher at maximum external rotation compared to the moment of foot contact and ball release to compensate for the peak external valgus moment.<br/><br/>Significant peak activity was found at maximum external rotation for all muscles, compared to the instance of ball release. The parallel activity of the flexor pronator mass and m. pronator teres at maximum external rotation enhances a compensating effect to the external valgus moment by its directly counteracting tension. Furthermore, the results support a co-contraction between the flexor pronator mass:extensor supinator mass and m. triceps lateral head: m. biceps brachii muscle pairs to compensate for the external valgus moment by a compression force to the elbow joint. The generic function of the m. anconeus in the fastball baseball pitch is still debated due to the inconsistent results over the different pitchers in this study.<br/><br/>This study provides evidence that the muscles around the elbow joint can compensate for the external valgus moment during a fastball pitch. These results provide possibilities for using sEMG to assess the muscle activation pattern of individual pitchers as support to predict and prevent UCL injuries in pitchers in the future.","UCL; EMG; Elbow; Injury; Sports engineering; Baseball; Pitching; valgus torque; muscles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Such activities can be extracted by estimating human pose via a visual capture of the scene. This work uses a top-view depth camera in an ICU room to estimate pose of the non-patient stakeholders. The top-view leads to self-occlusions of body joints and thus poses a challenge for estimation of complete human pose. In addition, the presence of multiple persons in the room poses a secondary challenge, as detected body-joints need to be parsed into individual poses. To address these challenges, a 3D point cloud is extracted from the top-view depth image and passed through a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This baseline method is capable of estimating both body-joints and body-parts to eventually output human pose for multiple persons. To improve the quality of output poses, the baseline method can benefit from additional spatial context since the problem of human pose estimation has a highly structured output. The proposed techniques either increase the receptive field, perform feature extraction at multiple scales or change the order of data processing. An increase in F1-score for the proposed methods highlights the importance of additional spatial context as a crucial tool to improve the performance of pose estimation models.","3D Human Pose Estimation; Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Convolutional Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","","","","Computer Science","",""

However, there is still a lack of clarity about the conditions under which a geothermal system can be used sustainably. This study investigates the sustainable use of a geothermal system. The geothermal production process in a homogeneous geothermal reservoir with one doublet was simulated using SEAWAT. This model provides the possibility to conduct a sensitivity analysis to examine which parameters play an important role in the geothermal production process. The aim of this analysis was to asses the effect on the well temperature and the thermal recharge, i.e. heat flow from the confining layers towards the reservoir. The tested parameters include four geological uncertainties and two production parameters. From the tested geological uncertainties the thickness of the reservoir has the largest effect on the production profile. Also, it has an impact on the effect of all the other parameters tested, especially on the effect of the confining layers. The confining layers play an important role during the simulation of the production process because they control the thermal recharge, and this enhances the lifetime of the geothermal project. The thinner the reservoir, the larger is the effect of the confining layers and the change in its properties and the more impact the thermal recharge has on the production profile. By examining the effect of the production parameters, the aim was to define a sustainable production design and strategy. It was proven that the production rate has a large impact on the lifetime of a geothermal project, and that an increasing well spacing enhances the sustainable use of a geothermal system. To enhance the sustainable extraction of geothermal energy from a geothermal system the production rate should be kept low. When making a production optimisation two rules of thumb apply to maintain a sustainable production. The first rule says that with a doubling of the reservoir thickness, the production rate can be increased by approximately 50%. The second rule says that with an increase of well spacing of 20%, the production rate can be increased by approximately 50%. Overall, this study emphasizes the positive effect of thermal recharge on the production profile and its enhancement on the sustainable use of a geothermal system. We can conclude that with a sustainable production design and strategy the production from a geothermal system can continue for generations.","Geothermal Energy; Sustainability; SEAWAT; Geological uncertainties; Production optimisation; Thermal recharge; Renewable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

SDOZ is a refinery of vegetable based oils. The goal of this thesis is to optimize the scheduling of the Refined Oil Storage (ROS) of the refinery. This is done because within the company it is suspected that the current way of assigning the tanks, that is reactively by hand, is severely limiting the amount of usable free storage volume within the ROS. By increasing the amount of usable volume within the ROS, the production in the refinery, and therefore its profits, could be increased. This thesis starts out by analysing the exact scheduling problem at SDOZ. This information was then used to compare multiple scheduling optimisation methods from the literature in order to find the best applicable method. This was ""A novel network-based continuous-time representation for process scheduling"". The report continues by verifying this method, by reproducing example cases included in the literature. During these reproductions some issues were found, which were resolved by making modifications to the method. The next step was to improve the method to better suit the method to be used to schedule the SDOZ ROS. This was done by creating additions, which included the use of loading spots, the use of preloaders, and the need for quality checks. The complete method, including all features of the literature, and the additions made in this thesis, was verified after which it was validated. In the validation the developed method was compared to the current situation at SDOZ. This comparison showed that using the method developed in this thesis can improve the amount of usable free storage volume within the ROS significantly. It is therefore recommended for the company to implement the developed method. In this thesis the first steps needed in order to apply the method to the ROS of SDOZ are taken. In future research this could be used to completely optimise the scheduling of the ROS, something that was due to calculation power limitations, not yet possible in this research.","Optimisation; Scheduling; MILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","","51.8079445, 4.6378353"

However, flooding has recently been occurring more often than before. As a result, engineers have collaborated to come up with a potential solution to the flooding. This solution, a mobile barrier known as the Experimental Electromechanical Module (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, or Mo.S.E.) has been in progress for quite some time now and is therefore still not functional. On 12 November 2019, an extreme high water level event occurredwith the second highest recorded water level in history. The flooding event should have been prevented by the construction by a flap gate storm surge barrier, a project started after the 1966 historical high water event, which takes the name of Mo.S.E. project. In this paper, the 2019 event is analyzed, investigating the causes of the event and the design criteria of the Mo.S.E. barrier project in terms of its structure, construction process and completion state at the time of the event.The meteorological and hydrological causes of the 12 November 2019 is studied to better understand what caused the event. If the causes of an event are understood, a solution to similar future events can be more easily determined. Historic waterlevel data is used to better understand the hydraulic conditions within the Venice Lagoon. Existing research projects that utilized similar data are studied to estimate the return periods considered in the design of the Mo.S.E. barrier. The return period for the 12 November event (187 cm) was found to be about 130 –140 years. The return period for the water level at which the Mo.S.E. barrier is designed to be fully closed (110 cm) is 5 –7 years. The effects of climate change and subsequent eustacy are also analyzed to determine how this would affect the return periods of both the 12 November 2019 event and the barrier closure level. Analysis of estimated future return period data predicted thatthe return period range for the 12 November event would decrease from 130 –140 years to50 –100 years while the return period range for the Mo.S.E. barrier closure would decrease from 5 –7 years to 2 –5 years. An estimation of the flooded buildings and roads is made. Surface elevation data is compared with the water level of the November 2019 flood event. In this way information is gained about what areas were flooded. By using downloaded from Open Street Maps, information about all buildings and roads, including their location, are obtained. Analyzing this data results in information about what buildings and roads are flooded. These results, together with numbers of damage per flooded object, are used to make an estimation of the total direct damage due to the flood event. The estimated total direct damage amounts to €870 million.The estimated damage to cultural heritage amounts to €244 million. Also, the case was investigated in which the Mo.S.E. barrier would have been operational during the November 2019 flood event. If the barrier had closed, the total direct damage would have been€257 million.Conclusively, an analysis of the management system of the Riequilibrio E Ambiente (REA, Lit. Rebalance and Environment) mega-project and the Mo.S.E. project is conducted to visualize the main failures and delay causes which lead to the circumstances of incompletion of the barrier at the time of the 2019 flood event. Through a careful analysis of the main events and technical problems encountered throughout the planning and construction of the barrier, the leading cause of delay is found to be political corruption, along with uncareful definition of project objectives and extreme levels of project complexity. Currently, the completion of the storm surge barrier is scheduled to be at the end of 2021. In 2019, the construction of the barrier wasfound to be completed at its 94%, signifying an 8-year delay past the original completion date of 2012, which was determined at the begging of the construction works in 2005. The Mo.S.E. barrier project is merely one part of a much larger mega-project designed for the safeguard of Venice which was meant to be completed in 1985. While the Mo.S.E. barrier is delayed almost 8 years, the entire project is delayed by a total of 26 years.It is recommended to direct further researches to future impact, considering climate change, and the amount of damage for certain return periods and the impact of the Mo.S.E. barrier on this last. Hence data collection making damage estimations more accurate, internal corruption prevention and management within large infrastructure works and feasible optimizations solutions to apply to the Mo.S.E. barrier in order to face sea level ris","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Project",""

The single pile settlements (s1), are generated due to mobilised shaft friction and pile tip resistance. These settlements are determined with analytical methods (i.e. NEN 9997-1, 2017). Settlements related to pile group behaviour in soil layers below pile tip level (s2) are calculated with the equivalent raft approach i.e. Tomlinson (1977). However, an essential aspect for differential settlement calculations is the redistribution of loads by soil-structure interaction mechanisms, which are not currently incorporated in the calculation approach. A missing factor for a soil-structure interaction calculation is the lack of soil- displacement installation effects in the numerical methods for single pile behaviour. Therefore, this research is focussed on the implementation of a soil displacement single pile behaviour in PLAXIS 3D and thereby towards integration of the structural and geotechnical design in one calculation method for appropriate soil subgrade reactions and load redistribution. In this research numerical methods are used in combination with the embedded beam approach applied in PLAXIS 3D. To approximate the NEN9997 load-displacement behaviour of soil displacement single piles, the behaviour of the embedded beam in combination with the multi-linear shaft friction is fitted in PLAXIS 3D. The fit is conducted by increasing the stiffness of a soil volume below pile tip level. Which does account for the residual stresses after pile installation. The solution of this fit consists of two parts: improvements on behalf of the new embedded beam formulation after Smulders (2018) and a soil stiffness fit below pile tip level. Regarding the new embedded beam formulation, improvements have been determined on mesh-dependency and a stiffer load-displacement response. The fit method performs well in combination with the embedded beams while approaching the load-displacement response of soil-displacement piles according to NEN9997. However, the ultimate bearing capacity of the embedded pile should still be calculated with D-Foundations (analytical method based on NEN9997). In the pile group calculation, the behaviour of single piles is extrapolated to all piles in the PLAXIS 3D model. A plate element is modelled on top of the pile heads to achieve a redistribution of loads due to the overlying superstructure. In this way, the single pile behaviour and bending stiffness of the superstructure is implemented in the PLAXIS 3D model, and the soil-structure interaction calculation is possible. However, group effects due to the soil displacement installation method are only partly covered in this approach. The reduction or increase in skin resistance in pile groups is not covered since, the predefined maximum skin friction capacity is manually inserted as an input parameter and it is not an outcome of the PLAXIS 3D calculation. Afterwards, the proposed framework is applied to a practical case study including measurement data of a high-rise project in Amsterdam. The proposed framework turned out to capture soil-structure interaction properly by taking into account a part of the superstructure bending stiffness and single pile behaviour. Compared to current calculation approaches, complex soil behaviour is captured in redistribution of the loads. However, the calculated settlements are still deviating from the measurement data. A probable explanation for the discrepancy is the shift in applied load over time in PLAXIS 3D relative to the real construction process. In conclusion, an improvement in terms of modelling soil-structure interaction has been achieved by incorporating single pile behaviour and superstructure bending stiffness in PLAXIS 3D. Therefore, the possibilities of linking the structural design to the geotechnical design in an early stage of the design process will be feasible. Combining the designs in an early stage, the structural dimensions of columns and beams are calculated with appropriate soil subgrade reactions and load redistributions by the soil. However, it is recommended to apply more investigation on the behaviour of soil- displacement pile (groups) in combination with embedded beams because, group effects are still not completely incorporated.","Pile foundations; Embedded piles; Soil-structure interaction; PLAXIS 3D; Soil displacement piles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

These waste piles consist of different waste rocks without any value and ore that was processed incorrectly. This method, if proven eective, will be used on mine waste from different commodities all over the world. However, there will be started with the waste pile Halde Haniel in the Ruhr area in Germany. The Ruhr area has been selected because of the manageable travelling time from Delft, the long history of coal mining activities in the area and the open-access of the waste pile. The thriving days of coal mining have left us with large amounts of waste piles (170 waste piles in the Ruhr area). Therefore, it will be essential to know if these waste piles have an impact on the environment by emitting gamma radiation. In Europe, this problem has not been addressed. However, in other countries, these waste piles are the cause of increased health risks. The Halde Haniel waste pile is a human-made object and consist mainly of shale, sandstone and bits of coal. Gamma-ray spectrometry is often used to determine lithology of a rock formation. To determine the lithology measurements are done on outcrops present in nature. In most literature gamma-ray spectrometry is used to determine the lithology of rock formations. However, in this research, the measuring location is a human-made object, which has destroyed the natural sequencing of the rocks. Therefore, the measurements taken on the Halde Haniel makes the research more challenging. Therefore, the accuracy of the measurements done on a site consisting of multiple rocks, such as the Halde Haniel, are essential to know in order to apply this method in future research. Field measurements were taken for two dierent reasons. First, a control study was executed in the Green Village in Delft. The main goal of these measurements was to select a correct measuring time for the measurements at the Halde Haniel waste pile. The rest of the measurements were done at the Halde Haniel waste pile. At the Halde Haniel waste pile, four dierent measuring locations were selected. From the results can be concluded that the amount of gamma radiation emitted from the Halde Haniel waste pile is higher than at a location without mining activities. However, this increase is still not high enough to result in health risks. The measuring error could not be determined to a satisfactory standard, because of the lack of soil moisture samples and the signicant impact of soil moisture on the error of measurements. Gamma-ray spectrometry should be supported with information about the lithology and the chemical composition of the rocks, because otherwise nding value in waste piles will be hard.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to design and evaluate an automated tourniquet for a fully-automated venipuncture device. In this study, two concepts were explored. The elastic tourniquet uses a strap tightened by an electric motor. The pneumatic tourniquet uses an air filled bladder, which is inflated to a standardized pressure. Both prototypes were realised and verified according to the system requirements. After verification a validation was conducted with seventeen participants, to determine usability and test user requirements. The participants used both prototypes and scored them on ease of use, comfort and sense of safety. Both prototypes did not meet three out of nineteen requirements during verification, but the shortcomings were deemed only minor. Both prototypes were considered easy to use, reasonably comfortable and instilled subjects with a high sense of safety. The pneumatic prototype scored slightly higher on comfort and safety. Users were able to apply the elastic tourniquet significantly faster and less mechanical noise was produced during operation. This study shows that it may be possible to implement automated tourniquets in fully-automated venipuncture devices in the near future. I conclude that the elastic prototype is best suited for automated phlebotomy. The shortcomings can be solved with little difficulty, whilst the design is less complex and more scalable.

Deep sea minerals exist in different forms at the bottom of the ocean. In this research, polymetallic or manganese nodules are the kind that are of interest. The nodules are 1 to 12 cm large and contain a variety of minerals like copper, nickel and cobalt, but owe their name to its main component manganese. The region with the highest approximated resource of polymetallic nodules is the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), situated in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico. The CCZ has water depth reaching 6000 meters, which is a significantly larger working depth than state-of-the-art deep sea projects within the offshore industry. These depths are accompanied by challenging environmental conditions exerted on the deep sea mining system. A deep sea mining system typically consists out of three components: 1) Production Support Vessel (PSV), 2) Vertical Transport System (VTS) and 3) Seafloor Production Tool (SPT). The SPT harvests the nodules from the seabed, the VTS transports the mined nodules through the water column to the surface where they are transferred to the PSV. The focus in this thesis will be on the Vertical Transport System. Where most deep-sea mining developments are considering hydraulic vertical transport with a riser, Boskalis introduces a concept that utilizes mechanical lifting for the vertical transport. This allows for energy efficient transport, relative simplicity of concept and a maximization of the amount of power units above water. The objective of this thesis is captured in the following research question: What is the behaviour of the combined mining system (ropes, skip and SPT) during vertical transportation by means of mechanical lifting? To answer this question, a wide overview is given of the deep-sea minerals that exist on the seafloor and the existing technologies to harvest them. Whilst the system is in principle relatively simple (just two containers (skips) that are alternatingly filled, hoisted to the surface, emptied and lowered again) many challenges arise. To identify these challenges, the system and the production cycle are discussed in detail. Literature research has been done to ensure realistic modelling of characteristics like structural damping of the rope, drag forces and added mass. The safe working load of steel wires is mostly consumed by its self-weight at a length of 4000 meters, making them unsuitable for deep-sea mining. Instead, the less common but naturally buoyant synthetic fibre rope is envisioned. Many of the challenges in this deep-sea mining system originate from the environment as the system is subject to wave action and currents. Therefore, the current profile and wave spectrum typical for the Clarion-Clipperton Zone are obtained to serve as input for further investigation in the hydrodynamic analysis software Orcaflex. The system will be deployed over the entire 6000 m water column, causing the current but also the forward velocity of the system to possibly lead to high drag forces. A reduction of the forward velocity by introducing a new harvesting method is implemented, resulting in a large reduction of the drag forces and offset. The system consists of at least eight ropes, with two moving skips. Combined with the current and vessel motion, rope entanglement is a risk. A solution to prevent the rope entanglement is presented in this thesis. Possible occurrence of vortex-induced-vibrations (VIV) is identified and future research is recommended. The offset analysis shows that a large offset (500m) between the PSV and SPT results in relatively low horizontal forces on the harvester. The system is connected to the PSV, which is subjected to the Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum environment it is situated in, resulting in vessel motions. These motions will govern the dynamic behaviour of the system. The skips with attached fibre ropes have different eigenfrequencies on different water depths, as a longer rope will make for a softer system. This causes both skips, full and empty, to resonate in some regions. Consequently, the dynamic tension in the ropes is higher than the static tension, although it does not come forward as problematic. However, undesired slack rope conditions can occur when lowering the empty skip. To conclude, an analysis of the deep-sea mining system has been done in which the eventual design has been modelled to the best extent currently possible. This research underlines the technical feasibility of this deep-sea mining concept. This research also evaluates the questions that have not been answered yet and recommends a variety of interesting topics for future research.","Deep-Sea Mining; Vertical transport; hydrodynamic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-15","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

These cyclic loads can cause fatigue cracks in the rib-to-deck joint. In and around the joint residual stresses are present due to the welding process. In this thesis, the effects of residual stresses on the fatigue crack propagation rate is evaluated. This research is based on finite element analysis and verified against experimental data. First, a thermomechanical weld simulation analysis is made in order to define and verify the residual stress field of the OSD-specimen. This analysis consists of two parts starting with a thermal model in which the temperature field during the welding process is analysed. This temperature field output is introduced into the mechanical model in which the residual stress field is modelled and verified. This data is subsequently used in a crack propagation model based on the extended finite element method (XFEM) in which the effect of the residual stresses on fatigue crack propagation is quantified. Next to that the residual stress component in each direction is analysed separately to obtain the effect of the residual stress per stress direction. The fatigue crack simulation including residual stress field shows good correlation (R2=99%) compared to the experimental data. The simulation without residual stress field shows less correlation (R2=95%), which shows that including the residual stresses improves the results significantly. Introducing only one residual stress component does not significantly improve the results compared to the model without the residual stresses. The effects of the residual stresses are relatively large as the tensile transversal residual stresses increase the crack propagation, while the tensile longitudinal residual stresses decrease the crack propagation rate.<br/>In the case study the obtained knowledge from the research will be applied on the Suurhoffbridge of Rijkswaterstaat. On this highway bridge fatigue cracks occurred and these are measured using Time Of Flight Diffraction (TOFD) measurements. Firstly, the geometry and boundary conditions of FEM-model are verified using literature data based on hot-spot stresses. Secondly, the critical load position of the truck load is determined by obtaining influence lines based on the stress intensity factor. These lines show that critical position is reached when the wheel load is positioned between the webs of the stiffener. Also, from the influence lines can be concluded that the residual stresses in the transverse direction increase the stress intensity factors, while the influence of the residual stresses in longitudinal direction is negligible. At last, a fatigue crack propagation simulation with and without residual stresses is performed. The transversal tensile residual stresses are essential to initiate crack propagation, as at the weld root, compressive transversal stresses are present due to the traffic load which prevent crack propagation. Overall, the fatigue crack simulation including the transverse residual stresses corresponds relatively well compared to the measured data as the difference is approximately 14% also considering that two wheel load that have limited effect have been ignored in the analysis. If these two wheel loads would be included the results will improve. However, there are many assumptions made that can effect the result, such as the Paris law properties and load parameters. A slight change in these parameters would effect the results greatly. In order to verify the results, the assumptions made in the case study, should be verified using measurement data of the structure.<br","Fatigue crack propagation; XFEM; Orthotropic Deck Steel; Fracture mechanics; Residual stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Though a lot of work has been done on seizure detection, to limit the impact on epileptic patients, the true necessity lies in timely prediction of seizures before they manifest. Various attempts have been made using conventional algorithms to accurately predict seizures however, so far, results are not that encouraging. In this work, we applied various machine-learning algorithms, in an attempt to identify complex, multi-dimensional epileptic precursors in brain recordings. Three types of neural networks are used in this feasibility study, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. The used input data was annotated Electrocorticography (ECoG) data, recorded in living mutant rodents, containing epileptic events at an interval of about one minute. The data was pre-processed for better learning performance by data normalisation and by generating distinctive training features. The neural networks were configured as three-class classifiers, distinguishing among inter-ictal, pre-ictal and ictal periods. A grid-search approach was applied to determine the best set of parameters for the neural networks. Despite our best efforts, the relation between the input data and output data could not be learned in a reliable way. The maximum reached Average Prediction Rate (APR) was 0.57 with a prediction time of 3.1s when using the normalised data as input and 0.65 with a prediction time of 6.1s when using the distinctive features as input. These results essentially signify good detection but virtually no prediction of upcoming seizures. The evaluation of the experimental findings has revealed that the employed ECoG recordings were ill-selected for training our various neural-network models. Also, a non-conclusive exploratory experiment is performed by applying a Weibull Time-To-Event Recurrent Neural Network (WTTE-RNN) on a sub-set of the normalised input data. The experiment has yielded some positive results, a short-notice prediction of the upcoming seizure in some cases, encouraging for further exploration of this approach. Despite the limited success of this work, however, through its extended forensics analysis, it has paved the crucial, initial steps in the direction of seizure prediction.","Recurrent Neural Networks; Absence seizure; Seizure prediction; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

A DBFM contract is a contract in which the aspects of designing, financing, constructing and maintaining a construction project are integrated. The contract is long-term and based on delivering a service instead of an asset. This research is aimed at the period of time in the contract after the construction is completed which is called the exploitation phase. To make sure that the service is delivered according to the standards, the client has formulated functional output specifications. In order to check whether these functional output specifications are met, the performance of the contractor is monitored. This monitoring of the performance is processed into the payment mechanism. If by monitoring it turns out the functional output specifications are not met and thus the performance is insufficient, this has financial consequences for the contractor. After finishing the construction, the contractor receives an availability payment of Rijkswaterstaat every quarter of the year. The gross availability payment is the maximum amount that the contractor can receive. The contractor will receive this amount if no discount is imposed. There are two different discounts that can be imposed by Rijkswaterstaat: the Availability Discount and the Performance Discount. The Availability Discount has a direct link to the payment. There is no debate possible on the Availability Discount. The Performance Discount has an indirect link with the payment. The contractor can approach the Contract Manager of Rijkswaterstaat to discuss the Performance Discount. If the contractor cannot meet certain specifications, penalty points can be imposed by Rijkswaterstaat. The specifications in the contract indicate what amount of penalty points are to be imposed in the occurrence of shortcomings by the contractor. The Contract Manager has the authority to decide on imposing penalty points. It is known that not every shortcoming according to the contract ends in penalty points. It is unknown how the approach of a Contract Manager can influence the penalty points that are imposed. Different reports state that managers argue that this has to do with the culpability of the shortcoming. How do Contract Managers make this decision? What is their approach? What influences that approach? The political management calls for uniformity and standardisation, while the Contract Managers are afraid that this will come into conflict with the culpability and proportionality of the penalty points and that this will have a negative impact on long-term cooperation (Court of Audit, 2013; Rijkswaterstaat, 2017b; Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal, 2017). <br/>The relationship between Rijkswaterstaat as client and the private party as contractor is related in the study to the relationship between principal and agent that forms the basis for both the Agency and the Stewardship theory. These theories are used to generalise and clarify the findings. This principal-agent relationship is characterised by the information-asymmetry between both parties. The exchange of information between the client and the contractor is incorporated into the research. The main question of the study is as follows: <br/>How do the Agency and Stewardship theories clarify the influence of information exchange between clients and contractors on the approach of Rijkswaterstaat Contract Managers when imposing penalty points in the exploitation phase of the DBFM contract? The first phase of the research was completed through a literature study and a preliminary research. This preliminary research consisted of studying the internal Rijkswaterstaat document and informal conversations with Contract Managers. This phase ended after the design of a theoretical framework and is followed by the empirical research. This was done through a case study. Four projects were selected for the case study. The Contract Managers of these projects were interviewed. The theoretical framework serves as a tool to analyse and visualise the relative position of the projects. The collected knowledge has been analysed in order to discover interdependencies in the characteristics of the projects in terms of the perspective on the penalty points regime, sharing information and the approach of the Contract Manager. The last part combines all aspects of the research in which the validation, discussion, conclusion and reflection of the research are presented. <br/>The Contract Manager is part of the Integral Project Management (IPM) team that is responsible for managing one or more infrastructure projects of Rijkswaterstaat. The Contract Manager must ensure that all parties to a contract fully understand their respective obligations and possible shortcomings. The requirements are laid down in the contract by managerial actors. In order to understand these requirements and to assess the outcomes, the Contract Manager obtains knowledge and information concerning the profession. The Contract Manager is located between these managerial actors and the profession. This position relates to the actor that ‘can both play the managerial game and understand the profession’ and is defined by De Bruijn (2006, pp. 90–91) as a boundary spanner. The process of imposing penalty points starts with the observation that a performance requirement is not met. This can be observed by an individual or by a computer system. In the case of a deviation that is worth penalty points, this is a shortcoming on the part of the contractor. The shortcoming is then registered in a system. Ultimately, a decision will be made on whether to impose penalty points. There are three different outcomes: penalty points are imposed, penalty points are placed on hold and the contractor formulates a control measure or no penalty points are imposed. If the control measure is not met, penalty points can still be imposed. The decision to impose penalty points relates to governance through monitoring and incentives described in the Agency theory. The decision to put a penalty point on hold and to have the contractor formulate a control measure relates to governance by means of empowering structures described in the Stewardship theory. The Contract Manager has the authority to make this decision. The Contract Managers make this decision based on the ‘Stramien Boetepunten’. The ‘Stramien Boetepunten’ is a guideline and not a legislation. This guideline is an attempt to describe the tacit approach of the Contract Managers and takes into account the nature of the requirement, the culpability of the shortcoming and the proactivity of the contractor. Culpability and the proactivity of the contractor can often be interpreted in different ways and is subjective. Although imposing penalty points is discussed in the IPM team, one Contract Manager can make different decisions than the other. The results of the research give a suggestion of a number of interdependencies. The research suggests that a Contract Manager who is closer to the profession obtains more nice to know-information, which reduces the demand for need to know-information. This Contract Manager has higher levels of trust and prefers to have a control measure formulated. Higher levels of trust and the preference for a control measure relates to the shareholder described in the Stewardship theory. Lower levels of trust, demand for monitoring, focus on the result and choosing to impose penalty points relates to the principal described in the Agency theory. However, the scope and history of the project influence the results of the research mentioned. A Contract Manager on a project with a smaller scope has fewer intermediate links that increase the distance between Contract Manager and the profession. In addition, Contract Managers can include past events in their decision. The problem definition showed that politicians value optimal follow-up of the contract. However, the research shows that the degree of discretion is regularly used by the Contract Managers to deviate from this. This is substantiated by the importance of a boundary spanner. By means of the ‘Stramien Boetepunten’ the Contract Managers attempt to guide their approach as a collective in advance of the decision on imposing penalty points. In order to reduce the risk of losing important information and to get a complete overview of the state of affairs, it is recommended to start collecting the information on imposing penalty points centrally.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The growth of the container ships has necessitated ports to adapt, e.g. by increasing the water depth requirements. Many of the conventional onshore ports cannot receive larger ships without dredging activities due to depth restrictions. A considerable amount of dredging is necessary to create an access channel to reach deep waters. The development of offshore-onshore port systems can be a huge opportunity for coastal zones with an extensive shallow foreshore to limit the channel dredging costs. However, the methodology for evaluating the design of innovative solutions, like offshore-onshore port systems, is limited compared to the evaluation of conventional onshore port designs. A framework, including the cost-based evaluations, could serve as a reference to make more deliberate and integral choices between various types of port systems. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate the major logistical trade-offs regarding various types of port systems based on costs. Three port system alternatives, including the associated characteristics, are introduced: i) an onshore port system, ii) an offshore-onshore port system with a waterway transport link and iii) an offshore-onshore port system with a fixed infrastructure link. Next, two characteristic design variables are identified to specify the design scenarios: i) the capacity of the design vessel and ii) the distance between the offshore and onshore terminal. The developed model comprises two parts. The first part is developed to determine the required port system elements and to make the corresponding cost estimates for the specified design scenarios, for all three port system alternatives. The second part is developed to address the logistics of the offshore-onshore port system with a waterway transport link. The results show that the cost estimates of offshore-onshore port systems can be less costly compared to the cost estimates for the onshore port system for specific design scenarios. Hence both offshore-onshore port systems offer less costly alternatives compared to the onshore port system for specific design scenarios. From this, we can conclude that offshore-onshore port systems will be considered more frequently in the future, as the size of container ships is still growing. The framework - a collection of concepts - results in a better understanding of the logistical trade-offs between different type of port systems for container transport and handling. The major logistical trade-offs are framed based on the evaluation of the characteristic design variables, the results of the sensitivity analyses and the assessment of the relationship between the operational reliability of the waterway transport link and the required storage capacities. The logistical simulation is the first method to relate the container ship and shuttle barge transport with the terminal operations using agent-based discrete-event simulations. These logistical simulations evaluate the cost related to the shuttle barge downtime. Depending on the frequency and length of the periods of downtime, the most cost-effective solutions are found for specific downtime scenarios.","Ports; Offshore terminals; Container terminals; Logistical model; Investment decisions; Discrete-event simulation; Agent-based modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This research presents silicon-based planar arrays of 3D microelectrodes, whereby each microelectrode supports multiple, independent and vertically stacked TiN sampling points. The microarrays were manufactured by wafer-scale micromachining which can be assembled onto PCBs conforming to MEA readout standards. The study entails multiple fabrication processes in order to find the most promising recipe for manufacturing arrays of truncated pyramids. Results show clear differences between alkaline etching solutions (KOH and TMAH) and the effects of surfactants. Material properties and corner compensation techniques allow for precise control over the final shape of the truncated pyramid structures which are used as a base for the electrodes. Sidewall lithography techniques are investigated and results are shown to prove the viability of patterning high resolution spatial details on 3D structures. Final microelectrode arrays were fabricated on 4"" Si wafers. The truncated micro-pyramids were obtained by timed anisotropicwet etching (25%TMAH + Triton) solution of the Si substrate using lithographically defined hard masks that allowed precise selection of crystallographic directions. After thermal growth of a 270 nm thick SiO2 passivation layer, a 40 nm/200 nm-thick Ti/TiN layer was sputtered and lithographically patterned to define the electrically independent electrodes. On each pyramid, vertically stacked and distinct sampling points were defined at the tip of each electrode by lithographic patterning of a thin oxide passivation layer. The smallestmetal tracks patterned on the slanted facets were 15 um-wide with minimal inter-track gap of 5 um.

Optimizing the image quality was split up in two parts, motion compensation and clutter suppression. A literature study is performed to research the existing methods. A performance evaluation is performed on different motion compensation techniques based on a simulation which is set up to resemble the radar parameters of AMBER. Based on the results of this evaluation, keystone formatting combined with image contrast maximization is concluded to be the best fitting approach. For clutter suppression a similar approach is followed with real measured data. Apart from the existing techniques, MVDR, DPCA and ODPCA, a new technique is proposed which filtered a target from clutter based on motion. It is referenced to as the IDPCA. The techniques show better image quality than regular beam forming. To enhance the image quality more, a method is searched to combine different clutter suppression techniques. This leads to a unique method which is proposed in this thesis. The new technique exploits the circular phase variance of pixels in the range Doppler image between different sub arrays. With this approach, strong clutter can be filtered in the range Doppler domain based on its angle of arrival. The newly proposed technique is applied as a mask, as it does not contain amplitude information of the target. Combined with the ODPCA method, the final image is generated.

In autonomous vehicle-pedestrian (AV-P) interaction, the perspective taken by the pedestrian could be affected by the design of an external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI). However, currently, there is little knowledge about the effect of message perspective on the crossing intentions of pedestrians when interpreting the intention of an AV. This study aims to investigate the effect of eHMI message perspective and cognitive load on participants’ perspective-taking, as inferred from their crossing intentions. We designed a photo-based experiment and examined the effect of message perspective (egocentric (from the pedestrians' point of view): ‘WALK’, ‘DON’T WALK’ vs. allocentric: ‘BRAKING’, ‘DRIVING’ vs. ambiguous ‘GO’, ‘STOP’), and cognitive load on the crossing intentions, response times and pupil diameter of the participans (N = 103). We added a memory task to increase the cognitive load during two-thirds of the trials, since crossing intentions can be demanding (the traffic scenario can be complex complex or the pedestrian is distracted) and therefore might influence perspective-taking. <br/><br/>The results showed that the egocentric messages were most persuasive as demonstrated by more uniform crossing intentions and faster response times compared to allocentric and ambiguous messages. When participants were put under cognitive load, a more efficient strategy was used to make a crossing decision as demonstrated by faster yet consistent crossing intentions compared to no memory task. No difference in cognitive load was measured for both message perspective and cognitive load at the moment of response, as evidenced by equal pupil size. Concerning the ambiguous messages, ‘GO’ encouraged crossing and the ‘STOP’ inhibited crossing, which points towards an egocentric perspective taken by the pedestrian. We conclude that pedestrians initially take an egocentric perspective if the eHMI message is ambiguous, though this egocentric bias can be overcome by using explicitly an egocentric or allocentric eHMI message perspective. In addition, we conclude that participants perform better (more uniform crossing decisions, faster responses) when the eHMI’s message perspective is egocentric rather than allocentric. <br","External Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs); Autonomous vehicles; Perspective-taking; Pedestrian crossing intentions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-15","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This thesis work focused on improvements to a technique called immersion lithography that uses a confined pool of liquid as the scanning medium for printing of finer structures onto a silicon wafer. A greater process yield can be achieved by minimizing liquid loss that occurs while the silicon wafer is being scanned. One of the mechanisms of liquid loss, which was the point of focus of this work, is associated with the interaction of gas jets impinging onto liquid contained in a micro-channel. Experiments that utilized high speed optical imaging to study the fundamental case of a single impinging jet showed that there are three different mechanisms responsible for droplet formation, i.e. side splashing, liquid film formation and bubble formation. The effect of a number of parameters on the extent of interaction was studied. Next, in order to validate the theoretical understanding and provide a methodology to predict the gas jet-liquid interaction for an arbitrary configuration, a simple theoretical model was developed based on conservation principles. The model results showed reasonable agreement with the trends observed in the single jet experiments. The final section of this thesis focuses on the more complex situation of jet array impingement. This case is more realistic and technologically relevant. The insights gained from these experiments were correlated with the results of the single jet experiments and used to provide design recommendations to ASML to improve the performance of the next generation of DUV immersion lithography scanners.","high speed imaging; microfluidics; photo-lithography; Image processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the worst cases, there were catastrophic consequences with numerous human casualties and significant economic impacts.

Looking from the latter perspective, this thesis is focused on the fire-induced thermal exposure in concrete tunnels, aiming at coupling numerical simulations of idealized fire scenarios in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software with the use of FEA for the analysis of structures, moving towards a performance-based approach in replacement of the currently adopted prescriptive approach. <br/>In this sense, fire imposes one of the most hazardous conditions for concrete structures, characterizing severe thermal degradation of the mechanical properties of the material. During fire exposure, steep thermal gradients are formed within the concrete structure. Those will always lead to the development of thermal stresses, the state of which being determined by several conditions (i.e. elastic modulus, thickness and supports). Besides the structural consequences of a fire, this thesis also deeply investigates the interface between a fire and the structure, which involves the interaction of three different modes of heat transfer, namely conduction, convection (related to the gas temperatures generated by a fire), and radiation (related to the radiation temperatures generated by a fire). While conduction within the solid phase regulates the amount of heat absorbed by the structure during a fire, radiation overcomes convection and becomes the primary mode of heat supply to the structure. The adiabatic surface temperature (AST) combines both the radiation and convection contributions to the total heat transfer to the structure into a single term, fully characterizing the fire phase in the structural analysis. Based on this concept, the differences between the two methodologies (i.e. prescriptive-based and performance-based) are exposed. From the prescriptive-based perspective, the development of the RWS curve and its indistinct use among protected and unprotected concrete tunnels is deeply discussed, together with the current fire resistance furnace tests. For the performance-based approach, the thermal exposure generated by two pool fire scenarios (200 MW and 30 MW) within the Piet Hein tunnel is addressed and the effects of longitudinal ventilation are highlighted.<br","adiabatic surface temperature (AST); radiation; RWS curve; concrete tunnels; thermal stresses; Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS); furnace tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

We develop a Lagrangian saltation model and a high-resolution surface model, which we couple to each other and to a turbulence resolving large eddy simulation model. The simulated transport takes place primarily in the form of aeolian streamers, bursts of elongated transport structures parallel to the wind field, which result in a mass flux signal that is highly heterogeneous both in space and time. The temporal frequency responses up to 1 Hz of the mass flux and wind field share the same characteristics, which indicates a coupling between the two. The system can be in equilibrium, during which the stress profiles induced by the particles, the turbulent fluxes and the imposed large scale pressure gradient balance each other. A bimodal shape is found in the mass flux profile, in which we can distinguish an upper and lower saltation layer. The upper layer is associated with a transitional phase between transport by saltation and suspension that exists in the aeolian streamers. Furthermore, The setup is able to simulate ripples, although future research is needed to investigate the mechanisms that influence the final shape of the ripples.","Aeolian saltation; Turbulence; Ripple formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-01","","","","","",""

As they grow up, their muscles lose strength progressively. Around the age of 10, they lose their ability to walk, in their teens they slowly lose their arm function, in their twenties they often need respiratory support and their life expectancy is usually between 30 and 40 years old. <br/><br/>To support Duchenne boys’ physical functioning and contribute to their independence, a passive exoskeleton has been developed to support their arm function. The exoskeleton is designed to be physically most beneficial for boys with Duchenne between 10 and 17 years old, which is therefore defined as the target group. It is expected that, as the boys in this target group mature, both their physical and emotional needs regarding medical aids, such as exoskeletons, will change. However, the exoskeleton is not yet able to mature with the user, to accommodate for those changing needs. The design goal of this project is therefore to redesign the exoskeleton to increase its ability to mature, both physically and emotionally, with Duchenne boys from 10 to 17 years old. In order to understand the requirements needed to meet the design goal, both physical and emotional needs of Duchenne boys are researched through a literature study and user research.<br/><br/>Literature shows that the boys can physically benefit from the exoskeleton from the moment of wheelchair confinement (around the age of 10), but do not usually use arm supports until a much later age, or not at all, indicating a lack of perceived relevance for the target group. It also shows that there is a high variety in disease progression, so it cannot be predicted when the exoskeleton needs to be altered to fit and support the user physically.<br/><br/>User research shows that there are three phases of growing up with Duchenne (Naïve Playful Kid (10-12 years old), Anxious Self-Conscious Teen (12-15 years old) and Constrained Reluctant Adolescent (15-17 years old)), who differ on topics such as confidence level, attitude towards their disease, responsibility, social life, relation with their parents, and relation towards healthcare products. Products can have a positive influence on emotional development if they can improve independence and individual functioning. Products can have a negative influence if they feel like an imposition, if the user has no control or choice over them, and if the introduction or alteration of the products confirm further muscle decline.<br/><br/>For the exoskeleton to fit with the physical and emotional maturing process, it should therefore achieve the following design goals. The use of the exoskeleton should be made more relevant for each of the three emotional phases of growing up; the user should be able to focus on positive progress and anticipate on negative decline; the exoskeleton should accommodate for an increasing responsibility and independency of the user; and the user should feel like he has a sufficient amount of control and choice over the exoskeleton.<br/><br/>For the exoskeleton to achieve these goals, a new concept is proposed, which consists of three components. Firstly, the exoskeleton is given an added functionality of controlling devices in the user’s house, by making movements. Secondly, an interface containing a coding platform enables the user to decide which devices are controlled with which movements, and through a communication platform he can ask questions and share experience. Thirdly, a service in which an expert regularly checks the exoskeleton’s hardware (physical fit and support) and software (controlling functionality).<br/><br/>The concept increases the ability of the exoskeleton to mature with its user, because it ensures the exoskeleton fits well with the needs of all different ages in the target group and because the target group expects the concept to remain interesting for a longer period of time. They expect this because of the amount of possibilities and adaptabilities the interface provides, but also because of the combination of fun and extra independence the extra controlling function provides directly when using the concept. Furthermore, the expert service ensures the physical fit and support of the exoskeleton is regularly checked and updated, without confronting the target group negatively regarding their physical decline. By implementing the concept, the exoskeleton is expected to continue to be relevant for boys with Duchenne and give them a more positive experience as they mature from children to adults.","DMD; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Exoskeleton; Maturing; User-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

At the mo- ment, the port area emits about 18% of Dutch CO2 emissions. Various studies have been conducted on how to reach this vision.

However, these studies were bound to the geographical context of the emissions. The tremendous impact of the up- and downstream flows was not included and is not included in the Dutch emis- sion statistics. This thesis is the first element of a two-part analysis. In this part, a green hydrogen supply chain from the Port of Sohar towards the Port of Rotterdam will be taken as a case study in order to evaluate the current techno-economic potential of such a supply chain. The second part will evaluate which hydrogen markets in the hinterland of the Port of Rotterdam are feasible for the introduction of green hydrogen sourced from the Port of Sohar. This green hydrogen supply chain is based on solar pv solely, in combination with electrolyz- ers, hydrogen storage, liquefaction and liquid hydrogen shipping. A cost model is proposed, that includes each stage of this supply chain. Finally, a price per kilogram of hydrogen is calculated. The price of hydrogen arriving in Rotterdam is found to be 2.17 [$ · kg−1], including shipping. Even though the price of green hydrogen arriving in Rotterdam is lower than the price of green hydrogen based on electrolysis produced locally, it is yet more expensive in comparison to grey or blue hydrogen produced in the Netherlands. However, economies of scale have not been included in this analysis, neither the potential of cost optimization throughout this supply chain. Therefore, future research is required to evaluate further cost reduction potential in this supply chain.","Green hydrogen; Techno-economic analysis; Renewable energy; water electrolysis; Green hydrogen economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","21.4735, 55.9754"

The collection of said data is of great importance for organizations like municipalities, where it is used for applications such as maintaining streets and greenery. The benefit of crowd-mapping over traditional mapping methods, where workers physically observe the area, is that it has the potential to be far more cost-effective and time-efficient. As this should not come at the cost of losing accuracy, research needs to be done on how to effectively map objects in a city. <br/><br/>Although previous work has focused on mapping urban objects using street-level imagery, they are all specifically aimed at a single type of object. Furthermore, they do not offer a general method for geo-location estimation and do not estimate the height of the objects. All of the systems designed in previous work only support task execution using a web platform. As crowd-mapping is nothing without the crowd, it is important to keep the workers engaged. No research had been done on how the task execution platform and type of task could affect the worker engagement and satisfaction.<br/><br/>In this thesis we will design a system for crowd-mapping urban objects using street-level imagery. We will propose novel methods for geo-location and object height estimation. Experimentation showed that the proposed geo-location method was able to deliver an accuracy with up to 83% of the estimations being within 2.5 meters of the ground truth with a mean distance of 1.85 meters. The height estimation showed up to 85% of the estimations being within 30 centimeters from the ground truth with a mean difference of 15 centimeters. Furthermore, the system supports task execution on three platforms; web, mobile and mobile virtual reality. We demonstrated the feasibility of executing mapping-, data-enrichment- and verification tasks on each of these platforms. Experimentation with the different platforms showed that the type of task and execution platform affects user engagement, cognitive load, satisfaction and execution time.","crowd-mapping; street-level imagery; urban objects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the PICU, there is a preference for NIV compared to invasive ventilation, because of complications, such as airway injuries. Their biggest challenge is finding a suitable non-vented NIV mask. They often do not fit well, resulting in too much air leakage and patient-ventilator asynchrony. This increases the breathing effort of the patient, and can lead to NIV failure. The air leakage is often too high, therefore the mask has to be repositioned and tightened to reduce the air leakage. This disturbs the patient and influences the patient’s comfort. <br/><br/>The core problem of NIV is the excess of unintentional air leakage. Therefore the main focus lies on reducing air leakage by increasing the fit of the new developed NIV mask. The new masks need to fit patients up till the age of seven, because the available masks do often not fit well. There are no non-vented NIV masks available for patients below one year. An oronasal mask is developed, it is most effective and relatively non-intrusive compared to the other types of non-vented NIV mask. NIV at the PICU can be divided into acute NIV, for which an acute NIV mask will be developed, and extended NIV, for which an ideal NIV mask will be developed. <br/><br/>Four concept NIV masks are developed, of which two concepts are selected based on the results of the simulation and most important requirements. The NIV intervention is simulated by ventilating a reanimation mannequin with prototypes of the concepts to determine the effectiveness in terms of air leakage and contact pressure. The two selected concepts shows reduced air leakage compared to commercially available masks.<br/><br/>The final design proposal consists of two masks: the Modular Mask, and the Quick Curable Mask. The Quick Curable Mask is developed for patients who require acute NIV. The Modular Mask is developed for patients who need NIV for an extended time. Due to overcrowding at the PICU of Amsterdam UMC there was a shortage of NIV tubes and sensors, it was not responsible to test the masks. Therefore a protocol is written to test the air leakage and evaluate the wearing comfort of the two proposed masks with a test participant after the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>The final design proposal is suitable for NIV at the PICU. A roadmap describes how the two mask can be further developed by the hospital and implemented in the PICU.

There is a need to switch to Circular Economy (CE). One of the ways in which the public clients can stimulate this transition is by implementing the Design for Disassembly (DfD) principle in the public procurement process. However, this stimulation is underexploited, and public clients seem to lack in having an effective system for implementation. Therefore, the objective of this research was to conceptualize a system for the implementation of the DfD principle in the public procurement process to achieve circular ambitions. A mixed research approach was adopted where first a literature study was conducted on the general procurement process of buildings and the aspects of DfD to conceptualize the DfD based procurement process. Following this, two case studies were conducted to understand how public clients have implemented DfD in the public procurement process of known circular buildings. Based on the results of the case study, the conceptualization of the DfD based procurement process was refined. The main findings from refined conceptualization are: firstly, the client needs to hire a design team specialized in DfD. This design team needs to formulate an ambition primarily for flexibility in design and beyond that for future reuse. Secondly, for the tendering phase, the client needs to set eligibility requirements for the selection of the design team asking for training and experience. They also need to set requirements for the inclusion of deconstruction professionals in the consortium. Finally, the client needs to award the contract based on the design principles of DfD. The client needs to assess the offers for these design principles using BIM-based tools. Also, for the assessment of the cost of the offers, the client needs to use life cycle costs. In conclusion, the implementation of DfD does not lead to a fundamental change in how the procurement process is conducted. Only in certain phases, the activities need to be conducted in line with DfD.","Circular economy; Public Procurement process; Design for disassembly; Design for deconstruction; Flexible buildings; Adaptability; demountable buildings; temporary buildings; Sustainability; Temporary Courthouse; The Green House","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

By way of contrast, solving the mobility issues of the past, created a challenge in terms of conservation today as many assets are reaching the end of their technical, economical and functional lifetime [Hertogh et al., 2018]. Main challenge arises for public authorities which have to meet safety demands and satisfy user expectations in the context of aging assets, imperfect knowledge on their conditions, limited resources, increasing traffic volumes and threats from climate change. Determining when, what and how has to happen is therefore more complex than simply renewing or replacing assets [Polder et al., 2012; van der Vlist et al., 2015; Nicolai et al., 2016].Together with the evident challenges, the magnitude of the predicted increase of Maintenance, Renewal and Replacement (read: MR&amp;R) projects creates a variety of opportunities. One of the opportunities, is to widen the perspective beyond the boundaries of a single asset. Creation of a holistic view and recognition of portfolio opportunities is considered to be key in realizing strategic and tactical objectives, improved alignment with other projects and realize savings due to a decreased need of resources and selection and procurement procedures [Ferns, 1991; Heising, 2012; Chen et al., 2013]. Realizing the potential while controlling the present challenges is however easier said than done. Public organizations within the Netherlands are currently facing serious difficulties in the implementation of their MR&amp;R projects in a fit-for-purpose manner. Fit-for-purpose, in this sense, refers to choosing the best solution for a problem, given the others alternatives [Koops et al., 2017]. In order to investigate both the complexities and the possibilities of MR&amp;R challenges, the main questions of this research is:”How can decision-making on the MR&amp;R interventions of the emerging set of soon-to-be outdated assets be supported to configure assets in a fit-for-purpose manner?”Since the preferred solution regarding the development of a project is picked during the front-end development (read: FED) of a project, the research is focused on these preparatory phases. During the FED, the problems are assessed, a preferred alternative given the present requirements is selected and further defined before it continues to the consecutive project phases [Weijde, 2008]. To provide support on the related decision-making process, the research is guided by two main deliverables:1. Provide an overview of the main complexities of MR&amp;R challenges which influence the FED process2. Develop a framework to support public organization in organizing their FED process to deal with their emerging amount of aging assets in a fit-for-purpose mannerThe overview of the main complexities public organization face during the FED of their to MR&amp;R challenge was created by a combination of scientific and empirical research. Given the present body of knowledge on MR&amp;R challenges, FED and decision-making complexities, a conceptual framework was created. This functioned as a pair of glasses through which multiple cases were analyzed. By investigating four MR&amp;R cases of Rijkswaterstaat, the Municipality of Amsterdam and the Province of North-Holland individually and jointly, a set of 20 challenges emerged. Altogether, these challenges influenced the opportunity of public organizations in the creation of fit-for-purpose project, portfolio or program configurations during the FED procedure.To create a framework which indicates how to deal with these challenges, seven decision-making dilemmas were identified. These dilemmas indicate the opportunities executive authorities within public organizations have in aligning their FED process to their perceived complexities, requirements and resources. The red cluster marks the dilemmas which influence the physical solution space of MR&amp;R challenges, whereas the dilemmas in the orange cluster determine the design of the FED procedure. Since the opportunity to review and revise made decisions applies on both contextual and procedural dilemmas, the agility dilemmas is present in both clusters.In the end, public organizations in charge simply have two choices: simplification or complexification of the FED process. To deal with the emerging set of soon-to-be outdated assets, the process may be kept simple and foreseeable, but the opportunity to create asset transcending benefits is small. On the other side, an organization may decide to deliberately complicate the configuration process by increasing the amount of elements and related considerations. Given the developed decision-making framework, there are seven options to realize potential integrated benefits. during the FED procedure. With every dilemma, decisions to either simplify or complicate the FED process may be made, which create the opportunity for a public authority to adjust the configuration process to the present requirements, complexities and resources. Observance of the cases and the afterwards validation of the framework however pinpointed the risks of increasing the complexity of the FED process. For example, creation of a separate program and related procedures to deal with the MR&amp;R challenge may result in a reluctant attitude of the involved staff and create an unforeseen amount of interrelations with other divisions in the organizations. Ifthe amount of components and actors involved in the decision-making process increases, also a greater span of control is demanded [Leijten, 2017]. Manageability issues due to the increase levels of complexity may therefore hamper the overall FED process. Therefore, using the developed framework should help decision-makers in public organizations in finding a balance between the potential to create certain benefits and the risk of making the process too complex.In order to improve the validity of the developed decision-making framework, it was first tested in an existing case of Rijkswaterstaat by conducting an imitation experiment. Based on the conditions of the case, decisions on the dilemmas in the framework were made and translated into a FED process. Next to the imitation experiment, an expert review on the framework was conducted. In the presence of representatives of the Municipality of Amsterdam and Rijkswaterstaat, the framework was tested on its completeness, functioning and usability. In the end, both validation incentives confirmed the added value of the decision-making framework as it provides the opportunity for public organizations to align their MR&amp;R challenge and objectives with a FED process design.","Maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R); Renewal; Replacement; Maintenance; Decision-making framework; Public values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The balance assistance was provided by the RYSEN– an active Bodyweight Support (BWS) system used in gait training– in the form of lateral damping. The damping value was tuned over successive trials to optimise the trade-off between maximising the distance walked by the participants before loss of balance and minimising the lateral impulses applied by the RYSEN during each trial. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) was used for the<br/>automated optimisation of the lateral damping assistance. The performance of the CMAES algorithm was compared to participant performance in optimising the damping based on the same cost measure.<br/>Using a final sample size of 15 healthy participants, comparisons were made between costs for trials conducted with Zero Damping (ZD), the optimal damping estimate returned by the algorithm (D<sub>a</sub>) and the optimal damping estimate selected by the participants (D<sub>h</sub>), with the expectation that lower trial costs would be returned by the optimal damping estimates.<br/>No significant difference was found among the median cost measures of the three conditions (p = 0.24, Friedman’s ANOVA).

By discussing analog cases of far-field deformation, these results have been placed in a larger context of large--scale basin deformation. <br/><br/>The second part of the report focuses on the Netherlands, where ambitious goals have been set for the implementation of geothermal energy in the energy transition. During the gas production in Groningen, a negative social perspective towards mining operations, in general, was developed. For the implementation of geothermal energy, an approach for the communication of technical uncertainties between the initiators and the local public of a geothermal project is designed in this study. Technical uncertainties that are present in geothermal energy implementation in the Netherlands have been identified during semi-structured expert-interviews with different stakeholders in the spectrum of geothermal energy. The approach addresses guidelines for the communication of the context, the goal, the technical uncertainties present in the geothermal project, the main communicating actors, their reference frames, and the situation in which the communication process takes place.","Structural Geology; Fracture Pattern Characterisation; Northern Territory; Greater McArthur Basin; Drone Imagery; Geothermal Energy; Uncertainty Communication; Social Acceptance; Communication Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","Reservoir Geology and Science Education and Communication | Science Communication",""

However, Imitation Learning methods require demonstration data (in the form of state-action labels) and in many scenarios, the demonstrations can be expensive to obtain or too complex for a demonstrator to execute. This lack or sub-optimality of demonstrations limits the applicability and performance of many Imitation Learning methods.<br/> <br/>Advancements in Interactive Imitation Learning techniques however, have made it easier for demonstrators to train agents and improve their performance. These techniques involve demonstrators interacting with and guiding the agent as it performs the requisite task. This guidance is typically in the form of corrections or feedback on the current actions being executed by the agent.<br/> <br/>In this thesis, a novel Interactive Learning technique is proposed that uses human corrective feedback in state-space to train and improve agent behavior. This technique is beneficial since providing guidance to the agent in terms of `changing its state' is often easier or more intuitive for the human demonstrator (as opposed to changing the actions being executed). For instance, in manipulation tasks using a robotic arm, it is easier for the demonstrator to provide state information such as the Cartesian position of the end-effector rather than low-level action information such as joint angles. Keeping such scenarios in mind, we propose our method titled: Teaching Imitative Policies in State-space (TIPS).<br/> <br/>We evaluate the performance of TIPS for various control tasks as part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit as well as for a manipulation task using a KUKA LBR iiwa robotic arm. We show that through continuous improvement via feedback, agents trained using TIPS outperform the demonstrator and in-turn outperform conventional Imitation Learning agents.","Imitation Learning; Learning from Demonstrations; Robot Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

However, the dynamic river behaviour, archaic boat equipment and limited monitoring, yearly results in large numbers of grounding ships, causing injuries and economic losses. A pilot project involving CoVadem technology was initiated in the beginning of 2019 to benefit safer navigation on the Chindwin. CoVadem technology can chart the most up to date water depths by collecting under keel clearance measurements from the commercial fleet. The pilot project aims to increase safety on the Chindwin through sharing information about safe routes and forecasted water depths with captains sailing the river.<br/><br/>The added value of using CoVadem technology, however, is vulnerable to the number of participating vessels. A combination of morphological changes and the typical spatial spread of CoVadem data limits the extent of the navigation channel that can be derived from the data. With only a small part of the navigation channel known it is unclear where passing of other vessels is possible, where speeds should be adjusted due to e.g., bottlenecks and where shorter routes are present.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to provide more information about the navigable area around CoVadem data in order to assist captains with navigation. During this research, two physics-based models have been developed, able to carry out this task. The ‘soil-model’ combines CoVadem data with assumptions about the maximum slope in the bed.<br/>The ‘axi-symmetric model’ utilises CoVadem data, the axi-symmetric solution and assumptions about sand dunes and river banks in a model to estimate a navigable area.<br/><br/>Two ‘reliability indicators’ have been developed that can indicate areas of the river where the output of the axi-symmetric model is reliable in its estimate. One indicator is related to the channel stability, it is calculated from many years of satellite imagery. The other indicator is related to channel curvature.<br/><br/>To measure the performance of the models and the reliability indicators, two dimensionless performance indicators have been developed: the safety score and the channel coverage score. The models and the reliability indicators were consecutively tested and evaluated for four study cases located along the Chindwin river. <br/><br/>The results are promising. It follows from this research that navigation channel estimates around scarce CoVadem ship track data can substantially benefit from application of a physics-based model. The soil-model is very robust, but has limited added value for navigation. The axi-symmetric model increases the navigable width estimate around a single CoVadem trackline significantly O(100 m). The performance indicators can improve the reliability of the axi-symmetric model significantly.<br/><br/>This research combines Big Data, physics-based models and remote sensing in a not early demonstrated way: with models tailored for navigable area estimates and with measured data as the starting point. The correlation between axi-symmetric model reliability and remote sensing/curvature is, moreover, something that has not been demonstrated before. Finally, the two developed performance indicators show great promise for the evaluation of navigable area estimates. As such, this research adds to current advancements in (open-access) cross-platform data accumulation and utilisation.<br","remote sensing; scarce data; morpholgy; IWT; navigation; CoVadem; Big Data; Earth Engine; Earth Observation; Electro-optical; physics-based modelling; water occurrence; MNDWI; Myanmar; Chindwin; Ayeyarwady River","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Pilot Project Navigation with Nature: a CoVadem application for the Chindwin River, Myanmar","22.0700, 95.0900"

Both the intermittency of renewable energy sources and the carbon-intensity of the heat sector challenge this transition. In the context of heat and renewable power integration, this report focuses on balancing uncertain wind power production using a heat network. The thermal inertia of heat networks enables a flexible use of power-to-heat as central source in district heating. Operation of the central heat source is to respond to wind power availability. To this end, a multi-consumer heat network with a centralised electric boiler has been modelled, taking into account heat transportation times. The boiler should be scheduled to be active when predicted wind power production is high, for the boiler to turn off when wind power production is low. Furthermore, wind power prediction errors could be mitigated by changes to the boiler schedule, thereby decreasing the need for additional intra-day balancing power. The day-ahead scheduling problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Intra-day operation of the boiler is regulated by model predictive control. It was found that a number of constraints are necessary for a reliable optimal control of the heat network. In addition, the linear relaxation of the integer programming problem could not provide a proper approximation of the computationally complex integer problem. The flexibility of the boiler load is compared for a varying boiler power capacity, as well as a varying prediction horizon used in the model predictive control. This reports contributes to the growing interest in demand response and flexibility across energy systems.","District Heating; Power-to-heat; Model Predictive Control; Optimal Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

For propellers which are mounted in front of the wing, the interaction of the slipstream with the lifting surfaces can alter the lift distribution significantly. In the use of modern optimization tools, fast and accurate analysis of the wing aerodynamics is needed, including the influence of the propeller slipstream. Current potential flow based wing analysis tools, such as the lifting-line and vortex lattice method, highly overestimate the lift increase due to the axial induced velocity component in the slipstream, compared to wind tunnel and CFD data. The shortcomings of the existing wing analysis tools are found in the approach of adding the slipstream velocities to the wing induced circulation. At the wing segments that are submerged in the propeller slipstream, it is assumed that the slipstream is infinity large. To account for the effect of the finite slipstream dimensions on the lift distribution, potential flow methods based on the image vortex technique, are used to correct the existing analysis tools. These tools were validated using CFD simulations using the Euler equations. From the validation process, one method was found to produce a good agreement with the CFD data and this can be used to improve the modeling of propeller-wing interactions.","propeller; propeller-wing interaction; lifting-line method; propulsion integration; cfd","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The high-rise building sector faces the challenge of considering a design that is flexible and adaptable to meet the functional requirements along its life span; and additionally, to consider a design for deconstruction, where the benefits and challenges that arise form reusing and recycling the material can be considered and addressed from early design stages.<br/>This research addresses these trends and challenges by evaluating and comparing the environmental impact of different structural systems for a high-rise building in the Netherlands (151m). The comparison of four different structural systems with two core variations provides eight different stability systems. The scope of the stability systems considers foundations, core, columns, beams, bracings and floor slabs. The design of the structural systems was performed by the elaboration of 3D FEM models with parametrical tools to ensure the structural safety and serviceability of the building. Furthermore, the assessment of the environmental impact (global warming potential) was performed by means of a Life-Cycle Aseessment comparing three scenarios of the structure: cradle to gate, cradle to cradle, and cradle to cradle with 100% reuse of the structural elements; with data from the Nationale Milieu Database and with information from a technical report from the Joint Research Center.<br/>The analysis of the results demonstrated that the environmental impact of the structural systems with steel core is 21% higher than the one that corresponds to the structures with concrete core, However, this variation is only 4% for the two variants of the diagrid structure. Furthermore, by including the average recycle and reuse rates form the market and current construction practices, the benefits at the end-of-life stage of the building can represent up to 17% of the impacts from the production phase. Moreover, when the reuse rate is considered as 100% the benefits increase up to 42% of the impacts from the production phase.<br/>The results indicate that the improvement of the environmental impact of high-rise buildings can be achieved by means of sustainable structural design from the early phases of the design; where the choice of materials and of the structural system play and important role on the outcome of the total environmental impact of the building, which is becoming an important driver for the decision-making of new projects.","sustainable structural design; high-rise buildings; LCA; stability system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Manoochehri, M. (graduation committee); Noordanus, Elisabeth (mentor); Wang, Lei (graduation committee); Song, Wolf (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Background: When two acoustic sinusoids of slightly different frequencies are presented in the same ear, the listener perceives a beating sound with a rate the difference frequency between the two sinusoids. In the dichotic presentation of two acoustic sinusoids with slightly different frequencies, separately at the two ears, the listener perceives beats at the difference frequency and these beats are called Binaural Beats. As opposed to the Monaural Beats the Binaural Beats require the combined action of the two ears in order to be perceived. Monaural and Binaural Beats can be assessed with EEG recordings of the Auditory Steady-Steady Response. While the Monaural Beats are already created at the level of the cochlea, the Binaural Beats are caused by bilateral inputs at higher levels of the auditory processing chain. This suggest that possible differences between the generators of the ASSRs elicited by Monaural and by Binaural Beats can help in the understanding of the binaural processing of sound. Objective: The objective of this study is to localize the generators of ASSRs evoked by MBs and by BBs, with the goal to detect possible spatial differences between their sources.<br/>Methods: EEG recordings from 11 participants in response to multiple sinusoidal acoustic stimuli were used. Monaural beats, binaural beats, as well as other higher order monaural and binaural interactions between the input acoustic sinusoids were detected as ASSRs at the respective frequency of the beat or at the frequency of the other interactions. All the significant ASSRs were identified and then a spatial filtering technique was applied for the localization of their generators in the brain. The Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) beamformer with left/right symmetric scanning dipoles was used to scan the whole brain and estimate the sources of the ASSRs. Results: The sources of the ASSRs evoked by monaural beats of 33Hz and 39Hz were identified in the auditory cortex. Maximum activation of the brain was found in the auditory cortex contralateral to the side of the monaural beat stimulus. ASSRs of 4 Hz Binaural Beat and 6Hz binaural interaction were localized in the right auditory cortex, slightly lower than the source of the Monaural Beats. Finally, sources of ASSRs evoked by other binaural beats and other monaural and binaural interactions were found in the following brain areas: temporal middle gyrus, parietal lobule, frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus. Based on comparisons with results from other studies, the localization accuracy of subject-level source estimates was estimated 24.7mm. Conclusion: Generators of ASSRs evoked by monaural and binaural beats were estimated in the auditory cortex. The overall source results of the study suggest right-asymmetric contribution to the ASSR from the auditory cortex. Areas not belonging to the auditory system were also localized as sources of ASSRs. This suggests that brain areas outside the auditory system might be involved in the processing of the sound and sound perception. Finally, the results of this study were not enough to answer the question whether there are differences between the generators of ASSRs evoked by MBs and by BBs.","Monaural Beats; Binaural Beats; Source Localization; Auditory Steady State Responses; EEG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","OtoControl Project",""

Anaerobic processes taking place in pressure sewers are not fully understood but show the potential to act as a pre-treatment for the wastewater reaching AGS reactors. Moreover, the contribution of the influent to the hydrolytic activity of the reactor is unknown. This research evaluated the impact of a pressure sewer on wastewater characteristics, as a possible pre-treatment of sewage before reaching the treatment plant. The variations of sewage in terms of physicochemical composition and microbial activity were monitored in a full-scale pressure sewer, focusing on the hydrolysis and fermentation of organic matter for further treatment in AGS reactors. Moreover, the contribution of the influent to the enzymatic activity of a full-scale AGS reactor was assessed.<br/>Inaccuracies deriving from sampling on a full-scale pressure sewer might have affected the results. However, statistical analyses helped to derive trends from the collected data. The pressure sewer primarily affected the degree of fermentation of the wastewater and the concentration of suspended solids. It is hypothesised that such variations could benefit the performance of AGS reactors. Although the biodegradability and enzymatic activity of the wastewater did not improve significantly, anaerobic conveyance seemed more appropriate than aerobic transport for AGS reactors. However, the influent did not seem to have a large contribution to the total reactor activity, due to the high concentration of granular biomass.","aerobic granular sludge; sewage; anaerobic transformations; Volatile fatty acids; anaerobic sewage transport; hydrolysis; fermentation; enzymatic activity; glucosidase; Proteins; Carbohydrates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-13","","","","","",""

An optimization model is combined with a choice behaviour model to determine the trade-offs between delivering to parcel lockers or to end-users, in terms of service level and total transportation costs.

The provided services are dependent on each other, which makes information sharing between the actors of the nautical chain essential.

This research aims to fill this gap, by researching the information that is shared in the nautical chain of the Port of Rotterdam in the delays that frequently occur through expert interviews and observations. The information that is shared in the frequent delay situations is considered critical for efficiency improvements, because the shared information contributes to decisions that reduce the cascade effect of a delay trigger.

This approach shows a green light for the on-ramp vehicles when a gap in the main lane flow on the right lane has been detected instead of using the temporarily fixed cycle times. Computations on the location of the gap measurement loop detectors is required. Therefore, an acceleration distribution has been composed by means of an experiment as well.

In retrospect, unforeseen maintenance makes up approximately 8\% of the total operational costs. The estimation of the operational costs can be improved by including the unforeseen maintenance costs. Improved operational cost calculations lead to better substantiated maintenance policy decision-making. Therefore, the (unforeseen) maintenance costs over the lifetime of a vessel are modelled. This research focuses on maintenance cost calculations, based on failure behaviour. First, it is explained how the Maintenance Cost Model calculates and compares the costs of different maintenance policies. Thereafter, the model is validated in a case study. The achieved cost reductions resulting from the case study varied from 0\% to 70\%, with a conservative average of 16\%. Next, the case study conclusions are assessed in a sensitivity analysis. The model generates a, system specific, cost based ranking of the maintenance policies. The ranking can be used by shipping management companies, to obtain a better substantiated system specific maintenance policy.

This minimum lateral control speed is predicted by a system, named the Vc Prediction System (VPS), which continually predicts the minimum lateral control speed Vc at which an aircraft can still obtain a certain roll angle within a certain amount of time. It consists of three components; a linear model, a parameter estimation method and a Vc prediction model. These VPS components were designed for a simulation model of the Piper Seneca. This study analyzes the sensitivity of the VPS design to a change in aircraft dynamics and simulation model complexity by redesigning this system for a high-fidelity simulation model of the Fokker 50. The results show that both aircraft favor a small linear model and the Modified Kalman Method for parameter estimation.

People can get infected when they get into contact with contaminated fresh water. The disease is most prevalent amongst children, farmers and rural communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by microscopic egg count in laboratories. However, there are limitations to use of this method in low resource settings. At Delft University of Technology, smart diagnostics are under development that allow diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis without microscope. However, the user and diagnostic setting for these tests has not been specified yet. The goal of this project is to combine gaps in the healthcare system and the needs of stakeholders with technological possibilities into a target product profile for a diagnostic device for urinary schistosomiasis for specific use case scenarios. This project takes Nigeria as study field. There are two optical diagnostic methods under development, which combine a simple optical system with an algorithm to automatically detect S. haematobium ova in urine samples. The Schistoscope uses a reversed lens attached to a smartphone or Raspberry Pi camera to magnify and take an image of an urine sample. An algorithm localizes and classifies potential ova. The SODOS uses an optical sensor and a lens to perform a holographic analysis of urine samples. The algorithm digitally reconstructs the image, from which ova are classified. These technologies can offer the following benefits compared to microscopy; 1) Simple and user friendly; 2) Rapid; 3) Sensitive; 4) Robust and portable; 5) Affordable; 6) Data collection. An qualitative research with semi-structured interviews was conducted in Oyo State, Nigeria to explore the context and identify gaps and stakeholders for i) case management on primary healthcare level, and ii) the control &amp; elimination program. The main problem in case management is that diagnosis is not done at primary level due to limited resources and awareness, which leads very few confirmed cases. For case management, the stakeholders are divided into healthcare enablers, formal health providers, informal health providers and healthcare receivers. The control &amp; elimination program is divided into i) mapping of schistosomiasis prevalence and ii) mass drug administration during Deworming days. The problem in the control &amp; elimination program is that lack of diagnosis leads to an unknown disease prevalence. As a result, there is limited government interest and funding. For the control &amp; elimination program the stakeholders are divided into initiation, organization, mapping implementation, Deworming implementation and target populations. The benefits from technology were combined with gaps in the healthcare context into twelve opportunities for diagnostic scenarios. Three diagnostic scenarios were selected; 1) Test at PHC consult by a community health worker, which allows testing at PHC level; 2) Mapping of adult populations at risk, where adults are tested at occupational group meetings by community health worker and/or lab assistant; 3) Test as sensitization tool, where diagnosis is done by a community resource person in communities to create awareness. Insights from the research were combined into target product profiles with acceptable and ideal values for product attributes. A creative session was organized to determine the value of this specification list for product design.","Diagnostics; low resource settings; Schistosomiasis; Nigeria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The culprit in these emissions is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) can mitigate a part of these emissions, by converting carbon species to useful products. The typical route for CCU involves: carbon capture, compression, transportation and utilization. This thesis takes on a slightly different approach. Instead of utilization at a centralized location, the utilization of carbon species will be realized on location. This is beneficial, since no transportation of CO2 is required. Three different high partial pressure carbon sources will be addressed: tail-gas (TG) from steam methane reforming, blast furnace gas (BFG) from the steel industry and biogas from the bacterial degeneration of biomass.

By capturing the carbon species in these gases or removing some of the inert components, different ratios of CO2, CO, H2 and inerts can be obtained.

In part one of this two-part research (Shipping Sunshine) two green hydrogen import prices were calculated based on a 100 [GW] solar pv system. The first price of 1.97 [e·kg−1] hydrogen received at the Port of Rotterdam considers cur- rent costs. The second price of 1.47 [e·kg−1] considers a 50% decline in solar pv module and electrolyzer capital expenditure costs. However, supply and demand of green hydrogen have to be created simultaneously. This second part will identify which hydrogen markets in the hinterland of the Port of Rot- terdam are feasible from a techno-economic perspective given both import prices and an ETS price of 25 and 80 [e·t−1] respectively. Besides, it will evaluate the carbon emission abatement cost in these markets. A new methodology is proposed, using hydrogen parity prices to create a level playing field in comparing these markets as well as synthetic fuel costs. Furthermore, the existing supportive policies will be included. Lastly, the required prices in these markets are compared to current market prices. At a green hydrogen import price of 1.47 [e·kg−1] and an ETS price of 80 [e·t−1], the following hydrogen markets are feasible: mobility, steel industry, natural gas blending, low temperature heat, natural gas power plants, SMR substitution and harbor tugs. The mar- ginal abatement cost ranges from minus 350 [e·tCO2−1] to 460 [e·tCO2−1]. Future research could focus on the sensitivity of these hydrogen markets when other techno-economic para- meters change, thereby affecting the parity price of these specific hydrogen markets.

(mentor); Berghuis, G.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The research was performed in order to design a roadmap for transforming the departure hall, by researching the way KLM could improve the customer departure journey. Hall capacity needs to grow to accommodate for an expected increase in passenger numbers: for welcoming, waiting, check-in, and baggage processing. Design roadmapping methodology is used for performing initial context research, and for mapping user value drivers, new ideas for departure, and pathways to a future vision. <br/><br/>The company context is researched by discovering KLM values and by mapping stakeholders in departure. Passengers are the primary stakeholders who interact with staff at the airport, and perform check-in and bag drop tasks in the departure hall. By mapping flow, user routing in the journey is made clear. By combining these insights with literature on waiting, passenger behavior, the perception of waiting, and an action mapping exercise, a journey overview is created. In order to truly understand customer journeys, interviewing with passengers was arranged in the live environment. Journey mapping yielded a journey experience overview and four personas in departure with specific service requirements, motivations for assistance, and needs. Market research in the form of a competitor analysis and DEPEST research provides the trend patterning needed for future visioning. A problem definition of current departure at the airport is established by reflecting on the airline's ambition to be most customer-centric, efficient, and innovative. <br/><br/>Most important in design roadmapping are user value drivers; the unmet needs of future customers. Understanding these needs allows forward-looking enterprises to transform processes and services in time to create new value. By introducing the analogous customer experience of upcoming seamless grocery shopping, the design team engaged in a value mapping exercise yielding five key user value drivers: convenience, comprehension, choice, confirmation, and care. An envisioned future departure interaction is explained by imagining the functional and emotional benefits of future solutions according to these five value drivers. A three component future vision statement is provided. While the first half of the research focused on doing research and envisioning an improved future departure, the second part is dedicated to designing the roadmap. At this halfway point of the research, a switch from journey touchpoint research to changed strategic processes for new business development is made. Here, a roadmap offering a strategic pathway to the future is needed. <br/><br/>As the five user value drivers were found, what remains is mapping of new ideas for departure, and mapping of pathways to the future vision. For idea mapping, a tech scouting is performed in order to see what technology is available and to learn how these are relevant in reaching the vision. An integral ideation day yielded eight idea concepts spread over three horizons. The ideas aim at simplifying touchpoints, offering journey guidance, providing departure certainty and facilitate purchasing, shortening touchtime, and offering true care and recognition. Implications of horizon developments for a Staff of Tomorrow, and Operations of Tomorrow are explained. <br/><br/>These five themes in the mapped ideas shape the pathways to the three component future vision, or alternatively: the roads to follow to achieve the ambition. Here, the decision is made to construct two roadmaps for flexibility in creative dialogue: a strategic roadmap which quickly communicates vision outlook and strategic themes, and a tactical roadmap displaying full background information and concept idea information. <br/>The two roadmaps are introduced and the approach and design choices are explained. A reflection on requirements set at the halfway point of the research is provided.<br/><br/>Finally, the research is concluded by means of a discussion which provides a brief summary of the work, states the implications of the research, and suggests four follow-up projects, as well as future design sprint HCWs for moving forward with Departure of Tomorrow. <br/><br/>The thesis concludes with a reflection on the value of creative dialogue and roadmapping at KLM, and a personal reflection on the project. ","UX research; Design Roadmap; Strategic Design; Aviation; Journey mapping; Business Design; People in Transit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

MaaS has the potential to play a role in addressing issues as pollution, congestion and crowded cities. However, without interested users, these promises cannot be fulfilled. This study explores whether the proposed expectations of MaaS are realistic by examining the interest of potential users in MaaS. The focus is on employees in the Netherlands. Commuting trips might make an interesting first market for MaaS since there are possibilities to increase the interest of employees by financing commuting MaaS trips by employers. A latent class cluster analysis is performed to identify groups of employees based on the attitude towards and the intention to use MaaS for commuting trips. The results indicate that the majority of employees are not interested in using MaaS to commute. An increase in interest is seen when employers finance MaaS. However, this increase is not substantial. The interested groups of employees are individuals with high environmental consciousness and low car affection which often travel in a multi-modal way. This research concludes that the benefits of MaaS that are proposed by researchers and policymakers are overestimated. However, this does not imply that the MaaS concept should be discarded. The MaaS platform might be of added value for some travellers since it provides new travel options in case of unexpected disruptions and an easy and clear way of booking and paying for a door-to-door trip. For now, it is important to present MaaS in a more realistic way instead of the Holy Grail.","Mobility as a Service; Latent Class Cluster Analysis; Commuting mode choice; Factor Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Lazaro, Carlos (graduation committee); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); van der Linden, L.P.L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Geometric patterns inspired in historical Islamic ornamental art have attracted the attention of contemporary designers worldwide. The large variety of shapes, symmetries and combinations is a source of inspiration, but at the same time makes it difficult to provide general rules when used in a technological application. Structural small-scale applications have been object of research, but there are potential applications at larger scales that deserved attention. In view of some recent proposals of Islamic patterns as structural grids for tall building skins, the question of their structural efficiency, especially compared to conventional grids, arises. The purpose of this research is to assess the performance of structural grids based on geometric Islamic patterns as outer skins of tall buildings. For this purpose, several historic patterns have been classified. An equivalent meta-material has been defined for each pattern, based on the homogenization method for a series of saturations or beam sizes. Their response in different orientations has been studied to identify their structural behaviour based on the pattern geometry. Their relative performance has been assessed for all patterns against themselves and against the conventional diagrid system. All this process has been collected and summarized in a predesign tool made of graphs, pictures and tables Finally, the predesign tool accuracy has been assessed and applied to three tall buildings. All those steps have been structured in three distinctive levels: At the method level, the conclusion is that the developed predesign tool is a success as it provides a higher level of accuracy than modelling all the beams. It is also faster and easier to implement, than modelling all the beam elements, to compare alternatives in early stages as the complexity of modelling the patterns is postponed to later stages. As the saturation decreases and the effective beam length influence in the beam model results diminishes, the beam model will become more reliable than the predesign tool and vice versa. At the pattern level, the most interesting finding is that the patterns with square symmetry (symmetry directions at 90º) display a perpendicular isotropic behaviour, whereas the patterns with pentagonal symmetry (symmetry directions at 72ª) display an orthotropic behaviour, and the patterns with hexagonal symmetry (symmetry directions at 60ª) display an isotropic behaviour. It has also been studied the effect that would have filling the stars as an alternative to building the patterns as an assembly of beams. At the building level, it has been found a few geometric Islamic patterns that could be suitable alternatives to the conventional diagrid systems, a pattern with a similar performance and even a pattern with a higher structural performance than the conventional diagrids. This highly performing pattern is currently been used for some architects such as Shigeru Ban in their parametric designs. In this regard, it can be concluded that the objective of finding suitable alternatives to conventional diagrid systems has also been a success and it can affect some designers engineering judgement. The homogenization process obtained an equivalent ideal material corresponding to a plane infinite panel that will not correspond with the built structural grid. The use of complex geometries and its application to tall buildings introduce effects not considered in the homogenization that will disrupt the expected structural performance. Those effects are minimized in the case of other shells structures such as domes but can be important in the case of tall buildings. It is not advisable to account for the squeezing effect by adapting the saturation with the change of the modulus size in the x-direction as the relative beam depth has a greater impact in the overall stiffness than the change of geometry due to the squeezing effect. The distortion effect cannot be accounted for directly and it depends on the angle of the distortion and the pattern. However, in the studied case it has been found a required correction factor of 1.2-1.3, in line with other uncertainty factors used in practice. Finally, the intermediate supports can have a great influence in the final drift. It depends on the pattern used and the number of diaphragms inside the module. Nevertheless, the use of intermediate supports is always beneficial and not considering them will always lead to more conservative solutions. In conclusion, this document successfully bridges the knowledge gap regarding the structural behaviour of historic Islamic patterns, with comparative tables. It identifies the best performing patterns and their best orientation, and it provides a useful tool for the decision making in the design process of in-plane bearing geometric Islamic patterns.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, mostly because the textile industry relies heavily on non-renewable resources. When looking closer at the fashion supply chain, textile wet processing, which includes dyeing and printing of fabrics, contributes significantly to the environmental impact of the fashion industry by consuming and polluting significant amounts of water. Therefore, this thesis focuses on decreasing environmental impacts of textile wet processing for marlies|dekkers (MD). Fashion supply chains are highly decentralised and therefore, traceability of lacking. This leads to a lack in transparancy. Supply chain integration or supply chain alignment could overcome these challenges. The design challenge for this thesis is formulated as follows: How can a fashion company collaborate with suppliers in its supply chain to decrease the environmental impact of its textile wet processes? An analysis of the fashion industry is given, as well as a supply chain analysis and company analysis. Furthermore, suppliers and industry experts are interviewed.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The main objective of this thesis is to assess the combined influences of specified reservoir conditions and operational parameters on the profitability of a geothermal project and on the potential for fault reactivation. The aim is to propose potential development strategies to maximize the profitability and minimize the potential for slip and reactivation of pre-existing critically stressed faults. The reservoir conditions of interest in this study include the fault permeability, the fault throw and the friction coefficient of the sandstone. The operational parameters of interest are the flowrate, the injection temperature of the re-injected water and the distance between the wells and the fault. As a case study a simplified homogeneous 3D box-shaped reservoir model is simulated based on the Delft Sandstone Member in the West Netherlands Basin, using the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Reservoir production data and local pore pressure data are generated with DARTS and serve as the input data for the fault stability model and the economic model, which are both built in Python. The fault stability model is built based on the method of Mohr circles, regional stress values in the Delft area and the failure criterion of sandstone and allows to assess the fault slip tendency of a pre-existing fault. The economic model is based on the Dutch fiscal system and policies and includes the costs of the phases of a geothermal project and required energy calculations. The outputs of the model allow to assess the profitability of a geothermal project based on the Net Present Value (NPV). Outcomes of this study have shown that the profitability and the fault stability depend highly on the joint influences of specific reservoir conditions and operational options. Sealing faults generally have a negative influence on both the NPV outcomes and the fault stability as the presence leads to decreasing heat production, higher pumping costs and higher pressure build up near the fault. This influence is strengthened when the wells are placed close to the fault, while it is reduced by placing the wells far from the fault. The flowrate and the used injection temperature are found to be the most important operational options, regardless of the reservoir conditions. Combining the highest possible flowrates and the lowest possible injection temperature maximizes the NPV outcomes. As it is found that NPV outcomes increase by a factor 6 when increasing the flowrate 2.5 times and decreasing the injection temperature by 5 K may increase the NPV values up to 19\% to 43\% depending on the flowrate. With respect to the reservoir conditions the study has shown that the fault permeability and the sandstone friction coefficient are the most important influencing reservoir conditions, compared to the fault throw. The risk for fault instability increases with decreasing value of the friction coefficient and of the fault permeability. With respect to the operational options the potential for fault slip is minimized when the lowest possible flowrate is combined with the highest possible injection temperature. However, the use of a 5 K higher injection temperature allows the use of a 600 m3/day higher flowrate. Placing the wells minimally 200 m from a fault in the homogeneous reservoir and using a minimum flowrate of 7200 m3/day maximizes the NPV outcomes and fault reactivation is reduced as much as possible. The assessment of the fault stability and the profitability is however very sensitive to the reservoir conditions, which is explicitly found from the results comparing a homogeneous and a heterogeneous reservoir.

Contemporary social, technological, economic and political trends demonstrate an emerging pressure on both primary and secondary care. The trend with the most profound impact, is the growing amount of chronically ill patients, causing a high pressure on the workforce and on limited resources. Additionally, during the past number of years, healthcare costs have been growing substantially. Simultaneously, people expect more services and more involvement in their health. Partly caused by those trends, Heart for Health seeks for a solution to work towards a ""future where remote healthcare prevents unnecessary CVRM patient visits at general practices"". But, it has been found that there are currently many obstacles to be overcome for the implementation of such solutions. This thesis aims to create a complete overview of the complex environment where Heart for Health is currently working in. Even though all stakeholders strive to work towards a healthier population, many conflicts of interests were found. Besides, the concerned stakeholders have complex expectations and desires, that are not easily satisfied. Like others, Heart for Health has experienced that overcoming those obstacles is challenging. The aim of this thesis is to research and propose how Heart for Health can create new business within the general practitioner sector. Therefore, an extensive research has been done into the current care pathway of CVRM patients and the desires of the stakeholders. In order to create a comprehensive overview, many stakeholders were involved throughout this project. A product vision has been created to formulate what a product for monitoring CVRM patients at general practitioners should contain. Besides, multiple requirements were found to develop such products. This thesis discusses why Heart for Health is currently struggling with the development and implementation of their pilot. And explores how this struggle could be overcome by taking a more customer centered approach. To do so, an explorative session has been executed to find opportunities for creating new values. This exploration has led to a proposal for a more comprehensive product than Heart for Health is currently making. To realise the development of this product, a step-by-step approach has been proposed. It is argued that Heart for Health should first focus on creating a product for patients before including general practitioners. The proposed approach is translated into a roadmap, describing the different steps that Heart for Health can use to work towards the future that they envision. This thesis strives to give a realistic and strategic perspective on the proposed solution by repeatedly testing on desirability, feasibility and viability.","Healthcare; eHealth; Roadmap; Strategy; Strategic Design; general practitioners; CVRM; Heart for Health; patient app; health monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The government aims to overcome this issue by encouraging the development of reuse markets but it is not yet clear for which building products it is possible for markets to arise; how to determine whether a self-sustaining B2B market for reusing specific products can arise with government support is the main question of the research. From Exploratory interviews, it was found that there are several types of obstacles that make reusing building products uneconomical. Literature was reviewed in search for the effects of these obstacles on the costs of reusing but it turns out that literature on this topic is lacking. Because there is already tacit knowledge available from demolition contractors who disassemble and sell second-hand products in the B2C market, it is decided to focus on supply of second-hand building products in the research. A Theoretical Framework is developed to provide the metrics for answering the main question with a supply-driven approach. It is proposed that there must be a hypothetical middleman who buys second-hand building products from demolition contractors to temporarily store them and upgrade them in order to be able to provide products that compete with new products. The framework also contains a model that demonstrates which price E1 demolition contractors must receive from middlemen to make reuse feasible for them and whether a transaction is profitable when the price E1 and the middleman’s costs E2 are subtracted from the price that builders are willing to pay for the product. Another model then evaluates whether there can be a market size for which the total profit made from all transactions is large enough for the middleman to facilitate market development. It does so by proposing how the price E1 and E2 develop when production scale increases. In a case study about reusing toilets, a method is demonstrated for determining the prices E1 and E2 at different production scales. This method is referred to as the Market Assessment Method. The price E1, that demolition contractors need to receive for disassembling a product is determined for different situations where the product occurs by means of a newly developed tool referred to as the Purchase Costs Tool. This tool is synthesized on the basis of stories from 15 demolition contractors, gathered in semi-structured interviews. The tool is validated by linguistic analysis and by testing it in practice. The tool is considered the main deliverable of the research. The case study shows that it can in fact be determined whether a market for toilets can arise by using the developed method and tool. Based on the discussion, it is concluded however that focussing on supply alone is not enough to conclude whether a market may really arise based on the method because it is not realistic that a middleman can actually supply an old product in the same way as a new product. It is proposed to do follow-up research to the additional costs that a builder needs to make for reusing second-hand products. Although the developed method does not cover the entire scope, it is concluded however that the method forms a valid basis.","Circular Economic Transition; circular economy (CE); Reuse; Building Materials; demolition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we explored the feasibility of evoking multi-frequency nociceptive SSEPs using a multisine frequency modulated pulse train. The novel electrical stimulation technique using a frequency pulse train composed of 3, 7 and 13 Hz can stimulate multiple frequencies simultaneously. For the first time, we were able to induce multi-frequency SSEPs indicated by a contralateral maximal signal to noise ratio EEG response for 3 and 7 Hz. The power in 3 and 7 Hz showed significantly higher power compared to all other frequencies up until 40 Hz.

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Previous studies show that the smart electrosurgical knife, which adds diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to the traditional electrosurgical knife, is a promising technique for breast-conserving surgery, namely it enables real-time tissue characterization while cutting. More specifically, based on the fat/water-ratio, it enables intraoperative healthy from malignant tissue discrimination, therefore potentially reducing the re-excision rate with breast-conserving surgery procedures. However, the smart electrosurgical knife cannot be used on patients yet since it has not been validated yet. Several studies suggest phantoms are ideal for validation of systems including imaging systems like diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Hence, for this master thesis, the objective was to develop a breast phantom that enables validation of the smart electrosurgical knife.<br/><br/>Firstly, it was found that a study which enables validation of the smart electrosurgical knife, should mimic a breast-conserving surgery procedure including a breast phantom, so that the potential of the intraoperative margin assessment technique ‘’ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ‘’, added to the traditional electrosurgical knife, could sufficiently be tested. For such a study to take place, it was found that the phantom should have a similar size and shape as human breasts containing a tumour. With regard to pre- and postoperative margin assessment, the phantom should have a contrast between the tumour and healthy phantom, which enables size, border, and location assessment of the phantom tumour upfront and residual tumour inspection after surgery. Intraoperatively, the phantom should have a significant difference in fat/water-ratio between the tumour and healthy phantom. This enables us to assess diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with its capability in discriminating healthy from malignant tissue. Furthermore, visually and mechanically, there should be a minimal difference between the tumour and healthy phantom, which eliminates the possibility of using the intraoperative margin assessment techniques, palpation and visual inspection. Finally, the phantom should have similar mechanical- electrically conductive and thermo tolerance properties as real breast tissue. This will result in realistic haptic feedback and tissue effects with electrosurgery.<br/><br/>To develop such a phantom, various fat/water-ratios of water and lard, in combination with various additives such as guar gum, agar, gelatin and barium sulphate, were produced and tested. It turned out that agar in combination with water, lard, and the contrast agent barium sulphate, enables breast phantom production, that meets all the aforementioned phantom requirements. More specifically, the final phantom is a breast-shaped phantom with a realistic size and shape, consisting of healthy tissue with a tumour inclusion. The healthy tissue is composed of 50% lard, 50% water and then 5% agar by weight of water, whereas the tumour is composed of 20% lard, 80% water and then 3% agar- and 5% barium sulphate by weight of water. Since this phantom meets all requirements, it enables the design of a study that subsequently enables extensive testing and further validation of the smart electrosurgical knife.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The amount of possibilities of enhancing the listening experience is enlarged drastically by setting up arrays of speakers in front of and around the audience. Technological advancements make it possible to render recorded audio channels for an immersive audio system during live performances. These advancements rely on spatial audio rendering techniques, which will be described partly in this thesis. The elaboration on these techniques serves to clarify how the created audio effects are generated. Object-based audio (OBA) mixing allows the rendering of (pre)recorded audio channels for an immersive audio system. OBA mixing allows to be very close to the listening experience. In the project that is presented in this thesis, an in-depth look is taken at the use cases of immersive audio in the application of live performances. The users of immersive audio systems, who carry the responsibility of developing and executing the content that is reproduced over such systems, are determined and involved in defining a number of common use cases. Through the ability of defining specific requirements, these use cases lay the foundation for the development of a concept of a mixing tool for immersive audio systems. These requirements are supported by a respective definition of quality. Qualitative research is also done in terms of generating ideas. Furthermore, a look is taken at existing relevant software, with analogous functionalities. The research is bundled in a concept for a mixing tool, which is worked out in a visual mock-up. This mock-up is used in an evaluation study, to create an insight into the desirability of the concept. The concept is also laid parallel to its requirements that have been set for it. At last, elements of the concept, which are missing despite their relevance, are discussed. Further research is suggested for the development of these elements. Additionally, some use cases that arose during the project for the use of OBA mixing in the further future are presented.","immersive audio; object-based mixing; audio mixing; mastering tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-06","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In a literature review, four main things were explored. The concept of Mental Models and Common Ground, the concept of bandwidth, the current state of VR and VR collaboration and the composites of ATG. This formed the theoretical basis for the project. <br/>It became clear that there were two knowledge gaps. The first one being the composite production process and the second being what communication tools were currently used and why. <br/>To gain insight into the production process, an immersion exercise was done in which the designer did the actual production process. This was then made it into a timeline and discussed with the composite team to ensure it was accurate. The main conclusion was to focus on the alignment process.<br/>Ten interviews were done to determine the use of each communication tool. The results of these interviews were then clustered and made into charts and a write-up. This indicated that a traceable and high bandwidth tool did not exist yet which presents an opportunity for VR.<br/>For the conceptualisation, a set of requirements were created based on the previous research. These requirements helped to create a concept direction. The concept direction is a Virtual reality tool that does two main things. First, it records sketches, objects and the engineers’ position and voice in 3D over time to capture Mental Models. Secondly, by organising those Mental Models in a clear project structure that makes the Mental Models traceable and findable in a persistent project.<br/>An almost fully featured prototype of the concept was build using a method called RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation). This meant multiple iterations of the prototype were made and evaluated. The QUESI questionnaire was used to evaluate the performance of each iteration. <br/>A between-group study was done to evaluate the prototype on its ability to transfer Mental Models. Participants were shown either a video or a written description of a process, which they were then asked to answer questions about, resulting in an individual score. Furthermore, they were asked about their perceived understanding of the domain before and after the immersion activity, as well as their opinion on the experience. A video of the prototype was used so the study could be done online. This was necessary to recruit participants.<br/>With 24 participants the results came back mostly insignificant but the video of VR did perform better on clarity and experience. It performed slightly higher but not significantly so on the score and the perceived understanding. That is still a promising result as preparation time was lower and the VR tool is traceable.","Virtual Reality; Composite Production; Hand Lay-up; Mental Models; Common Ground; Collaboration; rite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van der Veen, M.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Searching for better ways to store the excess renewable energy at large scale, the topic regarding sorption enhanced methanation of CO2 is researched, pushing the Sabatier reaction over the theoretical equilibrium by means of different water-absorbing zeolites. Till now zeolites and catalyst were mixed separately in the reactor for sorption enhancement. In this thesis, the focus is on impregnating the catalyst on the zeolite as the support, so as to shorten the diffusion path length of water vapour. This material will be called ‘the bifunctional material’. This report covers 2 subtopics: Firstly, do bigger pore sized zeolites improve the sorption enhanced CO2 methanation? An appropriate zeolite is searched, resulting in just one zeolite found from the 237, namely the zeolite L. Thereafter, the zeolite L, 13X and 5A zeolites, were impregnated with nickel citrate or nickel nitrate. These bifunctional materials are characterized with the XRD, SEM/EDX and H2-TPR. In addition, two distinct tests in a fixed bed Sabatier setup were executed: The activity and sorption enhanced methanation tests. Overall, the results show that the nickel impregnated zeolite L activity is between impregnated 13X and the 5A activity (13X &lt; L &lt; 5A). The sorption enhanced test reveals that impregnated 13X and 5A did have sorption enhancement but not for impregnated zeolite L. Secondly, how do cleaned bifunctional materials affect the activity compared to regular bifunctional material from evaporation impregnation? Here, the influence of washing on the nickel loading is examined with SEM/EDX. Thereafter, the activity test shows the effect of cleaning on the activity. Finally, the activity of various bifunctional samples (zeolite supports) are compared with reference samples (impregnated Al2O3 supports), based on comparable support’s pore structure. The results show the following: Increasing the amount of washing did not have a noticeable effect on the nickel loading. Just by changing the impregnation method from evaporative impregnation method to filtered impregnation method without additional washing (1,2,3,4 or 5x) is sufficient to prepare clean bifunctional material, containing only little precipitated salt precursor material. Furthermore, by comparing regular and cleaned bifunctional material per zeolite, reveals that the 5A is impregnated primarily on the outside surface of the zeolite followed by L and 13X (nickel on the outside surface: 13X = 51.3%, L =58.1% &amp; 5A = 84.9%). The activity test displays that the effective activity (conversion per gram nickel catalyst) of cleaned impregnated 13X and 5A are the highest in H2 conversion. This makes it interesting for further research since separation enhancement of the Sabatier reaction reduces byproduct formation (CO) to a very large extent. The activity test comparing bifunctional samples with reference samples result that, supports with similar-looking pore structures do not lead to comparable activity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Development of the coastal system inevitably leads to changes in these associated societal and ecological systems. Hence, a coast is not only defined by its physical characteristics, but it can also be defined by means of values and interests. The mouth of the Haringvliet in the Southwest of the Netherlands is a striking example where coastal evolution has its impact on societal and ecological systems. Here, a multitude of anthropogenic interferences triggered a regime shift of the coastal system. While continuously developing towards a new equilibrium, coastal evolution has its impact on societal and ecological systems.

This project taps into the quality of current courses on the market, which is insufficient for people to understand Design Thinking as well as to comprehend how Design Thinking can be applied in practice. The project has taken on a design-led approach. After a quick benchmark of several existing courses, a literature study has been executed. Subsequently, an existing course has been observed, and different interviews have been conducted with eight people from the target group, two Design Thinking trainers and ten participants that have participated in a Design Thinking course. These observations and interviews have led to several insights for the new course. Furthermore, as a set of key mindsets for Design Thinking novices has been selected based on a co-creation session with three design students and four people from the target group. The results have been used to develop an operational framework for Design Thinking novices, which integrates the Design Thinking process and key mindsets. This framework, as well as constructive alignment, have led to the realisation of a prototype of the course. The prototype has been validated with twenty participants, divided over two different settings (i.e. an in-company course in the private sector and an open course in the public sector). The validation of the prototype has proven that the course is projectable in both situations. Furthermore, the activities of the course enable participants to accomplish the learning objectives. Follow-up interviews have shown that participants actively integrate the key mindsets after the course into their context at work. An additional insight from the interviews was that the course must contain an overview of all the design methods and tools with practical guidelines to enable the participants to apply the Design Thinking process after the course. Furthermore, the course must empower participants to convince others in their context of the added value of Design Thinking in projects. Based on these results, the prototype has been iterated and refined, and a final product has been presented, which is assumed to allow Design Thinking to be embedded in organisations successfully.","Design Thinking; Mindsets; Corporate; Course; Training; Novices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It can be reached through product differentiation, but innovation is also obtained through having the right employees. Corporate cultures that support to take the risk and think creatively will be led to new products, services and strategies. However, these innovations are only beneficial if they manifest superior value in the customer-driven marketplace. To do so, companies should act upon customer-centricity: the act of placing the customer at the centre of everything one does, by listening to what they have to tell, studying their needs, and afterwards using these gained insights in one’s process. By putting consumers first and empathising with them, one gains an understanding of the target group, but even though this is very important, it is often not sufficient for successful NPD (New Product Development). Instead, consumers need to be present and cooperating in NPD stages to provide valuable feedback. This involvement can be managed with the well-known principle of Design Thinking, primarily through the first step of empathising. Empathy is described as an identification process of “becoming” the experience of the client, and it is based on the two components of affective and cognitive empathy. By balancing these two and with that optimally empathising with customers (understanding the customer; recognising the customer), innovation and profitability are reached. Hence, a new type of innovating was introduced: Empathy-driven Innovation. One in which companies focus on the deepest underlying needs of their users and the quality of those, by putting the customer first and performing all company-energies while thinking on behalf of the consumer, to stimulate innovation. <br/><br/>However, based on a Case Study at HEMA, it was found that there is currently limited contact with (and involvement of) customers happening in (design) processes within the studied company. The goal of the Case Study was to find out how much innovation was currently happening through both qualitative and quantitative research. The study discovered five lacking factors of innovation to be improved. Firstly, employees should not only acknowledge Customer-centricity but also act upon it. Secondly, employees should use (more) customer insights in the fuzzy front end to build a foundation for their products to make. Also, the perceived level of innovation among employees should be enhanced. Fourthly, all employees should take ownership of innovation: it is not a one man’s job. Finally, HEMA should become a frontrunner, whereas they are right now following other businesses to get ahead. A strategy was created to integrate customers in HEMA working processes, to become therefore more innovative. The HEMA framework, based on empathising with the customer, is short for Hear, Experience, Melt and Analyse. These four steps in the HEMA model are in the first place easy to remember for employees because of the acronym and second of all, they support the employee to engage in customer interaction. The designed HEMA Empathy Toolbox takes care of the company’s lacking factor of innovation. The toolbox contains, amongst others, a HEMA Empathy Card Deck with 42 questions that enable the employee to take on the perspective of the customer. While supporting employees to take on this perspective or to even act as if they are the customer themselves, it stimulates active customer participation in company processes. A Customer Involvement Panel is the end-goal of the strategical roadmap to this issue and is recommended to support employees even more to have direct contact with their user. With this panel, employees can set up meetings themselves to, together with Empathy-driven Innovators, facilitate co-creation sessions with real customers. Ultimately, this HEMA Empathy Framework will improve the rate of customer engagement, and with that stimulate and reach innovation.","Innovation; Framework; Strategical Roadmap; Empathy; Employee Engagement; Customer Involvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The generalization of B-splines to multiple dimensions is done through tensor products of their univariate basis functions. The number of basis functions and weights that define a multivariate B-spline surface, therefore, increase exponentially with the number of dimensions, i.e. B-splines suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Tensor network theory provides a mathematical framework to alleviate the curse of dimensionality of B-splines by representing the high-dimensional weight tensor as a low-rank approximation. This thesis presents the Tensor Network B-spline (TNBS) model, along with an optimization algorithm that allows the estimation of the exponentially large weight tensor directly from data, without ever needing to explicitly construct it. P-spline regularization is incorporated to induce additional smoothness and ensure the B-spline hypersurface generalizes well across the high-volume domain. The developed TNBS framework opens doors for the application of B-spline theory in high-dimensional function approximation. This thesis provides an overview of both B-spline and tensor network theory, then uses it to derive the TNBS model. We validate the effectiveness of the model through an application in black-box nonlinear system identification using a NARX approach. An open-source MATLAB implementation of TNBS is made available on GitHub. The work is concluded with some recommendations for further research on this topic.","function approximation; B-splines; tensor networks; tensor decomposition; curse of dimensionality; system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""
