(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Biomedical engineering focuses in advancing health care by taking advantage of the technological improvement. An important part of biomedical engineering is biomedical sensing, that focuses in the acquisition of biopotential signals. Through time, a lot of research has been done on the acquisition of biopotential signals and a variety of methods has been presented. The main goal of the front-end circuits of the biomedical sensing devices is to convert the analog value obtained by a sensor to its digital equivalent. In order to achieve an accurate conversion, the analog-to-digital converters used, need to achieve a medium resolution and a sampling frequency at the kilohertz range. Another important aspect in biomedical sensing devices is to achieve minimum power and area consumption. The properties of the biopotential signals and the requirements set by the biomedical applications, make the design of ADCs based on classical mixed architectures increasingly difficult, as technology scaling deteriorates the performance of the analog part of the devices. In the presented thesis, time-domain signal processing techniques have been used in order to develop a programmable resolution, low-voltage, low-power and small-area time-mode ADC for biomedical applications. The proposed time-mode ADC is a novel architecture and it is composed of a voltagecontrolled ring oscillator based analog-to-time converter, followed by an asynchronous, unfolded SAR, coarse TDC and an asynchronous, enhanced range. fine flash TDC, As the input is sensed, the analog-to-time converter, embeds the analog informationwithin the time period between a rising and a falling edge of the output signal. Following, the output time pulse is fed to the TDC that quantizes the pulse and produces the digital equivalent representation of the sensed value. The resolution of the ADC can be programmed from 8 to 10 bits. The delay elements of the coarse TDC are based on a novel modified version of Dynamic Leakage Suppresion delay elements. Moreover, a novel background calibration mechanism is introduced to correct the errors due to process variation. The calibration removes the offset and gain error of the ADC and achieves DNL and INL reduction. The integrated circuit has been implemented in a 65nm TSMC process and its performance has been evaluated through Cadence and Synopsys tools. The ADC uses a 0.5V supply voltage and consumes 771 nW for 10-bit resolution. The total area of the ADC is 0.01342 mm2. The maximum sampling rate is 2.2 KS/s. The DNL and INL of the 10 bit converter are +0.86/-0.83 and +0.88/-1.79 respectively. The simulation results indicate an SNDR of 61.3 dB and an ENOB of 9.8 bit for a 10mV peak-to-peak 1kHz input frequency.","time-mode; ADC; TDC; ATC; Biomedical sensing; low energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to the best of authors' knowledge, no studies are available that investigated the individual or combined effects of PTE and ESE on perceived sportiness and driving behaviour. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESE, PTE and their combination on perceived sportiness and driving behaviour. <br/>In a within-subject driving simulator study, thirty-two participants drove under five conditions: no enhancement (Off), PTE, ESE, PTE and ESE combined (PTE-ESE) and a control condition (Control) with a physically sportier car (i.e., more engine power and a sports car sound). PTE provided a more sensitive pedal-to-throttle mapping and ESE an engine sound associated with increased engine speed. Both implementations did not increase engine power. Perceived sportiness was measured using a questionnaire, whereas driving behaviour was retrieved from the simulator.<br/>The results showed that ESE contributed significantly to perceived sportiness and perceived engine responsiveness, whereas PTE had no to limited effect. Furthermore, ESE created the impression of enhanced engine responsiveness, more so than PTE. PTE resulted in increased acceleration during acceleration from standstill, whereas driving behaviour was not significantly affected by ESE compared to Off. In addition, PTE significantly influenced control behaviour: it led to a decreased mean accelerator pedal depression angle and an increased mean throttle reversal rate compare to Off.<br/>We conclude that ESE increases perceived sportiness to the extent it approaches the perceived sportiness of an actual sportier car without altering the driving behaviour or decreasing safety margins. The findings of this study support the use of ESE in sport mode. PTE should be further explored in an experimental setup that provides vestibular feedback.","perceived sportiness; engine sound enhancement; power-train enhancement; driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The reality of climate change and the consequential pressure to act fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions requires immediate attention. And yet, despite this unprecedented urgency, active public engagement needed to motivate meaningful change is still missing.<br/> <br/> This graduation project explores how to utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) – to motivate public engagement through the emotion of fascination and element of play. The final design of this exploration is an interactive exhibition piece that allows its users to create novel, AI-generated landscapes.<br/><br/> In the first phase of the project, hands-on exploration of the use of GANs as a design opportunity was conducted and the experiences of the exploration process documented. Further research through interviews with climate researchers and literature review into the topics of climate change helped to get an understanding of the climate context and map out and narrow down the solution space for the following ideation phase. The context research revealed that the current climate debate is deeply emotional, with mostly negative emotions like fear and hopelessness in its center. Yet, it was also found that fostering positive emotions like fascination and joy is a potential means to increase interest and motivate people to engage with climate initiatives. Based on the context exploration, a series of design prototypes were created and tested with participants to inform the final design.<br/><br/>The final concept LANDSHAPES is an interactive exhibition piece intended for the museum context. It features a circular projection of AI-generated aerial landscapes – images that look real, yet have never been seen by anyone before. The installation enables participants to become absorbed in the morphing landscapes and experience their potential impact on our surroundings in a playful, open-ended manner.<br/> A preliminary installation was evaluated with participants using qualitative methods of observation and interviews. The installation evoked a deep sense of beauty, calmness, and inspiration that contributed to a meditation-like, engaging experience. Even without a predefined narrative, participants automatically associated the morphing images with our changing planet and ascribed meaning to the abstract visuals. The addition of control over the moving landscapes resulted in a mindset shift, as the experience transformed from a passive and meditative experience to an experience with additional cognitive involvement. The preference of experience differed between participants.<br/><br/> The design research conducted in this project strengthens the assumption that experiences with positive emotion in its center can be used to foster initial engagement with the topic of climate change. Furthermore, it showed that GAN technology can be used to evoke an emotional response, which offers interesting opportunities for future work. More specifically, the research suggests the potential for further development of playful experiences to make climate data accessible and engaging to the general public, as well as an opportunity to explore GANs that utilize emotional value as an input to generate targeted media that reinforces or counteracts the viewer’s emotional response.","Artificial Intelligence; Satellite Imagery; Generative Adversarial Network; Playful Interactions; Installation design; Climate engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In my work, I explore how design might produce experiences that are optimised for both forms of resonance. In doing so, I aim to contribute knowledge that furthers scientifically informed interaction design and enables the design of effective, enjoyable and personalised brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurotherapeutics. My findings are expressed through an audiovisual installation that uses a feedback loop between participant and designer to co-compose a data-driven resonant experience.

One of these researches is the PARSIFAL project, that investigates an efficient box-wing aircraft for passenger transport. In previous work, an engine sizing tool is developed to design the engines of the PARSIFAL aircraft. The tool is developed as part of the Multi-Model Generator (MMG), a knowledge based engineering application developed in the Flight Performance section. This work also included an engine integration study, which showed that a fuselage mounting is preferred over a wing mounting. However, the integration study lacked the desired design sensitivity for small design changes, e.g. engine diameter and length. Because of this lack of design sensitivity, the question whether the engine installation following from this work is ideal remains open. Therefore, in this thesis a best practice for engine integration studies during the preliminary design phase is investigated. The found best practice is then used to re-asses the engine installation by aligning the engines with the local flow. The best practice is also employed to asses under wing engine installations, to establish the potential use of the practice for this type of installations. Before the trade-off study for a best practice could be performed, changes to the MMG had to be made. Three primitives, the building blocks that create an aircraft geometry, had to be adapted. A new wing primitive, through flow nacelle (TFN) geometry, and a pylon primitive are introduced. In search of a best practice, textbook analyses, 3d panel solvers, and combinations of the two are compared. To fully assess an engine integration, information on lift, drag, and pitching moment is required. Since textbook methods only provide information on drag, these are not satisfactory on their own. Nonetheless, these methods can be used to predict the drag addition of a pylon, when only airframe and nacelle are simulated. In two panel solvers, FlightStream and VSAERO, two analysis practices are tested. The first being a simulation including airframe, nacelle, and pylon and the second being a simulation including airframe and nacelle complemented with a textbook correction for the pylon drag. Following a trade-off, using speed, accuracy, ease-of-use, and design sensitivity as criteria, a simulation with FlightStream of airframe and nacelle with a textbook addition of pylon drag proved to be the best analysis practice. This best practice is employed to re-asses the engine installation of the PARSIFAL aircraft. While the location is fixed, since it aligns with the structure inside the airframe, the orientation is changed to align with the local flow. This alignment results in a 3% decrease of aerodynamic efficiency loss and a 17% reduction of pitching moment increase, with respect to the original engine orientation. In a second study, the potential of the best practice to analyse under wing engine installations is tested by changing the location of an engine under the rear wing of the PARSIFAL box-wing. These results show that with proper placement, the same aerodynamic efficiency loss can be obtained as for fuselage installations.","Airframe-engine integration; Aerodynamic performance; Best practice; Box-wing; Panel solver; Textbook analysis; Preliminary design; Knowledge based engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Capturing CO2 directly from the air has gained wide attention as it is one of the possible solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change. Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is a start-up in Delft that develops a small-scale plant to produce methanol from sunlight and air only. CO2 and H2O are captured from the air by a direct air capture unit that operates continuously by means of an absorption and stripping column. Liquid amines are investigated as chemical sorbent. In this work, the stripping column is characterized and optimized for the liquid amine tetra-ethylenepentamine (TEPA). A vapor-liquid equilibrium based stage-by-stage stripper model was established using mass and energy balances for each stage individually. A number of input parameters was specified to understand the effect of those parameters on the performance of the stripping column. The parameters include; composition, temperature and mass flow rate of the feed, number of stages, H2O reflux ratio, temperature of the reboiler and absolute pressure of the column. The mass balance was solved according to the Rachford-Rice equation while using bisection as numerical root finder. To validate the stripper model, experiments were performed for varying configurations regarding the input parameters mentioned above. For this, a trayed stripping column with bubble caps, was build and adjusted according to the experimental plan. Furthermore, single stage kinetic experiments were performed at 115 °C and 950 mbar to find the limitations of the desorption process inside the column. Subsequently, the Damköhler number was estimated to understand the effects of reaction rate and diffusion during the process. Sensitivity analyses were performed to find the effect of input parameters on the performance of the stripping column. The effect was measured in terms of; CO2 concentration in the outlet stream, cyclic capacity of the liquid solvent, CO2 and H2O vapor ratio in the top stage of the column and energy demand per desorbed mol of CO2. Based on the results, a tool to predict the performance of the stripper in an elementary way was produced. Based on the kinetic experiments, it was found that a typical hold up time that is required for the system to reach equilibrium was measured at 600 s. This number was used to estimate the liquid hold up volume per stage in the final stripper design. The experimental and model results were combined in a new stripper design considering the operating conditions stated by ZEF. The 5 stage column operates at 1000 mbar and a reboiler temperature of 120 °C. The feed was preheated up to 105 °C and the mass flow rate was determined at 0.31 g/s resulting in a hold up volume of 187 ml per stage. The cyclic capacity of the system equals 3.3 mol CO2 per kg TEPA and the energy demand was found to be 279 kJ per mol CO2. In addition, a new design for ZEF's direct air capture system was presented where the absorption column is modelled as a black box. An heat exchanger was implemented to minimize the energy demand of the system, which resulted in a lowest energy demand of 2319 kWh per ton of CO2. This is slightly higher than the DAC energy demand of companies like Climeworks, Carbon Engineering and Global Thermostat, but could potentially decrease when optimizing the system.","Direct air capture; Stripping; Liquid amines; CO2 capture; Desorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-26","","","","","",""

As a result, texture control is an imperative part of manufacturing processes, especially those involving plastic deformation, such as rolling, which significantly impact crystallographic texture. The exact mechanisms and underlying causes behind such texture evolutions are not well understood. This study investigates the effect of initial disorientation topology on plastically deformed texture, with the help of mean field crystal plasticity simulations performed using the ALAMEL model. The simulated textures are compared to experimentally measured textures of IF steel samples with symmetric rolling reductions of 55 % and 83 %. The results indicate a clear distinction between low disorientation topologies and high disorientation topologies, most evident at high rolling reductions. The study aims to incorporate the disorientation information into the ALAMEL simulations, by re-ordering textural input orientations. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used in addition to the Hungarian Algorithm to re-order orientations based on pre-set disorientation angles. A comparison between the two re-ordering algorithms is also performed, and the Hungarian algorithm is found to have a disorientation distribution closer the ideal result. A comparison between the two yields minimal differences, with the difference between the two results being the error index local minima for minimum disorientation evolved textures and average disorientation (between 35°. Local maxima for error index comparisons are observed for very high disorientation values of over 60°. In the present study, we also result spread for similar disorientation topologies orders to discount the randomness associated with such a process. Thus, multiple files are created with largely similar disorientation characteristics but different grain orders. An overlap is observed for high disorientation simulations, at a higher frequency for lower rolling reductions. The deviation of obtained results is also highest for a disorientation angle average of 15°. The simulated texture comparisons between textures with modified and unmodified texture disorientation topology also indicate a higher disparity with minimum disorientation modified texture. A convergence is observed at a disorientation value between 35° and 40°, close to the disorientation average of the unmodified texture, and an overlap is observed at higher disorientation values. The valorisation of such a technology is also considered in this study. The current study precedes applied research and is assessed as a level 2 on the technology readiness scale, in danger of facing the ‘valley of death’. This is owing to fading interest and funding unless the private sector see’s value in the technology. The domain most aligned for the application of such technology is electrical steels, which is set to see a large increase in demand and will play a significant role in the energy transition and move towards electrical mobility. The high cost of development and price sensitive market serve as barriers of entry, and entry into the niche beachhead market of DC converters for next generation ‘more electrified aircraft’ is determined to be an appropriate valorisation strategy. The study also proposes a ‘way to market’ strategy, drawing parallels with other high tech and high value material industries, to determine ‘critical partnerships’ with high levels of integration in addition to leadership in materials and manufacturing development as key factors for a successful market entry.","Crystal Plasticity; Electrical Steels; Monte Carlo; ALAMEL; Disorientation Topology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Railway infrastructure managers aim to increase the rail network capacity with the minimum possible investments in infrastructure. Next generation signalling concepts such as Moving Block (MB) and Virtual Coupling (VC) are expected to bring significant capacity benefits to railway corridors. The aim of this thesis is to identify capacity benefits of Virtual coupling over ETCS L3 MB considering a realistic operational setup, where different rolling stock characteristics, driving behavior and traffic information updates exist. Inspired by safety distance car-following models, the multi-state train-following model developed by Quaglietta et al. (2020) is enhanced with a dynamic term, called Dynamic Safety Margin (DSM). The DSM ensures that the following train can come to a standstill at any time applying service braking, even in the worst-case scenario when the leading train applies emergency braking. The DSM accounts for positioning errors, the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication update delay, different train control delay times, and braking capabilities of trains running as a convoy. An One-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is conducted to evaluate the importance of selected model parameters in railway capacity. The model parameters under investigation concern the V2V update delay, the train control delay time, and the braking rate of the following train. The braking rate of the following train is proved to have a significant impact on railway capacity, implying that trains with better braking performance imply shorter time headways. To identify potential capacity benefits of the proposed model over ETCS L3 MB, operational scenarios are executed through microscopic simulation in the EGTRAIN tool. The scenarios consider three different rolling stock types, being suburban, regional, and intercity trains. For trains running on open track without stops, the proposed model promises the highest capacity benefits over ETCS L3 MB, for trains with improved braking and acceleration characteristics. For train services with stops, all the train convoy combinations show promising capacity benefits, which are higher for heterogeneous train convoys. Moreover, headways can be reduced to the minimum possible when faster trains follow slower trains. Finally, this model enables multiple train convoy formation based on a predecessor-follower communication topology, where a safety distance is always ensured between trains.","Virtual coupling; Dynamic safety margin; Safe train separation; Sensitivity analysis; Railway capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

After developing a traffic forecast and resulting CO2 forecast, the four levers were used to limit carbon emissions toward a net-zero emission scenario in 2050. The 22 ASTM certified SAF alternatives were tested against carbon mitigation power and costs, the latter being determined by using the experience curve theory of decreased prices with increased cumulative production. This results in the FT-SPK fuel made from Municipal Solid Waste as being the most attractive SAF alternative with a Net Present Value of 875 million USD. However, it is recommended to include extra fuel alternatives in this research in the future. For example, Power-to-Liquid fuels will have great potential, but are not certified yet.","Aviation; aircraft emissions; environmental economics; traffic forecasting; Cost-Benefit Analysis; experience curve; sustainable mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This negatively impacted their psychological well being which is important for providing optimal care and maintaining long-term employability (Schoonhoven &amp; Trappenburg, 2020). There is a lack of accessible and low-threshold support tools such as online peer support platforms for nurses. While storytelling driven online peer support is a promising tool, it is unclear how it should be designed. This project aimed to design a storytelling tool, specific to the psychological needs of the Dutch nurses, that best facilitates online peer support. This report describes the research, design and evaluation activities as part of the design process of SLOWLY - A tool that helps nurses reflect on their experiences, preparing them to write a story to be shared as part of online peer support. A context and target group analysis lead to the assessment of the thirteen fundamental needs (Desmet &amp; Fokkinga, 2020). Fulfilment of autonomy, competence and relatedness, as part of self determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000), was found to be critically low. This was the primary source for the design requirements of SLOWLY. After using the design requirements to access a wide variety of design interventions, SLOWLY proved to be the most promising concept due to its potential to provide understanding about an experience in an accessible, low-threshold and safe manner. A detailed digital prototype was created, which used five storytelling prompts (character, setting, plot, conflict and theme) to guide nurses in a five day reflection process. Their responses were shown to them during the writing process to help them write stories with more details relevant to their experience. SLOWLY was found to provide increased understanding of the experience based on user testing with seven participants. It showed potential to fulfil all three critically affected fundamental needs. An additional expert review with one nurse yielded a positive response to the likeability, ease of use, clarity and benefit of SLOWLY. The results of this project provided insight into the potential role of storytelling in facilitating online peer support for nurses. Further research is recommended to evaluate longitudinal effects and possible interactions as a result of story sharing.","Nurses; Healthcare; Reflection; Well-being; Peer support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

These applications increase the demand for machine learning models to extract information from these images. To provide these models, improve their performance and reduce the time that experts have to spend on manually tuning them, the field of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims to automate the design process of machine learning models by optimizing the selection of algorithms and their hyperparameters for each application. This work applies an AutoML approach to medical image classification, using a Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically optimize the selection of preprocessing and classification algorithms and their hyperparameters. Its performance is compared with the performance of a random search optimization strategy, evaluated on three datasets from three different clinical applications. The results show that the Bayesian optimization and the random search return models that achieve similar performance on the unseen test sets. We show that a random search with relatively few evaluations and a simple ensemble strategy is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to a more sophisticated and more computationally demanding Bayesian optimization approach, therefore validating the use of a random search optimization strategy in this medical image classification setting. All found models generalize poorly, with average F1-scores on the validation sets used for optimizing the models being at least 20\% lower than the average F1-scores on the unseen test sets. Finally, we further emphasize the difficulty to generalize in this setting, by showing that the differences between subsets of the evaluated datasets are large and that increasing the computation time of the optimization does not benefit the test set performance of the final solution.","Automated Machine Learning; Radiomics; Bayesian Optimization; Random Search; Image Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The IRJ creates a discontinuity in stiffness and geometry that leads to wheel-rail impact forces. The angled IRJ is a proposal to reduce these impact forces. Despite the real-world experiences with angled IRJs the research on the topic is marginal. In this thesis a study is presented into the dynamic behaviour of the wheel-rail impact occurring at IRJs. Numerical models are established to simulate a wheel rolling over IRJs with angles of 0, 15, 30 and 45 degrees, using the implicit-explicit sequential finite element method with the software ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The impact forces are the main output and analysed. Three variations of the IRJ models were used for simulations. The basic version IRJ model is built up with a fully constrained rail foot to simulate an infinite support stiffness condition. The second version is supported by spring and damper elements to simulate supports such as ballast and rail pads. Height differences between the rail ends are generated when a wheel passes the joint, which corresponds to a real-world scenario. Different degrees of support degradation are simulated by varying the support stiffness, using the spring and damper element parameters. The third version also incorporates the spring and damper elements as support but couples some nodes between the fish plate and rail web in vertical displacement to reduce the rail height difference caused by wheel pass-by, aiming to simulate a ‘factory-new’ condition joint. The established models were validated in terms of wheel-rail contact solution and contact force amplitude. In comparison with existing FE wheel-rail impact models the proposed models in this thesis are less time consuming and more flexible for joint angle adjustments. The second version simulating degraded joint conditions provided the most interesting findings and was used in a sensitivity analysis by varying the velocity and wheel load. The simulation results show that angled IRJs are advantageous when degradation is present, whereas in ‘new joint’ conditions the gap width plays a significant role and angled IRJs with larger gaps produce higher impact forces. Based on the results the recommendation is given to consider angled IRJs on tracks with a low maintenance scheme and further research is suggested.","insulated rail joint; IRJ; angled; FEM modelling; implicit-explicit; contact force; wheel-rail; impact force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In order to establish a reliable model, the input parameters are investigated by means of a literature study and sensitivity study. Additionally, the numerical model is validated by comparing the results to an analytical study. From the analytical study it is determined that the failure mechanisms are correctly estimated by the numerical analysis. However, differences between the values of ultimate strength and ductility were observed. The effect of the confinement is investigated by a pushover analysis on a shear wall with two different masonry tensile strengths: ft = 0.01 N/mm2 and ft = 0.03 N/mm2. These values are selected to show how such a small difference in tensile strength results in a different failure mechanism of the wall, and therefore results in a vastly different displacement capacity and ultimate strength. Additionally, a shear wall with and without a window opening is studied. If the building is constructed with extremely low-strength masonry (ft = 0.01 N/mm2), the timber frame confinement will increase the resistance of the wall (with or without window opening) against the pushover load. If the building is constructed with masonry having a tensile strength of 0.03 N/mm2 or higher, the confinement has a negative impact on the ductility of the closed wall. For the wall with window opening the confinement triples its ultimate strength. Weather a strong or a ductile structure is more desirable, depends on the demand with respect to the seismic spectrum. If the ground motion demands a strong structure, it is advised to confine the masonry with a timber frame consisting of four timber bands, and columns at each wall junction. The design of the timber frame as recommended by the Nepali building codes is determined to not be sufficient and must be altered in order to provide this positive impact on the structure’s resistance. Firstly, the columns must be placed at both sides of the band, instead of on the inner side only, to avoid eccentric loads on the bands. Secondly, the cross-sectional dimensions of the bands and columns must be increased avoid failure of the connections and splitting of the timber. Taking these aspects into account, a new design for the confinement method is presented in this study. The limitations of the conclusions of this research follow from the investigation of a single, in-plane wall only. One of the goals of the use of bands is to improve the box behaviour, for which the out-of-plane performance must be investigated. Moreover, an analysis on a three-dimensional structure is needed to fully answer the research question. In a three-dimensional study, the closed walls and walls with opening give a combined response to the load, therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of the confinement are combined as well.","rubble stone masonry; earthquake; numerical analysis; seismic bands; Nepal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

If the reciprocity is lacking in the system, any time delay that appears between the upstream and downstream signals at zero-flow conditions will result in false flow measurement. This phenomenon is known as the zero-flow error. <br/>This thesis presents a system in which the reciprocity property has been ensured by matching the electrical impedances of the front-end electronic circuits, namely: the output impedance of the transmitter Z$_\text{out}$ and the input impedance of the receiver Z$_\text{in}$. To achieve this, a circuit has been developed that can be used as both a transmitter and a receiver. This is the main feature that distinguishes the proposed design from those presented in previous work. The transmitter-receiver circuit has been implemented using a three-stage operational amplifier in unity gain feedback configuration. The class AB output stage of the amplifier is equipped with an additional function being used in receive mode for sensing and amplification of the signal. The simulation result obtained by the cross-correlation method yields a zero-flow error value of 30 fs, which is at least by three orders of magnitude smaller than the results achieved in prior work. The input and output impedances are equal to Z$_\text{in}$=73.2$\angle$80.7$^ \text {o}$ m$\Omega$ and Z$_\text{out}$=79.6$\angle$77.3$^ \text {o}$ m$\Omega$ respectively. A small mismatch remaining between the impedances prevents perfect reciprocity to be established in the system.

A compliant surface is a thin layer of viscoelastic material drawing inspiration from dolphin epidermis, which was thought to have drag-reducing capabilities by Gray (1936). Research into the drag reduction capabilities of compliant surfaces has been long going for more than five decades, starting with Kramer (1960), yet no firm conclusion has been reached. In addition, most of the experimental research has been focused on water flows, with air flows regarded as incapable of inertially forcing a compliant surface to deform. This research attempts to disprove this assumption by applying the proper inertial scaling to the FSI between the compliant surface and air flows. Compliant surfaces are characterised by the stiffness and thickness, which are presumed to be of first-order influence on the FSI. A parameter sweep of these compliant surface properties was conducted by drag delta measurements and flow visualisation by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the M-Tunnel at the Low Speed Laboratory (LSL) Drag delta results confirm the possibility of turbulent viscous drag reduction by compliant surfaces, with a measured drag delta of -3.43 %. This result is further supported by the decrease in 1D turbulence intensity at the test plate's trailing edge from hot-wire measurements, and a smaller decay of the shape factor H from PIV. Quadrant analysis of the PIV data found evidence of a reduction in combined Q2 and Q4 events, further supporting the drag delta measured. Correlation between the compliant surface's viscoelastic properties and the drag delta found a negative correlation between the magnitude of complex shear modulus and a positive correlation between the loss tangent and drag reduction. The high loss tangent for the drag-reducing compliant surface and its subtle positive correlation with the drag reduction indicates that the viscoelasticity might have a greater influence on the FSI than expected.","Drag reduction; Turbulent boundary layer; Passive flow control; Compliant surface; Fluid-structure interaction; Quadrant analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

We were unable to explore the culture of Bali together as a design team because of which we had our own assumptions, perceptions of what the culture is or could be. And most importantly in the project we had reduced a whole culture to a set of constraints we needed to design for. This was deeply troubling. So in order to tackle this issue of culture clash and the need to be sensitive to other cultures, this project was born. The cultural element of Japan and their design philosophy were an inspiration. Their design philosophy and culture are weaved together to form one coherent Japanese Design Philosophy. To address the cultural dilemma for designers, it was decided to bring design philosophies into this project so that one could frame design philosophies based on the culture they design for. The target group for this project was the Master’s design students of TU Delft from the Industrial Design Engineering department. The research began with understanding of existing design philosophies such as Japanese Design Philosophies, Bauhaus and De-Stijl movements, Buen-Vivir centric design model. These formed the basis on how the design philosophies manifested and how it was culturally connected with their respective cultures. Interviewing two design studios viz. Butterflyworks, Netherlands and Whitenoise Design, India gave an opportunity to understand the workings, the tools they used for designing and gave an in-depth understanding of their design philosophy. These case studies provided a strong basic understanding of design philosophy and when should one consider a design philosophy a design philosophy. Keeping this in mind, the next step was to see how one can frame design philosophies depending on a certain context and culture. This was executed by having design students from TU Delft undergoing co-developing sessions using sensitising material and insights from Cultura tool. Students from the sessions developed the design philosophies which were rooted to the context and the culture. These sessions were analysed to extract the process of developing design philosophies along with the content that required to develop the design philosophies. These inputs were further translated to toolkit requirements and interventions. This way a toolkit could aid the designers in developing culture and context driven design philosophies. The ideation for the toolkit began with ‘The Card Set’ which was tested with designers. Though it had some flaws, the participants were able to successfully develop design philosophies. A new concept ‘The Board Set’ was born which was much more refined. In order to make the interactions much more fun and meaningful, a third concept ‘The Block Set’ was developed. This involved exploration cards, blocks, response sheets. The designers would undergo initial exploration of self, culture and later develop the design philosophy as a team. This was surveyed with designers, who mentioned that the toolkit definitely provides moments of reflection and brings teams and cultures together without compromising on either of them.","Design Philosophy; Reflection; Culture; Teamwork; Exploration; Sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Results suggest that, while near-field momentum-driven mixing remains unaltered following the introduction of the impinging shock wave, mid-to-far-field mixing mechanisms do change. An increase in the jet plume elevation was observed together with one in lateral expansion as a consequence of the introduction of a shock wave. Also, the formation of a strong shear layer downstream of the jet was observed, which acts as a source of vorticity to promote entrainment towards the jet mid-field.

One of the disruptive technologies that can be seen as an enabler for this change is the technology of a Digital Twin (DT). A DT is widely adopted in the field of engineering for predictive maintenance and testing of parameters of physical objectives such as engines to increase the effectiveness and optimize processes. A DT consists of three major factors: a physical object, its virtual representation and a continuous data stream between the two. In the healthcare sector this could mean to represent not an engine but a whole human with the potential goal for predicting a disease, taking necessary actions for prevention or identifying optimal treatments. This could shift the current underlying paradigm in medicine of curing a disease towards preventing a disease. The extent of representing a whole human body with this technology is still only a vision, but first steps towards this concept have been taken. This development may come with a lot of responsibility so that a user-centered perspective needs greater attention. This thesis aimed at unraveling users’ values for a meaningful DT as innovative technology. By using the concept of Responsible Research in Innovation (RRI), I addressed the importance of grasping, anticipating, and evaluating the potential impact of a DT on the individual interview partners. In a first step, I identified the field of diagnosis as a central research topic with high importance for the user. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with a focus on the context of diagnosis and followed a practice-based approach of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). This allowed me to explore underlying values from the past into the future of diagnosis with and without DTs. A six-step analysis approach proposed by IPA led to the discovery of values embedded in the (anticipated) experience of diagnosis of the interviewees. Finally, the findings led to the development of different forms or concepts a DT could take. These are meant to start a reflection. The findings showed that the meaningfulness of a DT may change significantly by age, life situation, preferences or also individual personality. In contrast to current company visions which visualize a DT as dashboard overview of the human, I assumed that this may lead to an objectification of the body and might rather support the development of an alienate feeling. Furthermore, it might be that the possibility of constant confrontation of one’s own objective status of the body might rather have negative effects on the individual. Additionally, time, place and frequency an individual interacts with a DT seemed to play an important role and should be reflected upon. In order to complement the development of a more user-centered and meaningful DT, I concluded this work with nine guidelines that can be a starting point for further reflection on responsible innovation of a DT. Taken together, I showed that meaningfulness of a DT is highly variable and would need a dynamic, personalized approach to create and implement a meaningful and responsible innovation for the user.","Digital Twin; Healthcare; Responsible Research and Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","Pride and Prejudice",""

To study the different paths that can be followed during the transition process, various tools and methods have been developed. A preliminary investigation of the response of a laminar flow to an internal or external disturbance can be performed by applying Linear Stability Theory principles. In the recent years, the Direct Numerical Simulations of flows offer a more insightful method to study the transition process, since the flow fields are numerically solved using high computational power. Previous research has primarily focused on the stability and transition of Ideal Gas flows, with little attention to the effects of a highly Non-Ideal behaviour. The present work aims to develop a DNS code that can be used to investigate the stability of compressible boundary layers in the vicinity of theWidom Line. For the initialization of a DNS, a two dimensional base flow profile is required. For the calculation of the base flow, a self-similar solution is obtained, using a MATLAB script that has been developed for the purpose of this study. The DNS code is developed in FORTRAN. An inviscid characteristic wave analysis is utilized for the implementation of the boundary conditions, along with numerical sponges to avoid reflections. To trigger the instabilities, periodic suction and blowing is incorporated. For the simulations of non-ideal fluids, a thermodynamic table interpolation tool is incorporated. For the validation of the results obtained by the DNS code, an in-house MATLAB script is used to for the calculation of the growth rate and fluctuation amplitude profiles using LST. Initially, the FORTRAN code is used on ideal-gas simulations, to investigate how different computational parameters will affect the flow field. The parameters are related to mesh resolution, boundary conditions and numerical sponges. To investigate the stability of non-ideal fluids, cases of different free-stream temperatures and Eckert numbers are simulated. The free-stream temperature is altered to control the non-ideal gas effects, whereas the Eckert number is used to control the compressibility effects. In general, the flow is stabilized as non-ideal gas and compressibility effects become more prominent. However, a second unstable mode is observed in the case where the temperature profile crosses the pseudo-critical point. This second mode has a higher growth rate of instabilities, compared to the first mode. All the results are validated using the LST predicted profiles.","DNS; Direct; Numerical; Simulations; fluid; mechanics; compressible; flow; carbon; dioxide; supercritical; ideal; gas; stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A combination vehicle system consists of a lead vehicle that powers the motion, and one or more trailers that are towed by the lead vehicle. Any such vehicle system is unstable due to the presence of a coupling joint that disconnects the driver from the trailer. The risk of an accident is increased since many trailer parameters are variable and change with operating conditions. In light combination vehicles where the towing vehicle is a passenger car or SUV, the situation is more serious because the driver is necessarily not skilled enough to perceive the effects of steering and braking actions on the response of the trailer. A method to stabilise the car-trailer system by controlling the actuators of only the towing car is presented. Although similar attempts have been made in the past, they have been limited by their scope of applicability. The main component of the sway stabilization system is the Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that is robust and has a good transient performance. This controller is combined with a weighted least squares control allocation method to control the rear-wheel steering and the brakes of the towing car. The control allocation method provides flexibility and redundancy to the system. Based on simulations over different test cases, it is seen that the car-trailer system can be stabilised significantly, resulting in an improvement in the lateral handling characteristics, and reducing the chances of an accident occurring due to driver error. The thesis concludes by highlighting the advantages of the design and proposing recommendations for further improvement.","Trailer; articulated vehicle; Sway Stabilization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

It negatively affects humans and wildlife through animal death, groundwater pollution and incorporation of micro plastics in our digestive system. There are many initiatives focusing on reducing the negative effects of plastic pollution, but the amount of plastic consumed and the subsequent pollution is still increasing every year. Additionally, in the current COVID-19 pandemic the dependency on single-use plastics has increased exponentially. That is why it is important to keep improving recycling infrastructure, especially in low and middle-income countries. Their plastic waste management is often informal, and tools are insufficient for the correct management of plastic waste, resulting in plastic pollution.The research conducted in this thesis showed that especially t he sorting stage of the plastic recycling process is very time consuming and labor-intensive. This discovery led to the central research question: which resources can be developed to accelerate the process of plastic sorting for informal recyclers? Discrete near-infrared spectroscopy makes it possible to identify over 75% of all plastic used in everyday life. Therefore, it became my mission to make this technology accessible to recyclers in low and middle-income countries. By applying principles of context variation, local manufacturing and open development in the design process, tools that accelerate the sorting of plastic waste were created. This brings Plastic Identification Anywhere another step closer, with the end goal of fighting plastic pollution, together, today. The project described in this paper resulted in a complete ecosystem of open-source resources (figure 1) that can be used to implement near-infrared spectroscopy in any plastic waste management setting, especially in low and middle-income countries. This ecosystem consists of: -A breakout board that combines all components to emit and sense infrared light on a small printed circuit board with standard communication protocols. -A handheld scanner that integrates the breakout board into real-world applications. It enables local machine-learning processing of the sample, all in a compact form factor. -A kit that delivers all the components for the breakout board in a small package with clear instructions on how to assemble a breakout board, making board building more accessible. -A website that informs (and inspires) all potential users about the Plastic Scanner, connecting those who want a Plastic Scanner to those who can build a Plastic Scanner. -Documentation that is published online in its entirety, to enable cooperative working and transparency. This also makes it possible to modify a Plastic Scanner to personal preference. -Software that communicates with the hardware and implements machine learning for optimal and quick prediction of plastic types.","Plastic recycling; infrared spectroscopy; open source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In order to achieve this we need to look for new approaches in the design of FWMAVs at the component and at the system level. This research explores a new approach for the flapping wing design. Inspired by insects, the corrugation pattern on the wing can be optimized in order to achieve the required passive pitching behaviour of the wing. Optimized corrugated wings has the potential to achieve a higher strength to weight ratio than available flapping wing designs, while at the same time exhibiting the required passive pitching behaviour. Moreover, the manufacturing process of the wing is more reproducible compared to conventional wing manufacturing methods. This is important because at such a small scale, a minor deviation in the wing features can drastically affect the wing properties, which has implications on performance and control. In this study shell shape optimization method was utilized to obtain passively pitching wing designs. The obtained wing designs performance is then evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, through a time dependant study of the flapping motion of the wing. Finally, a wing prototype is manufactured and the results are experimentally validated.","FWMAV; Optimization; Shell Structures; Bio-inspired design; Insect flight; Shape Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Benthem, Roel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The demand for air travel is increasing as more people gain access to commercial aviation. As the current generation of aircraft makes use of fossil fuel combustion, this growth results in an increase in the global emissions. This is at odds with the worldwide efforts of reducing the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, advanced propulsion systems must be developed to limit the emissions caused by the commercial aerospace industry. Using hydrogen fuel cells for propulsion is a promising technology to potentially get the sector to zero emissions. It is of interest to explore the capabilities and feasibility of aircraft with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain. To determine the feasibility for a wide range of aircraft, a general design methodology is required.Current research efforts focus on component level performance, however system level design research, while present, didn't introduce a general methodology. The most pressing challenge was found to be related to the system level design of a CS-23 category hydrogen fuel cell aircraft. The CS-23 category aircraft class has been identified as the most suitable focus for research efforts, due to the lower technical and certification requirements placed on the components to reach a feasible design. A general methodology for the design of CS-23 category aircraft was therefore found to be a useful contribution to the state of the art. This additionally provides a deeper understanding into the most important parameters of the power and propulsion systems design.In this report, a general methodology for the conceptual design of hydrogen fuel cell powered CS-23 category aircraft is presented. The methodology makes use of a modified class 1 weight estimation for initial sizing according to customer requirements and component technology levels. The generated aircraft is refined using further aerodynamic analysis, which results in a feasible aircraft concept, as well as component level specifications for important aircraft components.The methodology is implemented in a software tool, HAPPIE (Hydrogen Aircraft Power \&amp; Propulsion Initial Estimator), which allows for rapid sizing of different hydrogen fuel cell concepts. This makes the methodology accessible, and additionally provides feedback on the effects of individual design choices and technology levels on system level performance. SUAVE is used to perform the refined aerodynamic analysis.The methodology is validated using existing conventionally powered aircraft, by comparing the sizing results from the methodology with publicly available data. The methodology's ability to analyse conventional as well as hydrogen fuel cell powertrains, furthermore allows for performance comparison between current and future technologies.The results of the sizing methodology demonstrate the viability of hydrogen fuel cell aircraft in the CS-23 category. A conceptual design is generated, which serves as a baseline for the sensitivity analyses. It is found that hydrogen fuel cell aircraft are generally heavier than conventional aircraft, using current technology levels. Liquid hydrogen is identified as the best hydrogen storage method. Compressed hydrogen storage is also possible, however this results in a heavier aircraft with limited range. The current methodology does not predict thermal behaviour to have a significant effect on the mass of the aircraft. A component sensitivity analysis determined that the fuel cell efficiency, fuel cell specific power and hydrogen storage efficiency are the most important parameters.The ideal cruising altitude for fuel cell aircraft is at an intermediate altitude, due to the fact that the fuel cell powertrain performance decreases at increasing altitude, which balances with the lower drag in lower density air.The research demonstrates that hydrogen powered CS-23 aircraft are viable for current technology levels, and are a suitable way in reducing carbon emissions in this category.","Hydrogen; Fuel Cell; Sustainable Aviation; CS-23; Aircraft Performance; Aircraft Design; Aircraft Conceptual Design; Aircraft sizing; Design methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Two main conclusions were drawn from the results. The first is that the introduction of AVs would lead to a lesser heterogeneity of speed between vehicles, this would in turn result in fewer casualties. The second conclusion is a conclusion drawn based on the emergent behavior of the model, the introduction of AVs would lead to less headway for AVs.

(TU Delft Civil Engineering and Geosciences)","Coenders-Gerrits, Miriam (mentor); ten Veldhuis, Marie-claire (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The assessment of potential evaporation or reference combined evaporation and transpiration is among the most important components for many hydro-climatic applications such as irrigation design and management, water balance assessment studies, and assessment of aridity classification indices. Aridity classification indices such as UNEP, Thornthwaite and others are usually employed at large scale applications and require respective estimations of potential or reference combined evaporation and transpiration. The major problem in such applications is not only the limited availability of stations per se but also the limitation of many stations to provide data for a complete set of parameters (i.e., precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, humidity). A complete set of climate parameters is prerequisite for accurate estimations of potential or reference combined evaporation and transpiration using the most advanced methods, which are expressions of energy balance (e.g., ASCE-standardized method, successor method of Penman-Monteith FAO-56). Unfortunately, large scale applications of aridity indices suffer from this limitation and the common solution is to use temperature-based formulas. The most popular and historical temperature-based formula is the one of Thornthwaite, which was developed to support the respective aridity classification index. The popularity of this formula is based on the minimum requirement of mean monthly temperature and latitude at the location of interest. Considering the above, this study aims to develop a global database of local correction factors for the original Thornthwaite formula that will better support all hydro-climatic applications but mostly to support large scale applications of aridity indices, which are highly prone to data limitations. The hypothesis that is tested in this work is that a local correction factor that integrates the local mean effect of wind speed, humidity and solar radiation can improve the performance of the original Thornthwaite formula and to convert it at the same time to a formula of reference combined evaporation and transpiration for short reference crop. The global database of local correction factors was developed using gridded climate data of the period 1950-2000 at 30 arc-sec resolution (~1 km at the equator) from freely available climate geodatabases. The correction factors were produced as partial weighted averages of monthly ratios between the benchmark ASCE-standardized method for short reference crop versus the original formula of Thornthwaite by giving more weight to the warmer months and by excluding colder months of Epr&lt;45 mm month-1 where monthly ratios are highly unstable with unrealistic values. The validation of the correction factors was made using raw data from 525 stations of Europe, California-USA and Australia that cover periods mostly after 2000 and up to 2020. The validation procedure showed significant improvement in the estimations of reference combined evaporation and transpiration using the corrected Thornthwaite formula that led to a 19.4% reduction of RMSE for monthly and a 55% reduction of RMSE for annual estimations compared to the original formula. The variation of the correction factor was also investigated in different major Köppen climate classes and it was found that tends to increase in drier and warmer territories. The five major Köppen groups were ordered as follows B &gt; C &gt; A &gt; D &gt; E considering the magnitude of the correction factors values. The corrected and original Thornthwaite formulas were also evaluated by their use in UNEP and Thornthwaite aridity indices using as a benchmark the respective indices estimated by the ASCE-standardized method. The analysis was made using the validation data of the stations and the results showed that the corrected Thornthwaite formula increased by 18.3% the accuracy of detecting identical aridity classes with ASCE-standardized method for the case of UNEP classification, and by 10.4% for the case of Thornthwaite classification in comparison to the original formula. The performance of the corrected formula was extremely improved especially in the case of non-humid classes of both aridity indices. The overall results showed that the correction factors produced in this study can improve the performance of the original Thornthwaite formula providing better estimations of the aridity classification indices.","Reference Evaporation; Climate analysis; Thornthwaite","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

In order to minimize the production time and expenses, the design and fabrication of these guides could be implemented into the hospital’s workflow using an in-house available 3D printer. Compared to the current gold standard for the production of patient-specific surgical guides, a different printing technique and 3D print material will be used. Therefore, it should be determined whether these are suitable for the production of the guides. Moreover, the 3D printed models must be compatible with the in-house sterilization method in order to ensure quality and reliability. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of the in-house available sterilization method on the mechanical, dimensional, and sterility properties of a novel biocompatible 3D printing material. Methods and results BioMed Clear resin specimens were tested according to the ISO standards for mechanical testing of plastics. Overall, steam sterilization changed the mechanical properties of the material, making it stronger and stiffer but more brittle, as compared to unsterilized specimens. The dimensional tests indicated that sterilization resulted in a dimensional change, up to 0.12 mm, which mostly occurred in the small crevices of the model. The deviations of the dimensions of the resulting 3D printed model compared to the digital 3D model were roughly less than 0.3 mm, which is comparable to the accuracy of the gold standard material, polyamide 12. Sterility tests showed that sterilization of the 3D printed models is indeed mandatory for the guides to be used intraoperatively. Also, the Central Sterile Services Department of the hospital is able to deliver sterile medical devices that can be stored for a minimum of four weeks at the sterile storage room. Conclusion With the feasibility confirmed for the hospital to be able to design and produce patient-specific surgical guides in-house, it is necessary to stress that the hospital must meet the Medical Device Regulations by complying with an appropriate quality management system, documenting the manufacturing process, evaluating the performance, and reviewing the experiences from clinical use.","3D Printing; patient-specific; surgical guide; Sterilization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

GPUs and FPGAs are generally better suited for such tasks. To assist FPGAs in their functions, some boards are equipped with one or more high bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks, with a bandwidth of 230 GB/s each. This thesis presents a hardware design for the Alveo U280 FPGA board with HBM. Each HBM stack provides multiple interfaces to the full range of memory within HBM. Utilizing these multiple interfaces, a hardware decompressor for the Snappy compression algorithm is placed in parallel to achieve a higher end-to-end throughput. Additionally a design is created to perform benchmarks on HBM where varying sizes of data are transported between HBM and logic within the FPGA. The hardware decompressor and component that interfaces to memory within HBM were found to be incompatible and required additional logic to become able to transport data between them. To ease the parallelization of the decompressor a custom Snappy framing format is implemented. Using this format a softcore processor on the FPGA is able to buffer the locations of compressed data within HBM and divide these over available decompressors. The design is successfully synthesized into a kernel that can be loaded by the FPGA. From the moment compressed data is sitting in HBM until it is decompressed, a single decompressor reaches a maximum end-to-end throughput of 4.0 GB/s. When eight or more decompressors are activated, they reach a throughput between 20.0 to 26.2 GB/s. The hardware decompressor designs uses less than 10% of the resources of the U280 with little power usage. Compared to a software implementation, using multithreading, the hardware solution is 1.5-2.5x faster on a set of files that is used for benchmarks on decompression speed with varying compression ratios.","FPGA; parallel; decompression; snappy; HBM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The multiple leveled square function as a social place where people meet and are invited to explore the daylight perforated underground world. The recognizable entrances adding to the human scale and add to the local and regional character. As well as the pillars influence the local climate, by giving shelter for the rain and heat, function as a sounding board translating the weather to the underground area. The flexibility of the transport hub is key for future developments, as the underground is already quite full, there is still some room to extend the entrance or bike facility or add an extra metro line possibly. Interweaving, perforating and breaking the underground open, increase the accessibility and mobility of the secondary node Beurs and the inner-city itself.","Stations; Rotterdam; Mobility hub","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","",""

The European Union has set high targets for zero-emission bus sales. Many European local governments and public-transit operators are looking to replace their GHG-emitting diesel/gas bus fleets with clean alternatives. One such alternative is In Motion Charging (IMC) technology for trolleybuses. With this technology trolleybuses are able to charge an on-board traction battery whilst in motion and connected to the overhead wires. This makes it possible for these buses to extend their range outside the trolleygrid infrastructure. These IMC buses can replace diesel/gas buses. IMC is of particular interest for municipalities that currently have a functioning trolleybus fleet and infrastructure. Existing infrastructures are however not built with the increased power demand of IMC buses in mind. A good understanding of the power demand of IMC buses and the limits of a trolleygrid is necessary before implementing IMC buses. The explanatory research that is presented in this report aims to give insight in the design factors that influence the feasibility of adding in-motion charging buses to an existing trolleybus network. It does so by first explaining the difference in energy consumption between IMC buses and regular trolleybuses through simulations. Next, by performing a case study on the Arnhem trolleygrid the effect of IMC buses on the trolleygrid is discovered. The results of the energy consumption comparison indicate that there is promising potential for IMC implementation. It shows that there is a large margin in which IMC buses can make more efficient use of their regenerative energy compared to their regular trolleybus counterparts. It also shows that there are large degrees of freedom in IMC bus implementation leaving room for errors. The Arnhem case study uncovers where exactly these errors lie by looking at potential power demand, minimum voltage and maximum current limit breaches on the network. As long as these breaches can be mitigated through smart charging strategies there is a lot of promise for IMC bus implementation on existing trolleygrid infrastructures.","IMC; Trolleybus; Electric mobility; In Motion Charging; Dynamic charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-19","","","","","",""

The complexity of a railway along with the large area it extends makes manual monitoring difficult and time-consuming. The increasing availability of 3D acquisition technologies has made point clouds a widely used 3D data form. Thus, identifying the key components of a railway and its environment using 3D point cloud data can be the first step for automating this procedure. The past years, machine learning has become the most popular subfield of artificial intelligence used for various different applications, with its subfield of deep learning evolving dramatically. Although deep learning has been vastly researched on 2D data, applying deep learning on 3D point clouds can be challenging due to the irregularity, unstructuredness and unorderedness of such data. To overcome those challenges, recent approaches use projection or voxelization, while the latest methods focus on working directly on raw point cloud data.<br/><br/>In the present research, 2 machine learning methods are implemented to classify 3D point cloud data of railway environments into 7 categories of rails, sleepers, track bed, masts, overhead wires, trees and other. To this end, the ensemble method of Random Forest, and the deep learning method of DGCNN (Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network) are implemented. While Random Forest is a simple and handy ensemble algorithm used for a wide range of applications, DGCNN is a deep learning method based on PointNet, the pioneer method on raw point clouds, and graph CNNs. The methods are validated under 3 case studies, produced by structure from motion photogrammetry, airborne laser scanning and terrestrial laser scanning, and locating in 2 different areas within the Netherlands. For each method, 2 scenarios are developed for classifying colored and uncolored point clouds, respectively. Finally, the 2 methods are combined for the first scenario, as a first attempt to further improve the final results. <br/> <br/>The obtained results show that, in this work, DGCNN performs better than Random Forest, and both methods approximate state-of-the-art performance. The contribution of colors is important to improve both the overall accuracy of the models, as well as the classification results of the individual classes. More specifically, Random Forest scenario 1, Random Forest scenario 2, DGCNN scenario 1, DGCNN scenario 2, and the combination of Random Forest and DGCNN scenario 1 result in an overall accuracy of 88.65%, 83.39%, 89.19%, 88.20% and 90.57%, respectively. The corresponding per class F1-scores for all methods and scenarios range between 43% and 94%. Both methods meet difficulties in generalizing on data from different sensor systems and different areas with very different point density and missing data. Nonetheless, the individual methods are already very promising, while they are able to achieve the required accuracy of more than 90% when combined.","Classification; 3D point cloud; Machine learning; Deep learning; Random Forest; DGCNN; Railway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-25","","","","","",""

In conventional solar cells, glass is used to protect the panels from external damage. However due to its heavy weight and rigidity, glass is not an option for thin-film flexible solar cells. HyET Solar, a company based in the Netherlands that produces flexible thin-film solar cells uses a transparent foil produced using a roll-to-roll process to encapsulate and protect their solar panels. In order to reduce the amount of materials used and cut the costs, a thinner foil is being developed. Producing the thinner foil in a roll-to-roll process causes different defects in the foil, among which half sinusoidal waves forming mostly in the bottom side of the foil, these waves are called wrinkles. The process of manufacturing the top encapsulant layer involves changing temperatures and mechanical stresses applied on the foil. Therefore, two models were developed to understand the effect of three process parameters (web force, web speed and temperatures of each production zone) on wrinkle formation. First, a thermal model of the process using ANSYS program was developed to understand the temperature profile of the produced foil along the process. Then, a mechanical model that uses the output of the thermal model and the applied mechanical forces to study the effect of the investigated production parameters on wrinkle formation was worked out. The results show that operating at higher temperatures and reducing the thickness of the foil are directly responsible for decreasing the threshold of the critical stress that causes wrinkle formation and thus reducing the range and the magnitude of the force to 1.4 N is needed to perform the process without forming wrinkles in the foil. Varying web speed between 0.3 m/min and 3m/min is found to have a minor effect when varied under high temperatures. Finally, decreasing the temperature of the first and second zones by 10 °C is found to extend the range of the web force that can be applied. Performing the process under lower temperatures or reducing the mechanical forces that act on the foil will reduce wrinkle formation in the developed foil; web speed should not be considered in mitigating wrinkle formation.","Flexible solar cells; Top encapsulant; Wrinkling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To stay competitive in this new era, launch vehicle companies must develop new technologies to reduce launch costs while serving the growing demand for space accessibility. A possible solution is to use additive manufacturing in combination with topology optimization to relieve manufacturing and assembly burdens in addition to reducing launch mass. Topology optimization is a mathematical method that optimizes the distribution of material in a design domain for a given combination of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the objective of maximizing mechanical performance. Now an increasingly popular design tool in the aerospace and automotive industries, topology optimization is used to redesign structures to reduce mass while increasing stiffness. To effectively apply this design tool to launcher structures, the optimization process must take into account multiple load cases to represent the large number of load cases such structures are subjected to, throughout the various flight phases. In this thesis, a design methodology was established for topology optimization of launcher structures under multiple load cases by redesigning a launcher structure produced by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. The thesis used two analytical models; a simple cantilever beam model to set baseline expectations of design methodologies which were then verified on the launcher structure demonstrator model. To achieve the objective, a suitable multiple load case objective function was identified for the design problem at hand by testing different objective functions on both analytical models. In the process, efficient ways to accommodate the large number of load cases in the objective were also studied through which promising methods to reduce the number of load cases were identified. The final optimized design was compared to the original launcher structure which showed that the optimized design exhibited organic design features, higher stiffness with the same mass. This thesis provided insight into multiple load case topology optimization which is expected to accelerate its adoption in the launch vehicle industry and pave a new path for more efficient space travel.","Topology Optimization; Multiple Load Case; Multi-Objective Optimization; Launch Vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-24","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It is a small general cargo vessel of 2999 GrT (Gross Tonnage) called the Future Trader. The ship design is finished and the ship will be equipped with a modular power plant and fuel storage on the aft of the ship. In total four different power plants will be compared. The first is the base line system, this consists of a single internal combustion engine fuelled by Marine Diesel Oil (MDO). The three other systems will be modular systems. They all use the concept of distributed generation. There is looked into a system with three internal combustion engines fuelled by MDO. Besides this there are two fuel cell systems. Each consists of two separated fuel cells and one uses hydrogen and the second ammonia as fuel. For those systems mathematical models are created to compare three modular power plants to each other and to a base line. With those models the effects on the Future Trader's range, fuel costs (operational capabilities) and emissions are researched. A modular power plant is installed on the aft of the ship, constructed of four power packs each in a Twenty foot Equivalent Unit (TEU). The four systems will be simulated on four voyages and the results will be normalised with respect to the first setup. It can be concluded that a modular system with the concept of Distributed Generation (DG) will reduce the ships overall performance in comparison to the single engine diesel electric system (base line). When reviewing the fuel cell systems with respect to the base line system it is found that the ammonia fuel cell system has zero emissions and it still offers a sufficient range. The increases in fuel costs are lower than that of the hydrogen fuel cell system. Hydrogen will also reduce harmful emissions to zero but the reduction in range is more severe. The increase in fuel costs is also significantly higher than for the base line. Overall ammonia seems the most promising of the non hydrocarbon fuels. The DG system is also useful as long as emission regulations remain unchanged. The MDO DG system can be loaded for large distance voyages and hydrogen can be loaded for short voyages if desired.","Ships operation capabilities; Power plant systems; Distributed generation; Mathematical modelling; Modular shipping; Alternative fuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

These effects of climate change influence salt intrusion, particularly by affecting the freshwater supply. In The Gambia also a planned hydropower dam and possibly future irrigation development will affect the freshwater supply. The combined effects of climate change, the hydropower dam and irrigation development on salt intrusion are unknown. A river south of The Gambia, the Casamance, turned strongly hypersaline during the Sahelian droughts, which strongly affected the rivers discharge in the early 80s. The freshwater supply in the Casamance after these droughts was insufficient to flush away the salt and the estuary never restored. This led to the decay of the entire ecosystem that existed in and around the Casamance. The Gambia river is of major importance to the country, the agricultural sector relies on the freshwater it supplies for growing crops, the fishing industry relies on sufficient numbers of fish to catch and the forestry industry makes use of the mangroves growing around the river. All these industries combined account for ±75% of the working force in The Gambia. If the Gambia estuary turns strongly hypersaline such as the Casamance, this would have disastrous results. This thesis aims to clarify the effect that climate change, the hydropower dam and irrigation development have on salt intrusion in the Gambia river. A 1D model, SALNST, is used to model salt concentrations over the river length up to the year 2100. The effects of climate change, the hydropower dam and irrigation development are represented by four model parameters: climate projections, sea level rise, dam operations and irrigation development. Multiple parameter values, ranging from mild to strong conditions or impact are implemented, creating a set of 27 scenarios. These scenarios treat the parameters independently to distinguish the individual parameters effect on salt intrusion. It can be concluded that The Gambia is prone to climate change when considering salt intrusion. Due to the importance of the river, monitoring sea level rise and the development of climate change will be essential for planning and taking counter measures. Understanding the effects that climate change can have regarding salt intrusion can also be used in negotiations to reserve some freedom in the hydropower dam operations. In addition, solutions that limit the increase in evaporative surface for strong sea level rise (e.g., dikes along a part of the Gambia river) prevent extreme salt intrusion lengths and hyper salinity. The hydropower dam causes a reduced range of salt intrusion lengths, this creates easier to predict salt concentrations which is beneficial for aquaculture. Furthermore, the reduced maximum salt intrusion is also beneficial for agriculture that makes use of irrigation.","Salt Intrusion; climate change; 1D Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","","13.4457859,-15.3061209"

This work offers a multinode multi-GPU solution that offers excellent<br/>scalability performance due to how the simulator is constructed, with the use of OpenMPI and CUDA. The simulator is configured with JSON configuration files, containing the neural descriptions and simulatorspecific settings. Consequently, enabling a userfriendly environment, for the neuroscientists, without the need of recompiling or understanding the source code. The gap junction calculations are identified as the critical function bottlenecking performance of the simulator. Therefore, an algorithm tailored to utilize GPU performance is implemented to decrease wallclock time for these specific calculations. For internode<br/>communication, OpenMPI can be configured in two ways. Eiter share all possible compartments potentials with every node in the network or only share the compartments potentials to nodes that need them. These methods rely internally on MPI Allgather and Alltoallv respectively. When available, GPUDirect, NVlink, and RDMA are supported. The implementation hides communication overhead, when possible, by concurrently executable compute kernels. A neuron model from the Inferior Olivary Nucleus is selected for benchmarking. Reported results go up to 32 Nodes with a total of 64 GPU cards. The design shows linear weak and strong scaling within the experimental setups for intranode and internode scalability. With this simulator, networks over 10 million cells become available to model on largescale GPU clusters, setting a new standard for eHH simulations. Comparisons against related work on CPU and FPGAs have been conducted, a 100x speedup is achieved versus a single cpu threaded solution. Furthermore, a 2x speedup is achieved over an FPGA solution (flexHH) and 10 fold over a multithreaded CPU (GenEHH, with 128 threads) solution, both reported speedups are for a fully connected network with 7000 IO cells.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Additionally, high-dimensional offline model identification with current approaches can take several hours for a few dimensions and this means model iterating and hyper-parameter tuning is often not feasible. Current approaches to smooth high-dimensional functional approximation are not scalable, require global communication between iteration steps, and are ill-conditioned in higher dimensions. This research develops the Distributed Asynchronous B-spline (DAB) algorithm that is more robust to ill-conditioning, due to low data coverage, by using first-order methods with acceleration and weighted constraint application. This algorithm is also suitable for continuous state-spaces. Smooth aerodynamic models can be determined in exactly n·r iterations, where r is the number of continuity equations in a single dimension and n is the number of dimensions.

Their abnormal gait pattern is characterized by increased ankle dorsiflexion, excessive knee flexion during stance and reduced ankle push-off power which leads to decreased walking speed and increased energy cost of gait. To improve walking ability, dorsal leaf spring (DLS) ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are often worn that provide stiffness around the ankle joint which is its most important characteristic. Selecting optimal AFO stiffness is important because it can substantially reduce the net metabolic cost of gait, while improper AFO stiffness can lead to discomfort, fatigue and overall reduced activity. Experimental data shows that the effect of AFOs is dependent on the individual characteristics of the patients, such as level of muscle weakness, spasticity and body mass. Despite the importance of AFO stiffness, empirically determining the stiffness of the applied AFO remains time-consuming and ad hoc. This master thesis aims to uncover the mechanism relating AFO stiffness to the metabolic cost of transport (CoT) as observed in experimental trends from individuals with calf muscle weakness. We used predictive forward musculoskeletal simulations to reproduce the experimental trends and analyzed our simulations to explain the relationship between AFO stiffness and metabolic CoT. The predicted optimal AFO stiffness was within 1 Nm/deg of the patient's experimentally measured one. From the experimentally observed effects, all kinematic and kinetic trends were predicted within 0.5-2.5 SD from the mean of the experimental slopes of all patients' results. Moreover, the differences between the slopes of the simulation results were mostly lower compared to the modelled patient's individual experimental slopes than compared to the experimental slope of the group average results. We identified a reduction in the vasti muscle metabolic cost due to larger external knee extension moments with increasing AFO stiffness as the main mechanism resulting in the net metabolic CoT trend. Limitations on translating our findings to patient behavior include: modelled calf muscle strength, where the model may be significantly stronger or weaker than the patient, and the relative importance of metabolic cost minimization to other goals during walking, such as minimizing the loading rate at heel strike.","Ankle Foot Orthosis; calf muscle weakness; forward simulation; SCONE; OpenSim; metabolic energy cost of transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of this inherent spatial variability, a slope can actually fail along any potential slip surface. A single value of Factor of safety cannot account for this variation dominated the slope stability problem. Probabilistic analysis considering the spatial variability is a reasonable method to quantify the risk of the slope stability problem. Thus, in order to better simulate this variation, the theory of random field has been widely used in the slope stability problem. However, statistical outcomes derived from the probabilistic analysis will be influenced by how the random fields are generated and how the random field values are assigned to each potential slip surface. In order to investigate the extent of this influence, this study proposed a new probabilistic slope stability analysis method and compared it with the other two methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In this report, three different probabilistic slope stability analysis methods are presented. These methods combined the traditional limit equilibrium method of slices with random fields, which can account for the inherent spatial variability of soil properties. An exponential decaying function is used to describe the correlation structure of this spatial variation. This correlation structure is further expressed by the form of covariance matrix. Since the covariance matrix is a symmetric positive definite matrix, Cholesky decomposition is used to decompose it into the product of two triangular matrices. Because the triangular matrix is more computationally efficient, the two-dimensional random field is generated by multiplying a normal random number vector with the lower triangular matrix derived from Cholesky decomposition.","Slope Stability; Probabilistic analysis; Limit equilibrium method; Random fields; Monte Carlo simulation; Cholesky decomposition; Spatial variability; System probability of failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Minimum camera requirements were set up which required the camera to: be inexpensive (i.e. ≤ €1000,-), be mobile, be open-source (for Linux), have a minimum frames-per-second of 5, have a resolution of at least 160x160 pixels with a field of view (FOV) of 27°, sensitivity of &lt; 0.1°C, and safe to the patient. Such a camera was found in the FLIR One Pro. For this thesis a different FLIR camera was used due to lack of budget, namely the FLIR A305sc, which was already available at the TU Delft. The A305sc is not open-source, which required a work-around. The Aravis Open Source Project allowed for communication with the camera. Internal camera parameters had to be determined to calculate temperature based on analogue-to-digital values. ExifTool was used on a file stored by the camera to extract these parameters. This calculated temperature was compared to the temperature as determined by FLIR’s software and led to a difference in the range of 1·106°C. An open-source application was written that can connect with this IRT camera that has a GenICam interface using Aravis. Additionally, this application implemented the temperature calculation based on the internal camera parameters. The hood of the incubator is opaque to infrared, which required the design of a measurement setup to circumvent this. Three different setups were discussed, with the final choice falling on placing the camera in front of an opened incubator porthole on a tripod, and sealing this porthole with high or low density ethyl polyethylene (HDPE/LDPE). Regular H/LDPE used for construction site was found to have a attenuated transmissivity as found in literature. To quantify the interaction between IRT and a neonatal incubator, the IRT measurements were to be compared against the current golden standard sensor, namely thermistors. These sensor values were to be read out from the incubator as this would also be used in the final product. Code was written which allows for automatic detection between the GE GiraffeTM Omnibed and the Dräger Caleo® incubator, automatic connecting, and manipulation of all sensors values to a standard string which allows for easy uploading to the InfluxDB database on the server. To be allowed to perform measurements on human subjects, approval had to be acquired by the human research ethics committee (HREC) of the TU Delft and the respective hospital. A “non-wet medisch wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen” (nWMO) request was submitted and approved, which resulted in 25 recorded sick and healthy neonates in incubators divided over two hospitals (the JKZ in The Hague, and the RDGG in Delft), with over 25 hours of recording material. Simultaneously, measurements were performed on an empty incubator to gain an understanding in the behaviour of an incubator when actors from outside interacted with the internal environment. Measurements that were performed included determining the reflected apparent temperature (RAT) for every possible opened porthole and for both incubator types. The RAT for the Caleo was found to be higher for every measurement for the GE. The accuracy of the IRT and hospital skin temperature sensors was compared against a calibrated Pt-100 sensor, which show that the Pt-100 sensor measures an equal value as the hospital skin temperature sensor, whereas The IRT camera measured .6°C higher. The effect of changing the distance on IRT values was measured, which shows that for a distance of 0.2m to 1.2m the accuracy of the IRT camera is within the specified accuracy. Finally, the effect of opening additional portholes on IRT was measured, the effect of the airboost setting on IRT, and the measurement of opening additional portholes was repeated with a different IRT camera. Overall the IRT camera measures a higher temperature than the hospital skin temperature sensors, but follows the skin temperature sensors’ pattern.    ","infrared; thermography; neonate; infant; premature; incubator; camera","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Pigs are devices that are transported from time to time through a pipeline, mainly to either clean the pipeline or to inspect the integrity of the pipeline wall. Conventional models for the friction between the pig and the pipe wall, as used in the oil and gas industry, are often criticized for their inaccuracies. To obtain a more accurate model, this thesis investigates the detailed physics behind the frictional forces. The effect of the sliding conditions on the wall-normal force and on the friction force was investigated by conducting 1D lubricated sliding experiments for a rubber lip moving along a metal surface and by performing model simulations, including a parameter sensitivity study. The experiments were conducted for dry water, dodecane and castor oil under varying sliding velocities and loads. The loads were measured with a dual axis transducer and the lubrication film was observed during the experiments with a microscope set-up. The experimental results consist of friction forces for various configurations, which show that the frictional behaviour depends strongly on the lubrication regime in which the rubber lip is operating. The friction coefficients for the boundary lubrication regime and the mixed lubrication regime were measured and compared with results from the model. Among the tested fluids, castor oil showed a non-proportional decrease in friction force when the sliding velocity was increased. This decrease in friction force was interpreted as a transition from the boundary lubrication regime to the mixed lubrication regime. The other tested fluids remained in the boundary lubrication regime in the experimental runs. A validation study was performed by fitting the friction model to the experimental results. Only the dry friction coefficients are in good agreement with the model. Both the water and dodecane experiments show a slight increase for the friction coefficient with increasing lubrication factor and are in mediocre agreement with the friction model. The castor oil experiments are in the mixed lubrication regime of the Stribeck curve and are in reasonable agreement with the model. The results can be linked to the oil and gas industry as pigs can operate in different regimes of the Stribeck curve. Stalled pigs can be the result of transitions from the mixed lubrication regime to the boundary lubrication regime. This can happen when a pig is momentarily slowed down in the pipeline. Recommendations for future experimental work are: performing experiments at higher sliding velocities, using an emulsion as lubricant and finding suitable methods to calibrate models that have a range of input parameters. This work was carried out by the author at the Shell Technology Centre in Amsterdam. The supervision by the Shell staff and the support obtained in carrying out the experiments in the Shell lab are greatly acknowledged.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a machine learning method based on artificial neural networks, has recently become a popular choice for modelling the lane change decision-making process, outperforming various traditional rule-based models. So far, performance has often been expressed in terms of achieved average speed, absence of collisions or merging success rate. However, no studies have investigated how humans will react to the resulting behavior as potential occupants. This study addresses this research gap by validating a self-developed DRL-based lane changing model (trained using proximal policy optimization) from a technology acceptance perspective through an online crowdsourcing experiment. Participants (N=1085) viewed a random subset of 32 out of 120 videos of an automated vehicle driving on a three-lane highway with varying traffic densities featuring our proposed model or a baseline policy (i.e. a state-of-the-art rule-based model, MOBIL). They were tasked to press a response key if the decision-making was deemed undesirable and subsequently rated the vehicle's behavior along four acceptance constructs (performance expectancy, safety, human-likeness and reliability) on a scale of 1 to 5. Results showed that the proposed model caused a significantly lower amount of disagreements and was rated significantly higher on all four acceptance constructs compared to the baseline policy. Moreover, considerable differences between individual disagreement rates were observed for both models. Our findings offer prospects for the practical application of DRL-based lane change models in a use-case scenario, depending on the user. Further research is necessary to examine whether these observations hold in other (more complex) traffic situations. Additionally, we recommend combining DRL with other modelling techniques that allow for personalization of behavioral parameters, such as imitation learning.","automated lane changing; automated vehicles; deep reinforcement learning; artificial neural networks; proximal policy optimization; technology acceptance; crowdsourcing; MOBIL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To optimize such schedules for these events, flight delay predictions are necessary. Till now, flight delay has been studied mainly from a binary and regression standpoint. These type of predictions lack a certainty indication, which is needed by decision-makers to optimize a schedule. This research focuses on probabilistic predictions of flight delay on an individual flight level. Flight operation data from Amsterdam Schiphol airport and weather data from METAR is used to train four machine learning models that predict probabilistic flight delay distributions on a prediction horizon of one day. The first two developed models, a Dropout neural network and a Random Forest, predict empirical distributions. The other two models, a Mean Variance Estimator (MVE) and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) model, predict continuous distributions by predicting the parameters of an assumed distribution. The MVE predicts a single normal distribution, while the MDN model predicts a mixture of multiple normal distributions. Two interval-based performance metrics are suggested which assess the probabilistic predictions from different perspectives. It is concluded that arrival delay is best modelled with a MDN model with ten components, while departure delay is best modelled with only three components. Both models outperform a baseline statistical method on all considered interval widths. The MDN models outperform the other machine learning models by predicting more early arrivals and early departures correctly. The proposed models show that they can provide certainty indications of flight delay on an individual flight level, as opposed to binary and regression models. In the future, these certainty indications can assist airport operators with optimizing operational schedules, ensuring continuous operations and making ultimately air travel more pleasant.","Flight delay; Probabilistic predictions; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Multiple ultrawideband devices known as anchors can localize a device that supports ultrawideband communication after each anchor measures the distance between itself and the device. The anchor and the tag can measure the distance between themselves by measuring the time of flight of the ultrawideband messages exchanged between them. If the location of the anchors are known, the location of the device can be computed. However, errors in range measurements can cause errors in localization of the device. There are many sources that can cause errors in the measured range between the anchor and the tag. For example, when the tag transmits a signal, and the path between the anchor and the tag is blocked, the signal may be attenuated to such an extent that it may go undetected at the anchor, causing the anchor to measure the time of arrival of a delayed reflection. In this thesis, we aim to find a solution to improve the ranging accuracy when an anchor is equipped with two antennas. We target approaches that can be implemented on an embedded processor with limited resources. In order to improve the ranging accuracy, we first investigate various machine learning based classifiers that can identify non-line of sight and line of sight signals. Next, for each of the classified signal, we train and test various machine learning based regression models that will predict the true distance from the distance measured by the anchor.

Numerous tools and techniques have been developed for successfully implementing risk management. However, risk is frequently inadequately addressed and existing tools and knowledge are not used and exploited at a high degree. This research examines current practices of the risk management process and identifies barriers and opportunities pointing to improve its implementation through the exploitation of information and knowledge of past projects. The investigated knowledge and information focus on project drivers, characteristics and other KPI’s. The empirical study of the research incorporates the analysis of seven risk registers/projects of Witteveen+Bos and development of interviews of W+B risk and project managers involved in the analyzed projects. Subsequently, validation of the results is achieved through extra interviews of risk management experts external to Witteveen+Bos and a conceptual framework is developed. The last step of this qualitative research entails the validation of the conceptual framework which is tested with a case study implemented through an online workshop and a questionnaire. <br/>By analyzing the literature findings and empirical data, it is concluded that information and knowledge management during the implementation of risk management are not adequately developed while simultaneously constitute a major barrier to its success. Therefore, a conceptual framework that incorporates a way of structuring risk related information is developed while targeting to also tackle certain identified barriers of the current procedures such as the understanding of risk structure to the whole project and the adequate exchange of information during the process.<br/>The framework suggests a higher quality use of risk registers while structuring information and afterwards exploiting the information for capturing lessons that can be reused in future projects. It provides a way of clustering information during the development of projects and at the same time incorporates the development and use of risk networks. The development of risk networks is initiated by grouping risks based on their source. The aforementioned sources are selected based on the results of the research and named ‘Key Sources’. The aim of using risk networks is to increase risk insights while displaying risk exposure visually. In this way barriers such as lower understanding of risks, incomplete communication of risks as well as short term view of risks may be addressed or eliminated. Another part of the framework concerns the development of evaluation concerning the process as well as the description of risk related information. It is concluded that even though, there is a wide array of identified barriers to the effectiveness of risk management implementation, overcoming information and knowledge management barriers can constitute a higher level way of overcoming other barriers as well.<br","Risk management; risk registers; information; knowledge management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The project started of with the brief; What does the future of expoze.io hold? This indicates the need for a future vision. In order to create a future vision the company purpose must first be researched, the reason why they exist. The purpose of the company is often related to the customer needs, therefore it is important to understand the subjective value that the product offers to the customer. Therefore before the preliminary research the research questions proposed were; What does the future roadmap of expoze.io look like? What is the future vision for the predictive eye tracking platform expoze.io? What is the purpose of expoze.io? What is the customer value of expoze.io? What are market gaps / differentiating factors in the market? The preliminary research revealed that for the roadmap to succeed a process integrating the roadmap should be designed. This process should also fit the company as it is still a startup, therefore it must be time, effort and cost efficient. Another insight was that there needs to be a shift to a more human oriented mindset within the company. These insights led to the addition of the following research questions. What does the future roadmap of expoze.io look like? How can the roadmap assist in adapting the product to be more Human? How could the roadmap be best adopted into the operation of the expoze.io team? (process) How to build an innovation process that fits a small startup team? cost, time, effort efficient How to create a shift to a more human oriented mindset in this process? How to make sure that ideas selected fit the needs of the customers? Through customer interviews it became evident that the subjective customer value that expoze.io brings to the customer is confidence. Through eye tracking analysis the customer gains confidence in their advertisements and if they will perform in the market as they would like it to perform. It also brings confidence in presenting their analysis to their bosses or clients. This in turn makes the purpose of expoze.io “bringing confidence to marketeers”. By accompanying the purpose with the insights from competitor analysis, customer research, trend analysis and market research the future vision could be created. Through brainstorming the following vision was proposed; “Bringing the brains to the art of marketing”. This vision was tested through a workshop with the employees at Alpha.One. The workshop also ensured the involvement of the people working at Alpha.One in the creation of the roadmap, it also facilitated communication about everyone’s ideas about the future path of the company. The vision was chosen by the most people and is therefore implemented into the roadmap. The roadmap was based on the vision that was created accompanied by the insights from the research to fill in the steps that need to be taken in order to reach that future. The core strategy of the roadmap is to create confidence by facilitating deeper insights through the platform. In order for the roadmap to succeed an innovation process to support roadmapping was designed. This innovation process will also facilitate the shift towards a more human mindset by incorporating the customer in the ideation and validation of ideas. The innovation process revolves around three meetings on the following topics; strategy, ideas and planning. For every meeting a process is designed that interacts with the roadmap and makes sure that ideas added are actual customer needs and will create an impact for the customer.","Roadmap; Artificial intelligence; eye tracking; Innovation process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Recent industrial compressors are more efficient, less energy-demanding, and provide higher modularity than ever before. On the other hand, such innovation led to a higher degree of complexity of the equipment, which could undermine the reliability.Every compressor unit has sensors, programmable logic controller (PLC), and human-machine interaction (HMI) modules. The PLC can stop the equipment in case of danger, and the HMI displays the reason why the compressor stopped (e.g. high oil temperature).However, data from the sensors installed on the machinery can be used to obtain more insight to the status of the compressor. Less severe faults can be detected and diagnosed earlier, interrupting in advance the chain of events that leads to more expensive failures.GEA is one of the largest players in industrial refrigeration and produces different models of compressors, such as screw and piston compressors. The company performs maintenance services to their equipment located in different locations worldwide and they made available for this thesis multiple datasets of compressors experiencing different faulty behaviors. The aim of this project is to define methods of fault detection and diagnosis of faulty non-return valves, liquid refrigerant carryover in the compressor crankcase, and an investigation on faulty bearings.Different solutions about fault detection &amp; diagnosis (FDD) in reciprocating compressors have been found in the literature. Among the proposed solutions, two rule-based methods have been developed for the leaking non-return valve. The same fault has then been detected by classifying the data with three supervised machine learning (ML) techniques: decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. In the end, all the different models have been compared and their respective strengths and weaknesses analyzed. All the ML models showed an advantage in detecting the leaking in non-return valve compared to the rule-based models because the trend of such fault is not always predictable with a series of if-then-else rules.A similar approach has been used for the detection of liquid carryover in the compressor's crankcase. In this case, a rule-based model detected the fault accurately. This was due to the lower grade of complexity in detecting the symptoms of such fault. The ML models required a data augmentation step for the training dataset since the ratio between faulty and non-faulty data was too big. Two data augmentation methods have been used: random oversampling and synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) technique.For the last study case, an investigation and detection of symptoms to detect faulty bearings has been performed. Multiple rule-based algorithms have been defined to detect the symptoms of such fault, while a model-based approach has been proposed to compare the measured power demand with the predicted power demand of GEA's proprietary compressor model.In conclusion, a hybrid approach, rule-based + ML, is the proposed method for the development of GEA's FDD program, since there is no outstanding method that fits all the possible faults. Based on the results of the models developed in this thesis, GEA can choose which algorithm is worth implementing in the FDD program embedded in their compressors.","Fault Detection; refrigeration; Compressor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Here, a robot needs to create a map of its surroundings while simultaneously localizing itself in this map. An unknown environment is assumed. Traditionally, it has been approached through filtering solutions. This paradigm has shifted to pose graph optimization (PGO). This method scales well with large maps and is fast and accurate. Furthermore, it is especially suited to the distributed SLAM problem as existing distributed optimization methods can be leveraged. One such method is the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which has been used in distributed PGO. ADMM has a simple implementation and can achieve high accuracies in distributed PGO. A solution of good quality can be acquired in a few iterations with ADMM. However, ADMM is slow to converge to high accuracies. This thesis introduces an algorithm which implements Nesterov acceleration in the ADMM algorithm for distributed PGO in SLAM problems. Such an implementation will be novel. To create the proposed Nesterov accelerated ADMM (N-ADMM) algorithm, the current literature is adapted and extended based on the choices made in this thesis. The main research question is how to make these choices. The proposed N-ADMM algorithm is implemented in C++ and compared with unaccelerated ADMM and the state of the art. N-ADMM has shown better performance in some scenarios. To further research what these scenarios are characterized by, two models are introduced to create new datasets of which the parameters can be controlled. The effects of graph size and bad initial guesses are investigated.","SLAM; pose graph; distributed optimization; Nesterov; ADMM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Domestic wastewater consists of 40-60% of slowly biodegradable complex substrates, out of which proteins form a major fraction. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms of protein degradation in AGS. This research assessed the anaerobic availability of protein substrates for enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR) in an aerobic granular sludge reactor. Proteins have to be first hydrolyzed before being assimilated by the bacteria, and nutrient removal is often limited by the rate of hydrolysis. Therefore, a major part of this thesis attempted to look into the mechanisms of proteolysis in AGS. Next, the utilization of amino acids - the hydrolysis product of proteins - by PAO was explored, based on critical evaluation of available literature. Firstly, it is proposed that the important aspect likely to govern the hydrolysis of proteins in AGS is the substrate-granule interaction, taking into account the diffusion limitation of particulate substrates within the granules and the probable presence of hydrolytic enzymes on the granular surface. Further, it is seen that the amino acids may be utilized by the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) either directly or after the anaerobic degradation of amino acids to simple VFAs (volatile fatty acids), which are then taken up by the PAOs. The anaerobic degradation or fermentation of amino acids may occur via two well-known pathways- Stickland pathway and the non-Stickland pathway. Non-Stickland reaction requires syntrophy with hydrogen consuming bacteria whose presence in AGS is questionable. The bacteria responsible for Stickland reaction are obligate anaerobes belonging to the genus Clostridium which has not been found in aerobic granular sludge. Thus, it seems more likely that the amino acids are directly taken up by the PAOs in an AGS reactor. However, the direct uptake of amino acids by the PAOs has been reported only for eleven amino acids in total. More research on the likely fate of the remaining amino acids is recommended, considering that very little is known about the fate of amino acids in AGS. Few laboratory experiments were also conducted to study the effect of substrate size and granule size on the rate of hydrolysis of proteins. From preliminary experiments, it was seen that aerobic granular sludge exhibited significant anaerobic phosphate-release activity when casein (protein) was the only available carbon source. In the lab experiment carried out with different sizes of protein substrates, the observed anaerobic phosphate-release activity was used to obtain the rate of hydrolysis of different sizes of casein. Based on the hydrolysis rate obtained, it is seen that in an AGS reactor with a typical sludge concentration of 8g/l, up to 90% of the proteins present in domestic wastewater influent could be potentially taken up by the PAOs, provided that the proteins are completely dissolved. It was also seen that 60-80% of the particulate casein COD (&gt;0.45um) was hydrolyzed within 24 hours of the assay. In another lab experiment, fluorescent protease assay was performed to assess the effect of granule size on the rate of hydrolysis. A significant decrease (by at least 2 times) in the specific rate of protein hydrolysis was observed when the aerobic granule size was increased from 1-2mm to 3.15-4mm. This may be significant especially when the stratification of granules and plug-flow feeding in an AGS reactor is taken into account. Further research is recommended to analyze the relative effect of substrate size and granule size on the rate of hydrolysis of proteins in AGS.","Aerobic Granular Sludge; Hydrolysis; Proteins; EBPR; PAO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

The research is centered around Rotterdam The Hague Airport, a regional airport in the Netherlands. The first objective is to test how well machine learning classifiers can predict whether a flight will be delayed for a regional airport. This results in accuracies of around 70%, while taking precision and recall into account. The second objective is to predict the probability distributions of flight delays, for which three models are selected: a modified Random Forest Regressor, a Mixture Density Network and a Dropout Network. The main finding is that accurately predicting distinctive delay probability distributions for individual flights is possible. As a final objective, the predicted flight delay distributions are incorporated into an existing Flight-to-Gate Assignment Problem. It is found that this improves the robustness of the resulting schedules, although associated with a small reduction in their efficiency. The overall conclusion of this research is that machine learning-based prediction of flight delay distributions is possible, sufficiently accurate, and can improve at least one airport operation optimization problem. Further research will have to show whether this approach can be extended to other airports, other aviation optimization problems, or even optimization problems in other research areas.","machine learning; flight delays; airport operation optimization; regional airport; probabilistic forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Dijstelbloem, Huub (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are widely used tools for estimating climate change's impacts on the socio-economic system. However, IAMs possess a limited ability to represent the impact on vulnerable populations. Influential IAMs use highly aggregated outcomes masking significant relative differences in impacts across heterogeneous populations and time. Therefore IAM studies systematically undervalue the need for faster CO2 emission reductions to prevent substantial climate impacts on low-income groups. Previous literature has proposed alternative distributive principles to use in IAMs to overcome inequity problems in current abatement pathways. Due to the heterogeneous models, scenario assumptions, and principles used, comparison between studies has been difficult. Therefore the literature lacks an overarching comparative study of the performance of various distributive principles. Furthermore, deep uncertainty present within climate change is often not considered because most studies focus on single-scenario optimality. Therefore, current abatement pathways contribute to maintaining current economic inequalities and possess exposure to uncertainty. This thesis applies alternative principles to the RICE model through a MORDM method. Alternative distributive principles are used to generate more equitable abatement strategies using a MOEA. This research analyses four main principles: the Prioritarian, Sufficitarian, Egalitarian, and the Utilitarian principle. Alternative principles generate significantly different abatement trajectories than the Nordhaus optimal policy. Sufficitarian policies have the most stringent abatement targets focusing on reaching net-zero emissions by 2065. Prioritarian strategies aim at 2065-2105. Utilitarian strategies focus on reaching net-zero emissions around 2135. Lastly, Egalitarian policies enforce slow climate abatement. Abatement strategies have been stress-tested through an uncertainty analysis based on the SPP-framework and exposure to long-term climate uncertainty. Sufficitarian strategies possess high robustness to climate extremes and high average performance across all scenarios. Prioritarian strategies possess high average robustness but lower regret-based robustness. This research shows that alternative principles can successfully generate well-performing abatement pathways in the RICE model that outperform Utilitarian-based policies. The Sufficitarian principle's capacity to produce equitable and economically optimal strategies has been undervalued in previous research. Lastly, this thesis emphasizes that stronger climate action is needed to prevent possible disastrous worldwide impacts on low-income groups. Global emission reductions should adhere to a global warming of 1.5 degrees set out by the IPCC, which is consistent with the best-performing pathways found in this research. A first step would be to reduce existing economic inequalities to overcome exposure to climate extremes for lower-income groups. <br","integrated assessment modelling; Deep Uncertainty; Climate Change; Distributive Justice; RICE Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Designing engineering structures relies on accurate numerical simulations to predict the behaviour of a structure before its realization. In the design process, many variables influence the final structure. There is an incentive for optimizing the design based on the desire for cheaper structures and less material usage. Although a wide variety of optimization techniques exist, in practice many structures are not fully optimized and could fulfill their purpose with less material usage. This partly results from optimization techniques generally requiring many simulations for problems with a high number of variables. In creating increasingly complex models, simulating its performance can take up to days or weeks to compute, incentivizing the development of optimization methods that use as little simulations as possible. The goal of this thesis is to provide a method of optimization which significantly reduces the required number of simulations to be performed, aiming to overcome the issue of required computational effort. The optimization problem used in this thesis is the geometric optimization of a fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) microstructure. Each evaluation requires a Finite Element analysis, and many parameters are required to describe the geometry. The goal is to find the maximum stress at perfect plasticity during uniaxial tension, interpreted as a measure of strength. While generally only fibers with a circular cross-section are used, here a morphing parameter is introduced that changes this shape between being circular and square. Furthermore, fibers are allowed to overlap, effectively creating a single fiber with a complex shape. This geometry optimization provides a challenging problem for which different optimization techniques can be compared. The approach taken in attempting to minimize the number of function evaluations is a combination of several machine learning methods. Based on a limited number of initial samples, Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied. In BO a prediction model in the form of a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is created and used to inform further sampling. This prediction model provides a mean and a standard deviation in its prediction, both of which are used to find the best point to sample next. The number of initial samples required to create an accurate prediction model increases exponentially with the number of parameters. It is therefore opted to first use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the number of parameters in which BO is performed, by encoding the parameters in a lower dimensional representation. The variational autoencoder does this without requiring any function evaluation. Results show that when encoding the original parameters using the VAE, the encoded representation is unable to recreate all possible configurations of the original parameters. Furthermore, by transforming to a lower dimensional representation, within this representation the complexity of a function increases compared to the original function, generally leading to many local optima. This complexity proves difficult for the BNN to accurately predict based on a limited number of samples. As a result, BO does optimize the result, but does not reliably find the global optimum of the reduced parameter space. No clear conclusion can be made on the overall performance of the method compared to alternative optimization methods. Recommendations are made for what additional studies could be performed. Further recommendations are given for solving issues limiting the current performance as well as possible additions to the framework. The fiber geometry optimization serves as a good case to compare different optimization methods. It is shown that the geometry has a significant influence on the mechanical performance of a FRP microstructure, and optimization is therefore beneficial. The load case considered is however too specific for the optimized result to have direct practical use. Still, it does demonstrate that the results of an optimization study can be generalized. As the optimization framework is data driven, the optimization objective could easily be extended to study more realistic problems.","Bayesian Optimization; Variational Autoencoder; machine learning; Regression; high-dimensional; Fiber Reinforced Polymers - FRP; Artificial intelligence; optimization; Genetic Algorithm - GA; Bayesian neural network; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Accurate prediction of turbulence in wind farms is critical as it is proportional to wind turbine fatigue loads, power losses and prediction of wind farm lifetime. IEC Standard 61400-1 suggests the use of the semi-empirical turbulence model called Frandsen model, which was originally proposed in 1999. Since the development of the Frandsen model, the size of wind turbines and wind farms has increased significantly. Therefore, this work aims to determine the accuracy of two versions of the Frandsen model: Standard and Modified, when applied to large offshore wind farms experiencing a combination of atmospheric stability conditions. This is done by comparing the estimated wind farm turbulence under specific atmospheric stability conditions with measurements from Westermost Rough and Horns Rev 2. It was found that the atmospheric stability distribution and the distance of the upstream wake inducing wind turbine at the offshore site plays a significant role in the accuracy of the estimated turbulence from the Frandsen models. The estimated turbulence intensity from the Standard and Modified Frandsen models was found to be under-predicted with respect to the measured turbulence for all atmospheric stability conditions at both wind farms. For wind directions with wake flow for upstream wind turbines more than 10 rotor diameters away, the Modified Frandsen model showed better prediction of turbulence intensity compared to the Standard Frandsen model. On the other hand, for wind directions with wake flow for upstream wind turbines less than 10 rotor diameters away, the Standard Frandsen model showed better turbulence intensity estimation compared to the Modified Frandsen model. Among all atmospheric stability conditions, the turbulence intensity estimate was closest to the measured data for unstable conditions. It is suggested that this fact can be attributed to the presence of a significant number of unstable conditions in the offshore wind farms used for the design of the semi-empirical Frandsen model.","Frandsen model; Turbulence Intensity; Wake model; atmospheric stability; Offshore Wind Energy; Wind Farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-10","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Laser-beam welding (LBW) under tension is proposed as an alternative method to analyse LME cracks growing during the welding process of a DP1000 dual-phase steel grade. The influence of global thermo-mechanical parameters on the degree of embrittlement is investigated through Gleeble hot tensile tests.

Results show that a temperature dependent ductility trough is present between 750 and 900°C. The Fe-Zn system is further found to require specific mechanical conditions (stress and strain rate) to become susceptible to LME. The proposed LBW setup is found to be susceptible to LME, but not in a high enough severity to be detectable through SEM and EDS.

For the well-being of their parents, it is crucial that they feel connected with the people in their surroundings, for fulfilling their fundamental human needs, for maintaining their connection with their surrounding culture, and to get support in the many challenges they encounter. Therefore, the first aim of this graduation project is to provide the designers of Ontzorghuis with an overview of information that contributes to their understanding of the bigger picture regarding the relationship between CSN parents and the people in their surroundings. Insights from literature research, interviews with experts, and contextmapping research with 6 highly educated CSN parents with Dutch heritage, have resulted in 3 overviews of information. The Opportunity Framework lays out the different levels in capacities that CSN parents desire from people in their social surroundings, going from a vague acquaintance to a close friend. The Framework of Values illustrates 3 influential values of CSN parents, to better understand what is important to them and how their coping strategies are affected. The Practical Learnings and Attitudes offers designers an understanding on a more practical level. It offers insight into the psychological challenges CSN parents can face, navigating their own and other people’s expectations and attitudes. Secondly, this project proposes a design intervention that supports CSN parents in awaking a feeling of ownership among a few people in their social surroundings. The final design is a DIY-booklet with the following key aspects: it invites CSN parents to be soft with themselves, it promotes the common recognition and acceptance of long-term social support, and it inspires CSN parents to make it a positive event to ask for long-term support. The main message incorporated in the booklet is: it is important to be kind to yourself and it is okay to need support. First, the booklet introduces them to the novel concept of ‘zachte wacht’ or soft guard, a long-term social support circle for CSN parents. Secondly, it encourages them to reflect on what they expect of themselves, what they need to stay on their feet in the long term, and what they can expect of people in their surroundings. Thirdly, it guides CSN parents through the steps of setting up their own support circle, the final step being a small ceremony to seal their supporters' commitment. Although there is still room for iteration, the evaluations of 6 CSN parents demonstrated that the design is desirable for the target group. Everyone that expressed their opinion of the zachte wacht, CSN parents as well as experts, considered it to be a beautiful concept. The design capabilities, understanding of the target group, and network needed to implement the booklet and other aspects of the concept are a perfect fit with the unique strengths of Ontzorghuis. The concept has the potential to appeal to a large and growing target group. Moreover, promising opportunities for collaborations, funding, and subsidies are awaiting.","culture change; CSN parents; Design for well-being; Context mapping; Medisign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The safety problem of unmanned vehicles has been paid more attention from researchers. People are continually developing new control technologies, making the auxiliary driving or control of vehicles more accurate and reliable. Before designing a reliable controller, researchers need to obtain an accurate model of the vehicle system. However, the vehicle is a complex system, and various vehicle parameters are difficult to obtain by direct sensor measurement. In addition, there are deviations between the actual vehicle and the simulation model. At this time, it is necessary to make system identification to obtain reliable vehicle parameters and models. In this paper, vehicle simulation is carried out based on the CarSim C-Class model under the environment of CarSim vehicle simulation software. The model includes tire, suspension, steering, driver, and other subsystems. This platform can simulate a vehicle closed to the real one. The vehicle model can be controlled through Simulink and output the real-time data of various variables of the vehicle system. Then, the data required for identification and validation can be obtained through the joint simulation of CarSim and Simulink. By comparing different vehicle and tire models, different identification data sets and different algorithms, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different choices and their applicability. First, the comparison between the bicycle model and the four wheels vehicle model is implemented. The Interior-point algorithm was used to identify the two models under different control data sets. The results of parameter validation and vehicle validation are analyzed. Then, under the same control data set, the four wheels model is selected for the comparative experiment between different algorithms. The first comparison with the Interior-point algorithm is the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and its improved method Particle Swarm Optimization-Unscented Kalman Filter (PSO-UKF). The Magic Formula tire model was then identified by Genetic Algorithm (GA) algorithm, which compares with the Dugoff tire model. Each model and algorithm has its suitable scenarios.

(mentor); Abraham, E. (graduation committee); van Andel, E. (graduation committee); de Groot, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis proposes a novel design approach for a monitoring system that can detect hidden leaks in intermittent water supply (IWS) systems. Cities with IWS conditions in their drinking water network, such as Nairobi and Harare, often have a high percentage of non-revenue water (NRW) in their system. Estimations of the amount of NRW in these cities range from 40% to 50%, of which a large part is due to a leaky infrastructure. Intermittency of water supply is usually caused by a shortage of available supply, making it extra poignant to notice that these areas lose significant volumes of water. The leaks are also important locations for contaminant intrusion, which deteriorate the quality of drinking water. Additionally, intermittency of supply results in people using storage to fulfill themselves with their weekly water demand, which provides new challenges when constructing hydraulic models. Hidden leaks, which are leaks that do not appear at the surface, can be noticed in continuously supplied areas through reports of pressure deficiencies or the absence of supply. As these are regular circumstances in IWS areas, these hidden leaks are seldom noticed. Therefore, methods that are applicable in IWS systems need to be developed to detect these hidden leaks. This thesis proposes a new approach to detect hidden leaks in IWS areas with a smart hydraulic monitoring system. The approach optimizes the design of such a system in a district metered area (DMA) with IWS conditions in sub-Saharan Africa, by balancing information density and investment costs. By using as little equipment as possible, this optimization study aims to be not only scientifically and practically relevant, but also cost-effective. The methodology that was used to design the monitoring system makes use of a similar concept as the Dynamical Bandwidth Monitor (DBM), which is a smart hydraulic monitoring system that has been applied regularly in networks with continuous supply. The monitoring system consists of sensors that continuously measure flow or pressure and it compares these measurements to a range of expected values, attributing deviations from these expected values to a potential leak. A case study of Ashdown Park, a DMA with IWS conditions in Harare, was used to assess the performance of the design. The flow into this DMA and the pressure at its inlet had been monitored for one year. Two designs of the monitoring system were made, one which mainly consisted of flow sensors and one with mostly pressure sensors, to showcase which type of sensor could best be used in Ashdown Park. A hydraulic model was constructed for the DMA using pressure dependent outflow modelling. Daily demand patterns were constructed from analyzing the inflow measurements and used to calibrate the hydraulic model. The proposed calibration method assumes linear relationships between the demands and inlet pressure on one side and the pressure at a specific node and flow at a specific pipe on the other side. The range of expected flows and pressures within the DMA was calculated by Monte Carlo analyses, during which demand realizations were modelled by using a novel method which made use of a random weighted choice of demand, based on the outflow from a single tap. The ability of the monitoring system to detect leaks during different demand realizations was stored in a three-dimensional Boolean matrix, which was then used to determine the optimal sensor placement. A social and financial analysis, summarized in a business model canvas, shows more practical challenges and opportunities that could arise from implementing the monitoring system. The lessons learnt from this thesis were used to showcase whether the monitoring system could be applicable for IWS systems around the globe. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results of this thesis. The daily demand patterns in Ashdown Park showed a different pattern than in continuously supplied systems, showing less strong peaks. This could be due to a constant water demand for filling storage, leaks in the system or different consumer behaviour. The calibration method made it possible to model flows and pressures at the DMA inlet which were comparable to the measurements. The novel method to model demand realizations with a random weighted choice and a single tap capacity, showed promising results since the spread of the modelled inflow was well comparable to the spread of the inflow measurements. This standard tap capacity is especially suitable for IWS areas, since most people in IWS areas usually only have one tap directly connected to the water supply system and water end-use devices are not directly connected to the network. Furthermore, it was found that the water use behaviour of inhabitants of Ashdown Park had been more constant than the supply behaviour of the water utility. This irregular supply behaviour of the utility increased the difficulty of designing a pressure monitoring system. Using a flow monitoring system to detect leaks showed a better performance (leaks could be found on a daily basis in 25% of the pipes in the DMA) than using a monitoring system with pressure sensors (leaks could be found in 1% of the pipes). Making the monitoring system with pressure sensors dependent on the inlet pressure increased its performance (from 1% to 8.3%). Branched parts of the system were more favorable locations to place sensors and sensors at the DMA inlet were crucial for calibrating the hydraulic model. Practical barriers that were identified during this thesis were irregular operational schemes, unknown demand patterns and incomplete GIS data. Furthermore, costs can be saved as soon as leaks are detected, making the financial profitability very dependent on the performance of the system and the occurrence of leaks. The applicability of the monitoring system in IWS areas around the globe is determined by the priorities of a local water utility, its network characteristics and the ability of the local utility to overcome implementation barriers. The main limitations in this research are due to making some simplified assumptions, such as assuming a constant flow-rate from the tap in all households in Ashdown Park, and due to a lack of understanding of the local situation, since this research was performed in the Netherlands. To validate assumptions and get better understanding of the local situation, it is advised to conduct follow-up research at the location of interest. Especially a pilot project of the proposed monitoring system would likely find more practical barriers and limitations than could be thought off in this thesis and therefore bring more valuable information for the implementation of a smart hydraulic monitoring system. If prioritized, properly installed and operated, the proposed smart hydraulic monitoring system could generate substantial water savings and provide many social benefits, such as an increased access to clean drinking water and employment opportunities. Above all, it can assist a local utility with fulfilling their responsibility: supplying people with the basic need of drinking water.","water supply system; intermittent water supply; Leak; leak detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Part of that vision is to begin the shift towards a circular economy in which the lifecycle of the product is extended, and parts can be processed in a circular manner during the lifecycle. Considering that Microcab is a small company and the challenge is considerable, additional safety regulations mean that a vehicle should become a road-safe vehicle. This graduation project contributes to this challenge by researching the main question that focusses on the front section of the vehicle: ‘How can Microcab design the front section of the VIANOVA to increase the repairability and solve the safety issues?’. Through several analyses and explorative design directions, the result is a concept that reconfigures the front section of the VIANOVA to allow for increased repairability and better safety requirements while maintaining the goal of becoming more circular. An important requirement is that the concept should allow for a production volume of 500 units annually. The current design of the front clip is a single large body panel hand-made from a glass fibre reinforced thermoset, which is difficult to repurpose and recycle. Based on research data, a sustainable alternative known as thermoplastic olefin (TPO) is introduced. Furthermore, the front clip has been split into four segments. These changes allow for better repair capabilities and lower the overall impact of a low-speed collision. In order to make this possible, structures were required to support the panels and increase energy absorption. The bonnet with incorporated headlights is enlarged to increase accessibility during service and fixated on the support structure, removing it from the impact zone. The support was required to improve safety for pedestrians and increase protection of internal components. This support consists of adding an energy absorber, upper load beams, cross member, and extending the width of the bumper beam. Additionally, it is recommended to use plastic fasteners to increase circular capabilities, considering that these are more likely to break, allowing for the body panels to remain intact. Lastly, it is recommended to implement a different type of surface finish. 3M provides an PVC-free wrap material, reducing the use of harmful chemicals and increasing repairability and circularity. This change also provides opportunities to illustrate internals or implement advertisement. Therefore, the project reveals that there are multiple elements that can have a positive influence on the repairability and safety issues while at the same time, shift towards a circular economy. The recommendations that emerged from the project provide a high desirability, but will require follow-up research am physical crash testing to determine optimal configuration of the front section, and create a better understanding of the elements and how they influence impact resistance and repairability.","Circular economy; Repairability; Safety; Car body panels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autoplanning systems have been introduced to both reduce the time consumption and to counteract the influence of individual planning choices. Although autoplanning generally increases performance of the treatment plans, the plans still need to be checked manually to ensure plan accuracy. Increasing plan consistency with knowledge based planning (KBP) or automatic plan evaluation would be clear ways to improve upon this problem. For both improvements, deep learning can be an important tool to produce accurate and fast 3D dose distributions. In this study such a deep learning tool is developed in two parts to accommodate this. <br/>In the first part a structure based deep learning model, using a U-Net architecture is developed, used for dose distribution prediction for prostate patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, generated by autoplanning. Different loss functions have been tested to see which achieve the best results. In the second part physics information is included in the neural network prediction by using a hybrid physics-data approach. For this, an approximate dose distribution, the segment dose, is used as extra input for the dose prediction network. This segment dose is created by predicting multi leaf collimator (MLC) positions and reconstructing the corresponding dose with a simple dose engine. The predictions are evaluated using several dose characteristics, dose volume histogram (DVH) curves and other clinically relevant metrics. The U-Net architecture proved able to accurately predict the dose of patients in the test set. The best performing loss function for accurate dose characteristics prediction was found to be the weighted mean squared error (WMSE) loss, which predicted several PTV DVH statistics within a 1.5 % error and the rectum statistics within 3.5 % error. Furthermore, the model predicts the DVH points of the PTV within 0.84 ± 0.40 Gy average absolute dose difference and the rectum in 0.91 ± 0.72 Gy average dose difference. The hybrid physics-data model did not improve the prediction accuracy of the dose prediction model in terms of DVH statistics and DVH prediction, as the MLC positions could not be predicted accurately enough. The performance of the structure based prediction is similar to the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models. Although the hybrid model with the predicted segment doses did not improve the prediction accuracy, a significant effect could be seen from using the correct MLC positions instead. The bottleneck of the prediction is therefore identified to be the segment prediction. As such, it would be interesting to focus on segment prediction in follow up research.","Radiotherapy; Treatment Planning; Deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG) is used in most cases to enable sufficient blood flow for haemodialysis, but these have been associated with a large number of undesirable patient outcomes. Most of these can be linked to the resulting constant high blood-flow and the anastomosis remaining in an open position. To counter this, an implantable Dynamic Arteriovenous System (DAS) that can regulate blood flow through an anastomosis is to be developed. For this, a valve mechanism is to be designed and validated, that converts a mechanical translation from an actuator into an opening and closing motion on a synthetic graft.<br/>Objective: The goal of this research is to design a proof-of-concept DAS valve mechanism, and validate this ex vivo.<br/>Method: A methodological approach was utilised to generate concepts for a DAS valve that can fully collapse and open a synthetic graft acting as anastomosis. A Harris profile with a set of grading criteria is set up to determine the optimal concept. This concept is assessed through means of a number of test setups, that includes force measurement during collapse and opening of the graft, traction, and lifetime.<br/>Results: The result of the design study is a linkage mechanism utilising pinhole joints that converts the input into an (approximately) vertical translation on the top and bottom of the graft. A transmission ratio that approaches infinity when the graft is fully<br/>collapsed is achieved, whilst allowing an infinite number of states to control flow when open. The majority of the requirements set are met, but the necessary input force, traction andmass require some optimisation to fulfil the criteria.<br/>Conclusion: From this study it was concluded that the current design shows promise but a next design iteration is necessary to fully meet all design criteria. Future research should include the transmission of the actuator input to the valve and the assessment of foreign body response, which may require the development of a sealing method.","Haemodialysis; Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs); Mechanical; Design; Validation and Verification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-26","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Predicting the critical buckling load of cylindrical shells with circular cutouts subjected to uniform axial compression is an important part of the structural design in the aerospace industry as buckling significantly reduces the load-carrying capability of the structure. A cutout constitutes a major disruption in the shell geometry, and therefore it should be expected that it has a significant effect on the sustainable buckling load. An analytical solution for estimating the buckling load of isotropic and quasi-isotropic composite cylindrical shells with circular cutouts is developed to assess changes made to the geometry and the material during the preliminary design phase quickly. The Ritz method is employed to minimize the total potential energy of an ideal shell that contains a central opening in order to predict a linear buckling load. Finite element simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the analytical solution. In addition, they are used to investigate the evolution of buckling modes, the effects of initial geometric imperfections, as well as the shell failure mode. The nondimensional curvature parameter α can be used to categorize the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells and is a function of the cutout radius, the shell radius, and the shell thickness. A small cutout has virtually no influence on the buckling load compared to a pristine shell and the displacement pattern at buckling is global. The buckling load decreases rapidly for moderately large cutouts where the stability loss is the result of a local buckling mode that immediately leads to global buckling. Cylindrical shells with large cutouts are again relatively insensitive to an increase of the cutout size, but the buckling load is greatly reduced relative to a shell without a cutout. Large openings also feature a stable local buckling mode where substantial lateral prebuckling displacements emerge before the structure buckles globally. While the analytical procedure theoretically should not capture the onset of global buckling independent of local buckling, it follows numerical trends for cutouts of moderate and large size regardless. Therefore, it may be used during preliminary design to estimate the impact of changes made to the shell geometry and material. Local buckling is caused by high compressive stresses next to the cutout and, in some cases, large lateral prebuckling displacements. The detrimental effect of the stress field may be partially relieved in composite cylindrical shells by reducing the amount of axial bending stresses that occur. Hence, the chosen stacking sequence can have a significant influence on the buckling load of shells with moderate and large openings.","Buckling; Cylindrical Shell; Cutout; Analytical Solution; FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Auctions have established themselves as highly efficient mechanisms for the online allocation of time-constrained pickup and delivery tasks, which is an important problem in the domain of distributed autonomous systems. Current methods leverage simple temporal networks (STNs) to allow agents to efficiently process temporal constraints in the bidding phase of the auction. However, they suffer from two major weaknesses which limit their applicability in real-world systems. Firstly, they are relatively ineffective when tasks have non-deterministic durations, as the STN representation enforces a binary notion of plan controllability which is highly restrictive. We remedy this by introducing the probabilistic temporal sequential single item auction (pTeSSI), a novel polynomial-time auction-based task allocation mechanism in which plans are represented as simple temporal networks with uncertainty (STNUs). Using a recently proposed non-binary characterization of controllability in STNUs, agents efficiently determine the risk of unsuccessful dispatch of their temporal plans and incorporate this in their bids. We evaluate our auction mechanism in an online simulation of an on-demand UAV delivery system and demonstrate that it is more effective and efficient than the current state of the art method. In addition, we propose a dynamic re-auctioning routine to address the second main weakness of sequential auctions when applied to online problems, namely that they do not revisit existing partial allocations over time. We demonstrate that dynamic re-auctioning increases the quality of the allocation and improves system performance, but also increases the auction duration. We mitigate this downside by bundling tasks based on their spatio-temporal synergy and auctioning bundles, rather than single tasks, at once.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The goal of the project was to design a compliant hipback support of an exoskeleton while researching how to achieve desired directional compliance on this application. This work starts with an introduction to exoskeletons and explaining their working principles. The problem is that the reduction of range of motion for wearing an exoskeleton reduces the adoption of exoskeletons in industry. The objective of this study was to solve this by creating a hipback support with compliant behaviour in torsion and lateral bending while remaining stiff in the supporting forward bending direction. For inspiration, the state of the art of current hipback supports and research projects was reviewed. Also, the characterization methods of compliant mechanisms were reviewed for inspiration, to come up with a suitable design method for developing a compliant structure for a hipback support. By tuning stiffness of the structure in distinct directions, a conventional synthesis method for compliant mechanisms could be applied, namely the Freedom and Constraint Topologies method. This was used to come up with a preliminary design. This design was extended to improve stiffness behaviour for coupled motions by researching how to change stiffness on demand. The only categories to change stiffness are shape, material, prestress and boundary condition. For each category, a promising highlevel design was worked out with improved stiffness behaviour for coupled motions. To generate an even more satisfying solution, optimization of the beam shape was applied to handle the defined rather complex kinetostatic task and to develop a lightweight structure. The objective function was to reach specified deflections where shaperelated parameters are optimized. These parameters were the spine shape of the beam, the crosssection and orientation of the crosssection. To generate a design, a selfdeveloped optimizer using beam modelling was extended and applied. The extensions were to optimize a doubleclamped beam that was loaded in the middle point and optimizing for angular deformations as a set objective function. This extended optimizer generated the final design which was a thin rectangularshaped beam with threedimensional curves. This design was not straightforward to fabricate into a prototype. Multiple manufacturing methods were evaluated and one final method was selected to fabricate a close approximation of the final design. This final manufacturing method was to produce the prototype by roll bending and manually applying a twist on a curved lasercut strip which was extracted from flattening of the spatial shape. This prototype was verified by simulations and experiments. Simulation tests were run on an original design of the back support and compared with the new optimized shape based on the requirements. The results, for similar loadings and material, are 27 times more lateral flexibility, 1.25 more torsional flexibility and a design that is four times lighter in comparison to the original design. The original relative stiffness of 1 to 1 for forward relative to lateral bending improved to 2 to 1. An important remark to note is that the beam model generated a thin section which was less suitable for 1D beam modelling of the implemented FEM. Creating an optimizer based on 2D shell modelling code might give more accurate results and can be considered for future work.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Despite the increased robustness against model error due to the decreased model dependency, control laws based on INDI could still show performance variation when the on-board CE model deviates from the actual CE. This thesis will put this in the context of the control performance of high-performance aircraft. Furthermore, multiple adaptive INDI control techniques are investigated as possible solutions. This study revealed that adaptive control based on Least-Mean-Square (LMS) parameter estimation has the most potential. A second analysis using handling quality and stability (HQ&amp;S) requirements showed that this approach is able to decrease variation in the HQ&amp;S as well. However, the results also show that HQ&amp;S variation for large centre of gravity shifts could not always be fully mitigated by adaptive control as it is possible that the time-scale separation assumption becomes impaired.","Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; flight control; Adaptive control; Handling Qualities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Schröder, E. (graduation committee); Jonkman, Sebastiaan N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","By signing the Paris Climate Agreement, The Netherlands has committed itself to curtail its CO2- emissions in order to keep global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Pivotal to achieve these targets is the phase-out of CO2-intensive electricity generation technologies and investments in renewables. Current investments aiming to decarbonise the electricity system are predominantly allocated to solar PV and off- and onshore wind energy. However, this trajectory might change as the development of Dynamic Tidal power (DTP) might soon enable The Netherlands to harvest the North Sea’s currently unutilised tidal currents to generate clean electricity. DTP uses a 30-70 kilometre long dam perpendicular to the coast to capture the North Sea’s tidal currents. The alternating currents that proceed parallel to the coast create a hydraulic head over the dam, which turbines in the dam convert into electricity. However, the variable availability of solar irradiation, wind, and tidal currents makes it increasingly complex and costly to match electricity supply and demand as their shares in the electricity mix increase. To ensure electricity security, freely dispatchable energy generators (e.g. natural gas, biomass or coal turbines) are deployed to cover the electricity load that could not be met by the variable renewable energy (VRE) generators. However, due to the fuel used to generate electricity, dispatchable energy sources tend to emit CO2 and bear higher marginal energy generation costs than VRES. To address this problem, the portfolio shares of solar PV, offshore wind, onshore wind and DTP that minimise the need for dispatchable backup capacity and the energy generation costs were computed in this study. Due to its novelty, special attention was paid to the effect of DTP on a VRE system’s ability to efficiently match supply and demand. In order to achieve these objectives, a novel application of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) was used. The MPT originates from the stock market but is often used to comprise VRE portfolios that maximise the electricity output. However, as the aim was to minimise the residual load, demand-variability was introduced into the MPT. Existing literature had not covered this topic. Hence, by assessing to what extent including demand-variability in the MPT affects the selection of efficient VRE portfolios, this study filled a gap in the literature and serves as a starting point for future research into the application of the MPT. In total, three different electricity demand scenarios were optimised; the contemporary load profile (1), increased peak loads due to an extreme penetration of electric vehicles (EV) and electric heat pumps (HP) (2), and a flat load profile due to an extreme penetration of demand-responsive measures (3). The most efficient portfolio shares for each demand scenario were found by computing how 35GW should be distributed among solar PV, offshore wind, onshore wind and DTP in order to minimise the need for backup capacity and energy generation costs. The results of this study indicate that regardless of the demand profile, The Netherlands’ VRE system would be most cost-efficient in meeting demand when comprised of approximately 75% DTP and 25% offshore wind. However, only under the condition that the DTP-dams are geographically dispersed. Geographically dispersed DTP-dams, for example, located in Zeeland (south of The Netherlands) and off the coast of Texel (north of The Netherlands), cancels out the volatility in the electricity output caused by high and low tide. This reduces a VRE system’s volatility in electricity output and stabilises the electricity output from the dispatchable backup system, which minimises the system’s electricity generation costs. However, in terms of the amount of backup capacity required, it was found that a system comprised entirely of DTP with an integrated battery storage system would be even more efficient. The battery storage system eliminates all variability in the electricity output from DTP, which minimises the need for dispatchable backup capacity. However, as battery storage costs are significant (approx. 100,000 €/MWh), it is unlikely that a DTP-dam with a storage system large enough to flatten its electricity output is economically viable under the current market circumstances. This might change when DTP is combined with other storage systems or if battery storage costs reduce due to learning-effect, economies of scale or technical innovations. As DTP is still in its initial development phase, it is not certain DTP will successfully penetrate the power generation market. If DTP fails to enter the market, the current VRE system (61% solar PV, 8% offshore wind and 31% onshore wind) is fairly cost-efficient. However, if the aim is to reduce the amount of dispatchable backup capacity required to ensure energy security, future investments should be allocated to offshore wind. The overarching conclusion is that there is no unequivocal VRE portfolio that is most efficient to meet demand as it depends on the perspective taken (required backup capacity versus electricity generation costs). However, this study shows that the current VRE system benefits from the inclusion of DTP, both in terms of the required amount of backup capacity and the system’s energy generation costs. Only if DTP is combined with a large battery storage system to flatten its electricity output do the system’s energy generation costs surpass the costs of the current VRE system. In regards to the effect of including demand-variability in the MPT, it was found that demand variability has a limited effect on the selection of efficient VRE portfolio shares. Only in a scenario (2) with increased peak loads did the share of offshore wind slightly increase. This is due to the fact that the peaks in electricity supply from offshore wind coincide with the peaks in demand from electric HP (winter).","Dynamic Tidal Power; Wind Energy; Solar PV; Modern Portfolio Theory; Demand-Variability; Renewable Energy; Energy Transition; Tidal Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Furthermore, the critical nature of this application domain allows no room for error, whereas the process has to be simultaneously flexible enough to permit the unhindered work of the corresponding medical professional. Such medical imaging applications presently rely on complete hardware implementations of their processing pipelines and compositor engines, as opposed to earlier adopted paradigms of hardware-accelerated solutions. Said engines are usually realised in FPGA platforms due to their massively parallel computational capabilities and exceptional connectivity. However, given the vast amount of input streams arriving at the compositor's pipeline, switching and routing to available processing resources has remained a persistent issue. Present commercial solutions prove to be either too costly, too slow or too inflexible for developers to consider. On the other hand, academic literature centred around the subject is severely lacking. This thesis proposes a unique hardware architecture solution to mitigate the aforementioned problem. The proposed architecture, developed in collaboration with Philips Healthcare and TU Delft, exhibits an average end-to-end latency of 100 ns and a throughput of 7.2 Gb/s. Additionally, these results were realised under marginal resource utilisation, proving that such a switch can fit in the FPGA device and, subsequently, be developed as an integrated part of the compositor engine. Finally, the limited amount of reserved memory resources allowed for near-linear scalability of the proposed design should an increased amount of I/O devices be added; as well as dynamic portability should migration to smaller devices be a concern.","Image composition; FPGA acceleration; High-throughput interface; Low-latency switch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-11","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","FitOptiVis",""

However, glacier parameterization is often overly simplistic or non-existent in GHMs. The representation of glacier dynamics and evolution, including related products such as glacier runoff, can be improved by relying on dedicated global glacier models (GGMs). In this study we test the hypothesis that coupling a GGM to a GHM can lead to increased GHM predictive skills and decreased GHM uncertainty through better glacier parameterization. To this end, the GGM GloGEM is coupled with the GHM PCR-GLOBWB 2 within the eWaterCycle II framework. For the years 2001-2012, the coupled model is evaluated against the uncoupled benchmark in 25 large (&gt;50.000 km2) glacierized basins. Across all basins, the coupled model produces higher runoff throughout the melt season. In July and August, it ranges between 100.07% and 352% of the mean monthly benchmark runoff in lowly and highly glaciated basins respectively. The difference can primarily be explained by the inability of PCR-GLOBWB 2 to simulate snow redistribution and glacier retreat, causing an underestimation of glacier runoff. The coupled model better reproduces basin runoff observations primarily in highly glaciated basins, i.e. where the coupling has the most impact. This study underlines the importance of glacier representation in GHMs and demonstrates the potential of coupling a GHM with a GGM for better glacier representation and runoff predictions in glaciated basins.","Global Hydrological Model; Global Glacier Model; eWaterCycle II; Snow towers; Glacier runoff; Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Learning from Demonstration (LfD) can be used instead to teach the robot unknown parts of the environment, such as a goal deviation or an unforeseen obstacle. The general approach is to train a model offline and expect it to perform well afterwards. Problems arise however when the model is trained insufficiently or unknown variations have occurred in the environment, which demand for refinement of the model. In online learning the operator is allowed to refine a predicted trajectory during execution time, where the state-of-the-art methods focus on kinaesthetic teaching. The contribution of this research is the development of a teleoperated online learningmmethod, where the operator can make refinements by moving a haptic stylus (Phantom Omni) in the desired direction. By doing this, a force is felt proportional to the magnitude of refinement. After creating such a refined trajectory, it is used to update a condition dependent probabilistic trajectory model. The proof of concept was shown on a 2D example and on a simulated robot that shows that we can adapt an initial model when unknown variations occur and that the method is able to deal with different object positions and initial end effector poses. To show if other people can use the method, a human factors experiment is performed, comparing the developed method against three other methods on how much time it takes to successfully adapt a model (refinement time) and on the perceived workload. Two different parameters are varied, which are the teaching device (stylus or keyboard) and the learning mechanism (online or offline). The expectation was that both online with stylus has the lowest refinement time and workload, but the results show that only online has a significant improvement over offline methods (p = 7.94 × 10^−12 and p = 0.000512 respectively). This is explained by the fact that only small corrections have to be made and in a maximum of three degrees of freedom (DoFs). No significant difference was found between keyboard and stylus (p = 0.755 and p = 0.302 respectively). An explanation for this is that this is task, person and implementation dependent. The recommendations are to evaluate the proof of concept on the real robot and to extend the method with orientation refinement, such that more complex tasks can also be dealtwith. We hypothesize that with these tasks the combination of online with stylus does perform the best.","Learning from Demonstration; Online Learning; Human-Robot Interaction; Unknown Environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

One of these concepts is the delivery of packages in urban areas. Transportation companies are already testing vehicles capable of performing such operations, and many studies indicate that this concept is both technically feasible and financially attractive. However, how much risk do civilians living in cities (also called third-party-risk, or TPR) face following these drone operations? Moreover, what measures can be employed to mitigate this risk? Regulators demand answers to these questions before allowing autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations to take off. Recent research has focused on developing methods of calculating the TPR, or on creating models that accurately resemble drone operations in urban cities. The model proposed in this work bridges the gap between these categories using an agent-based safety risk analysis. In this analysis, we study the TPR of UAS package delivery operations in Delft, New York and Paris. This model leads to two main contributions. The first considers observations regarding the influence of the environment on the TPR. In particular, our model suggests that if the low-risk areas are clustered in a city, this leads to higher TPR. The second contribution is derived from the interaction of the risk computation with our model of the environment. Global- and local sensitivity analyses led to a few interesting observations. For example, our model suggests that it is more important to understand the vehicle's failure rate in the cruise-phase, than in the takeoff- and landing-phase. It is also suggested that it is more important to understand how buildings protect people from impact than to understand the effects of an impact directly on a human. Another finding is that modelling the impact speed with the terminal speed, as is common in literature, leads to a TPR that is 15% - 26% higher than when the impact speed is modelled based on the drone's dynamics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Nanocarriers, such as micelles, can be used to transport drugs to the tumor site and limit side effects of cancer treatment. Micelles are easy to produce, have a high solubilization potential for hydrophobic drugs and therefore can have high loading capacity. Due to the increase in cell division and higher activity of cancer cells, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often present at the tumor site. ROS have a highly oxidizing agent property by damaging DNA of cancer cells, it can be used to treat tumors. Beside ROS formation of the metabolic cycle, ROS can also be produced by ionizing radiation. With radiolysis of water, caused by radiation, the ROS concentrations at tumor sites can be increased. This research aimed to prepare micelles made from a block copolymer, that are sensitive to ROS and that are sensitive to ROS formed by radiolysis of water with gamma radiation for drug release purposes. 4-(methylthio)phenyl acrylate (MTPA) groups present in the block copolymer (PDMA-MTPA), are sensitive for oxidation reactions which will lead to decomposition of the polymer, and thus of the micelles. During this research, micelles with a hydrodynamic diameter between 30 and 50 nm were exposed to H2O2 levels between 2 wt% (0.6 M) and 0.007 wt% (2 mM) and a change in hydrodynamic diameter and light intensity scattering was observed, meaning that micelles decompose with elevated concentrations of H2O2. In addition, an increase in hydrodynamic diameter was observed for micelles exposed to a dose between 67 and 500 Gray by irradiating with gamma rays of 1.25 MeV originating from a 60Co source, indicating that micelles cluster after sufficient dose of gamma radiation. These characteristics can be useful for making PDMA-MTPA micelles, a suitable candidate for drug delivery applications.","Copolymeric Micelles; Oxygen Species; Drug delivery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Still, IMU-based motion reconstruction remains a challenging task as these IMU measurements are corrupted by noise and bias. There have been many filtering and sensor fusion algorithms developed to address this problem, but limited attention has been paid to including the system dynamics of the subject to estimate kinematics and kinetics from multiple IMUs. I propose a novel motion reconstruction algorithm for capturing 3D motions in a markerless and unconstrained environment using gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. The algorithm is based upon an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter for state estimation and the 3D dynamical model of the subject created in OpenSim (IEKF-OS). The IEKF-OS algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage incorporates the dynamics of the subject to predict the motion. The second stage tracks measurements from multiple IMUs to improve model estimates of joint angles and speeds. The goal of this thesis is threefold. Firstly, the IEKF-OS is derived and verified using simulations performed on a six-link robot manipulator including sensor placement errors. Secondly, experiments are performed to validate the algorithm’s estimations against the robot’s ground truth joint encoder values. Thirdly, the algorithm is compared against an inverse kinematics method to track IMU estimated orientations (OpenSense) provided by OpenSim. The IEKF-OS algorithm showed lower motion tracking errors compared to OpenSense for various motions performed by the robot manipulator. The joint angle estimations as computed by both methods are compared against the gold-standard ground truth robot encoder values. OpenSense joint angle values were in the range of 0.6-6.4 [deg] RMSE, whereas the IEKF-OS algorithm estimated joint angles and speeds in the range of 0.4-2.8 [deg] and 0.3-2 [deg/s] RMSE, respectively. These results highlight accurate 3D motion reconstruction on a six-link robot manipulator. Contrary to OpenSense, the IEKF-OS is able to accurately reconstruct motions regardless of magnetic disturbances because it does not rely on magnetometer data.","IMU Sensor Fusion; Biomechanical Model; OpenSim; 3D Motion Reconstruction; Kalman Filtering; State Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The number of vehicles utilizing freeways increases every day, with more and more traffic jams as a result. Lately, the development of smart traffic management systems seems to be a way out and these systems are used extensively. In this thesis, smart traffic management systems are used to control a freeway network in order to achieve an optimal flow, as well as a minimal amount of emitted gasses, and to protect target areas in the vicinity of freeways from dispersed gasses. Smart traffic management systems use control measures such as ramp metering and variable speed limits. To control these measures in an optimal way, model predictive control is found to be a suitable control method. In order to simulate the behavior of freeway traffic and traffic emissions, a model predictive control scheme uses traffic models. The METANET traffic flow model and the VT-macro traffic emission model are suitable models for control purposes in traffic networks, and therefore, these are used in this work. In order to predict the amount of pollutant gasses distributed in the area downwind of the freeway, a third model has to be used. Multiple authors have proposed so-called dispersion models, but none is yet suitable for on-line control of freeway networks. This is due to high computational costs, the inapplicability in constantly changing traffic networks, or deviating purposes of models. This work proposes a new dispersion model that is able to model the distribution of pollutant gasses in the vicinity of a freeway and which is applicable in real-time traffic control. The proposed model, the line source Gaussian puff model, is an extension of the existing Gaussian puff model. The Gaussian puff model is suitable for the modelling of point sources such as industrial stacks. In this work, the Gaussian puff model is modified to make it suitable for the dispersion modelling of freeway sections. This is done by implementing line sources instead of point sources. The proposed model has a small normalized error such as the validation data set generated by a CFD model, implying a good performance. Compared to alternative models used in freeway traffic control, the new model has a smaller error. The LSGP model is used in a case study to get an understanding of what level of pollutant gasses can be averted to disperse to target areas. In this case study, an MPC scheme is used to control a freeway. The aim is to find an optimal situation where the flow of the freeway is optimal, the total amount of emitted gasses is minimal, and the concentration level in the target area is reduced. The results show that the new model is able to minimize the amount of pollutant gasses nearby a freeway with a low computational complexity in a model predictive control scheme.","Dispersion; Traffic control; Freeway Traffic Control; model predictive control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Within incident management the so-called major incidents, incidents with a severe impact on the company, require emergency actions to reduce this impact. An earlier detection of these major incidents will lead to a faster resolution time and this can be achieved by using software analytics methods. These methods have been used on incident management before which faces challenges with data quality and imbalance. However, software analytics have not been applied to major incidents in particular, which is what this thesis aims to do. To gain more insight into the possibilities and challenges of automated major incident detection, a case study at ING (a large global bank) was performed. For this case study a machine learning system has been created and assessed by eight<br/>experts through interviews. Following from these interviews, three novel challenges were identified. The first challenge is that the impact should be measured to make a more accurate prediction. The second challenge is combining multiple information sources and the third challenge is the explainability of the decision. Furthermore, two solutions to existing challenges were investigated during the creation of the machine learning system. The first being the suitability of different machine learning models for incident data, as no direct comparison is available in literature. It is shown that Logistic Regression is best suited for this use case while the Support Vector Machine and Neural Network also perform well on incident data. Finally, some findings on the<br/>pre-processing of the incident data are reported. It is shown that assumptions in literature about automatically generated incident data being easier to use, can not always be made and that imbalanced data still remains an unsolved problem as sampling is not suited.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) is an energy efficient technology to temporarily store groundwater of different temperatures in an aquifer. The basic idea behind ATES is to store thermal energy in warm and cold wells so that the energy can be used for heating and cooling of buildings in the next season. Design and planning of ATES systems requires numerical simulation tools such as SEA- WAT, COMSOL, and FEFLOW. COMSOL and FEFLOW are expensive commercial products. SEAWAT is a free computer program based on MODFLOW and MT3DMS. The flow field is modelled with the finite difference method while there are several methods to simulate the heat transport including the finite difference (FD) method and the total variation diminishing (TVD) method. OpenGeoSys (OGS) is an open-source alternative based on the finite element method which is able to simulate groundwater flow and heat transport processes and can potentially be used for design and planning of ATES systems. There are very few applications of OGS to simulate ATES systems. The main goal of this research is to assess the usability of OpenGeoSys in the simulation of ATES sys- tems. The numerical solutions of OGS and SEAWAT (both the TVD scheme and FD scheme) are compared to the analytical solutions for a single well that injects water with a constant flow rate of water and constant temperature. For a doublet with a cold well and a warm well, the OGS solution is compared to the SEAWAT solution for both a sin- gle cycle system and a multiple cycles system with constant flow rates and temperatures. Finally, a field case of a doublet with varying flow rates and injection temperatures is studied to compare the performance of OGS to SEAWAT. The main findings of this study are as follows. Both OGS and SEAWAT can reproduce the heat transport process of the analytical solutions for a single well injecting warm or cold water. There are some deviations between the temperature distributions computed by the numerical models and the analytical solutions which are primarily caused by nu- merical dispersion. The TVD scheme results in the smallest numerical dispersion while OGS shows slightly more numerical dispersion when applying the same number of cell- s/nodes. Numerical dispersion can be reduced by application of finer spatial resolution for the SEAWAT since the time step is adjusted automatically. For OGS, the time step must be reduced manually when the grid is refined. Both OGS and SEAWAT show energy balance errors smaller than 1%. Numerical dis- persion has an effect similar to physical dispersion so that the thermal radius increases when the numerical dispersion is larger. The interaction between the warm well and cold well of a doublet increases when the thermal radius increases, which may result in an increase of the energy balance error. According to the analytical solution for the model where the heat transport between the aquifer and aquitards is included, OGS shows the smallest overestimation of thermal energy that remains in the aquifer part compared to the two solution schemes of SEA- WAT. The vertical temperature distribution in aquitards simulated with OGS is closer to that of the analytical solution compared to SEAWAT. Both numerical dispersion and the overestimation of thermal energy in the aquifer have an influence on thermal recovery efficiency of an ATES system. Larger numerical dis- persion indicates a longer heat transport distance, resulting in more time needed for thermal energy to transport back to the wells during the extraction period. Similarly, the overestimation of the thermal energy in the aquifer provides more thermal energy dur- ing the extraction period. There are some overshoots/undershoots when simulating an ATES system with varying flow rates and injection temperatures by the TVD scheme. This can be eliminated by refining the spatial resolution. It is more complicated to simulate an ATES system with OGS than SEAWAT. The com- putational time is much longer for OGS compared with SEAWAT by a factor of around 10 for the same number of cells/nodes. Despite these drawbacks, OGS is suitable for the simulation of ATES systems as the simulated temperature distribution in both the aquifer and aquitards compares well to the analytical solution, and there are no prob- lems of overshoots/undershoots in the simulation of varying flow rates and injection temperatures.","OpenGeoSys; SEAWAT; ATES systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, much CSAM remains unfound. Secondly, hotlines have a very important but also insecure position in the government policies. Further, are direct incentives for the sector more than moral duty are missing and the organizational degree of the sector is low. Also, the set norms and policies of the government and self-regulation are not accounting for the high diversity of the sector. There is a lack of financial resources.

(mentor); Brandt, Jelmer (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A significant growth of the world’s population together with fast growing urbanization is causing challenges for cities in the future. One of these challenges is how to deal with waste production and therefore the waste collection in such areas. Smart waste collection is a promising solution since it optimizes an already excising infra structure including vehicles and since the collection and transportation of the produced waste accounts for roughly 70% of the waste management costs. Smart waste collection is a routing problem and can be categorized both as a vehicle routing problem (VRP) or as an inventory routing problem (IRP) depending on which container selection method is used. Smart waste collection uses sensors to measure and communicate the fill levels of the waste containers. This data can be used to optimize the process of waste collection and optimize the chosen KPIs. When all fill levels are known, routes can be optimized and containers can be collected at exactly the right time. This article will use real data obtained from the containers collected by OMRIN with the help of AMCS and their software. Container selection methods can be categorized as threshold based, attractiveness based or must-go may-go based. Containers can be selected for collection, roughly based on three methods. The interesting thing is that these three methods have not yet been compared to each other. Therefore the main goal of this research is to compare the three aforementioned methods based on real data and investigate certain tuning parameters to optimize each model based on the chosen KPIs. The models are first individually optimized by changing their tuning parameters and keeping the overflow in an acceptable range of the baseline, calculated based on real data. Overall a strong negative correlation is found between the total traveled time and the amount of overflows. Furthermore a warm-up period of three days is used, meaning the first three days of a test instance will be removed in order to capture only the steady state of the models. The individual optimization shows the best solutions for a 1% threshold buffer for the threshold model, a three-day horizon with 110% upper limit for the attractiveness model and a three-day horizon with an threshold buffer of 7% and a 110% upper limit for the must-go may-go model. When compared the attractiveness model shows to have the smallest total travel time. However, its computational time exceeds the actual total travel time. The must-go may-go model shows a slightly higher total travel time, but has a significant lower computational time. Therefore making it more suitable for real world application. This research as well shows that the two-day horizon instances of both the attractiveness model and the must-go may-go model barely improve the solution of the one-day horizon. Finally a true forecasting model was used to see what potential lies with designing a detailed forecasting model, which shows to be in the same order of improvement as was obtained by tuning parameters of each model.","Smart waste collection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided focal laser ablation to treat prostate cancer reduces the risk of adverse effects by preserving noncancerous tissue. Prostate cancer diagnosis and focal laser ablation treatment both require the insertion of a needle for biopsy and optical fibre positioning. The insertion of needles in soft tissues causes tissue motion and deformation, resulting in tissue damage. In this study, we propose an MRI-ready actuation system for a needle that can be inserted into tissue with a zero external push force and without buckling. The zero external push force is achieved by moving parallel needle segments in a reciprocating manner. The actuation unit’s design inspired by the click-pen mechanism actuates the reciprocating motion of six parallel needle segments by solely a discrete manual translating actuation as its input. A prototype, called the Ovipositor MRI-Needle, was built using 3D printed parts and six 0.25-mm diameter Nitinol rods. Experimental validation of the Ovipositor MRI-Needle in ex vivo human prostate tissue inside a preclinical MRI scanner showed that the needle could advance in three out of five measurements through the tissue. The Ovipositor MRI-Needle is a step forward in the direction of developing a self-propelling needle for MRI-guided transperineal laser ablation to treat prostate cancer.","Medical needle; magnetic resonance imaging; additive manufacturing; manual actuator; biologically inspired design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This sheltered region is called the shadow zone and contains a reduced wave climate. The turning of the waves is based on the lateral transfer of wave energy along the wave crest, caused by a gradient in wave height. This process is called diffraction. Breaking wave heights and angles inside the shadow zone will be influenced significantly because of wave diffraction. Since variations in breaking wave height and/or angle are responsible for gradients in the alongshore sediment transport, should the process of wave diffraction be taken into account while simulating the shoreline evolution in the vicinity of a groyne.

Therefore, matching the observed anti-clockwise rotation of the coastal cell. Without accounting for diffraction effects, this matching result was not achievable.

This proposal contained a bioresorbable ceramic component, made out of hydroxyapatite (HA), with a porosity gradient which will be subjected to a compressive load. In order the prevent mechanical failure of the prosthesis, the compressive strength of the ceramic component must be investigated. Therefore, the influence of a porosity gradient on the compressive strength compared to a homogeneous porosity is researched in this study. Six different designs, one containing a porosity gradient (ranging from 23% to 30% to 37%) and five containing a homogeneous porosity (18% ,23%, 30%, 37%, 50%) were manufactured and tested on their ultimate compressive load (UCL) and first maximum compressive load (FCL). The UCL seemed to decrease with an increasing porosity and the FCL was around 400 N for every configuration. Heterogenous scaffolds seemed to have a lower UCL compared to homogeneous scaffolds containing a porosity equal the heterogenous lowest porosity. However, this heterogeneous UCL seemed to be higher than the UCL of a scaffold with a porosity equal to the average and highest porosity present in the layered configuration. Significant differences were only found between the UCLs for the 18% and 37% porosity configuration. Not all scaffolds showed the required UCL for the current application. However, HA is still a promising material, although the manufacturing of the scaffolds and other production techniques should be investigated further to obtain the desired UCL and FCL","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-16","","","","","",""

Recent assessments led to the insight that protection levels of many flood defences should be increased. Integrating reinforcement measures is a difficult task as many dikes are situated in densely populated areas. Conventional reinforcement measures include berm construction or the implementation of sheet pile walls. The first can become very expensive in case houses are situated close to a dike, the latter is rather expensive and irreversibly changes dike composition. Geotechnical failure modes piping and slope instability are most important failure modes for Dutch river dikes. In this thesis a case study is carried out on such a dike that is disqualified for those failure modes. The dike is situated in an urban area with limited space available for reinforcement works. It is studied whether pore pressure measurements behind the dike can be used to improve the reliability estimate for piping. Subsequently it is analyzed whether implementing pressure relief wells can be used to increase dike reliability for both considered failure modes. For the case study an advanced modelling framework was used consisting of groundwater modelling software and a random field generator. The case study was divided into two parts. The first part consisted of a dike section of 100 m based on a dike section at Wijk bij Duurstede. The second part consisted of the same dike section, only now extrapolated over a length of 2 km for which variations in soil conditions become more important. First, an analysis was conducted to define the optimal amount of pore pressure sensors behind the dike. It was found that for a dike section of 100 m a total of four sensors could be used to perform reliability updates, for a dike section of 2000 m it was found that a total of six sensors could be used. For the 100 m section piping failure probability improved from 5.21E-3 per year to 1.62E-4 per year. For the 2000 m section piping failure probability improved from 5.21E-3 per year to 1.89E-4 per year. Pressure relief well implementation behind the dike was considered as a measure to increase dike reliability for both failure modes. The system was designed based on a target reliability level for slope instability. The same modelling framework was applied. An analysis was conducted and it was shown that for the 100 m section a well spacing of 50 m would sufficiently increase dike reliability for slope instability. For the 2000 m section a well spacing of 45 m was found. For the 100 m section failure probability for slope instability increased from 8.81E-5 per year to 1.22E-6 per year, failure probability for piping increased from 1.62E-4 per year to 2.03E-7 per year. For the 2000 m section failure probability for slope instability increased from 8.81E-5 per year to 1.30E-6 per year, failure probability for piping increased from 1.89E-4 per year to 1.02E-7 per year. It was shown that for both trajectories target reliability levels for all failure modes were met. For this case study it was shown that pressure relief wells provide a good design alternative for dike reinforcement in urban areas. A life cycle cost analysis was applied and it was shown that implementation of relief wells is economically attractive compared to traditional design alternatives berms and sheet pile walls. For the first relocation of houses forms an important cost driver, for the latter initial construction cost are high. Furthermore it was shown that implementation of pore pressure monitoring prior to the design of a relief well system yields a positive value of information.","Dike reinforcement; Probabilistic design; Bayesian updating; Dike reliability; Pore pressure monitoring; Pressure relief wells; Backward erosion piping; Slope instability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.972179, 5.349489"

Despite their prevalence, a thorough understanding of them lacks because they are such complex phenomena, and their manifestation can differ depending on the region they occur in. Monitoring hydrological variables and processes is imperative for a good understanding of how droughts develop and persist. Backscatter from ASCAT and previous scatterometers has long been used for soil moisture retrieval. The first and second order derivative, slope and curvature respectively, of the backscatter - incidence angle relation in the TU Wien Soil Moisture Retrieval algorithm are used to correct for vegetation effects. Recently, new developments to this algorithm have allowed to account for interannual variations in the slope and curvature. This has given rise to the potential of monitoring vegetation directly with slope and curvature, rather than only using it to correct for vegetation effects in soil moisture retrieval. The long data record of ASCAT and previous scatterometers combined has the potential to provide valuable information for drought monitoring. This study investigates if ASCAT could be used as a self-contained dataset in drought monitoring. The spatial variability, the seasonal cycle, and the drought response of backscatter, slope and curvature across different vegetation types in Australia is assessed. Simulated surface- and root zone soil moisture, LAI and GPP from the land surface model ISBA are used to aid in the interpretation of the ASCAT signal. The results from this study show that backscatter, slope and curvature can adequately capture vegetation dynamics in times of drought across dry semi-arid grasslands and croplands. Over these regions the soil moisture and vegetation anomalies observed with ASCAT and simulated in ISBA correspond well. Considerable information into the vegetatin dynamics can be gained from analyzing the backscatter - incidence angle relationship. Especially the ability to monitor drought in crops with a coarse spatial resolution is promising for future applications. It proved more difficult to accurately capture the propagation from a soil moisture anomaly into vegetation anomaly across forests and mixed vegetation with grasses and trees. The first reason for this is the increased attenuation of the signal by vegetation, which hampers accurate measurements of soil moisture content. The second reason is that it is more difficult to separate the soil moisture and vegetation effects due to the fact that less is known about the scattering mechanisms induced by vegetation structure and moisture distribution. Overall the results support earlier findings the slope can be used as a measure of vegetation wet biomass and confirm that curvature is also a valuable source of information that gives insight into the relative contribution from surface or volumetric scattering to total backscatter. These relations have been shown to also adequately describe vegetation dynamics in times of drought.","ASCAT; Drought monitoring; Dynamic Vegetation Parameters; Scatterometer; Vegetation water dynamics; Backscatter; Australia; Slope; Vegetation monitoring; Curvature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-16","","","","Water Management","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","To fight the threat of global warming, nations worldwide are currently in the transition towards a renewable-powered energy system. One of the main technologies represented in a renewable-powered energy system is wind energy. Rapid developments in the offshore wind sector caused the rise of offshore wind farms in the North Sea and more wind farms are expected for the years to come. As this renewable-powered energy system will be heavily dependent on the availability of wind and solar energy, great challenges will arise to the security of supply in the energy system. To tackle this challenge, nine countries surrounding the North Sea (called NSEC) cooperate on researching a cost-efficient energy system design which enables the large-scale deployment of wind and solar energy. One aspect that hasn’t been researched for the NSEC so far is the potential of hydrogen for this energy system. Hydrogen can play an important role in the future renewable energy system as fuel and feedstock for different sectors and as energy carrier that allows for seasonal storage. The question of what energy system design choices bring the most cost-efficiency for the NSEC, considering the hydrogen and electricity demand in 2050, will be researched. For this research, results have been based on optimizing the future energy system in the simulation modelling program Powerfys. This model optimizes power plant utilization while taking the constraints assigned to the power plants and to the energy system infrastructure into account. Powerfys operates on a rolling planning on the intra-day and the day-ahead market. The model consists of 50 nodes, divided over 9 countries and the North Sea. By simulating scenarios focused on either renewable energy capacity expansions or transmission infrastructure design, different levels of cost-efficiency are determined. These outcomes will allow to answer the research question. This research shows that a cost-efficient energy system for both electricity and hydrogen in the NSEC can exist with the current planned electricity and natural gas transmission grid for 2050, assuming a fully retrofitted natural gas grid, exclusively utilized for hydrogen transmission. What this study does show is that extensive amounts of offshore wind (285 GW) and other renewables (245 GW of onshore wind and 434 GW of PV) must be deployed, to meet the expected electricity and hydrogen demand of 2050. For offshore wind this means that not only the potential of bottom-fixed wind turbines should be accounted for, but also the potential of the novel technology of floating wind turbines must be considered. On top of that, this study shows that only 4 to 5% of all hydrogen demand must be imported from outside NSEC. Even without the imports of any hydrogen, meeting full electricity and hydrogen demand would be technically possible, but this would lead to higher energy system costs for the deployment of higher capacities of renewables and the storage for hydrogen in salt caverns. Though, the sensitivity analysis shows that hydrogen imports can increase significantly when price levels related to hydrogen (import-, electrolyser- or hydrogen storage prices) will turn out different in 2050 than currently expected. Nevertheless, this research also shows that such a significant increase in hydrogen imports will not lead to remarkable deviations in the overall energy system design or the energy system costs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-01","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

This paper proposes a novel machine learning approach to establish the ship’s fuel consumption per mile for the actual environmental conditions and develop fuel consumption curves for the various propulsion configurations. The proposed approach uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to establish the ocean parameters based on the own ship data, with an accuracy of 4.150 %.

The proposed approach is especially useful for military operators since there is no need for external data sources.

(mentor); Bluemink, R.G.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The daily consumption of food influences the health of society and the planet. The current food consumption of an average Dutch consumer could be described as unsustainable behaviour (Muilwijk et al., 2019). Especially the intake of animal proteins should decrease and be replaced with plant proteins to realise a positive impact (Kramer &amp; Blonk, 2015). However, the consumer is not the only responsible stakeholder for this, because food processors, foodservice operators and retailers shape the market and influence consumers’ dietary choices (European union, 2020). In other words, the consumption system influences the consumer. Therefore a transition of the system is required to realise sustainable food consumption. This thesis applies a system perspective to explore essential actors and identify barriers and triggers for the transition (Loorbach et al., 2017). The system is locked in the feedback loop of demand and supply and the consumer strongly influences the demand side of the system. A change in demand means a change in consumer behaviour. Behaviour is influenced by a complex interplay of factors and to change the system a bottom-up strategy is applied. This requires a context-specific case to change the consumption system (McKenzie-Mohr,2011). In conclusion, the focus of this project is to design an intervention which supports consumers to replace animal proteins with plant proteins when ordering food. The consumer journey emphasises the importance of the right choice in order to change behaviour and purchase differently. Due to unconscious routine behaviour, the consumer needs support in the decision process. Personalised triggers and simplification of the consumption process supports the desired behaviour and could lead to a new habit of consuming sustainable food (Eyal, 2014). A concept is designed to match personalised meal suggestions with consumer preferences. Additionally, actionable support is provided to ease the choice between different forms of food delivery. The goal of the concept is to offer personalised inspiration, actionable support and accessible education for the consumer and the foodservice stakeholders to realise sustainable food consumption. The concept operates according to a platform business model where multiple stakeholders are included to add value. The added value for every stakeholder is validated with several expert interviews and online consumer discussions. The platform is self-learning and uses consumer data to advise the foodservice actors about anticipation of consumer needs. The translation of consumer data into valuable insights for the industry generates a viable revenue model. The key business activities are the data analysis and the matchmaking between consumers and meals. The implementation of the concept is explained according to a roadmap and indicates a strategy for entering the market. The concept is positioned as an honest and truthful platform that serves and supports stakeholders in their sustainable consumption behaviour. This creates a competitive advantage compared to other delivery platforms. The concept covers all SHIFT factors to encourage sustainable food consumption and therefore owns the potential to change consumer behaviour (White, 2014). A change in consumer behaviour results in new consumer demand. The change will affect the supply side of the feedback loop and contributes to the transition of the consumption system.","Behaviour Change; System Design; Food Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

On the one hand, curricular reinforce- ment learning approaches divide the task into more gradual complexity stages to promote learning efficiency. On the other, safe learning provides a framework to consider a system’s safety during the learning process. The latter’s contribution is significant on safety-critical systems, such as transport vehicles where stringent (safety) requirements apply. This pa- per proposes a black box safe curriculum learning architecture applicable to systems with unknown dynamics.

By adding system identification capabilities to existing safe cur- riculum learning paradigms, the proposed architecture successfully ensures safe learning proceedings of tracking tasks without requiring initial knowledge of internal system dynam- ics. More specifically, a model estimate is generated online to complement safety filters that rely on uncertain models for their safety guarantees. This research explicitly targets linearised systems with decoupled dynamics in the experiments provided in this article as proof of concept. The paradigm is initially verified on a mass-spring-damper system. After that, the architecture is applied to a quadrotor where it is able to successfully track the system’s four degrees of freedom independently, namely attitude angles and altitude.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The isostatic slab was developed by Pier Nervi and his colleague Aldo Arcangeli to create an elegant and easy to produce floor system, with efficient use of material. These slabs are designed with ribs aligned to the principal bending stress lines that support a flat deck. Concrete isostatic slabs are no longer constructed due to their expensive formwork. However, this system could be advantageous when made from timber as the grain direction will be aligned to the optimal flow of forces. Additionally, isostatic slabs can be designed for any support conditions, so an isostatic timber slab may be more desirable than the typical one-way spanning timber systems. The isostatic timber slab is a new concept and has not been previously used. Therefore, before the system can be applied, there needs to be a greater understanding of the design process. This research achieves this goal by splitting the process into two parts. Firstly, the rib geometry is created by generating the principal bending stress lines. Secondly, the system is designed and analysed for a case study. The aim is achieved by creating a functional design and identifying the critical areas in the design process. An approach for measuring the accuracy of stress lines is developed and used to test different methods for improving the stress line generation process. The improved process uses a more advanced integration method and a holistic seeding method. Additionally, a novel method for interpolating the principal stress trajectories from finite element analysis (FEA) results is established by utilising the shape functions from the theory of FEA. An iterative approach used to select stress lines to create optimised truss geometries in in-plane-loaded plates is tested for its applicability to out-of-plane loaded plates (i.e. slabs). The rib geometry produced was measured by the approximation error and the deck elements' span lengths. This iterative approach does not apply to slabs as it creates clustered areas and excludes symmetries. Analysis of principal stresses under different load cases shows that the most considerable difference from the primary load case is when half of the slab is loaded with a maximum load and half with a minimum load. (The primary load case is the condition used to create the stress lines for the rib geometry). Using FEA to calculate the stresses under each load case shows that uneven loading of the slab does not produce higher stresses than the primary load case. A functional isostatic timber slab design is made for the case study using laminated veneer lumber (LVL) for the ribs and plywood for the deck. Linear elastic FE modelling of the structure shows that increasing the deck thickness and decreasing the rib depth, causes the deck to carry more load and the ribs to carry less and vice versa. Increasing the rib thickness has a small effect on the force distribution due to the available LVL thicknesses. The FE modelling also showed that the torsional load transfer mechanisms are reduced by increasing the rib slenderness. The design is made based on the ultimate limit state (ULS) stress requirements for the elements and three critical connections, and the deflection under the serviceability limit state (SLS). The rib-to-deck joint requirements determine the deck thickness, and the deck has a low utilisation for the stress conditions, meaning that the deck span lengths are not critical. The ribs' depth is heavily dependent on the rib-to-rib moment connection as a large lever is needed. The cross-sectional properties of the ribs are also dependant on the standard LVL sizes. This system is compared to several conventional one-way spanning alternatives based on the total material volume, the structural weight, and the structural depth. The isostatic timber slab has a reduced volume and weight compared to a flat cross-laminated timber (CLT) slab, a Kerto-Ripa slab, and a concrete hollow-core slab; however, the isostatic timber slab has a larger structural depth. A ‘T’-beam equivalent to the two-way spanning isostatic slab has less volume and weight while maintaining the same structural depth, but has a larger average deflection. Timber isostatic slabs are complex to design with a highly connected network of parameters. The system should be designed by minimising the peak moment forces at connections, curating the support conditions to reduce stress line clustering, and selecting stress lines for the rib geometry which ensure sufficient stiffness at the peak deflection location. It is advised to produce a parametric model of the slab that can quickly assess the design performances and efficiently complete design cycles.","Timber; Isostatic Slabs; Optimisation; Principal Stress Lines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bosch-Rekveldt, M.G.C. (graduation committee); Davidse, Christine (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The increased complexity and changes in collaboration between involved actors in the realization of large infrastructure projects (LIP’s) cause major challenges. One of these challenges entails meeting stakeholders’ requirements through verification and validation (V&amp;V) during the design phase. Coordinating the design with the stakeholders can easily lead to delays or bad relationships. The V&amp;V process originates from systems engineering (SE) and it seems that an attempt is being made to reduce the complexity by performing the V&amp;V process in a systematic way. However, various researchers indicate that there is a need for interaction and it is doubted if this need for interaction is taken into account in this SE approach. The V&amp;V process half-heartedly relates to stakeholder management (SM) while they seem to be a good fit. It is expected that a successful performance of SM can fill this need for interaction in the complex environment of LIP’s. Therefore, this research sought an answer to the question: How can stakeholder management help to improve the verification and validation of the stakeholders’ requirements during the design phase of large infrastructure projects in the Netherlands? Through a literature study into SM, an evaluation tool is formulated consisting of four core values. These values are: setting goals together, assessing stakeholders, involving stakeholders in the decision-making, and continuously interacting with stakeholders. A case-study approach is used to allow a deeper understanding of the application of SM in relation to the V&amp;V process during the design phase in practice. Through semi-structured interviews, based on the evaluation tool, the perspectives of contractors, clients, and stakeholders on SM in relation to the V&amp;V process were investigated. Conclusively, the findings from the three cases were compared based on different themes to gain an understanding of the role SM plays in relation to the V&amp;V process. Setting goals together, appears to be truly important in relation to the V&amp;V process. Respondents believe that by setting goals together, parties involved become more aware of the underlying interests and concerns behind the requirements of the project and thus get a better picture of the purpose of the requirements. Consequently, it brings parties closer together from the start. Furthermore, continuously interacting with stakeholders during the process in an open way is important as this creates support among stakeholders. Through this, the contractor must discuss the progress of the design by reflecting on the overall picture and not only on the problems that arise. The stakeholders, but the client as well, find it very meaningful to be thoroughly informed about the reasoning behind the design choices of the contractor. This applies to involving stakeholders in the decision-making as well. The current way in which the stakeholders and the client actually participate in making decisions seems sufficient on condition that stakeholders and client are sufficiently informed about the motives of the contractor. In the context of the studied cases, assessing stakeholders does not appear to be important in the V&amp;V process of the design phase. This research has not identified a clear correlation between the performance of the V&amp;V process and a contractor or a client who is carrying out the SM related to the V&amp;V process, the degree of collaboration seems much more important. Both the contractor and the client have substantial resources that are required to coordinate the design with the stakeholders and they have a common interest in monitoring the contract. Therefore, it is the interest of both of them to enter into good collaboration in managing the stakeholders in relation to the V&amp;V process. The ambiguity of the V&amp;V process is recognized in practice as well, where the contractor and client struggle to find a more SE-driven approach or a more SM-driven approach. The context in which the process takes place determines which approach is more effective. There are several directions for further research. First of all, this research uses an evaluation tool based on research into SM focusing on LIP’s in general. Therefore, this research can be seen as an exploratory study into SM specifically aimed at the V&amp;V process. It is recommended to conduct follow-up research into further testing and specifying the evaluation tool. Furthermore, this research shows that there is a tension in the V&amp;V process regarding monitoring the contract. Further research into contract management in relation to the V&amp;V process is recommended as well. Based on the evaluation tool, this research has made recommendations for determining an SM strategy in relation to the V&amp;V process. Since every V&amp;V process takes place in a different context, no unambiguous advice can be given. However, this research has shown that setting goals together and continuously interacting with stakeholders are both very important for the performance of the V&amp;V process, regardless of the conditions of the process.","Stakeholder management; Verification and validation; Stakeholders","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) for rapid-prototyping, the 3D printed parts usually have a short life, generating a constant stream of waste material and lost value. This issue becomes more relevant in the early stages of product development, where 3D printed prototypes become rapidly obsolete due to design iterations and advances in the project. Polylactic Acid (PLA) is one of the most popular in early prototyping. As a result, prototyping facilities generate a constant waste stream of PLA from failed prints, support material and obsolete prints. A material stream that is currently not being reused, recycled or industrially biodegraded. This project investigated the opportunity of reusing this waste stream by recycling it back to FDM filament, closing the material loop in a prototyping facility context. First, insights from industry experts, prototyping users and state of the art were collected and an opportunity was identified in low-fidelity prototyping. Then, the production and low-fidelity printability of recycled PLA from 3D printing waste was tested. The printability results demonstrated that recycled PLA filament produced with a desktop recycling setup can be 3D printed, achieving similar low-fidelity prototyping capabilities for design projects as virgin material. The findings gathered in the research phase were converged into a future vision, a roadmap and a short-term solution to explore and facilitate its implementation. Additionally, a printing guide summarized the adjustments and recommended settings for future end-users and a design case study demonstrated its feasibility and implications on the design process in practice. The solution is evaluated by a prototyping facility and the recommendations for its implementation are outlined.","3D Printing; FDM; Sustainabilty; Recycling; PLA; Prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

With the use of laser surface treatments, effort has been made in order to obtain a heterogeneous material with a well defined architectured microstructure to optimize this trade-off. In the present study, it is investigated how the deformation behaviour of Martensite/Austenite steel microstructures in a Fe-25Ni-0.2C alloy can be tailored by the creation of patterned microstructures with localized laser treatment. Due to these treatments strong variations in microstructure are observed. Two different patterns are created (i) a dotted diagonal pattern and (ii) a dotted horizontal pattern which are both evaluated using as-quenched and tempered martensite as base material. The deformation behaviour of the patterned microstructures is investigated using both experiments and simulations. In the experimental approach characterization of the laser treated specimens is carried out using Optical Microscopy (OM) and micro-hardness measurements. The local deformation of the patterned microstructure is investigated using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). During deformation, strain partitioning is observed in the austenitic areas. In these areas mechanically induced martensitic transformation takes place, influencing the hardening of the material. The phase strength does not seem to influence the austenite stability in the analysed patterns, however it does show difference in hardness of the freshly formed martensite. For the simulation, Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Modelling (CPFEM) is used to describe the plastic deformation of the patterned material. Both the local and overall behaviour are investigated and validated with the experimentally obtained results. The simulation can serve as a tool to identify patterns which show promising deformation behaviour.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Product-service systems, such as leasing, sharing and pay-per-use models, are presented as a way to contribute to the circular economy. Product-service systems (PSS) could potentially reduce environmental impacts, however, PSS do not automatically lead to positive environmental impacts and not all PSS are by default environmentally benign. Therefore, several authors call for quantifications of PSS’ environmental impacts, because the benefits of PSS remain inexplicit in literature and are mostly qualitatively described. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a common method to evaluate the environmental impacts over a product’s lifecycle. LCAs compare the function that products or services fulfil over their entire life cycle and over various impact categories. As such, they provide an appropriate method to assess PSS’ environmental impacts.","LCA; Product-Service System; Pay-per-use; Washing machine; Environmental Impact Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Schulte Fischedick, Erik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In general, costs are an important aspect long before the construction of a civil project starts. In the conceptual phase, which is the first phase of a civil construction project, little cost information is available, and the cost estimate is at that stage of project development less accurate than when the project is almost completed. When a cost estimate is made with a conventional method, such as SSK, in the conceptual phase of a civil construction project, the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering, AACE, argues that the error of a cost estimate compared to the real price can be 15-50%. The lower accuracy in the conceptual phase is caused by several obstacles: a lack of estimating experience, lack of information, and a method that cannot calculate an accurate cost estimate. Besides, the conventional approach is time-consuming. Machine learning models can overcome these obstacles. This research is initiated by a practical problem within the company Witteveen+Bos. Witteveen+Bos uses a conventional approach for cost estimates and wants to improve the accuracy and calculation time of cost estimates of road bridges in the conceptual phase of a project. This research aims to improve the cost estimates of bridges in the conceptual phase of bridge projects by use of the machine learning model called FALCON. This model is already successful applied in the field of cost estimates for construction project types. Improvement that should be realized in the reduction of the calculation time from hours to minutes. Besides the research aims to reduce the maximum deviation of estimates for road bridge projects to 30%. The FALCON model is not the only model to solve an estimation problem. Standard models, suitable for estimation problems, are multiple linear regression, K nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees. The results show that the average absolute deviation is 34% for the KNN model, 36% for the decision tree regression model, 57% for the multiple linear regression model, and 24% for the FALCON model. All 4 models are able to calculate results within a couple of minutes. FALCON is the most accurate model The error of the individual predictions of the FALCON model roughly corresponds to the bandwidth of the AACE (15-50%) for the conceptual phase of a project. The validation of the FALCON model is realized through interviews with cost estimators of Witteveen+Bos. These interviews showed that the realized results meet the expectations of the interviewees. Besides, the interviewees are willing to implement the model in practice. In the end, it must be concluded that the FALCON model can calculate a cost estimate, of bridge projects in the conceptual phase, more quickly, and with a comparable accuracy level as with conventional methods that are used today. For future research, it is recommended to use a larger dataset that has less variation. The used dataset consists of 39 bridge projects. Besides, it is recommended to use international standards for data structuring instead of national standards.","FALCON; Artificial Intelligence; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Especially in the Netherlands the regulatory regime constantly changes and increases the applicability of novel materials from MSWI in construction. Due to the Green Deal a step was taken to ban the former IBC-quality and prescribes the immobilisation or treatment into freely applicable bottom ash that is said to have the highest value. Connected to these regime changes, values about sustainability and risk of the bottom ash materials are regularly changing. In order to provide insights for informed decision making on novel solutions for bottom ash, this study was subject to examine expert’s subjective opinions about sustainability and risk of freely applicable bottom ash. Q-methodology has been chosen as qualitative and quantitative method as it can derive interesting insights in the debate on MSWI bottom ash, without making conjecture of any industrial perspectives. The established framework consists of 44 statements about sustainability aspects such as the circular economy, the role of Waste to Energy, Climate resilience and certification as well as risk aspects like leaching, chain risks, the application for the circular economy and project complexity. The participant sample consists of 15 experts from the construction and built environment, waste management and consultancy. The results present 4 perspectives that distinguish each other by the attitude towards the Green Deal and the role of Waste-to-Energy in the Circular Economy. While the freely applicable quality is widely approved for reductions of the leaching potential, the regulation does not yet sufficiently cover new risks arising from the free application potential for precautious experts. Furthermore, it should be taken into account in decision making that the communication about freely applicable bottom ash is subject to multiple inherent biases.","MSWI BA; bottom ash; Q-methodology; Q-sorting; freely applicable; Green Deal; decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The design is a continuation of the development of a laparoscopic gripper that can be 3D printed in plastic. Laparoscopic grippers 3D printed solely out of metal have not yet been presented. Laparoscopic instruments are limited in width to 5 mm, which is bordering the manufacturing limits of selective laser melting 3D printing. The use of 3D printing for medical instruments has the potential to customise instruments specific to patient, procedure, and surgeon. Metal 3D printing can produce complex parts, albeit with a high surface roughness. Post-processing is required to reduce the surface roughness. Mass finishing techniques are a group of mechanical polishing techniques, of which centrifugal disc finishing was selected due to its capability to process parts in bulk without requiring workpiece fixation. To synthesise a suitable design, the processes of printing and polishing were analysed to formulate design guidelines. The analyses were part literature study, part experimental study. The experimental study had the aim to quantify and supplement the guidelines found in handbooks and articles. Using a novel visualisation technique, the polishing of different geometries could be distilled into quantitative design considerations. Here, a marking lacquer was applied to the surface of workpieces, which remained on unpolished surfaces. In this experiment a number of features were used, which corresponded to aspects that had potential to be used in the design. The use of channels was deemed unviable for polishing at the scale of laparoscopic instruments, which required the removal of these from the design. Mass finishing polishing removed the coarse surface structure present on metal produced with 3D printing, and brought surfaces of the test pieces to 0.05 mm below their desired width. Application of the design guidelines to the laparoscopic instrument was focused on making printing and polishing compatible joints. The laparoscopic gripper has two degrees of freedom for increased manoeuvrability. The features that comprise the joint are protrusions and cut-outs, sinusoidal gear arches, and actuation cable guides. Each of these features were dimensioned with values from the guidelines. The joint design required a number of components to be split so polishing access could be guaranteed, specifically for the cable guides. This had the added benefit of having each part be orientated during printing individually. The final design is based on application of the relevant design guidelines, and has been validated using scale models for mechanical stability.","3D Printing; mass finishing techniques; Metal Additive Manufacturing; Laparoscopic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van Nederveen, Sander (graduation committee); Mochawer, Shahnam (graduation committee); Goosens, Michiel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","One of the cornerstones of construction project delivery is contract management. It can be directly related to business and project performance (Muhammad et al., 2019). Nevertheless, contracts and contract management have proven to be a complex and risky undertaking. It has been named as one of the main causes of conflict in the construction sector (Jaffar et al., 2011). To mitigate these problems, information systems have been implemented in contract management. Nevertheless, these systems are not fully delivering on their promises. Evidence that overall costs were reduced or an improvement in project performance is very limited (Zhai et al., 2009), and contemporary information systems have often failed to realize their goals (Mutschler et al., 2008). These developments indicate that the implementation process needs optimization. Preliminary research identified two socio-technical theories that are useful for analyzing human-system interactions during the implementation and use of information systems. Activity theory provides the framework for the analysis of human-system interaction. At the same time, boundary objects seem to be involved when multiple specialists transfer knowledge through the use of objects. Information systems are highly involved in this process. Therefore, boundary objects are also included as a focus of this research. These two theories should provide a new perspective on the challenges concerning contract management information systems. This analysis brought a few bad practices to light: •Support for the system users was severely lacking •Wrong tactics were used to incentivize system use •Responsibilities were unclear, and accessibility of necessary knowledge was limited •Solutions were often late and ineffective or only partly effective •Turnkey solutions rarely functioned as desired •Boundary objects are often not handled correctly Generally, the implementation process was characterized as unstructured and reactive. Next, these lessons learned were applied to create a set of recommendations that should improve current practices. The first set of recommendations was aimed at creating the right information system. The creation of a development team is key in facilitating this process. By sharing responsibility over multiple specialists under the guidance of a system coordinator, the information systems can be correctly created. Next, Including feedback from users, keeping the system as simple as possible, and using proper specifications make sure the information system is fit for purpose. The second set of recommendations cover the realization of the requirements for the correct supporting infrastructure for the information system. This consists of the introduction of a few new roles under the support team and some supporting tools to align the supporting structures with the users. This supporting infrastructure requires the introduction of system ambassadors, a system developer, a system coordinator, and a trainer. The necessary supporting mechanisms are two-stage training, system meetings, clear and targeted manuals, and rules, and finally, the securing of common interpretations. Finally, to make the recommendations more usable, they were transformed into the tool-support implementation (TSI) roadmap. This roadmap transforms the recommendations into a two-phase strategy that managers can apply in their projects. The first phase ensures the right conditions to build the correct information system. Consequently, the second ensures the right conditions to create the right supporting structures. Following this roadmap should ensure the proper creation and implementation of a contract management information system. Finally, to bring these conclusions back to the starting point, the following answer to the main research question is provided. Contract management can indeed be improved with an analysis of the implementation process based on socio-technical perspectives. The application of this new perspective brought a new set of problems concerning the implementation of contract management information systems to light. By showing what went wrong, changes could be recommended in order to improve current practices. Therefore, the importance of these challenges lies in the fact they need to be addressed to gain the benefits that information systems are supposed to have. To realize this goal of the research, the recommendations, and tool-support implementation roadmap have been constructed. When these recommendations are applied by using the TSI roadmap, the presumed benefits of information systems should finally be unlocked. As a result of these benefits, current contract management practices are likely to be improved.","Contract management; BIM; information systems; activity theory; boundary objects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-02-11","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

While interventions exist to treataltered structures, the selection of the most suitable treatment is verycomplex with highly variable outcomes. Musculoskeletal models have thepotential to support clinical decision making. However, a known limitation isthe translation of altered muscle-tendon parameters into musculoskeletalmodels. The aim of this study was to estimate the intrinsic calf musclesproperties using neuromuscular simulations of a passive ankle rotation intypically developing children and children with CP. With these simulations wedetermine to what extent optimal fiber length, tendon slack length, stiffness,and strain differ between typically developing (TD) children and CP children.  Methods: Experimental data was collected onthirteen children with spastic CP (6 diplegia, 7 hemiplegia, age 11.6 ± 3.1years) and 17 TD children (age 10.4 ± 3.3 years) during a slow passive anklerotation. Ankle angle, external forces applied on the ankle, and medialgastrocnemius fascicle length were measured. An OpenSim model with four musclesaround the ankle, GASM, GASL, SOL, and TA, was used to simulate passive anklerotation experiments. Optimal fiber length, tendon slack length, stiffness atlow force, strain at zero force, and strain at maximum force were optimized tomatch the measured ankle moment-angle curves and the GASM fascicle length-anglecurves.  Results: The ankle moment-anglecurves could be successfully matched in both CP and TD (RMSE &lt; 0.42 Nm) byoptimizing individual calf muscle-tendon parameters. The fascicle length-anglecurves could be predicted much better in CP children by optimization, howeverrelatively large residuals remained (RMSE 0.40 cm). These simulations revealthat children with CP have a shorter normalized optimal fiber length and alonger triceps surae normalized tendon slack length compared to TD children.Also, CP triceps surae was found to be stiffer and undergoes less fasciclestrain compared to TD children. Further, the triceps surae passive fiberforce-length curve in CP children is engaged at shorter fiber lengths whencompared to that of TD children.  Conclusion:Simulations show that intrinsic calf muscle-tendon properties aresystematically different between CP and TD children. However, large variancesin fascicle lengthening muscle-tendon parameters in CP children exist. Futureresearch should attempt to better match groups in terms of age, height, andweight.

This thesis presents an effort to develop a theoretical framework that can be used to analyse the barriers hindering the Aquaponics as an emerging value-conscious socio-technical system in the Netherlands. The barriers are identified in institutional, technical, economic, infrastructural, knowledge, socio-cultural, ethical and biophysical dimensions. In the research, the initial barrier criteria theoretical framework was established based on combining Functions of innovation system, Circular economy theoretical models in the Verhulst (2017) theoretical framework with ethical barriers based on Value Sensitive and Value Conscious Design approach. This primary theoretical framework Piptová 1 (2018) was applied to the current Aquaponics case in the process of desk research and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. This resulted in a list and description of barriers. The high initial investment costs, scalability issues due to the niche character of the market for Aquaponics products, cold climate in the Netherlands, current non profitability due to incumbent infrastructure of cheap vegetables supplied by elaborate Dutch horticulturalists from their greenhouses and cost-effectively imported fish, biophysical limitations as well as several ethical barriers in the form of value tensions and values not represented by a value advocate in the Aquaponics discourse were identified as the barriers hindering the Aquaponics as an emerging value-conscious socio-technical system in the Netherlands. Based on the list and description of barriers, the primary theoretical framework was revised and adapted by adding and removing indicators. The final theoretical framework Piptová 2.0 (2020) was established. It reflects on the malfunctions, ethics and risks of new technologies but also democratisation in the design process and science in general through an ecocentric prism due to the fact that it contains a consideration for all directly and indirectly affected stakeholders, whether presented or not by an actor, including the non-human ones. Via employing the fundamental capabilities of the created framework and adapting it in order to be able to detect a wider horizon of developmental bottlenecks from the systemic Industrial ecology perspective, a novel generally applicable theoretical framework was also created.

(graduation committee); Meeuws, Pim (mentor); Duvekot, Heerema (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A large number of light, modular topsides in the southern North Sea is planned to be removed in the near future. Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is currently not the most competitive in this market as smaller contractors can often provide cheaper removal solutions with the use of smaller heavy lift vessels. HMC therefore aims to find a more economically attractive solution for the removal of these topsides. Within HMC, a concept has been proposed to remove these modular topsides using so­called lift beams. The lift beams are large beams that are installed underneath the topsides, and are connected to the topsides’ strong points. The ends of the lift beams provide lift points for the complete topsides, enabling removal in a single lift. Due to their high lifting capacity, and large available deck space, the modular topsides on the lift beams can easily be lifted by a single crane of one of the company’s semisubmersible crane vessels (SSCV). Performing the lift by a single crane allows to put the topsides on deck of the SSCV for transportation. The concept is intended to be reused for a variety of modular topsides in the southern North Sea. In this thesis, the lift beams are designed, and optimised, to withstand the governing load cases, while complying with the practical boundaries that each topsides imposes. Hereafter, it is investigated whether it is structurally feasible to lift the modular topsides using the lift beams. To determine this, structural integrity analyses are performed on a reference topsides using FEM software. Hereby the optimal lift beam setup to lift the topsides is determined. Furthermore, methods are designed for the connection between the lift beams and the topsides, and the installation of the lift beams.The efficiency of the final lift beams concept design is assessed by comparing its performance to conventional removal methods for modular topsides. The lift beams are designed as stiffened box profile beams with a weight of more than 250 mT. The topsides is found to have sufficient capacity to withstand the loads during lifting. The optimal setup to lift the topsides consists of two lift beams per jacket leg row, and cross­beams at each end­on side of the lift beams. The cross­beams add stiffness to the lift beams and thereby redistribute the lift loads in a favourable manner over the connection points. Using a pin­hole connection between the lift beams and the topsides’ legs is found to be most suitable. The lift beams are installed one­by­one using water as the counterweight component. Compared to conventional removal methods, the lift beams concept appears to be profitable after a relatively small number of topsides removals. For future research, it is recommended to investigate the possibilities of performing the lift beams concept with a dual crane lift. It is expected that the practicality of the removal process can be improved in this manner. The increased lifting capacity also allows for removal of wider range of modular topsides. After lifting off its substructure, the topsides could be transported while suspended in the cranes. Furthermore, it is recommended to extend the structural integrity analyses to the other topsides of interest. The structural limitations of the other topsides can be investigated, and the possibility to apply one­sided leg support can be considered. The weight and costs of the lift frame, as well as the installation procedure can be improved this way.","Topsides decommissioning; Single lift; Modular Topsides; Lift beams; Steel design; Structural integrity; SSCV; Connection concept design; Installation concept design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-02-10","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Pabst, Martin (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The presence of harmful pollutants and toxic pathogens in water is a risk to both living beings and the environment. Water treatment plays a crucial role in the removal of these contaminants through different stages of filtration. Among the existing pollutants, a family of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) escapes from all treatment methods and ends up in our food, water and, finally, in our blood. Current treatment methods are not effective due to their inability to break the strong C-F bonds in PFAS. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are the most widely studied PFAS due to their widespread contamination of various environmental and biological matrices. Due to the global ban of PFOA, a short-chain fluorinated compound named GenX (the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid) is currently used as an alternative. However, recent studies have shown that GenX has higher toxicity compared to PFOA and is more easily soluble in water, thus making it more difficult for removal. Hence, this research surveys the potential of using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes, which are known to have the largest potential window and high stability over time, for GenX degradation. During the electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP), the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH•) produced at the BDD surface break the C-F bonds to form fluoride (Fˉ) and CO2 products. Till date, very limited research is reported on the GenX degradation and they present a contradiction on the effect of sulfate radicals (SO4•ˉ), considered for their high redox potential, in the GenX degradation. In the present study, we investigate the degradation and defluorination efficiency of GenX using boron-doped diamond anodes in EAOP. This study aims to elucidate the first step in the degradation mechanism of GenX and to clarify the contradictions previously reported on the role of sulfate radicals. Experiments are performed separately with sodium sulfate and sodium perchlorate to assess the effect of SO4•ˉ. The results demonstrate that sulfate radicals are ineffective in GenX degradation due to the steric hindrance by the -CF3 branch which blocks the trajectory of SO4•ˉ for electron transfer reaction. The effects of electrolyte concentration, current density, and chloride radicals on the degradation and defluorination are investigated for the first time to provide in-depth understanding of the degradation mechanism. A possible degradation pathway is proposed by determination of the intermediate products using mass spectrometry. From the proposed pathway, it is inferred that GenX completely mineralizes to CO2 and Fˉ via formation of three intermediates. By comparing the electrochemical degradation of GenX with that of PFOA, it is observed that the presence of the -CF3 branch increases the complexity of electron transfer in the GenX degradation even though the mineralization rate is faster for GenX than for PFOA due to lesser number of intermediates. Hence, the direct electron transfer from GenX to the BDD anode is observed to be the rate-determining step in the GenX degradation. Additionally, by comparing different BDD anodes based on their material properties and surface morphology, it is observed that the presence of sp2 regions which act as active sites for effective electron transfer is necessary to initiate the GenX degradation mechanism. Electrochemical degradation of GenX using the BDD anodes has resulted in the complete mineralization to CO2 and Fˉ which supports EAOP using BDD anodes as a promising approach towards effective PFAS degradation.<br","Boron-doped diamond; Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA); GenX; Electro-chemical oxidation; Hydroxyl radicals; Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-10","","","","","",""

Electrical energy from these renewable energies are more difficult to store than fossil fuels. Transportation and feedstock for industries can also not always be supplied through electricity. Here, hydrogen has the potential to be a good alternative, clean energy source. However, hydrogen is currently either not produced in a renewable manner (grey hydrogen), or renewable but too expensive (green hydrogen). Grey hydrogen is less expensive at a cost of around 1.50 €/kg, while green hydrogen has a cost of 2.50 - 5.00 €/kg. A new method to produce green hydrogen at a lower cost is the hydrogen turbine developed by HYGRO. This method uses an integrated electrolyser system in an existing wind turbine to produce green hydrogen and has the potential to drop the cost of green hydrogen to a more competitive level. Since this new method changes design questions of the wind turbine, a potential increase in specific power, along with a decrease in cost of hydrogen (expressed in levelised cost of hydrogen, or LCoH) is expected. In order to research these effects, this thesis investigated the effects of an increased specific power on the cost of the components of the turbine and its design, as well as the amount of hydrogen it was able to produce. This investigation was done through a model along with a case study to determine the results for a specific case. The increase in specific power was achieved by increasing the power rating of the turbine, but maintaining a constant rotor radius and maximal rotor speed. The case study performed investigates the effects based on a 15 MW reference turbine, which has a specific power of 331 W/m2. Its power rating was increased from 15 MW up to 35 MW and the resulting costs and production amount were compared to determine an optimal point were the resulting LCoH would be lowest. The result of the case study suggests that if the 15 MW reference turbine was converted to a hydrogen turbine, the optimal power rating would be in the range of 25-30 MW, where an LCoH of around 1.69 €/kg was achieved. These power ratings are equal to a specific power range of 553 - 663 W/m2 or 66 - 100 % higher than the reference. Through an error analysis, the results were validated and determined to have a reasonable degree of certainty. The main component of the model that could be improved upon to increase its robustness is the wake loss model, which was not precisely modelled but does have a significant effect on the results.<br/>The increase in specific power suggests that hydrogen turbines have the potential to perform at higher power ratings than the wind turbine it is based on. This would allow the green hydrogen cost to drop significantly, down to a value were it is nearly competitive with grey hydrogen.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-10","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The effects of traffic conditions and geofence size on control behaviour, safety, efficiency and interface usage were investigated in a human-in-the-loop experiment with active tower and air traffic controllers. Results show that geofences are considered a useful tool in maintaining safety, that larger geofences significantly increase average traffic separation and that the effect on efficiency differs per traffic scenario. Performance could be improved by increasing transparency and predictability of UAV routing, for example by optimising the geofence structure around the runway and by more clearly presenting high-level UAV information to the controller. Further work is needed to investigate controller behaviour and performance in an environment with control over both UAV and manned traffic, considering the temporal aspect of geofences, as well as a broader range of UAV missions and capabilities.","UAVs; U-space; Geofences; Tower Control; Ecological Interface Design; Human Control Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The use of natural processes to modify the engineeringproperties of the subsurface could help to develop cost-­effective, robust andsustainable engineering technologies and is attracting increasing attentionfrom the industry (Zhou, 2020). This research aims to reduce the permeabilityby using aluminium (Al) and organic matter (OM) precipitates mixed ex­-situwith porous media to create a horizontal barrier. The Al­-OM precipitates wereexpected to clog the pore space with a reduction in permeability and hydraulicconductivity as result. To find out if it is feasible to use Al­-OMprecipitates mixed ex­-situ with porous media for a permeability reductivelayer, the Al­-OM precipitates and the permeability of the medium wereresearched.  To characterise the flocculation reaction, experiments onthe flocculation were performed. The yield of the reaction was obtained byadding certain amounts of Al and OM solutions to form particular amounts of drymass of flocs. This experiment confirmed the hypothesis that 85% of the addedmass of OM will result in dry mass of flocs. The concept of a critical metal tocarbon ratio (M/C­-ratio), indicating flocculation regardless of the inputconcentrations, was tested by measuring the pH over an increasing M/C-­ratio.From this titration curve, the found critical M/C ratio is between 0.023­0.031,and the pH stabilises at a level lower than pH 4. This result proves theconcept behind the numerical scenarios describing the titration of OM solutionswith Al3+, with a critical molar M/C ratio independent of the inputconcentrations (Veerkamp, 2018; Zhou, 2020). After determining the yield of thereaction and concluding that the concentration of Al and OM was not ofinfluence, the by-products of the Al­-OM reaction were quantified. The ionicstrength of the supernatant of an increasing density of flocs in solution wasdetermined by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). The results showedthat the ionic strength increased linearly with an increasing density of flocs.The relationship between the ionic strength and the density of flocs was coupledto the linear relationship between concentrations potassium chloride (KCl) andits EC. From the results, the measured EC can be used as a tracer since the K+and Cl­ are non­reactive.  The hydraulic conductivity measurements were conducted by afalling head test to be able to make an indication of the change inpermeability when adding the Al­-OM precipitates to the sand. To find theoptimal method to mix the Al, OM and porous media, the influence of differentmethods of producing, adding and mixing the materials on the permeabilityreduction is explored. In the first mixing method, the Al and OM were added insolution, the solution containing Al-­OM precipitates was centrifuged until thereduced ionic strength was at an EC value less than 700 µm/cm. The hydraulicconductivity measurements were used to obtain the relationship between thehydraulic conductivity reduction over an increasing concentration of flocsretained by one kilogram of sand. The hydraulic conductivity was reducedexponentially over an increasing concentration of flocs up to a magnitude of 3.The results imply a large variability in the achieved reduction dominated bythe amount of retained flocs. The second method is using Al and OM in powderformat and adding them to the dry sand and adding 500 ml of water to thismixture. This mixing method resulted in a completely different floc structure.The flocs produced by mixing in solution have a shear dependency feature, whiledry mixing created particles that have a constant size. For this method, theincrease of the reduction is linear over an increase of concentration of flocsretained by the soil. The highest reduction for this method was found to be ofa magnitude of two, measured at 50 grams of flocs retained by one kilogram ofsand. Finally, this research gave proof of principle of using Al­-OMprecipitates mixed directly with sand could reduce the permeability up to amagnitude of 3. These results present a new road to research on this Al-­OM­-sandmixture’s strength parameters and compaction over time over an increasing flocdensity, since these parameters are critical for using the layer in practice.  ","SoSEAL; Permeability Reduction; Hydraulic Conductivity; Hydraulic conductivity reduction; Al-OM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","SoSEAL",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In Ethiopia, rainfall variability and changes in rainfall patterns, induced by climate change, could increase the frequency and occurrence of floods and droughts. Due to smallholder farmers in the Gumera sub-basin, Ethiopia, mostly relying on rainfed agriculture, climatic changes highly influence the agricultural production with corresponding negative effects on food security and their economic well-being. To reduce their vulnerability to climate variability, the majority of smallholder farmers take up adaptation strategies, whereas a small group of farmers does not have the capacity to adapt. However, the understanding of what factors drive the climate adaptive capacity of farmers and how climate adaptive behaviour influences a farmer’s economic well-being is limited. Therefore, via a bottom-up approach, this study aims to determine what factors drive the climate adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers in the Gumera sub-basin and how they adapt to climate variability. Focus Group Discussions are conducted prior to an individual household survey to obtain local-level knowledge and data on the characteristics of smallholder farmers. Subsequently, this data is used to develop a methodology to incorporate the climate adaptive behaviour of smallholder farmers in socio-hydrological modelling. By implementing a logit model, the (dynamic) adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers is implemented, which provides the opportunity to create a better understanding of why farmers adapt to climate variability and its impact on their economic well-being. From the Focus Group Discussions and the individual household survey it is observed that the majority of farmers adapt to climate variability in case of a bad year, defined as a drought, by changing to a short cycle crop, mostly potato, and adjusting the planting and harvesting dates. The drivers that are found to mainly influence the uptake of these adaptation strategies are farm size, altitude, level of education, the number of livestock owned, capital, experience, access to a weather forecast, and labour availability. A small group of farmers does not take up adaptation strategies instead. First of all, their adaptive capacity is constrained by a lack of land, labour, and a weather forecast. Secondly, the rather optimistic perception of non-adapting farmers towards climate change seems to limit their adaptive capacity. Thirdly, especially the limited use of the onset of rains by non-adapting farmers was observed to negatively influence their climate adaptive capacity. Incorporating the climate adaptive behaviour of smallholder farmers in socio-hydrological modelling by enabling a logit model showed to be a successful approach. Based on the main drivers for the climate adaptive capacity, the model is able to simulate the agricultural practices with respect to climate variability. As such, the model has shown to be able to simulate agricultural practices that better coincide with what is observed during both the Focus Group Discussions and the household survey. In addition, the methodology used to evaluate the long-term effect of climate adaptation on the economic well-being of a farmer has the potential to help in creating a better understanding of why farmers adapt to climate variability. <br","Small-holder farmers; Climate adaptive capacity; Socio-hydrological model; Ethiopia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11.768623, 37.787051"

The results of the analysis of the city of Brussels show above all the diversity of the city. The city can be seen as a fragmented, heterogeneous and superimposed space of differences, complexity and problems, but also as an opportunity and place of appropriation. The city is therefore the subject of attention and observation. By using the method of making a section through the city, it can be seen that the east-west connection through the city brings together politically important institutions, cultural facilities and public spaces, but is separated by certain obstacles (boundary), such as streets, topography or the canal. These different demonstrations of power can be seen throughout the city; from the ornamental town hall on the Grand Place to the transparent monoliths of the European Quarter, these buildings are theatrical yet tired and seem to actively distance themselves from their citizens. However, it has become clear that public spaces in the city centre extend around the chosen site (pedestrian zone - ground floor). I would like to link these public spaces further and consolidate them as a place of expression for the citizens. Instead of taking public space, I would like to give the citizens space to participate in political and democratic events. It is clear in Brussels that the willingness of citizens to participate is high and that they articulate this. The possibility of gathering in public spaces reveals to citizens a sense of power through the crowd. There is an awareness of power within the amount of people.‘Like a Greek agora, the city must reassert its most ancient function as a place where people come together face-to-face.’ City: Rediscovering the Center by William H. Whyte (Author), Paco Underhill (Foreword); University of Pennsylvania Press; Reissue edition (September 22, 2009)But what is a political space and how does it express itself? Can we find this political space in everyday life? In my work I take the stairs as a political space. It is not so much the polarity of start and end that is recorded in this difference in level, but rather the tension between rise and fall, light and shadow, gravity and levitation, mind and body. The stairs are a primary motif of social interaction. A space that is constantly in motion due to the purpose of movement. This political space is especially intended to address the idea of being in between._Concept and Design__Site &amp; ProgrammeThe location is in the city centre. In the past, it was also occupied by an architecture that was intended to serve the population. However, as a public institution: market, event location and parking garage. The starting point of the project is the new centre of the city administration, the so-called BRUCITY, where the Brussels city administration is centralised. It is a project under construction. I see the resulting building as a provocation to investigate the nature of civic architecture in relation to public space and democracy. I set myself the task of designing a building that occupies less public space and thus creates a place to meet and pause in front of the building. The building will be the workplace for civil servants and at the same time the interface between them and the citizens of the city. The above ground floors will serve as workplaces for different departments of the city administration. The underground floors will house the municipal archives and the Council Chamber. While the meetings are often closed to the general public, the Council will be visible to the citizens from the street. The building will be accessible from different directions, and will initially lead everyone through a public space. There you will have the possibility to get orientation, information and if necessary to register. A public staircase with different framed views of the city and into the building will guide the person or group of persons through the building. On the top floor, the citizens will be offered a room with different and individual possibilities of use, as well as for meetings and events. It leads to a belvedere and opens up a clear view over the city. The citizen stands on the roof and sees the own city surrounding oneself.The new urban configuration will be a place of connection between people, but also of political and cultural exchange. Not only can we make demands on democracy, we must allow ourselves to be demanded.","Brussels; City Hall; Democracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

The aim is to generate high-fidelity junction flow data to be used in a data-driven turbulence modelling approach, specifically to improve the accuracy of RANS-simulations in junction flows. The simulation is performed on a 61.5 million C-grid body fitted mesh in the pimpleFoam solver of OpenFOAM, with a turbulent channel flow precursor providing the unsteady inlet boundary condition. Analysis of the wall-resolved LES shows that the simulation accurately captures the complex flow phenomena in the wing-body junction flow including intermittency for the present inflow condition. Comparisons of the wall-resolved LES with a coarse-grid RANS simulation and the wall-modelled LES of Srikumar [2019] show that the wall-resolved LES in the present study is an improvement over the other two numerical methods. Most notably, an improvement in terms of the prediction of the location and magnitude of the mean spanwise vorticity and the mean turbulent kinetic energy of the horseshoe vortex systems was observed. Especially the RANS-simulation was unable to accurately capture the complex flow physics in the junction due to the limitations of RANS-methods, which are unable to accurately capture Reynolds stress anisotropy due to the Boussinesq hypothesis. An analysis of the high-fidelity junction flow data was performed to indicate regions where the Boussinesq hypothesis breaks down. The most notable region where the Boussinesq hypothesis was found to be not valid, was the region in close proximity to the wing-body junction upstream of the wing.

Carrier-phase ambiguities are assumed constant over time. Two different variance models are used, one obtains variance as a function of satellite elevation, and the other obtains variance as a function of carrier-to-noise density ratio as estimated by the receiver. The elevation based variance model was used in the original RT-SF-PPP algorithm, and adapted to include Doppler measurements. The carrier-to-noise density ratio based variance model components are estimated from double difference (DD) observation combinations using measurements obtained from a shortbaseline experiment with two receivers setup over multiple days. Two velocity observables are used and related to velocity and clock drift through the extended functional model of the original algorithm: the receiver generated Doppler and a time-derivative of the carrier-phase observable: the time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP). Algorithmic performance is evaluated by the horizontal RMSE, which represents accuracy as the variance plus bias squared, precision and reliability. This was validated using three different experiments: a stationary receiver on top of a roof, a buoy freely adrift in the North Sea, and a receiver mounted on a car driving a regional road. It was found that in terms of position in the static experiment and under calm water conditions during the drifting buoy experiment the horizontal RMSE was between 0.429 and 0.530 [m], and under rough water conditions and a road partly flanked by fences and trees between 0.682 and 0.812 [m]. Furthermore in terms of velocity it was found that the TDCP observable in combination with the carrier-to-noise density based variance model has a horizontal RMSE between 0.014 and 0.068 [m/s] over all experiments, and using the Doppler observable with either variance model a RMSE between 0.033 and 0.122 [m/s]. The algorithm was even found by means of external reliability to be capable of detecting faults at the boundary of 0.5 [m] for position and 0.1 [m/s] for velocity in the TDCP observable case.","GNSS; PPP; Velocity estimation; Drifter; Buoy; Currents; Geodesy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.10799121631562, 4.253567236008856"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To deal with increasing complexity and connectivity of socio-technical systems it becomes unlikely for individuals to be able to oversee all possible changes. These systems are riddled with a plurality of actors with differing interests, disciplines, institutions and ecological limitations. Examples of systems like these are energy and gas grids. If one wants to tackle problems on these systems one would ideally understand possible results of changing things in these systems as a change in one part of the system can lead to results in other subsystems. If a tree falls down on an energy pole, for example, chemical plants can stop functioning. This in turn can cause orders to be late, influencing a whole production chain.<br/>To this end one would ideally one would ideally apply systems thinking: ”Systems thinking is a set of synergistic analytic skills used to improve the capability of identifying and understanding systems, predicting their behaviors, and devising modifications to them in order to produce desired effects. These skills work together as a system.”<br/>However, because the earlier pluralities it unlikely for a single individual or organisation to have all the required information for this. Processes are required where information is collected and co-created with multiple parties in such as system to enable the creation of comprehensive solutions for these problems. What is required is social learning. Social learning (SL)is learning that happens by people participating in so called communities of practice. A community of practice can be seen as a group of people with converging interests and skills. An example would be a grid operator, which have their own sub-communities (E.G. cable technician or systems manager). They can be smaller groups, E.G. a family, and participation is often not mutually exclusive. Rather than being part of a community of practice one could be seen as being part of the landscape of practice, consisting out of multiple communities. By partaking in these communities people gain experiences by both learning and expanding on a communities’ knowledge.<br/>The aim of this thesis is to gain insights into: 1. mechanics shaping and steering social learning 2. how to measure social learning processes for in vivo experimentation 3. design mechanics for participatory modelling processes and Social learning in general to improve development of such processes <br/>To do this a theory has been made on the mechanics and behaviour of individuals in a SL process. This has been done in chapters 4, 5 and 6. To do this a PM perspective has been used as this give a structure on the actions someone can take and requires shared information to be structured. Additionally it is seen as a useful tool for tackling socio-technical problems.<br/>The theory thus focussed on the main action of PM, namely sending information, receiving and processing information and deciding upon the model. To develop the theory knowledge from multiple disciplines is needed. To this end a theory has been developed using supersynthesis. This is a research method where multiple theories are combined to make a new on to explain something. The aim is not to supersed the combined theories, but to explain something new. The fields that have been the focus are communication science, helping understand how information is processed and sent, and social psychology, helping understand why and when individuals take certain actions. The theories have been synthesised in two rounds of conceptualisation, with the first focussing on conceptualising every possible action and mechanic. The ones that were deemed most interesting or useful have been conceptualised more in depth. To this an additional conceptualisation of knowledge and information is made. The final theory is as follows:<br/>Knowledge takes the shape of a knowledge graph. In this graph fields of expertise are called topics. One can think about the weather as such a topic. These topics consist out of information items, think cloudiness or temperature, and links between these items indicating their relation, think cloudiness leads to lower temperatures. These items may have links to items from other topics. For example cloudiness is related to sun hours and yields of Photovoltaics from th topic of Photovoltaics.<br/>It is assumed that a complete knowledge graph exists. Each individual knows part of this graph, signifying knowledge or expertise in the topic. The larger part of a topic they know the more expertise they have in that topic. This includes both information items as their links (relationships). All these items, links and topics also have a perceived relevance for people. This is based on interests or affiliation. Affiliation means relationship with a group of people, for example, meteorologists. Something is also seen as more relevant if it is discussed often, attributed to common knowledge effects. In a social learning process there are several individuals. Each round they are able to share information. Information is seen as information items and/or their links. A topic as a whole can also be discussed, but this is not seen as actual information for learning. What they share is based on the amount of energy they have and are willing to spend on sharing information. This is dependent on perceived relevance of the item they are considering to share, their expertise on the related topic and their tiredness. It is assumed that the energy one has decays over rounds.<br/>Shared energy is received by others and they start to process it. Here something is integrated or learned if they are able or willing to invest enough energy in the processing. This is dependent on their expertise of the related topic, their perceived relevance of what is shared and their attitude with regards to the sender. If expertise, relevance and attitudes are high enough someone will process and integrate information. Processing energy is also assumed to decay each round.<br/>In addition to information on knowledge, individuals can also share relational information. These are details like hobbies and other personal details. These are processed as either positive or negative and influence attitudes.<br/>Processing of shared information may also happen during breaks or downtime. Here one has more energy to spend and attitudes are less relevant. Total recall of information is assumed in the whole model (I.E. people do not forget anything).<br/>To allow for further reflection on the theory and to act as a proof of concept of the theory the theory has been translated into an agent based simulation model. This model has been analysed in a sensitivity experiment using LHS and extremely randomised forest in addition to a variety of plotting techniques in R. <br/>Additionally two experiments are designed, inspired by real cases. These are used to reflect on the theory and find less noticeable quirks from the ABM. <br/>Based on the theory and ABM the following things have been concluded:  -While communication science theories and social psychology theories have been used for theory development, they are not a be all end all. One can apply other fields if one wants. This specific combination, however works especially well for an individual perspective.-The theory can be used to reflect on SL by practitioners as it tells why and how people can act. Furthermore the idea of the knowledge graph can be connected to landscapes of practice, with topics relating to a community and links between items of these topics to those of other relating places where boundaries interact -Matters like conflict and increasing conflict, coalitions, personal inhibitions and norms are some of the values that would make sense to include in the theory. This would make the theory less usable for simulation modelling, however and would add a lot of behaviour that is not directly related to the learning process. To implement these additional behaviour could be conceptualised and added, making the theory more complete but less comprehensive. The most important addition that could be made according to me would be an extension on the actions influencing attitudes and the actual definition of a process result (a participatory built model or a plan). -This new theory is valuable as this individual based perspective has not been taken before, inviting to reflection on practice.-The knowledge graph could be used as a means for building new theories that are comparable. Additionally it is a way to explicitly learning. -The combination between social learning and Participatory modelling has not been made this explicit before. It would allow participatory modellers to reflect on their practice.-The ideas of energy for sharing and processing are quite influential in the ABM. They are interesting as they give clear reasons why learning may not happen or happen suboptimally. For learning to happen information need to be shared. If people lack the energy or the willingness to spend energy sharing will not happen. If they do not have the energy to process this they will also fail to learn. This highlights the need for keeping energy levels in mind when designing these processes. It is assumed that these energy levels decay linearly. While arguably too simplistic still it does show how intensive processes or boring processes can fail.<br/>The following design mechanics are proposed:1. Usage of a knowledge graph to keep track of what is learned by researchers 2. Usage of knowledge graph to steer the process order that makes learning more likely (topics that closely relate to all participants first and expand that towards specific participants later down the line). 3. Use set structures, conceptual modelling, drawings and other tools to make information sharing and processing easier and less intensive. This would make the process spend less energy if the used tools are chosen well (I.E. a conceptual drawing of what is said or what someone wants to explain using causal diagramming is probably better to explain ideas than doing so via live programming of a simulation model). 4. Use actions like summarizing what has been said to slow down the process if it becomes to quick, leading to a processing energy deficit. 5. Use means like using an agenda to ensure the speed of the process does not become to slow, leading to boredom and potential energy decays","Social learning; Agent based modelling; Social psychology; Participatory Modelling; communication science; Systems thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

To test these effects, different types of Bayesian Networks are constructed and made to perform predictions, using the same dataset. The dataset used contains records regarding the citations and other bibliometric statistics of articles published by authors aliated with the Delft University of Technology between 2010 and 2014. The first model is a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN), which assumes that the conditional probability distributions (CPD) of all variables concerned are Gaussian. The second model is a Multinomial Bayesian Network (MBN), which uses discrete variables. To accommodate to this model, the data is discretized. The third model is the Hybrid Bayesian Network (HBN, which can handle both discrete and continuous data and has no normality assumption on the distribution of the variables. The last model is a non-parametric Bayesian Network (NPBN). To compare the different models, they are used to perform a set of predictions in the form of quantile estimation. The results show that the GBN performs as well as the NPBN, when looking at the bulk of the data. When looking at data, where the mean citation score (mcs), the predicted variable, exceeds the 75-% quantile, the performance of the GBN becomes much worse than that of the NPBN.","Bayesian Network; Structure learning; Citation; Normality Assumption","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Raising a dike may give rise to excess pore water pressures in the subsoil, resulting in a temporal strength decrease. Observing the survival of such a loading condition might provide information on the strength of a dike. Therefore, this research investigates the effect of incorporating construction survival in estimating the slope reliability of dikes. Assessing slope reliability can be done by means of simulation. However, due to the high reliability of dikes, many realizations and thus model evaluations may be needed to achieve sufficient accuracy, leading to infeasible computation times. In this research, a method is developed for reliability updating using metamodelling, providing reasonable computation times while not losing accuracy. The effect of incorporating construction survival is explored by updating the inward slope reliability of a case study dike improvement. The case study shows that the current semi-probabilistic approach to assessing construction stability in practice leads to situations not effective for reliability updating. Though adjusting the construction phasing may lead to a significant update. It is shown that adapting the dike improvement design after survival of the critical construction step results in a 75% reduction of the dimensions of the berm to be constructed, while achieving the same reliability as prior to the update. The main finding of this research is that incorporating construction survival in the reliability assessment can be very effective in terms of reliability, and in making dike improvements more efficient and less space consuming.","reliability updating; metamodelling; slope stability; past performance; construction survival; surrogate modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pollution and congestion requires us to rethink how we move around and new technologies make sharing continuously easier and more convenient. Society is slowly moving towards a mindset that values access over ownership, and this is also the case for (urban) mobility. Research has shown that convenience is the most important factor for people to engage in shared mobility and the rising demand leads to all kinds of light electric vehicles popping up in our streets. Especially e-bikes gain market quickly, both in the form of publicly shared vehicles as well as within corporate fleets. But with operating shared mobility programs also come challenges, and keeping all those vehicles charged is definitely a major one. Free-floating vehicles are often charged by manually swapping its batteries, while dock-based schemes rely on its users connecting the charger after use of the service. Docking stations for e-bikes exist that combine locking the bike in a physical dock with charging its batteries, but they are often expensive, take up a lot of valuable (public) space and are bike-specific. Next to that, contacts suffer from breaking, mechanical wear and corrosion. The start-up TILER is currently developing a universal wireless charging solution for e-bikes, however the physical form of a charging tile with an accommodating kickstand is not considered as the ideal physical form to apply wireless charging to shared vehicles. Therefore, a graduation project was set up to explore alternative solutions and design a universal and convenient charger for shared electric bicycles. The result of this project is the TILER Click, a product that makes charging an integral part of retrieving and returning shared e-bikes from their hub. The easy alignment in combination with a simple yet efficient clicking mechanism make the TILER Click so simple to connect and disconnect that it is no longer an effort to charge the bike. Placement of the receiver on the rear of the electric bicycle make the product extremely universal and versatile, regardless of bike geometry. The TILER Click offers a convenient, simple and reliable way of keeping e-bike fleets charged. With that, it not only enhances the experience of charging itself, but also has a positive impact on the user experience of the entire system. Being able to charge shared e-bikes in a uniform and simple way can play a crucial role in the future of (shared) mobility.","Shared Economy; Bike Sharing; E-bike; Wireless Power Transfer; Charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This aircraft is a flying wing having a large sweep on the inner section, and a small sweep angle at the outer, giving the aircraft its characteristic V shape. The objective of this research is to create a parameterisation of the cockpit and aft center fairing for the Flying V that includes an integration of pilot anthropometry, satisfies visibility certification constraints, ensures positioning of nose landing gear and radar, while providing a high probability of good aerodynamic performance and being able to be used in an aerodynamic design optimisation. To accomplish this, a geometric parameterisation of the cockpit model is made by means of defining a rail on which cross-sectional profiles are placed. A loft through the profiles creates the outer mold line of the cockpit. Constraints were imposed on the cockpit model by pilot anthropometry, the required view angles at the pilot design eye point and by the presence of the radar and nose landing gear. Additionally, a center fairing is defined to reduce the root effect caused by the high sweep angle of the aircraft. Finally, the geometrical model is coupled to an aerodynamic solver to assess its performance and to make future aerodynamic optimisation possible. Demonstration of the model has shown that a cockpit design for the Flying V is possible at a 0.8% reduction of the aircraft lift to drag ratio while satisfying all constraints. Furthermore, the center fairing has shown to increase lift at the root by 13.5%, resulting in an increase of 0.94% in the aircraft lift to drag ratio. Lastly, the robustness of the cockpit and center fairing geometric models was found to be up to 20.3% and 39.9% respectively, where the former can be increased to 50.4% if a lower tolerance on the geometric model is chosen.","Flying V; cockpit; fairing; model; parameterisation; design; cockpit design; integration; anthropometry; overnose angle; pilot compartment view; constraints; root effect; aerodynamics; semi-empirical methods; robustness; Parapy; SU2; nose landing gear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","Flying V",""

Visualising objects and walking through methods step by step could help in understanding the fundamentals of object-oriented programming language C++.","debugger; Object-Oriented Programming; education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","","52.0017011, 4.3678927"

(mentor); Cats, O. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Despite its potential benefits of reduced traffic congestion and discounted trips, incorporating ride-pooling in a city comes with a set of challenges that require thorough analysis, optimisation, and planning. Even though, services like \textit{Uber} have existed in Amsterdam for over a decade, city wide ride-pooling has yet to be implemented. This paper uses an algorithm for exact matching of attractive shared rides (ExMAS) and Albatross travel demand data to map and analyse the spatial disparities of key performance indicators of a ride-pooling service in Amsterdam and discover the potential of certain areas in the city. The experiments utilised a set of increasing discounted fares for ride-pooling with increasing travel demand levels. A ride-pooling service with higher discounted fares generally increased the attractiveness of the system and reduced the total vehicle hours, when compared to its non-shared counterpart. It was found that the largest vehicle hour reduction were in areas on the periphery of Amsterdam (namely the West, North, and East areas) where rides of higher degree and longer trips lengths were more likely. However, the user attractiveness of the system tended to be higher in central areas of the city where trip density was higher, trip length shorter, and ride degrees lower. The study also determined that variance of the vehicle hours and user attractiveness decreased and stabilised with increasing demand level. This paper could be a starting point in optimising the possible roll out schemes for a ride-pooling service in Amsterdam.","ride-sharing; ride-pooling; Amsterdam; performance; Spatial analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

These CubeSat generate much heat due to a combination of increased power generation capabilities and miniaturisation. A deployable radiator is designed to solve this problem using HiPeR technology developed by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands. This design is analysed, a prototype is produced and tested. The design is proposed after iteratively sizing the shape, dimensions, location of the interface and number of layers. The design is a T-shaped laminate of 12 sheets of PG, and a top and bottom protective sheet of Kapton adhered with 3M966. This shape allows for easy folding over the outside of a CubeSat to minimise volume while being compliant with the P-POD requirements. Some parts of the PG sheets are not adhered, allowing for local bending with a small bending radius. A tape spring hinge provides support and the actuation for deployment. The radiator allows for an efficient heat flow path between the payloads and space. This reduces the temperatures of the payloads and allows for CubeSats to continuously generate up to 30W of heat.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); Voorendt, M.Z. (mentor); Onderwater, Martijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In recent years, the awareness of climate change and sea level rise has grown. Especially in low lying countries like the Netherlands, with a large river delta with a high economical and natural value, extreme variations in water levels will have great impact. Former used solutions proofed to be expensive and in some cases disturbed the dynamics of nature. Consequently, the need of new solutions of flood protections grows in which the negative impact on nature environments should be limited. The Delta21 plan proposes a future-proof design for the Dutch Southwest delta, that aims to tackle the growing need for flood protection, while contributing to nature and storing energy all at once. However, the coastal structure, located in the Haringvliet mouth, is likely to produce large disturbances in the environment. Since the Haringvliet mouth is located in the 'Voordelta', a Natura2000 area, it is essential to study the initial response of the proposed interventions to the hydraulics and morphodynamics that shape the system. Hence, the objective of this research is to determine the initial impact of the Delta21 plan on the large scale multi-year average hydro- and morphodynamics of the Northern Voordelta. To this end, a literature review was performed to analyse the evolvement of the Northern Voordelta since the closure of the Grevelingen and Haringvliet estuaries by the Delta Works in 1970. This study showed that the closure caused the tidal prisms to reduce strongly resulting in the tidal propagation to change from cross­shore to longshore. The remaining ebb tidal deltas started to follow the characteristics of a short basin, in which water levels offshore and nearshore are in phase. Flow velocities reduced strongly and channels started to fill up, at the foreshore waves started to dominate the morphodynamics. Waves began to 'bulldoze' the former ebb-tidal deltas onshore, creating shore parallel sandbars like the Bollen van de Ooster and the Hinderplaat. Besides, the construction of the Maasvlakte 2 triggered further sedimentation of the Haringvliet mouth, landward of the Hinderplaat, by sheltering the area from NW waves. The initial response of the system to Delta21 has been studied using a short-term morphostatic 2DH computational model simulation. The complexity of the processes inside the study area caused the need of the process based model Delft3D, in which flow, waves and sediment transport computations can be carried out. To reduce computational times, the applied modelling setup made use of reduction techniques and schematisations of the hydraulic forcing, while maintaining the natural character of the system. The computed flow and sediment transport patterns were used as indicators, in order to predict and compare the feedback of the system of the various scenarios. Model results showed that the tidal propagation inside the Haringvliet estuary, which is opened in the Delta21 scenario, changes to cross-shore again. Similar to the situation prior to the closing, the area will start to follow the characteristics of a long-basin. This implies that water levels in the estuary are out of phase with the offshore water levels. A cross-shore tide dominated flow prevails in the area, while the Grevelingen delta remains unchanged in the Delta21 scenario. The cross-shore action influences the offshore wave- and setup-driven residual currents. In the same offshore area, the Delta21 pump discharge develops a similar cross-shore acting influence area. Model results further showed that the Delta21 geometry causes a 'tidal squeeze', similar to the present-day processes around Maasvlakte 2. Altogether, the large disturbances to the hydrodynamic forcing, triggers morphodynamic activity. Concluding from literature and the model results, this leads to the erosion and formation of ebb and flood channels in the Haringvliet mouth and the formation of an ebb- and flood-tidal delta around the inlet. Processes in and around the ebb-tidal delta adjust towards a balance between the wave and tidal action. These findings agree with the known processes of a mixed-energy tidal inlet system that is adjusting towards a dynamic equilibrium. Conceptualised results are shown in Figure 1. Concluding, the analysis on the initial response of the system, as well as the expected initial dynamic behaviour, provides useful insight and a good basis for future optimisation studies on the Delta21 design. This study reveals the disturbed areas caused by the presence of Delta2 l and relates it to the contribution of the various hydrodynamic processes. Furthermore, the development of this type of study can be significantly relevant to the evaluation of other preliminary studies on solutions to sea level rise.","morphodynamic; Delft3D; Coastal Engineering; The Voordelta; DELTA21","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","DELTA21",""

The abstract interpreter is automatically proven sound via the use of Coq's automatic proof capabilities and typeclass system.

A considerable amount of research is in progress to explore the scope of various sustainable power sources; among which tidal energy is estimated to have a huge potential. With advancements in technology, it is predicted that electricity from tidal energy would increase in the coming years. It is necessary to have highly efficient generators that can convert tidal energy to electricity. Propeller type generation system using Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) are found to be suitable for the application of tidal generators. For the best utilisation of resources, it is essential to improve the performance of these machines in several aspects. And hence, multi-objective optimisation of electrical machines is emerging to be of high significance. The key goal of this thesis is to design, model and optimise a PMSM generator so as to get the desired power while considering other design objectives, including the efficiency, total volume of the machine and weight of magnets. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part consists of design, modelling and analysis of the PMSM machine. Initially, all the required machine constraints are identified and a topology is selected. An analytical model is built after which the machine is modelled using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The model is analysed where various key characteristics of the machine such as flux linkages, induced EMF, inductance and torque are calculated. This is validated by ensuring that results from FEM model and analytical model match. In order to optimize the machine; certain geometric parameters are varied to locate the dominant geometrical parameters. The second part of the machine consists of optimisation. A multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization is carried out to generate data to search for an optimal design. The three objectives for optimisation are higher efficiency, lower total volume and lesser weight of magnets. The analytical model is used in the optimisation algorithm. Since this is a multi-objective optimisation, a set of solutions (Pareto set) is generated from which a single solution is chosen. This selected solution is applied to the FEM model and thus finally an optimized model of the machine is developed. An analysis is carried out on the optimised model. Finally, the optimised model and the initial model are compared and the results are explained.","Optimisation; FEM modelling; modelling; Electrical machines","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master Thesis -M Sc.

The sizing method focusses on takeoff conditions, taking into account the low speed aerodynamic effects on the propeller and the resulting effect on the takeoff performance. The point mass takeoff performance model and BEM propeller analysis iterate the propeller sizing parameters; number of blades and chord ratio factor to determine the propeller that precisely achieves the required takeoff distance. Two case studies with reference aircraft are presented to demonstrate the impact of the developed sizing method on the preliminary aircraft and engine design solution with respect to reality and the empirical method. The results show the created constraints follow the same trends, however the power loading takeoff constraint is lower than the empirical constraint.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The results of the scenarios are afterwards compared to the social and spatial needs of the neighbourhood, from which the most suitable scenario can be chosen. The research has been done for three neighbourhoods from the New West borough in Amsterdam: Geuzenveld, Osdorp Midden and Middenveldsche Akkerpolder. The results show that for Osdorp Midden and Geuzenveld, the scenario focusing on economics is the most suitable for helping with the high rate of poverty and unemployment in the neighbourhood. On the other hand, for Middelveldsche Akkerpolder the scenario focused on creating social values can help strengthening the missing social ties and create a sense of community in the neighbourhood.","Urban Farming; Circularity; Value Creation; Urban Metabolism; Neighbourhood; Urban Planning; Nieuw West; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.356300, 4.809600"

(mentor); Borsdorff, Tobias (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the 13th of October 2017, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard ESA’s Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5-P) satellite enables daily global measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) total column con- centrations at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 7×5.6 km. TROPOMI has the ability to detect distinct pollution plumes, arising from point source emissions, from which emission rates can be derived. We in- vestigate the potential of CO column concentrations observed by TROPOMI to estimate the CO emissions of point sources on an operational level. This study developed a Python framework that for pre-defined point sources automatically detects pollution plumes and from which it estimates CO emissions using a mass bal- ance approach directly from single overpass CO observations. The algorithm is based on concepts from the computer vision to identify the plume and extract the plume center line while respecting the plume orienta- tion. The emission rate is approximated from flux profiles through multiple plume cross-sections following the plume center line. The performance of the developed framework and its potential is demonstrated by the application on 132 identified steel plant facilities over a time period of more than 2.5 years. Currently the lack of accessible and quality-wise good data limits spatial or even temporal comparison of CO emissions from steel plants. Therefore the control and understanding of emission rates could greatly benefit from the proposed approach. In total we obtained 1,774 emission estimates for 97 facilities. Up to 119 measurements per facility are derived where for the majority of the facilities the average number of measurements is around 10. The obtained time series showed large variation in the distribution of measurements over time as well as the emission values itself. For a number of higher emission values, that exceeded up to 2 times the aver- age emission, measured for e.g. the Bhilai Steel Plant, India, the outliers corresponded with interference of another source. Although individual plumes could be identified for two sources (∼35 km apart) in the same Bhilai area, no non-merged plumes were detected for the Schwelgern and Huttenheim sites (∼18 km apart) in Duisburg, Germany. Moreover, we tested the agreement of our measurements with recorded or stated events: i) The emission estimate from the afternoon of the 24th of May 2019, Bhilai site, confirmed the manufacturers statement that the operations had continued that day despite a reported fire in the morning. ii) Our results did not match the significant global drop noted in steel production during the first period of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The scattered distribution of measurements and their emission values over time seem to limit the representation of a small time frame needed for such analysis. iii) We found a positive correlation with a Pearson Coefficient of 0.76 between the European Pollutant Release Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and our data. For all examined facilities our obtained emissions were greater than reported by the facilities to E-PRTR. This might indicate an underestimation of the data registered. This first evaluation emphasizes the potential of TROPOMI observations to improve our understanding of point source emissions and to compliment existing data such as the E-PRTR. However, to be able to interpret the data from TROPOMI indeed structurally and to develop a reliable validation method extensive data-analysis on plant and area-level is required, especially to be able to rule out interfering factors.","Plumes; TROPOMI; CO; Automatic; Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Besides a reduction of emissions by new combustion engines, electric vehicles are being introduced to lower the fleet fuel economy. Especially this new drivetrain technology benefits from an improved driving resistance of the vehicle, as an increase in range is highly valued for current electric vehicles. The aerodynamic drag, a considerable contribution to the driving resistance, therefore plays an important role in automotive development. With a significant contribution to aerodynamic drag, the wheels and surrounding wheelhouses are considered to have potential for possible improvements and are currently one of the focuses of research. This thesis examines the aerodynamic flow in a rear wheel arch of a low drag electric sedan to identify areas of potential improvement and derive recommendations for future developments. Three major parameters of the rear wheelhouse geometry are therefore modified and their influence on the aerodynamic drag and the flow field is assessed. These include the wheelhouse radius, wheelhouse width and the wheel track. For this purpose, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations are used to both calculate the effect of the variations on aerodynamic drag and analyse the origin of changes in the flow field.

These factors influence the decision power of hospitals and their internal departments before and after signing off on a purchase. Based on the results, a complementary survey was developed to scale this research across Dutch hospitals. This survey serves as a stepping stonet for future research efforts.","cybersecurity; procurement; healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis introduces a theory for model-driven objective functions in Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms. For scheduling supply chains, such model-driven objective functions allow the MPC algorithm to make optimal scheduling decisions by anticipating future changes in product flow and transfer price dynamics. Including such dynamics introduces new insights in the decision-making process for supply chains, as current supply-chain management relies on professional expertise and modelling techniques with static product flows and transfer prices. In this thesis, a dynamic model for product flows and transfer prices at a storage depot in the supply chain is developed with Economic Engineering Systems Theory. We develop a model-driven objective function for profit-maximization in an MPC scheduling algorithm using the Economic Engineering storage depot model. The advantage of the model-driven objective function is the ability to assess the product flow and transfer price dynamics that affect the revenues and costs for various decisions. The MPC algorithm for scheduling shipments towards storage depots includes the constraints in the supply chain and offers the potential to control processes in the supply chain in a dynamic and automated way. This thesis applies the modelling technique and scheduling algorithm to the refined oil product supply chain of Shell for DACH. The algorithm automates processes that form the bridge between the yearly tactical planning and the day-to-day scheduling operations. Supply-chain companies like Shell benefit from the scheduling algorithm by optimal decision-making, additional time for strategic activities and less room for human error.","Model Predictive Control; Supply Chain; Scheduling; Economic Engineering; Dynamic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In the face of the gradual loss of freedoms, the people of Hong Kong have demonstrated an atmosphere of solidarity through social movements and physical engagement with the city. Under the contexts of top-down political and urban conditions, how can architecture, enable a democratic space that favours political debates and effective communication between different parties? An independent art institution, Green Wave Art, is looking for a new physical platform to gather the artist/cultural community and expand their ways of working with the social scope. The art corporate wishes to fund a place, with intentional openness that provides public enlightenment and entertainment. As they have always been outspoken on political issues, the challenge arises as looking for a space for “underground” activities in the critical condition of Hong Kong today is scarce. Inspired by the act of queering spaces in the protest, the project speculates a new public building typology that takes advantage of an undervalued urban space, which was formerly a car-park building. In the public Transcript, it suggests an alternative immediate solution for the underused building: to be kept and appropriated into spaces for street vendors to occupy the garage floors, which also saves the government from extra costs in demolition and rebuilding. In the hidden transcript, the artists would further re-appropriate the architectural framework provided by the government under the camouflage of the street market, into a free-space that invites political debates and public engagement at the rooftop, where the citizens can lookout and possess the city.","Hong Kong; Agency; Democracy; Reapproproation; Bottom-up approach; Protests; Public Transcript; Transformation; Hidden Transcript; The Art of Resistance; Public interior; interior building cities; The Independent group","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

However, recently the EU has been dealing with the rising power of populism, increasing polarization and strong bubble forming; all leading to a weakening practice of local, national and union scale democracies. An important factor in this is the lacking tradition of Public Sphere in our society; a safe and comfortable space that invites and facilitates dialectic engagement between people of different believes. Bringing back this sphere into the spatial realm, accessible to people, will strengthen the local practice of democracy. An institution that has played an import role in the traditional practice of European Democracy is that of the Public Domain; the space that derives its function and value based on the peoples' needs. This locally strong embedded institution already facilitate the Expression Sphere and Protests Spheres hence it needs to evolve, adding to it the Public Sphere. Public Domains through the whole of Europe need to spatially evolve in a bottom-up and gentle manner. Above all; the manifestation of Public Sphere needs to become deeply rooted in the local society and context to connect to the local society and its people. This relation between local people and the Public Sphere is coloured by the qualitative application of architectural atmosphere as it has the capacity to colour and define the emotional relationship between institution and space. One of the evolved manifestations of the public domain is that of the Demo Domain of Nowa Huta; a former utopian socialist town, close to Krakow, Poland.","European Union; Ecosophy; Democracy; Atmopshere; Contextualism; Public Sphere; Public Domain; Ecosophic Contextualism; Explore Lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","50.075360, 20.039977"

The historical era we live in today is cha- racterized by the use of technology, which is one of the factors that made globalization possible. While some time ago it was possible to define and identify the “center” of powers, of cities, it became more challenging today. Nowadays different types of centralities exist, ranging from the new transnational networks of cities to electronic space (Sassen, 2001). The urban question addresses the cities as the main places where the activities that arose from globalization are focused and they are characterized by different degrees of virtuality. Finance is one of them, probably the most virtual, thanks to the liberalization that happened in the eighties of the last century (Harvey, 2007). (Sassen, 2001) proposes a challenge to the archi- tects and urbanists in this sense: are we able to study and imagine projects for the places of intersection between the global, mostly virtual dynamics, and the local realities? The research that is explained here wants to take up this challenge. It focuses on the topic of the global commercial networks that have been developing in the last years. Such corridors aim at creating new con- nections between cities around the globe, by building new infrastructure in strategic points, among them harbors too. The practice of allowing den- ser flows between these areas is less virtual than the activities of finance, for instance. Every commercial corridor needs to take into consideration the question of logistics, mobility and consequently infrastructure whose physical implications are tangible. Similarly, some of the flows that pass through the hubs are flows of very tangible objects such as containers or liquids. Along with the concrete passengers of the commercial there will be the unofficial ones, whose presence is intrinsic every time there is an exchange of goods: the knowledge and culture from the places connected by the new economic corridor. Just like in the case of finance, explained by Sassen (2001), there is a variety of other activities and spaces that emer- ge along with it. This research wants to address the ones that emerge and could emerge from the development of harbor cities in the current logic of globalization and growth of global flows.<br/>This research wants to underline that the answer is not in the obedient ac- ceptance of the conditions that the global powers dictate. That is why, the outcome of this thesis wants to be a new method, and a new lens through which we can all choose to look at the urban paradigm of harbor cities.","Port city; border; theatre; global networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","45,6362, 13,8042"

This degradation can be continuously monitored using brake degradation sensors. Using this monitored degradation data the remaining useful life of the brakes can be estimated by means of a prognostic model based on a Gamma probability distribution. Using the remaining useful life estimations a maintenance schedule can be optimized for a fleet of aircraft each fitted with multiple brakes accounting for maintenance constraints. Considered maintenance constraints include the availability of the maintenance hangar and the aircraft flight schedules. Because the problem contains multi-unit systems opportunistic maintenance can be applied, specifically economic dependance between components is considered in the optimization. Using a rolling horizon approach a long-term maintenance schedule can be created and evaluated. This long-term schedule is simulated using Monte Carlo simulation to achieve robust results on which meaningful conclusions can be drawn. To compare the results of the condition-based maintenance strategy a time-based maintenance strategy with fixed replacement intervals is used. It has been shown that the application of a condition-based maintenance strategy which makes use of prognostics can significantly improve the scheduling performance.","Maintenance; optimization; Prognostics; remaining useful life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In dit verslag wordt onderzoek gedaan naar het verloop van de ziekte Atherosclerose. Dit is een ziekte waarbij de wand van het bloedvat uitzet en verhardt. Dit gebeurt doordat er in de bloedwand ophoping plaatsvindt van plaque, bestaande uit LDL-deeltjes, immuuncellen en foam cellen. In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken hoe deze plaquevorming zal gaan verlopen, en specifiek wat de invloed hierop zal zijn van de shear stress, oftewel de frictiekracht van het bloed op de bloedwand. Eerder onderzoek heeft al uitgewezen dat er een positief verband bestaat. Ook wordt gekeken hoe de binnenwand zal gaan veranderen in de tijd. Vooral bekeken wordt of de binnenwand sneller of anders zal gaan krimpen bij verschillende shear stresses. Er wordt een stelsel opgesteld van vijf partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen, bestaande uit geoxideerde LDL-deeltjes, monocyten, macrofagen, foam cellen en chemoattractant. Deze zullen gedefinieerd worden op het volgende domein: een dwarsdoorsnede van een bloedvat. De vergelijkingen beschrijven de evolutie van de plaquevorming. Om de bewegende binnenwand van de bloedwand te beschrijven wordt een snelheidsveld opgesteld, dat de verandering in de tijd beschrijft. Er wordt met behulp van numerieke methoden een benadering gezocht als oplossing voor dit probleem. Het model, bestaande uit de differentiaalvergelijkingen, wordt opgelost met de eindige volume methode. Hierbij is gekeken naar de stationaire oplossing. De bewegende rand is opgelost met de level set methode. Hierbij wordt wel gekeken naar de evolutie in de tijd. Alles is vervolgens geïmplementeerd en opgelost met het computerprogramma matlab. De volgende resultaten zijn gevonden. Als een initiële concentratie geoxideerde LDL-deeltjes aanwezig is, zal daar plaquevorming optreden. De plaque zal zich niet verdelen over de bloedwand, maar redelijk lokaal blijven. Dit kan worden verklaard doordat gekeken wordt naar de stationaire oplossing en de diffusie effectief nul wordt genomen. Ook is gevonden dat de bewegende rand mee zal bewegen met deze lokale plaquevorming, maar dat deze na 10 jaar een afwijking aan de onderkant van de bloedwand vormt. Ten derde is gevonden dat bij een plaatsafhankelijk lagere shear stress meer plaque gaat vormen op deze plek. Ook is gevonden dat een lagere shear stress zorgt voor een duidelijk zichtbaar hogere monocyt dichtheid. De laatste bevinding is dat een algeheel lagere shear stress ervoor zorgt dat het lumen-oppervlak sneller zal afnemen. Dit resultaat is echter erg subtiel.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/angelinebosman/Bachelorproject","","2021-02-08","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Dimples are shallow, indented surfaces that attempt to reduce drag in turbulent boundary layer flows. However, the underlying effect of the dimples on the drag is not entirely understood. This thesis sets out to expand our understanding; a numerical investigation of turbulent boundary layer flow over dimpled surfaces is conducted. This research aims to verify the drag results from recent experimental studies and investigate the possible drag-reducing mechanism of a dimpled plate. The research considers shallow, rounded-edge dimples with a staggered layout. Implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) is carried out with the cell spacing close to direct numerical simulations (DNS). Simulation outputs conclude that the dimple plate causes a total drag increase of approximately 1% compared to a smooth plate. This value confirms the results of Spalart et al. and recent wind tunnel measurements within the Aerodynamics group. The turbulent coherent structures are further investigated by performing hole-filtering sampling to the quadrant events. Results suggest that the dimple plate induces a more intense turbulent activity in the buffer layer. The increased occurrence contributes to a higher Reynolds shear stress. The development of quadrant events is further analysed using a Variable-Interval Time-Averaging (VITA) technique. It reveals that the averaged quadrant event development between two plates is almost the same. However, a more extended sweep development is found in the wake region. Given such a mild even evolution, the resulting Reynolds shear stress generation remains the same. Lastly, the coherent structure response is linked to the skin friction response through the Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi (FIK) identity. The resulting decomposition using the FIK identity reveals that dimples contribute to higher total drag due to increased Reynolds shear stress. On the other hand, the observed skin friction reduction seems relative to the mean flow convection.","drag reduction; turbulent boundary layer; passive flow control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
