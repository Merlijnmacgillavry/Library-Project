Circulating fluids serve as the transport agent of heat. The contact area between the fluids and the rocks is where the relevant heat transfer occurs, i.e., where the water is heated up. In some geothermal reservoirs, this circulation occurs naturally through porous matrix (mainly sediments) or through heavily fractured formations. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are potentially favorable reservoirs where subsurface permeability is increased by means of artificial stimulation techniques. These stimulation techniques often involve hydraulic fracturing where a limited existing fracture network is expanded or “enhanced” by injecting fluids under high pressure conditions. While the geometry of the generated fractures influences permeability, the effect on heat exchange has received less attention. This thesis discusses the effects of fracture geometry on the heat transfer between solid and fluid. Along with laboratory experiments, numerical simulations were conducted. All investigations were performed on igneous granite rocks. Tensile fractures were generated to allow a fluid flow along the otherwise impermeable rock samples. Several parameters were varied throughout the experiments and simulations including volumetric flow rate, fracture aperture, rock temperature and fracture geometry and surface area in order to investigate their impact on heat transfer processes. Flow rate variations in the experiments have shown that higher flow rates cause the fluid to absorb less heat per unit volume and cause the rock to cool down more extensively, therefore thermal depletion of the reservoir is likely to occur within a shorter time frame. The dependency of exchanged heat on fracture aperture variations (in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 mm) did not yield a clear trend within the experiments, but does so in numerical simulations. Aperture variations in the numerical simulations did not cause notable differences in transferred heat as long as the volumetric flow rate is kept constant. However, as the fluid velocity is kept constant the amount of fluid flushed along the fracture per unit time is affected by varying apertures. This causes a difference in heat transfer as well. Increased fracture surface areas alone (more extensive topology/roughness) have shown a minimal impact on the heat production while a more extensive fracture network (additional branches) has shown notable enhancement in the amount of heat produced. Cooling behavior of the rock has shown correlations with Newton’s law of cooling and suggests a limitation of heat production by the heat conduction occurring within the rock.<br/>Experimental findings cannot directly be compared with natural reservoir conditions. The reason for this is a thermal equilibrium that is achieved at each flow experiment, i.e., the heat withdrawn equals the heat resupplied by a heater. In natural reservoirs this is often not the case where a cold front propagates towards the production well and determines the lifetime of how long heat can efficiently be produced from a certain rock mass. This results in an unsteady heat conduction where the heat withdrawn does not equal the heat resupplied.","Geothermal Energy; Heat transfer; Fracture; Laboratory experiment; Numerical Simulation; Enhanced Geothermal System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Similar to many ML methods, RL suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the exponential increase in solution space with the increase in problem dimensions. Learning the hierarchy present in underlying problems, formulated using the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) framework, may exploit inherent structure in the environment. Using the hierarchical structure, an MDP can be divided into several simpler semi-MDPs (SMDPs) having temporally extended actions. The solutions of smaller SMDPs can then be re-combined to form a solution for the original MDP. The methods for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) explore ways to break down the original problem into SMDPs while providing several opportunities for state and temporal abstractions. A novel algorithm for learning this hierarchical structure of a discrete-state goal-oriented Factored-MDP (FMDP) is proposed in the thesis work taking into account the causal structure of the problem domain with the use of Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model. The proposed method autonomously learns the state and temporal abstractions in the problem domain and constructs a hierarchy of SMDPs using them. Such a decomposition results in decreasing the problem state dimensions to be considered for solving each SMDP and, hence, reducing the computational complexity induced due to increased dimensionality.","Markov Decision Processes; Semi-Markov Decision Processes; Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning; Reinforcement Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Especially due to stringent norms on emissions, the research on gas turbines have increased to reduce NOx levels. Most of the gas turbines have been using non-premixed combustion for power generation and since the early 90s research on premixed combustion was sought after. Aircraft engines and many other CHP power plants still currently use non-premixed combustion. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was one of the major part load operations in a gas turbine which was determined to improve part load efficiency and at the same time reduce NOx emission levels.<br/><br/>This thesis research would give an overview on how to model non-premixed combustion in a gas turbine and how different parameters effect NOx emissions. The two main reactors that were used are perfectly stirred reactor(PSR) and a plug flow reactor(PFR). The combustor volume was divided equally between perfectly stirred reactor and plug flow reactor. The half of the combustor where the mixing between the fuel and oxidizer and the combustion reactions occur are modelled by three perfectly stirred reactors which contain flame sheet reactor (FSR), post-flame PSR and PSR recirculation. The volume of FSR was determined by modelling the stoichiometric mixture fraction. This is done by determining the scalar dissipation rate which tells the rate of mixing between the fuel and oxidizer at the stoichiometric interface. The model was then validated using different technical studies on non-premixed combustion. <br/><br/>Parametric analysis was performed with this model using EGR as oxidizer and compared with results that were obtained when using air as oxidizer. It was seen that thermal NOx which was the most amount of NOx released during the combustion was reduced when EGR was used as an oxidizer. It was also found that the CO levels were increased when using EGR but still remained below the level when air was used as an oxidizer. This was due to insufficient residence time inside the combustor. When using EGR as a part load operation and at high pressures in gas turbine, the NOx emissions were lower. The results from the pressure analysis showed that at lower pressures the amount of NOx that was reduced was more when using EGR, but at high pressures the amount of NOx that was reduced was quite less even though it was EGR-oxydizer compositon. It was observed that the NOx and CO levels were still lower while using EGR compared to using inlet guide vanes as a part load operation(IGV). While using a fuel mixture of H2 and natural gas, it appeared that the NOx levels were higher with EGR and air as an oxidizer than just using only natural gas as fuel. At the same time CO emission levels showed that it was low for both EGR and air when fuel mixture of H2 and natural gas was used.<br/><br","Gas Turbine; oxides of nitrogen; carbon monoxide; Exhaust Gas Recirculation; Flame Sheet Reactor; Mixture Fraction; Scalar Dissipation Rate; Combustion; Stoichiometry; Chemical Reactor Network; Non-premixed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Perry (2017), for instance, shows that only 60 companies were present in the Fortune 500 in 1955 as well as in 2017, meaning that 88% of the companies from 1955 went bankrupt, merged with (or were overtaken by) other firms or were not able to meet the Fortune 500 revenue threshold anymore. It can be stated that many companies have not been able to adapt or to take advantage of changing market situations as they fail to scout and invest in new areas of growth or keep applying existing business models to new market segments (Anthony et al.,2016; Zook, 2014)<br/>Lately, design has received increased attention from companies that want to anticipate on market turbulence. Design is seen as a way to overcome creative destruction, helping companies to maintain their competitiveness in the marketplace. From multiple accounts, design and design thinking are seen to add value to businesses, organisations, (innovation) processes, products and services. However, the fact that the added value of design and design thinking is mainly described by anecdotal cases of businesses and organisations that successfully make use of design and design thinking seems to ignore the process that precedes the situation whereby design is fully operationalised in and adds value to innovation processes.<br/>It is therefore that this research project is executed with the aim of exploring the implications of design when being embedded in a company’s innovation process. Based on current collaborations between the Delft University of Technology’s IDE faculty and various businesses, three companies have been found suitable for examination in the context of this research project. As a result, three cases can be described <br/>through conducting empirical research, whereby further insights into these cases are provided through conducting two rounds of interviews. <br/>The data derived during this research project show that a design project is seen to be initiated by a non-design project brief, that design is positioned in the Fuzzy Front End of innovation processes and that design is employed in a separated type of department. It also becomes clear that an emerging disconnection emerges between the design output and the innovation process that is already put in place. It is found that this disconnection can be traced back to a barrier that is positioned within the higher ranks of companies as well as a barrier is perceived in the way companies have set-up their organisational structure relative to the design output.<br/>It is concluded that design should become an ‘implemented reality’ and it should be incorporated into the ‘thought processes of a company’s organisational structure’ when companies want to successfully make use of design with the aim of arriving at outcomes other than their current innovation processes are producing. Therefore, companies should adapt, revise and/or redesign each aspect of their innovation process that is either preceding or coming after the embedded design element in order to fully facilitate an innovation cycle.","Design; Innovation; Innovation process; Design process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The majority of which is located in rural regions of developing countries, such as India and most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As a part of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, a multi-tier framework that aims to categorize and quantify the electricity access of households and rural regions to reach the sustainable development goals by 2030. Solar Home Systems (SHS) is a potential solution that has emerged to cater for the lighting and power needs of these remote households. SHSs consist of a small stand-alone DC system which are composed of a PV array, battery, and power electronics that are designed to meet the load of a single household. The aim of this study is to propose a universal, optimal sizing methodology for the SHS with respect to cost, reliability (LLP) and battery lifetime for any household in the mutli-tier energy ladder. Moreover, the study aims to anticipate to which extend a stand-alone architecture remains a feasible solution. In this thesis, a practical model for each of the Solar Home System components was built using MATLAB, then two optimization methods: a classical iterative method, and the Genetic Algorithm, an evolutionary method were used to perform a multi-objective optimization on three case studies in different locations. The results obtained showed that for the lower energy tiers, with a load profile up to a peak load of 155W, the standalone approach is optimal. With an LLP·2%, an average total upfront cost of 1600$, and a lead-acid battery lifetime of 6.5 years. The results from the higher tiers however show proved that as the household moves up the energy ladder, the stand-alone approach becomes unaffordable and less reliable. An alternate approach to solve this issue was examined, where several households are interconnected forming a minigrid to share their energy generation and load. The outcome of this study showed that households with sub-optimal sized Solar Home Systems were able to greatly increase their system reliability, the LLP was recorded to drop by up to 50% in some scenarios with an increasing number of interconnected households. The LLP drop however reached a saturation point beyond 25 households. On this basis, it is recommended that further work should be done to increase the complexity of the component models, notable the battery. Moreover, a more extensive study should be conducted on the interconnected approach, with a multitude of scenarios to optimize the system size in a mini-grid architecture.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-28","","","","","",""

A combination of alloying elements and complex heat treatment generates microstructures with designed fractions, dimensions, compositions, morphologies and spatial distribution of phases. However, the high alloying content, required to stabilize the multi-phase microstructure of these steels, makes the material sensitive to hot cracking/solidification cracking. Hot cracking of laser welded components is a serious problem that is often reported by automotive manufacturers using AHSS. The increasing use of thinner gauge steels in order to reduce the weight of the automobile demands the application of laser welding at the edge of the steel flanges, which often leads to severe cracking. During the commercial steel making process, laser welding is applied to join steel coils. Therefore, in several industrial processes for advanced high strength steels, hot cracking can lead to serious disturbances, down time and production loss.<br/>An experimental study was performed for the graduation project based exclusively on thermo-mechanical aspects. External tensile loading was applied during lase spot welding to relate the stress and strain based models designed specifically for hot cracking. In situ strain measurements were extracted, using digital imaging correlation (DIC). All the laser welds were made using Nd:YAG laser. The experimental study focused majorly on single pulsed spot welds with few bead-on-plate welds for comparison. Only two kinds of AHSS were investigated namely, Dual phase (DP) steels and Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels, due to their high demands for laser weld automotive applications.

They are developing a 3 kW recuperated microturbine for a micro-CHP application and are constantly looking at options to improve the performance of the microCHP system. A suitable modification in the turbocharger technology can be achieve improvement in microCHP’s performance. MTT currently uses an off-the-shelf turbocharger system modified to accommodate a generator to generate power. As they use an off-the-shelf product, one way to improve the system efficiency is to opt for turbine/compressor design modifications to optimise its performance for the particular working condition of MTT’s CHP unit.<br/><br/>MTT is continuously looking at optimising their radial compressors and turbine. Literature and various researches over the past few decades suggest mixed flow turbines as an alternative with advantages for the conventional radial turbines. Thus, this thesis is oriented towards the design and analysis of new mixed flow turbines for MTT’s microCHP system. One of the main goals is to investigate the performance of the turbine stage by adopting new turbine rotors and their design impact on the current turbine stage. The relevant design process, loss models for the turbine, design parameters considered and the procedures followed in few past pieces of research are discussed. A 1D mean-line design procedure has been developed for MTT to design a new rotor considering the upstream and downstream components and the packaging constraints.<br/><br/>Four different turbine configurations are chosen for comparison. The existing radial turbine in use by MTT is considered, and two mixed flow turbines for the same dimensions of the existing radial turbine are analysed for its performance to compare. While designing new rotors, optimum inlet conditions are assumed to neglect the effect of incidence and its loss. Considering the optimum inlet conditions for the turbine rotor, new radial and mixed flow rotors are designed and compared for their performance and sizing. In comparison with the existing rotors, the turbine rotors designed for optimal performance meets the required exit pressure. Mixed flow turbines designed with inlet optimal conditions perform significantly (about 3- 5 %) better than the new radial turbines designed<br/>with the same optimal conditions. A reduction in the inlet diameter (by 5-6 mm) of the rotors is observed for the newly designed mixed flow turbines. Relieving the packaging restrictions, the rotors designed with optimum inlet conditions show an increase in the rotor and stage dimensions with reduced specific power and efficiency due to positive swirl at the rotor exit.<br/><br/>As a first step towards the more detailed aerodynamics and structural analysis, a 2D gas flow-path design procedure has been adapted and programmed to obtain the end wall contours of the flow path within the rotor. Thus, a basic two-dimensional flow path design for the rotors are created. 3D models of the turbine rotors are built using the commercial analysis and modelling software. The three-dimensional models of the newly designed radial and mixed flow turbine rotors are assembled in the current turbine stage to study the geometrical impact of the rotors on the turbine stage. The new rotors have larger exit diameter compared to the existing rotors which make the existing turbine volute to be modified to accommodate the new rotors. The design modifications for MTT’s micro CHP turbine stage have been suggested.","turbine; Mixed flow; Turbocharger; turbo-machinery; design; blade loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The produced heat from the low enthalpy geothermal energy can be used for heating up the buildings and greenhouses. A doublet system is used in the geothermal scheme, which consists of one production well and one injection well. The reinjection is done to maintain the reservoir pressure and reduce pressure decline due to production, earthquake and subsidence prevention, and environmental safety. Thus, it is crucial to model the aquifer distributions appropriately as the injection and production well should be placed at the communicated sand bodies. <br/>In this study, the architecture of the Alblasserdam Member in the Drechtsteden, West Netherlands Basin is modelled. An investigation of the paleo flow and the distribution of sand prone succession within the Alblasserdam Member is done by integrating seismic interpretation, reservoir sedimentology, and petrophysical evaluation. The data used consist of seismic data, well log dataset and core data from the acquired hydrocarbon exploration data. The Alblasserdam Member was deposited during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous when the high tectonic activities occurred in the West Netherlands Basin and followed by series of inversion impulses made this member bounded by various members at the bottom and the top. The seismic response of the Alblasserdam Member shows a high thickness and depth variations. The sediments of the Alblasserdam Member are highly accumulated in the central part of the study area, bounded by two major faults striking SE-NW. <br/>Several sections of well correlation are made based on cycles of changing accommodation to sediment supply ratio (A/S cycles). The correlation is supported with seismic interpretation, allow to map the distribution of sand-rich interval of the Alblasserdam Member in the Drechtsteden. Two potential aquifer intervals are found. A southwestward shifting of the main fluvial system is observed from the thickness trend of the shallower aquifer intervals. A petrophysical evaluation is made to analyze the properties of the potential aquifer that encompass net to gross thickness (N/G), average porosity, and average permeability. The deeper potential aquifer has a higher clean sand N/G, but lower average permeability, that might be caused by the compaction, and mineral precipitation after the inversion period, especially in the highly inverted area. In the end, a recommendation to place a pair of production and injection wells are proposed based on the high accumulation of sand-rich intervals, sufficient depth to produce heat &gt;70<sup>o</sup>C and absences of the fault. The wells are placed toward SE-NW trend which is parallel to the distribution of the main fluvial distribution and the orientation of the faults, with production well placed at the deeper level. <br","Geothermal Energy; geothermal doublet; Geothermal reservoir; fluvial deposits; Geology; Reservoir sedimentation; Late Cretaceous","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way to investigate the fast motor learning brain dynamics is with use of electroencephalography (EEG). This non-invasive and mobile technique records continuous electrical activity on the brain cortex with a high temporal resolution. Although there has been considerable research into motor learning in humans, the mechanisms behind movement acquisition and execution are still largely unknown. A better understanding of motor learning is relevant to treatment and training in neurorehabilitation and sports medicine. The aim of this study was to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms behind motor skill learning compared to motor execution. Motor skill learning is defined as the acquisition of a complex movement sequence by improving accuracy without comprising on speed. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms behind motor skill learning, 128-channel EEG was recorded in 20 young, right-handed, healthy participants while performing a motor skill learning task and a motor execution task. With use of adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA), time-frequency analysis and equivalent dipole fitting source localisation, functional neurophysiological correlates of motor skill learning were investigated. Due to an excessive amount of electrical bridged electrodes, 12/20 participants were excluded from further analyses. In the 8 remaining participants, a cluster of independent components of electrical activity was located on the left primary motor cortex. In the motor learning task, lower β-frequency power was found in these components compared to the control task. This suggest that motor execution could be distinguished from motor learning on EEG by means of β activity in the left primary motor cortex. The results of this study can be used for future research on motor skill recovery in rehabilitation, motor learning in sports medicine and research on interventions to enhance motor learning, like non-invasive electrical brain stimulation.","motor skill learning; EEG; Independent component analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are yet no accurate in vivo techniques that can capture and deliver data in real time. Therefore, the main objective of the research reported in this thesis was to introduce and validate a polyethylene insert with integrated wear sensors into knee implants that could be used in vivo after total knee replacement surgery. The instrumented insert was expected to help physicians and patients to acquire accurate wear information about the knee implant for an objective outcome evaluation of the intervention and to help to prevent excessive implant deterioration over time. <br/> A mechanical test setup with different parts of a knee implant was built. First, the positions where the highest forces would act on the implants, were determined by integrating resistance sensors in the test setup. The results of this test were used to determine the positions of the wear sensors, since the tibiofemoral forces correlate with the amount of the wear of the insert. Then, the insert with integrated wear sensors was produced by filling six cutouts in the insert with silver conductive paint and creating six tracks in three different layers. When the resistance of the track would be infinite, the track should be worn-out. This prototype was tested in the same test setup.<br/> The resistance values of the conductive tracks were measured to range from 40.3 to 128.4 Ω. After 6732 and 9974 cycles, the highest track on the medial and lateral sides, respectively, became damaged by the moving femoral head. The resistance of the tracks rose immediately to be infinite. Measuring the wear track with a caliper gave a value of 0.65 mms, which was deeper than the pre-determined track depth. The following tracks gave similar results. <br/> One of the limitations of the present study concerned the movement of the knee. Since the test setup was only made of a hinge, it could not be compared with a whole knee movement that also contains translation. Thereby was the prototype only suited for in vitro tests due to the materials choice and lack of a data transmitter. Since the prototype was made by hand, the layer thickness could not exceed the minimum of 0.6 mm and were the layers glued on each other. This made the wear measuring method not as accurate as wished. Nevertheless, the wear pattern corresponded well with the expected wear caused by the tibiofemoral forces. <br/> All in all, the insert with integrated silver conductive tracks is a concept that can be translated into a good solution to measuring wear in vivo in the near future. For the further development of this concept, the insert should be printed completely on a 3D printer. Thereby, more research should be performed on materials that could be used as conductive tracks, the possibilities to integrate more wear sensors to measure wear more accurately and the transmission of signals. <br","3D printing; Knee implant; Insert; Sensors; Wear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-12","","","","","",""

An era in which more and more things are becoming smart including the cars that we see around us. This technology will soon bring us new services like car- and ridesharing with autonomous capabilities. Big brands like Renault and Audi expect self-driving cars on the road around 2022. Nevertheless, a lot of questions remain unanswered. One of these questions is the adaptation of the interior to self-driving technology. What will we do, when we do not have to drive anymore? Every OEM has a different answer to it and a study was done in this project that shows that we will spend our time doing activities like sleeping, eating, working, socializing, using in-car entertainment or being private while daily commuting in this private ride-sharing car with friends or family members. <br/><br/>The second question that probably pops-up in your mind right now is how this interior will enable this. The solution provided in this thesis exists out of a mechanical rail system that enables different seating layouts which ensures that all occupants (in most cases this will be two) can enjoy the activities that they do during commuting to the utmost. Imagine that you want to have some private time while your friend is sleeping. He wants his personal space in the rear and does not want to be seen by you while sleeping. Besides that, he desires to feel safe and wrapped around by the interior. All this is possible thanks to the simplistic mechanism that resulted after a lot of iteration with the client. <br/><br/>The third question relates to the rituals that people have during these activities. Before sleeping people tend to read a book or watch something on the tablet and slowly fade away. These kinds of rituals show that the interior should provide solutions like a foldable table and space in which they can store their small or big luggage, when not in use. A creative session resulted in a cabin package which was used as a reference during the interior design. This session looked at the required stuff that people take with them during commuting which creates an atmosphere that feels like a second living room. <br/><br/>The design of the interior has function over form. Every part is designed with a specific scenario in mind while the aesthetic laws of automotive design were used, like indexing and coherent shapes. The design inspiration came from the interior philosophy of BMW, a visual comparison of current living rooms and a collage, in which the aim was to bring a design which has a nice harmony between simplicity and complexity with a balance of geometric and organic shapes.

The study shows that mass media has important role in spreading information to speed-up the adoption, more importantly in providing initial knowledge to households that have not had interest on PV yet. The role of information is further shown as there is indication that households' interest tend to increase with more knowledge available on the internet, and at the same time, leads to the increase of adoption rate. A crucial role of communication channel is to draw PV installer together with potential adopter.

In the Netherlands this is, for instance, reflected by the growing amount of extreme rainfall events. This creates big issues for water management authorities like water boards. Water boards are often responsible for local streams, that cannot handle the peak discharges caused by extreme rainfall. This raises the question whether measures have to be taken, for instance by creating additional storage areas to decrease discharge peaks. For questions like these computational model studies can be used to gain insight in the distribution of discharges and water levels.<br/><br/>During these model studies often one-dimensional models are used. Recent developments made two-dimensional modelling, including for instance the simulation of inundation, possible for regular users like water boards. Two-dimensional modelling is proved to be more accurate for rivers, compared to one-dimensional modelling. Water boards, however, often deal with water systems of smaller scale. This raises the question whether it is worth for authorities like water boards to invest their resources in this new modelling approach. Several physical system properties are of influence on the answer to this question. Therefore, the main question of this research is:<br/><br/>Which physical processes are of influence to the choice of a modelling approach, one or two dimensional, for the modelling of stream systems in particular situations?<br/><br/>The methodology of answering this question consists of three major parts:<br/><br/>1) identify possible differences in the model properties of 1D versus 2D modelling;<br/>2) analyze the output of test models to see whether the differences in model properties actually influence the effects of physical processes; and<br/>3) analyze a case area to see whether these processes are important in practice.<br/><br/>The research scope consists of the hydrodynamics of systems with a length scale of 10^3 – 10^5 m and a temporal scale of hours to a few days. This range corresponds with a range in discharges of a few cubic meters per second up to a few thousands of cubic meters per second. The choice for this range has been made to be able to analyze the effects between the scales of streams and rivers, as until now mostly rivers have been modelled using 2D modelling approaches.<br/><br/>The starting point of this research has been the analysis of differences in model properties. The used flow equations, numerical methods, computational grids and bathymetry implementation are analyzed and the differences are discussed. Concluding, it can be stated that there are differences, which may be of influence to the model output. The main differences are the number of dimensions on which the flow equations are calculated and the way the bathymetry is schematized by the computational grid.<br/><br/>Using these differences, physical parameters have been specified that were varied in a range of test models. These are mainly the parameters that cause 2D effects, like meandering and varying roughness coefficients. The modelling of flood waves could also cause differences due to the fact that the 1D model is not able to model storage with the used default settings. Lastly, the way the bathymetry is used in the simulations is of great importance, due to the way the bathymetry is discretized in 2D models. The goal of varying these physical properties is to analyze whether these variations would influence the quantity of the effects the differences in model properties are causing. Comparing the output of both a 1D and 2D model, it appeared that there are significant differences in the observed water levels. Generally speaking, the following observations were made:<br/><br/>1. The smaller the simulated spatial scale, the larger the 1D-2D differences are<br/>2. The higher the meandering intensity, the larger the 1D-2D differences are<br/>3. The lower the summer bed roughness, the larger the 1D-2D differences are<br/>4. The larger the 2D grid cell size, the larger the 1D-2D differences are<br/>5. The smaller the flood wave duration, the larger the 1D-2D differences are<br/><br/>The underlying physical processes have been analyzed to see how their influence varies in different situations and for different spatial scales. In the end, six processes were found to be influencing the 1D-2D differences:<br/><br/>1. The effects of grid size on bathymetry discretization<br/>2. The water level and velocity difference in cross-sectional direction for varying roughness<br/>3. The water level and velocity difference in cross-sectional direction for varying meandering intensities<br/>4. The interaction between summer bed and floodplains<br/>5. The Boussinesq approach and consequences for the summer bed – floodplain flow area ratio<br/>6. The effects of storage<br/><br/>When combining the findings of the test models and the analysis of a small scale stream system, it was found that the above processes are of the most influence on the following situations:<br/><br/>1. In situations with a complex bathymetry the process of grid discretization is having the most influence.<br/>2. In situations with a high meandering intensity two physical processes are playing a role: high water level and velocity gradients in lateral direction, and a high summer bed – floodplain interaction.<br/>3. In situations with a very low roughness compared to the surrounding area two physical processes are playing a role: high water level and velocity gradients in lateral direction, and a high summer bed – floodplain interaction.<br/>4. In situations with a lot of elevation changes and open water bodies, a lot of potential storage is present.<br/><br/>In these four situations a 2D approach is preferred, as the physical processes that are present in these situations are all processes that are poorly implemented or represented by a 1D model. Of course, there are also some more practical considerations to be made about the modelling choice. The most important one is the research goal; whether inundation modelling is desired and what the required model output is. Another important consideration is the available time for running the simulations; 2D models have a significantly longer simulation time compared to 1D models.<br/><br/>All things considered, this research provides an overview of the differences in model properties between 1D and 2D modelling approaches, an analysis of the important physical processes that determine the choice of a modelling approach and some recommendations about practical issues one could encounter when performing a modelling study.","hydrodynamic; numerical; modelling; one-dimensional; two-dimensional; small-scale; stream; Molenbeek; physical processes; SOBEK; D-Hydro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Matras Recycling Europe (MRE) is an Utrecht based company that specialises in disassembling mattresses. MRE is able to recycle 250.000 to 300.000 of the 1,5 million mattresses. Most of the pieces that are separated from these mattresses can be re-used in other applications. The outside layer of a mattress, known as ticking, has not found a useful application yet. In this thesis, the possibilities are researched for the application of mattress ticking. The main research question is therefore: How can recycled mattress ticking be treated to design useful applications? At the start of this thesis the common solution for the re-use of ticking waste is to shred the material and press it into sheets. The name for these sheets is TEPA. It can be used as insulation in renovated or new floors in buildings. However, the amount of ticking waste is greater than the amount of TEPA used. This is also a reason to find another application for ticking waste. For recycling purposes it would be desirable to be able to separate the different materials For the most part it is made of polyesters, cotton and other natural fibres. At the moment this is hard and too expensive to separate these materials. Several other processing techniques where analysed to find a useful one for ticking waste. An adjustment is made to the existing processing technique by pulverizing the waste material into smaller pieces to create a material that is more homogeneous than TEPA. After the waste material is pulverized, a sheet can be pressed and a product proposal can be made. Acoustic wall panels are designed called Acoustic Ticking. During the production process several shapes and surface finishes can be pressed into the sheets. There are however a few factors to take into account. The flammability of the untreated Acoustic Ticking, just like TEPA, is high. This can be reduced by treating them with a solution that is also used for curtains and furniture. The other factor to take into account are the dimensions of the fibres to not be hazardous for people. The dimensions of polyester and natural fibres however are large enough for the human body to safely dispose of.<br/><br/>The design of the Acoustic Ticking could be improved by looking into other hanging systems for the panels, see what other shapes can be manufactured and if it in some way can be used as a construction material.<br/>The final result of this thesis is an acoustic panel that extends the life-cycle of ticking waste materials. This solution uses no virgin materials and fits the circular economy diagram made by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Also, the manufacturing of the acoustic panels has the possibility to process a large amount of ticking waste that would otherwise be incinerated.","Recycling; Circular Economy; Mattress; Ticking; Industrial Design Engineering; Integrated Product Design; textiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Furthermore, the Bremer halo ring is not customized.In the present project, a novel halo with a different tightening technique was designed, manufactured and evaluated with the aim of solving the above mentioned shortcomings of the Bremer halo.A Surface Tessellation Language (STL) file was generated from Computed Tomography (CT) images of a male cadaver head. Based on the desired ring stiffness and the geometry of a custom-designed halo for the cadaver head, a model was created in Solid Edge ST 10. The model was analyzed and adjustedby using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The customized halo ring was then produced by means of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and then equipped with strain gauges in order to derive the forces acting on the skull by the pins during tightening. The customized novel halo and the Bremer halo were compared with respect to moment arm and pin orientation, both influencing the local pin site behavior. The moment arms, pin positions and pin orientations of the 3D model of the novel halo were validated in reality by consecutive application of the halo to the cadaver head. The halo was analyzed by measuring the pin force degradation over a period of 24 h, which was hypothesized to be caused by the visco-elastic behavior of the skull of the cadaver head. The tightening procedure was analyzed on a block of steel to determine the influence on the axial pin reaction forces.The novel halo showed smaller and more consistent lengths of moment arm than the Bremer halo. Furthermore, one pin of the Bremer halo showed a difference of &gt;15° from 90°, which has been regarded as contributor to pin loosening. The novel halo was predicted to be able to keep sufficient axial pin force without pin re-tightening during the traction period. The intended axial pin forces of the novel halo were achieved with an accuracy of 94.5%.With the customized novel halo, pins were tightened based on the displacement of the C-contours, resulting in an increased accuracy of pin force during tightening. The anterior pins were designed to be located in the musculus temporalis region, thereby leaving no visible scars and to be less prone to loosening due to a lower anterior ring stiffness. In conclusion, customizing the halo ring brings opportunities toengineer and control important parameters which contribute to better wearing comfort, higher pin force accuracy and less pin loosening, although it is yet a costly and time-consuming procedure.","HGT; Halo; Gravity; Traction; Scoliosis; Customized design; Pediatric healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-13","","","","","","52.0862805, 5.1799357"

Governments, consumers, and investors have seen the prospect of Photovoltaic (PV) as a prominent technology to fulfill the electricity demand. For the residential-scale PV system,costs of the PV module(s) and the BoS (Balance-of-System) are usually the issue that discourage the consumers from installing PV system in their households. To tackle this issue, the concept of PV-Battery Integrated Module (PBIM) is developed. The operations of the PBIM are similar with typical operations of PV-battery system, which are controlled by the energy management unit. Energy Management System (EMS) is responsible for ensuring the safety of the electrical components and controlling the system operations to make it efficient. Therefore,implementing the suitable EMS is an integral part of establishing the PBIM system.<br/><br/>This research aims to implement a power flow management for the PBIM system to perform two energy management strategies, namely peak shaving and off-grid self-consumption. To achieve that goal, this research focus on selecting the PBIM system architecture, implementing control system and power flow management, and analyzing PBIM system performance on the applications of peak shaving and off-grid self-consumption strategies. Two case studies are introduced in this thesis, namely off-grid PBIM in Cambodia and grid-connected PBIM in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The chosen system architecture for the PBIM is the DC couple architecture. The PBIM system consists of one PV module, one unidirectional boost converter to perform MPPT and curtail operation, one bidirectional buck-boost converter to handle charging and discharging operation, an inverter to connect the PBIM with an AC load, and a battery bank. There are seven modes of operation in the PBIM system, which are utilized to perform peak shaving and off-grid self-consumption strategies.<br/><br/>For the off-grid PBIM in Cambodia, a 265Wp module and 8 batteries are used. The PV curtail operation is performed mostly during dry season, due to high irradiance. The LLP during rainy season (4%-7%) is much larger than the LLP during dry season (1%-3%), due to big difference in the irradiance between those two seasons. The total LLP for one year operation is 2.6%.<br/><br/>For the grid-connected PBIM in The Netherlands, a 265Wp module and 8 batteries are also used. The peak shaving is performed in this case, hence the battery is being charged during off-peak hours, and the load is supplied by the grid. During peak-hours, the load is supplied by the PV, battery, and the grid. For one PBIM, the system autarky can only a maximum of 16%, hence multiple PBIMs are required to increase the PBIM system autarky for the grid-connected PBIM in the Netherlands.","PV Systems; Power Flow Management; Battery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The signal is modelled by a template signal that represents one revolution of the recurring pattern, and that the frequency of this pattern can change at any time with no assumptions about local stationarity. The algorithm uses a constraint maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to estimate the phase of the recurring pattern in the time series. Using the dynamic programming techniques from the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, the solution is found in an efficient manner. The algorithm is applied to the digitization of meter readings from analog consumption meters. <br/><br/>As of today, analog consumption meters are still widely used to measure the consumption of gas, electricity and water. Often, smart home appliance use a simple reflective photosensor located on a rotating part of the meter to obtain information about the state of the consumption meter. The algorithm presented in this thesis accurately estimates the phase of the repeating pattern that occurs in the sensor observation when the meter rotates. Using this estimate, the signal of the photosensor can be converted to an estimate of the total resource consumption and consumption rate.<br/><br/>The algorithm improves in accuracy over conventional methods based on peak detection, and is shown to work in cases where the peak detection methods fails. Examples of this are signals where there is no distinctive peak in the signal or a signal where the recurring pattern is reversed.

In crowdsourcing, crowd workers annotate data samples according to one or more properties, such as the sentiment of a sentence, the violence of a video segment, the aesthetics of an image, ... To ensure quality of the annotations, several workers annotate the same sample, and their annotations are combined into one unique label using aggregation techniques such as majority voting.<br/><br/>When the property to be annotated by the workers is subjective, the workers’ annotations for one same sample might differ, but all be valid. The way the annotations are aggregated can have an effect on the fairness of the outputs of the trained model. For example only accounting for the majority vote leads to ignoring the workers’ opinions which differ from the majority and consequently being discriminative towards certain workers. Also, ML models are not always designed to account for individual opinions, for simplicity's or performance's sake. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, no method exists to assess the fairness of a ML algorithm predicting a subjective property. In this thesis we address such limitations by seeking an answer to the following research question: how can targeted crowdsourcing be used to increase the fairness of ML algorithms trained for subjective properties' prediction?<br/><br/>We investigate how annotation aggregation via majority voting creates a dataset bias towards the majority opinion, and how this dataset bias in combination with the current limits of ML models lead to an algorithmic bias of the ML models trained with this dataset and unfairness in the model’s outputs. We assume that an ML model able to return each annotation of each user is a fair model. We propose a new evaluation method of the ML models' fairness, and a methodology to highlight and mitigate potential unfairness based on the creation of adapted training datasets and ML models. <br/>Although our work is applicable to any kind of label aggregation for any data subject to multiple interpretations, we focus on the effects of the bias introduced by majority voting for the task of predicting sentence toxicity. <br/><br/>Our results show that the fairness evaluation method that we create enables to identify unfair algorithms and compare algorithmic fairness, and the final fairness metric is usable in the training process of ML models. The experiments on the models point out that we can mitigate the biases resulting from majority voting and increase the fairness towards the minority opinions. This is provided that the workers’ individual information and each of their annotations are taken into account when training adapted models, rather than only relying on the aggregated annotations, and that the dataset is resampled on criteria according to the favoured aspect of fairness. We also highlight that more work needs to be done to develop crowdsourcing methods to collect high-quality annotations of subjective properties, possibly at low-cost.","Fairness; Crowdsourcing; Machine Learning; Dataset bias","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Web Information Systems","",""

With a constant increase in the installed power capacity, wind plays a key role in the global energy framework. The improvement of the technology opens up new targets for the wind development [28]. In particular, the installation of small wind turbines in the urban environment represents a promising solution to supply residential power. Whilst, some of the problems faced by large-scale wind farms, like losses in the electrical distribution and transportation system, can be reduced. However, the immaturity of the technology leads to elevated capital costs and technical challenges [41]. Among these disadvantages, the siting near human activities is limited by the sound emitted by small wind turbines [65]. <br/>The current work focuses on the aerodynamic noise produced by horizontal-axis small wind turbines. For this purpose, the rotational beamforming algorithm, ROSI (i.e. ROtating Source Identifier), together with microphone array measurements, have been used. The ability of the method to follow the movement of the sound source is essential to correctly localize and quantify the rotating sound source. ROSI is applied in the time domain: first, for every source position a time history reconstruction of the signal recorded at each microphone is performed. Then, the microphone signals are sampled for every emission time, leading to the de-Dopplerisation of the signals. Last step is to sum all de-Dopplerised signals and to repeat this procedure for each scan point [33]. <br/>In order to validate the technique, the ROSI performance has been investigated with an increasing degree of uncertainty: initially, under ideal and know conditions with simulated datasets and, then, applying ROSI to experimental data. The results of the simulations show that ROSI is not influenced neither by the rotational speed of the source or by the selected time snapshot. Furthermore, the differences in the beamformed results always agree with the differences in the source level, proving that ROSI can be used to compare different blade or turbine geometries. Additionally, the ROSI performance is in agreement with the Rayleigh limit. In fact, if the spacing between the sound source is below the Rayleigh limit, the sources are not distinguished as separated and their SPLs are not correctly estimated. As regards the experimental approach, a small-scale prototype simulating the acoustic of a small wind turbine was tested in the Anechoic Tunnel facility while an upwind turbine was measured in the Open Jet Facility, varying both the wind speeds of the tunnel and the rotational speed of the blades. The two facilities are located at the TU Delft University. During the first experiment, the measurement geometry is verified and the resulting outcomes are compared with the simulations. It is confirmed both that the rotational speed does not limit the ROSI performance and that the source localization and quantification are affected by the Rayleigh limit. As regards the last experiment, the ROSI uncertainty is investigated in a non-anechoic environment. In the range of frequencies where the wind turbine noise is expected (i.e. 500 Hz - 2000 Hz [60]), the high levels of background noise do not allow to localize and to quantify the main noise sources in the small wind turbine. Thus, the wind turbine noise is not assessed and the experimental data are not compared with the analytical noise models, provided in literature. <br","Beamforming; Small wind turbine; Aeroacoustic; Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Order picking is one of the last tasks that is done by humans in warehouses, because humans are flexible with respect to the large variability and changeability in items. However, it is a labour intensive and monotonous task, resulting in fatigue and a shortage of order picking personnel. This motivates the development of automated pick-and-place systems.<br/>One of the challenges for such systems is the heterogeneity of items. In warehouses there is a big diversity in items so the system has to be able to deal with all of them. Another challenge is dealing with items that are deformable. Current systems often make use of suction cups but integrating sensors that can be used to handle deformable items is hard. Fingered robotic grippers have more potential in grasping these kind of items, but grasping deformable items is one of the least addressed topics in robotics. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to design a control strategy for a fingered robotic gripper to grasp and hold deformable items in a pick-and-place task.<br/>Inspired by the underlying principles that humans use to execute a pick-and-place task, a multi-level controller is proposed for a three-fingered gripper with capacitive pressure pads. The multi-level controller consists of a low-level computed torque controller and a high-level numerical optimisation based extremum seeking controller. The computed torque controller uses an internal model of the kinematics and dynamics, which is derived with screw theory, to compute the torques required to comply with the fundamental grasping constraint and the setpoint on the gripping force. The controller is tuned in such a way that the grasp quality is maximised, given a constant reference gripping force. Because of the fact that the properties of the items are unknown, an intelligent control system has to be able to determine the gripping force setpoint autonomously. This is the task of the high-level controller, that uses tactile sensors to derive the slip. This slip is used to determine the setpoint on the gripping force that the low-level controller has to follow, while maximising the grasp quality and not damaging the products as a result of applying excessive gripping force. <br/>The proposed control strategy is tested and tuned in a simulation environment. The pick-and-place task is executed for the products from a virtual product inventory. The controller is optimised with respect to the control goal on a wide variety of deformable items. Designing controllers according to the proposed principle will increase the diversity of items that can be handled in a pick-and-place environment, while increasing the quality of the grasp and minimising the risk of damaged products.","Control; Strategies; Grasping; Deformable; Items; Gripper; Pick and Place Robot; Item picking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, the flame temperature and equivalence ratio are the most important parameters that has to be studied to infer the combustion efficiency and emissions from combustion. Combustion reactions in flames give rise to the formation of various intermediate radicals, some of which are chemiluminescent by nature. The relative intensity of optical emissions from chemiluminescent radicals such as OH*(the asterisk is used as a notation for electronically excited states), CH* and C2* can be used for flame thermometry and spatial analysis of flame structure in hydrocarbon flames. The C2* radical and CH* radical is emphasized upon in this study for the analysis of laminar premixed hydrocarbon flames. Spatial distribution of these radicals is mapped from their chemiluminescence signals and recorded across various zones of the flame using a fiber optic bundle to capture incoming photons, a Czerny-Turner spectrometer encompassing a diffraction grating for optical dispersion and a CCD detector to record the spectrum. Local flame spectra recorded in the reaction zone of methane/air flames are known to exhibit strong emission signals from OH*, CH* and C2* radicals. The peak intensity ratios of these radicals in the reaction zone are functions of local equivalence ratio. To sum up, spectral intensity measurements of such chemiluminescent radicals serve as tools for analyzing the local flame stoichiometry and for the measurement of local flame temperature.<br/>In this thesis work, an experimental set-up is proposed to capture the spectral signals of a premixed, laminar, methane-air Bunsen flame at various spatial locations across the geometry of the flame.

The TMF performance of the current SiMo variant used to manufacture exhaust manifolds - SiMo 5.10 (C-3.25Si-4.45Mo-0.76), is compared with that of the variants SiMo 4.05 (C-3.22Si-4.66Mo-0.56) and SiMoNi (C-3.3Si-4.5Mo-1Ni-1.3) by performing three out-of-phase (OP) TMF test series under partial constraint conditions. A benchmark TMF test series in the temperature range: 50 ˚C to 550 ˚C with a hold time of 30 s at 550 ˚C showed that SiMo 5.10 had relatively better performance due to development of lower mechanical crack driving forces compared to other variants. However, a long holding time of 600 s at 550 ˚C saw a larger decrease of average TMF lifetimes for SiMo 5.10 than that of SiMo 4.05 despite similar crack driving forces. An investigation of the stress relaxation during TMF of the two variants showed that the SiMo 4.05 performs better during long hold time due to better stress relaxation properties. The SiMoNi variant which is very brittle at low temperatures was found to fail by a fracture by overloading mechanism taking over quite early in the fatigue cycle; which is confirmed by examination of the fracture surfaces and numerical estimations. This also explained the low lifetimes and scatter in previously performed TMF tests under total constraint conditions. The TMF test series performed in the temperature range: 150 ˚C to 550 ˚C with a hold time of 30 s at 550 ˚C found that a heat-treatment seemed to reduce the TMF performance of the SiMo 5.10 variant. Metallographic investigations and hardness measurements of as-cast and heat-treated materials revealed that the distribution of the Mo-rich phase from the grain boundary regions into the matrix due to an annealing heat-treatment seemed to affect the TMF performance.","Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue; SiMo Nodular Cast iron; Fracture Mechanics; Exhaust Manifold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

A controller, in an open-loop setting, operates based on the velocity of the wind flow, predicted by a wind farm model. For a controller to achieve the desired level of power production, a wind farm model has to be accurate and computationally tractable. <br/><br/>Generally, high-fidelity wind farm models are accurate but are computationally complex, making real-time control infeasible. This issue can, however, be addressed by employing closed-loop approach. In this approach, low- or medium-fidelity wind farm models, which are computationally tractable, are used, and their accuracy Is improved by employing an estimator.<br/><br/>In the previous researches, a centralized estimation approach was employed. In this framework, a single estimator is employed for estimating all the states (second-to-second wind field at turbine hub height) in a wind farm. Simulation results show that the accuracy of an open-loop model can be improved. However, the problem is the state size of the wind farm models. This leads to the objective of the thesis, which is “Can the accuracy of a wind farm model be improved while maintaining computational tractability?”. <br/><br/>In this thesis, distributed estimation is proposed as a solution to this problem. The basic idea behind distributed estimation is to distribute a wind farm into a number of small spatial domains (subsystems), and define a wind farm model for each of these subsystems to independently predict the wind flow in their respective spatial domain. For estimation, each sub-system employs an estimator to independently estimate their respective states, in parallel. In this thesis, based on the extent to which the states are estimated (measurement-update), model distribution, and size of the subsystems, four types of distributed architectures are devised, using the medium-fidelity model WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). Simulations show negligible loss in performance, and at the same time, the time taken for each iteration decreases drastically, making it computationally tractable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, distributed architectures are capable of improving the accuracy of the open-loop wind farm models, to the same level of accuracy offered by the centralized architecture, while maintaining computational tractability. Additionally, application of these distributed architectures for controller design will be a scope for future research in this topic.<br","state estimation; Kalman Filter; extended kalman filter; wind farm model; closed-loop wind farm control; WFSim; Distributed estimation; Distributed Control; Data fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The applications of computer vision are mostly found within the domain of robotics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's. The use of computer visions in precision industry is new and offers both opportunities and challenges. In high performance precision systems the demands on sensors is set high in terms of precision, delay and sample rate. In previous work a computer vision sensor was developed for the control of a microscopy stage. This development opened a path for computer vision sensors in precision systems. However, the limitations of computer vision sensors are challenging in the domain of control. A computer vision sensor needs to process an image before it can estimate the position of an object. This processing requires time which introduces a time delay into the control system. Due to the nature of the computer vision algorithm and computing devices, the delay in the sensor is time varying. Furthermore, since a controller typically requires a tenfold sample rate of the control bandwidth the limited frame rate of computer vision sensors imposes additional challenges. <br/>In previous work, the delay and limited sample rate of the computer vision sensor limited the control bandwidth of a microscopy to 0.87Hz in translational range. Since high performance precision systems require higher bandwidths a new computer vision sensor is developed in this thesis. An existing microscopy stage is used to test the performance of a computer vision sensor. Ground vibrations in a laboratory environment have a peak value at 10Hz which defines the target bandwidth. In order to reach this target bandwidth a new computer vision sensor is proposed. The sensor uses a cost-effective camera and a computer to run the computer vision algorithm. <br/>By decreasing the delay from 60ms to 10ms a control bandwidth of 7Hz, using PID, is obtained in this work. Since the target bandwidth is 10Hz time delay compensation is considered to improve the performance. By implementing a Filtered Smith Predictor the target bandwidth of 10Hz is reached. The maximum control bandwidth of the controller, 15Hz, was derived in order to inspect the limit of computer vision sensors in precision systems.","Computer Vision; precision positioning; Control; mechatronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Energy-research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and the Danish Technical University (DTU) have conducted the ScanFlow campaign in the winter of 2016/2017 to study the inflow wind field of one of ECN's research turbines by deploying multiple lidar instruments. One of the instruments used in this campaign was a SpinnerLidar. A SpinnerLidar is a forward looking, nacelle-mounted, continuous wave wind lidar system. It measures Line-of-Sight components of the wind in a plane 60 meters in front of the turbine, which need to be transformed into 3D wind vectors. To do so necessary assumptions were made about the free inflow periods, namely that a vertical shear is present and that a wind direction misalignment is more likely than horizontal deviations in wind speed. With these applied assumptions the 3D wind components were determined and used in a validation study with a pulsed lidar instrument, the WindCube V2. The proposed method seems robust as a high correlation in wind speeds at hub-height between two distinctly different lidar systems was found. Using the validated SpinnerLidar measurement to find the turbulent characteristics of the free inflow wind field resulted in turbulence intensity plots showing a higher turbulent component in the lower regions of the measurement plane. Also indications for a induction zone are visible in the SpinnerLidar measurements when compared to the WindCube measurements.","spinnerlidar; inflow wind field; scanflow; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this method, a representative volume element (RVE) is assigned to a macroscale material point and the constitutive law for the macroscopic model at that point is obtained by solving a boundary value problem on the RVE. Among the conventional boundary conditions, the so-called strong periodic boundary conditions tend to converge faster towards the actual microstructural response. Nonetheless, applying strong periodic boundary conditions to a batch of 48 fiber-matrix RVEs under uniaxial load with varying orientations introduces a dependency between the average ultimate principal stress (σ<sub>1</sub>) and the orientation angle (θ). <br/><br/>This treatise investigates the effects on this dependency by applying so-called weak periodic boundary conditions instead. These boundary conditions soften the strong requirement of periodicity of displacements at the RVE boundary by coarsening the traction mesh and requiring periodicity to hold only in an average sense over this coarser mesh. Three main questions are asked: Do weak periodic boundary conditions alleviate the dependency between σ<sub>1 </sub>and θ? Is this dependency the result of RVEs prone to localization under shear? Do smaller coarsening factors widen the range of θ over which localization with a single shear band is permissible? Overall, it is concluded that only the weakest form of weak periodic boundary conditions reduces the dependency between σ<sub>1</sub> and θ, which is indeed caused by RVEs that are prone to strain localization under shear, particularly towards θ = 45<sup>o</sup>. Increasing coarsening factors quickly introduce stricter periodicity requirements, thus limiting the possibility of strain localization with a single shear band at angles other than θ = 45<sup>o</sup>. Recommendations are provided to alleviate the dependency between σ<sub>1</sub> and θ as well as how to more realistically model the behavior of RVEs used in this research.","multiscale methods; weak periodic boundary conditions; representative volume element; uniaxial stress; shear localization; micro-periodicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the future, robots equipped with AI will behave an act similarly as humans do, and this raises concerns about how they are going to be governed. However, scientists are alerting that not enough attention is paid to AI from a sociotechnical point of view. Intelligent systems can already behave in unexpected ways, make unfair decisions or treat data with bias. The consequences of this behaviour can directly harm humans, and researchers agree that much more research should be done. <br/>One of the applications of AI is combining it with Robotic Automation Solutions. RAS is a form of business process automation that combines both AI and software robots. The simplest application of RAS is known as Robotic Process Automation. <br/>More complex RAS solutions are not yet mature enough to be implemented widely. However, research shows that they may be mainstream in less than five years. This research will focus on RPA to be prepared for the more advanced solutions in the future. <br/>Because of the newness of RPA and the multiple challenges currently not solved, it has been neglected the need to have a proper scientific methodology to model an RPA implementation. The objective of this thesis is to develop a model that allows to analyse the roles involved in an implementation of an RPA project and to assess the accountability of the roles involved. <br/>The model is formed of four main phases. (1) requirements and analysis, (2) development, (3) testing and (4) deployment and governance. Each of these phases comprises different activities. The activities always have two roles assigned; a requestor and an executor. These roles have also been identified, and their responsibilities explained. Special attention has been paid to the accountability relationship between both roles in each activity. The research also covers a discussion of the types of accountability seen in the case studies. <br/>Finally, the research also contributes to the views on how RPA would change with the increase and improvement of AI technologies. An analysis on how the model would change if AI becomes very advanced is introduced. <br/>The practical contribution of the research has been (i) the creation of an IT artefact to assist and facilitate the implementation of RPA projects by detecting the activities and roles required, (ii) a methodology to identify and assess accountability relationships depending on the characteristics of the roles and activities involved and (iii) a discussion on how AI may evolve in the future and, more specifically, how the IT artefact will have to be modified to cope with it.

The architecture of the deposits is determined by both autogenic (internal) and allogenic (external) controls on the fluvial system and its deposition of sediments. However, the extents to which each of the two controls have an influence and how they interact in fluvial systems, is not sufficiently known for predicting the architecture of the deposits. Allogenic astronomical cycles have a trend which can be extracted from the deposits, leaving autogenic variability. This thesis means to find the lateral and vertical persistency of externally-driven floodplain deposits and their relation to the fluvial sands. Photogrammetry panels of the Early Eocene Willwood Formation (Bighorn Basin, USA) have been interpreted, a formation in which previous studies have found a pattern matching precession, one of the astronomical cycles. The formation consists of two floodplain facies in successions, together with a sandstone channel facies. Previous researches focused on the floodplain successions stratigraphically and only limited on the sandstones; this thesis means to find the lateral and vertical persistency of the floodplain successions and how these sandstones relate to the successions. The two floodplain facies, overbank deposits and heterolitics, form successions with an average thickness of 6.9m and standard deviation of 1.3m, measured over a maximum distance of 3.0km parallel and 2.8km perpendicular to the paleoflow direction. The longer the distance along which the successions are measured, the larger the range and standard deviation of an individual succession is and the more the average thickness converges to the average thickness of 6.9m. The average thickness over the 28 successions indicates a cyclicity period of 20.9kyr, matching precession cyclicity. The sandstones are subdivided into two classes based on their thickness: minor and major. The minor sands are observed to occur in the heterolitics layer of the floodplain successions. The average major sandbody thickness is 14.0m with a standard deviation of 3.9m, based on 13 bodies. Though most being multistory, it is thicker than results from previous research in the area. Opposed to the minor sands, there is not sufficient data and information on the major sands to confirm a depositional model. For the floodplain successions steps have been made to predict their behavior; once there is sufficient data to determine the role of the sandstones, prediction of the full alluvial architecture is enabled.","Willwood Formation; Bighorn Basin; autogenic; allogenic; fluvial deposits; Milankovitch Cycles; orbital climate change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-18","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

An industrial use case is made possible by the availability of anonymized user interaction data on curation-based personalized music television system provided by XITE, a music video television broadcasting company in Amsterdam. The characteristics of the curation-based system motivates us to explore the effects of user behavior and feedback on two tasks: session reranking and like prediction task. For the session reranking task, an improvement, in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP), is achieved by leveraging behavior toward playback of repeated item consumption, together with the implicit user preference which is inferred from personalized average playback ratio for each video. Three types of feedback are used for the `like' prediction task: explicit feedback when user presses like on a video, and implicit feedback in the form of skipping and watching a video completely. A multi-level sampler within Bayesian Personalized Ranking algorithm is used to exploit those types of feedback, and an improvement is obtained compared to using only one type of explicit feedback. Finally, considering common behavior that people often turns on the television while not actively paying attention to it, we show that performing heuristic cut-off, by only considering few music videos watched completely after an active action is taken by the user on the system as positive implicit feedback, could improve the MAP compared to assuming positive implicit feedback for all videos watched completely by the user.","recommender systems; music video television; user feedback; user behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These foundations are caissons with a set of properties which are different with respect to other caisson types. The number of constructed caissons is large and the timeframe for construction and transportation from land into water is small when these foundations are applied on commercially scaled offshore windfarms. In general, an offshore wind farm is constructed within two years and all GBFs must be constructed and transported into the water in a tight time schedule. <br/><br/>To accomplish the construction and installation of a large number GBFs in a tight timeframe, a new design method is developed. A realistic case study is composed and the target is to construct and install 64 GBFs in front of the Belgium coast in a timeframe of 2 years. <br/>Two designs are considered, a materialefficient design and a design which is optimized regarding the constructability. <br/><br/>When the GBF-design is known, the transportation method from land into water is considered. According to the decision matrix, developed in the literature study, the only feasible method is to apply a semi-submersible vessel. However this solution is quite expensive, whether the storage location is at the construction area or in the sea. Due to the large costs a new alternative method could be feasible. Several new ideas are created and the most promising solution is ‘The immersion structure’. <br/><br/>Because time is the most important factor, the construction planning and construction area layout are considered. Three options are considered and the most optimal construction planning is chosen. On four locations the construction activities are optimized and with the use of a production line it is possible to construct the 64 GBFs in time with minimal use of area and equipment. Because of the small area left, the storage location cannot be designed on the construction area. <br/><br/>The design of the immersion structure consists of a platform which consists of H-beams and two concrete hollow legs. The immersion structure is innovative because it is placed directly on sand and no foundation works are needed. Due to the large capacity the main part of the caisson types can be transported. Because the structure is able to float it can be easily transported. <br/><br/>At last the construction and operational costs of the immersion structure are compared with the cost of renting a semi-submersible vessel. The semi-submersible vessel seems to be the best solution but when the immersion structure is applied at multiple projects it could be a profitable solution. The depreciation and interest costs for the immersion structure are calculated and the immersion structure is profitable when a minimal utilization rate of 22% is achieved during a service lifetime of 20 years. Depending on the market development and the amount of applicable caisson construction projects the immersion structure could be profitable. Comparing with the case study the immersion structure is profitable if three comparable projects are executed in the service lifetime.","Gravity Based Foundations; Caisson; Construction; Planning; Design; GBF; Transportation; Offshore wind; Wind energy; Wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.634,2.862"

They are the ones expected to bring a creative mindset to the involved people. <br/>LEF Future Center, part of Rijkswaterstaat since 2008, brings a contribution to the power of change and the problem-solving capacity of their stakeholders. They have a set of creative environments to properly stimulate participants during the facilitation sessions. This project, done in combination between TU Delft and LEF Future Center, focuses on supporting participants’ creativity during sessions at LEF. <br/>The creative diamond (Guilford, 1950) is the basis approach for facilitation sessions, distinguishing between participants’ divergence and convergence thinking. During the first, many ideas are generated, while comes to a final idea/decision when converging. It is common to let participants make use of different means to generate ideas, like whiteboards, sticking notes, and markers. It is known that people might underrate their own creativity, and the facilitators' work is to facilitate participants’ creativity. Written, visual and verbal communication is important to let participants express their ideas to each other during sessions. <br/>Besides the classical creative diamond, newer studies have shown the need to differentiate a step in-between the divergence and convergence phases (eg. Tassaul and Buijs; Kaner; Heijne and Smit). It is called revergence and aims to revisit and rearrange every generated idea during the divergence, by making clusters. A literature study was executed to investigate further developments in the creative diamond approach, as well as what influence people’s creativity. <br/>At LEF, facilitators let participants generate as many ideas as possible (when diverging), and to come up with a final solution to the indicated problem (when converging). Further investigation with context observations and interviews with facilitators was performed. It was confirmed that not every facilitator does the converging phase of the session, and that many are not aware of the reverging as a separate stage from converging. In the end, clusters of ideas can be created in a messy mean, leading to deliverables for clients that may not show the full creative potential of the session. <br/>As a way to stimulate participants’ generation of ideas and the creation of clusters, the design of the tool thus focuses on supporting facilitators to perform the revergence phase of sessions. Joining findings from both the literature review and context mapping, a promising direction was identified in the use of combination tools for the three phases of the sessions. Using rapid prototyping tests of the tools, a toolkit structure for performing the reverging phase was designed: the Clustalk toolkit.","creativity; creative facilitation; visualization; revergence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Phase measurements from SAR systems have seen widespread use in the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture (InSAR) technique to measure deformations and elevations since the late 1980’s (Hanssen, 2002). Since the late 1990’s an increase in radar-based change detection is observed, mainly relying on amplitude measurements (Ajadi et al., 2016; Dekker, 1998). The unpredictive multiplicative noise-like speckle, inherent to coherent SAR,makes change detection in SAR imagery difficult (Bamler, 2015). However, the advantages in the all-weather mapping capabilities and object penetrating properties of SAR make it a suitable remote sensing technique for certain applications, such as natural disaster damage assessment (Bruzzone and Prieto, 2000). Broadly speaking, change detection in SAR-based images usually consists of applying an operator on two spatially filtered SAR images to create a difference image (DI), which is then analysed for change points by thresholding and/or clustering (e.g. Alphonse and Biju, 2015). However, such an approach completely neglects the long-term stability of a pixel. When taking the temporal evolution of a pixel into account, the steep increase in data volume puts an emphasis on finding an optimal (’best practice’) approach to the multitemporal change point detection problem. Here it is shown that change point detection methods that properly take the temporal evolution of a pixel into account can provide good segmentation results in multi-temporal SAR data stacks, even in unfiltered stacks that preserve the complete spatial resolution and without considering the spatial context in a pixel’s direct neighbourhood. Moreover, it is found thatmore sophisticated change point detection algorithms don’t<br/>necessarily yield superior segmentation results for various discontinuity functions. This means algorithm selection has to be application driven. The results demonstrate that the suitability of algebraic methods in heterogeneous areas is limited, whereas proper time series analysis yields fairly consistent results over different land covers within the same image.

It is anticipated that change point detection in SAR imagery will shift away from the classical bi-temporal methodology and multi temporal approaches will become the norm, be it by decomposing multi-temporal stacks or time series analysis.","radar; SAR; change detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Dutch flood defences are subjected to the new Dutch safety assessment program (WBI 2017) that incorporates the latest insights and safety regulations. As a consequence of the updated piping assessment model, studies are expected to identify more piping prone areas in the Netherlands, which makes it worthwhile to investigate alternative piping mitigation solutions that could be less expensive. A new potential solution is the Pipingontspanner, which consists of relief wells in combination with a water catchment area. The Pipingontspanner relieves water pressure fromthe aquifer and uses the water as counter pressure against the Uplift mechanism, thereby reducing the likelihood of piping.<br/><br/>The study investigates the technical and economic feasibility of the Pipingontspanner as a piping mitigation measure. A problem analysis was used to identify the components that form challenges in realising the concept and pinpoint the research to the functioning, effectiveness and applicability of the Pipingontspanner concept. <br/><br/>A hydraulic model and a design approach demonstrate the functioning of the concept. The hydraulic model describes the flow underneath the dyke, through the well and towards the basin above it. A critical point for the flow calculation appeared to be the time-dependent interaction between the river and the basin water level, which leaves only numerical calculation methods to describe the problem. The numerical program Modflow was chosen to predict the Pipingontspanner groundwater flow by simulating a flood wave scenario for a green dyke with piping problems and implementing relief wells and a basin. A parametric design approach was followed to create a Pipingontspanner model that could obtain the optimal configuration for a measure that can only be calculated with a groundwater flow model. For the verification of design configurations, relevant failure mechanisms have been included in this model. For the selection of the optimal configuration, a cost-benefit analysis has been used as an evaluation criterion. The Pipingontspanner model creates, calculates, verifies and evaluates the different design configurations.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of the Pipingontspannerwas illustratedwith a sensitivity and a cost analysis. For a variety of subsoil and hydraulic conditions, the sensitivity analysis showed that the safety factor for Uplift increases substantially for higher permeability of the aquifers and slowly growing hydraulic loads. The influence of the cover layer permeability and storage coefficient is negligible on the performance of the Pipingontspanner. On the other hand, the costs analysis showed that well maintenance, well monitoring and basin dyke construction costs are the main cost drivers of the design. <br/>The total cost grows exponentially if the basin width behind the dyke is limited as the number of wells increases for smaller basins. <br/><br/>The applicability of the Pipingontspanner was demonstrated through a case study of a green dyke<br/>in Tiel with piping problems. In addition, the design and costs of the Pipingontspanner in Tiel were compared against a traditional piping berm measure to illustrate the economic feasibility of<br/>the concept. The results showed that the Pipingontspanner is not only able to mitigate the piping problem, but it does so with a smaller footprint and lower total cost than the piping berm. However, the case study also showed that limitations in the current groundwater flow model setup required an adaptation of the case geometry to prevent the drying up of the top layer cells, which would terminate the simulations.<br/><br/>The Pipingontspanner concept has proven to be technically feasible and economically competitive compared to the piping bermunder the conditions of:<br/>1. a permeable aquifer with a minimum transmissivity of 25 m^2/d;<br/>2. a minimum hinterland space of 10 m behind the dyke.","Waterontspanner; Pipingontspanner; WBI2017; Piping mitigation measure; MODFLOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

This has in turn compelled offshore structure fabricators to find cost effective ways of fabricating oil platforms and jackets, to stay competitive in the industry. In this research paper, three alternative configurations to the conventional jacket production process are explored. The configurations are derived from a morphological table that is designed to include major tasks and resources of the production process. To evaluate the effects of these options on performance of the production process, in terms of production time and cost, a simulation model is presented. During the validation of this model through cycle time of the preassembly and assembly sub-processes, high variations are observed. On further analysis, these discrepancies are attributed to the number of shared lifting resources, workspace utilization of the available fabrication area and release dates of orders of parts used in jacket production. To increase the accuracy of the model, these aspects must be modelled in more detail. However, to show the potential of the simulation model, the previously proposed configurations are evaluated and a possible alternative is proposed as a promising solution. Additionally, throughout this research, the potential of a simulation-based approach to explore new configurations for offshore jacket production is suggested. Together with the morphological table, this results in a novel decision-making tool which can be used by fabrication companies to indigenously explore new alternatives.","Offshore jacket; Oil and gas; Morphological table; Simulated one-off production; Automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","The reference numbers in the thesis are not sequential, however, they correspond to the correct citation in the bibliography.","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Brazier, F.M. (mentor); Amin Hoque, Bilqis (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh is one of the largest naturally occurring groundwater calamity in South Asia. The rural people, about 64% of the population (104 million people) suffer the most from this grand challenge as they are still heavily dependent on groundwater based tubewells which are arsenic contaminated. Government interventions to switch to other arsenic mitigation technologies such Piped Water Supply Systems have not been very successful despite the technology being a long-term feasible solution in arsenic-affected areas. Rural communities find it difficult to make the switch from tubewells to piped water due to issues of high costs, less demand and extensive monitoring requirements of these systems. To align itself with the SGD 6.1 (“Clean Drinking Water for All”) and with the aim to climb WHO/UNICEF’s JMP’s highest ladder for drinking water, the Government of Bangladesh has installed multiple Piped Water Schemes in water-stressed areas. These schemes are technically viable in water-stressed areas and financially supported by the World Bank, UNICEF, WHO and other global organisations. However, at community level, institutionally, they face the challenge of Adoptability and Sustainability. Taking a case study approach, this research aims to suggest strategies that can be implemented to increase community adoption and sustainability of Piped Water Supply Systems in the rural areas of Bangladesh to ensure arsenic-safe water in every household-tap. The goal is to provide institutional insights to a research organisation in Bangladesh. Two relevant methodologies for institutional analysis developed by Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom: The Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) and Ostrom’s Design Principles for Governance of Common Pool Resources, are used to tackle this problem. The IAD framework is applied at three different levels of governance (central-local and community) to study the gaps in policy implementation at three different phases of the design process “Planning-Implementation-Community Adoption of Piped Water Schemes”. The findings from the IAD suggest that there are defined gaps between actual policy outcomes and policy expectations. The outcomes of the IAD analysis at each level, are evaluated against six of Ostrom’s evaluation criteria. The design principles are then applied to each of the findings from the evaluation to bridge that gap between actual and desired policy outcomes. Three main design principles, a) Collective-Choice Arrangements, b) Graduated Sanctions and c) Nested Enterprises, support the development of new institutional reforms. Proposed institutional reforms, which are robust in nature, lead to suggesting strategies that that can help to increase rural community adoption and sustainability of piped water supply systems to ensure arsenic-safe water in every household-tap.","Piped Water Supply Systems; Adoptability; Sustainability; rural WASH; Arsenic Contamination in Bangladesh; Institutional Analysis; IAD framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Breukels, Jeroen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Wire rope slings are commonly used lifting tools in all sorts of engineering applications. Usually, slings are either loaded axially or they are bent around a load bearing element such as a shackle or pipe. In the latter case, the combination of bending and axial loading introduces additional stresses within the wire rope that cause a reduction in capacity. In the offshore industry, this reduction is currently taken into account using a safety factor recommended by standardization societies such as DNVGL and IMCA. However, the expression to derive this factor solely depends on the rope’s curvature around the bend. Given that steel wire ropes can come in many different geometric configurations and their behavior is nonlinear, it is questionable to assume that this reduction is only based on a single parameter. Consequently, the main research question of this thesis is:</p><p>How does the wire rope capacity reduction due to forced bending recommended by DNVGL and IMCA standards compare to analytical and experimental results obtained for wire ropes of different sizes and configurations?</p><p>The approach to answering this question starts with a literature study, creating a predictive analytical model and then performing experiments for validation. Findings from the literature study uncover the main parameters affecting wire rope behavior such as lay angles, wire diameters and stress-strain relations. With these insights, an analytical model is created to predict the reduction in capacity of steel wire ropes subjected to forced bending. The model analyzes individual wire behavior and then applies a failure criterion to determine when the entire rope cross-section would fail. Finally, small and full-scale experiments are conducted that test different rope configurations (6x25F-IWRC &amp; 6x36WS-IWRC) with different rope sizes (∅20 mm &amp; ∅77 mm).</p><p>Knowledge gained from the literature study, the analytical model and the experiments was combined to come up with conclusions pertaining to the main research question. It was found that rope configurations, specifically wire to rope diameter ratios, played a vital role in the capacity reduction of steel wire rope slings. Additionally, results indicate that the capacity of slings increases with higher lay angles. The results also indicated that expressions recommended by the standards are not conservative enough for certain curvature ranges and ropes. Building on the research question, several observations pertaining to rope ovalization and consistency of failure location raised ideas for further investigation.","Steel wire rope; forced bending; Capacity; Experiment; DNV; IMCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-26","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Its huge advancement is mostly driven by lowering the overall project cost and renewable energy targets which are set by the EU. One of the potential cost savers can be found in the foundation structure design in which the monopiles are the most used choice. The area from which the design of these structures can be improved is quite complex and it can be related to the field of Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction (DSSI). Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) has several damping sources but in the last few years soil damping phenomena has attracted a lot of interest within the offshore wind research community because it is believed that potential benefits can be achieved if the contribution of this damping source can be estimated with reliability. Offshore wind design codes do not provide a methodology for the estimation of this damping type and therefore there is a need for the research. For the purpose of soil damping estimation, a geotechnical Finite Element (FE) software – Plaxis 3D was utilized. Firstly, the chosen soil model was verified through the three-step verification process which involved a comparison between experimental field data and numerical data from Plaxis. Once successfully verified, the soil model is utilized further in the design of the simplified OWT structure which is exposed to the dynamic wave and wind loads based on the serviceability and ultimate limit conditions. What is of the particular interest leads to the free vibration phase and monopile positioning (position of structure at the start of free vibration) from which the necessary information regarding the decay of displacement amplitudes is obtained and further analysed with the logarithmic decrement method for damping estimation. Adding on soil damping, as part of research additional topics were also considered and they relate to soil behaviour and natural frequency. The final results are compared to the other research papers and they are found to be well within the proposed literature damping range which highly depends on a certain combination of monopile geometry, soil type and loading conditions. From the research it was concluded that soil damping value increases as the wave and wind loads increase. Also, it was proven that a damping potential in offshore wind exists and that eventually soil damping should be implemented in the future offshore wind design codes.","Damping; Soil Dynamics; Monopile; Offshore Wind; Natural Frequency; soil structure interaction; Sand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Local drug administration could be achieved with a drug delivery implant to reduce the amount of invasive procedures and to include useful features such as electrodes for monitoring neural activity. In this study an advancement is made towards spatial control of permeability in a membrane. Porous PDMS membranes were fabricated by replica molding in a 3D-printed mold. The smallest pore diameter was 100 μm and the thinnest membrane thickness was 160 μm. The permeability of such a membrane is tested by a dye which must go through the membrane in order to observe staining in 0.6% agarose gel to simulate diffusion of brain tissue. No staining was detected using pristine PDMS membranes. However, a fast flow from hydrophobic to hydrophilic side was observed in a PDMS membrane recently treated with plasma on a single side. Furthermore, slow diffusion of the dye was present in a less hydrophilic, dextran-modified membrane that received plasma treatment on one side as well. Thus, the permeability was controlled by the wettability of the membrane surface without modification of the entire inner pore. The same experiments were performed on a mouse brain to be compared to the results on agarose gel. The use of agar as a brain phantom material is useful for further investigation of a local drug delivery device, but a few improvements are required to better correspond to the brain.","Membrane; PDMS; Porous membrane; Wettability; Permeability; microfluidics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is specialized in transporting, installing and removing large offshore facilities. HMC operates three crane vessels. Two of which are semi-submersibles (Thialf and Balder), the other is the monohull Aegir. A third semi-submersible, the Sleipnir, is currently under construction. To ensure safe operations, make accurate fatigue predictions and extend operational windows, HMC relies on vessel motion calculations. Currently, vessel motion estimations are based on response amplitude operators calculated by the diffraction software package WAMIT. As HMC cannot rely on diffraction software in case of non-linear vessel motions, the need for a method capable of capturing non-linear effects arises.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to determine the potential of a neural network based model in predicting hydrodynamic behavior of semi-submersible crane vessels. Hindcast weather data, vessel motion measurements and model test data are used to train several different neural network architectures. The research into the potential of neural networks in predicting hydrodynamic behavior is split into two main categories: the frequency domain and the time domain.<br/><br/>Within the frequency domain, wave forecasts can be used to predict a response spectrum. The neural network in this case acts as a conventional RAO. In an artificial environment, four architectures are tested and the results show that neural networks are able to make accurate predictions in a fully linear environment. When tested on project data, where the vessel sails at operational draft, the neural network predictions shows a slightly higher accuracy than the diffraction based predictions for the specific test case. Another network is tested on transit data, where the vessel sails at an inconvenient draft. The results from these tests show that there is potential for a neural network to be used as a substitute for Response Amplitude Operators.<br/><br/>The time domain models focus on predicting ship response based on surface height signals and/or hindcast vessel motion measurements. The first model is trained and tested on model test data from an SSCV. The input of the neural network is surface height measurements and the output is pitch motion prediction. The model shows that it is capable of predicting both first and second order pitch motions.

SMPC strategies make use of the probabilistic description of uncertainty to define chance constraints which allow a certain admissible level of constraint violation. SMPC strategies require the initial state of a system to be within a particular set, referred to as feasibility set, probabilistically, such that the derived control input, when applied to the system, gives rise to states that are also within the feasibility set satisfying all chance constraints on the system. This leads to recursive feasibility of the SMPC strategy. Such strategies are restrictive in nature when the uncertainty in the system is unbounded, as in the case of White Gaussian noise. In such a case, the feasibility set is very small and leads to a strategy that is very conservative. To reduce this conservatism, some constraint violations are permitted. However, such violations affect the closed-loop behaviour of the system leading to performance degradation. This performance degradation can be quantified as a penalty on the system for violating constraints, and intuitively, it can be thought of as a risk taken by the system in that undesirable state. An approach following the exact penalty method is proposed using the CVaR function to determine the penalty cost. The same optimal solution as the original constrained problem is obtained from a single unconstrained minimization. Since accurate computation of the expected value of risk using the CVaR function is not possible, a scenario-based approximation of the CVaR is used to obtain an overall tractable and computationally efficient SMPC strategy. An extensive simulation study of the double integrator system is provided to present the functionality of the proposed method.","Stochastic Model Predictive Control; Conditional Value at Risk; Scenario Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

For computational efficiency, the previous atmospheric model is evaluated at monthly scale. In order to cope with the numerical instability, nearest neighbouring averaging interpolation is iteratively performed to smooth the solutions as a transitional approach. Therefore a subsequent study is conducted to investigate the origin of the numerical instability and whether there are feasible measures to fix the numerical problem of the modelling. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction, which briefly introduces the background and research question — Whether there is any possible remedy that can solve the numerical instability of the monthly-timestep regional water balance model and obtain convergent solutions? Chapter 2 contains 7 sections, each of which gives statement of the specific problem, the experimental method applied, the corresponding results and related discussions. It has been concluded from the series of experiments that — a. adding diffusion terms makes no sense; b. applying smaller fractions of wind helps alleviate instability but the applied monthly timestep length seems to make the model paradoxic and inherently not convergent; c. instability is not really relevant with the iterative method; d. after correcting a dormant error in previous research, the results gets no better; e. the model may be so oversimplified that cannot reflect the reality; f . wind and monstrous timestep length are the keys to the problem, especially the latter is more problematic. Chapter 3 summarizes the discussions and conclusions from chapter 2 and proposes several recommendations for future research such as trade-offs between model complexity and efficiency, a heuristic way of making wind endogenous and reconsideration of the model architecture.","regional atmospheric model; large timestep; numerical instability","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order for these operations to be successful weather windows characterized by certain permissive wave, wind and current conditions is of enormous importance, whereas unforeseen events result in high cost and risk in terms of safety.<br/>For that purpose, Deltares created Meteo Dashboard, an integrated software system that collects, stores, computes and presents measured and forecasted meteorological and hydrodynamic data for decision making of maintenance or installation activities in an offshore wind farm. The wind speed, as well as the air and water temperatures, result from a meteorological model and serve as an input for the numerical modelling (e.g. SWAN or Delft3D) of waves, water levels and current related parameters. To account for the inherited uncertainty, several error modelling techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Copulas, Stochastic Interpolation (SI), ARMA models, and Linear Regression (REG), already run operational on Meteo Dashboard and can be implemented in order for the numerical model forecasts to be corrected.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Vibrotactile wearable devices are a non-intrusive and inexpensive means to provide haptic feedback directly on the user’s skin. These devices utilize one or multiple vibrotactile actuators to generate vibrations across the skin and into the tissue. Combining these vibrations in amplitude can create the illusion of a funneled sensation on the skin at another location than at the actual sites of stimulation. This allows for the placement of virtual actuators on the skin, such that fewer actuators need to be deployed. However, the illusion does not take into account that the waves originating from the actuator attenuate and disperse due to the viscoelastic properties of the skin. We hypothesize that this diffusion of the elastic energy in the skin is affecting the perception of this illusion. Therefore, if we correct for the wave propagation speed, and temporally focus the stimulation, we hypothesized that the specificity of the stimulation on the skin could be drastically improved. In this paper, a novel technique, which is named the inverse filter technique, was introduced that enables to focus the amplitude, frequency and phase of vibrations to one location while cancelling them at the remaining nearby positions. We developed a wearable device for the volar surface of the forearm on which we could independently control arbitrary waveforms at any position between a set of four physical actuators. A human-subject study found that the performance in terms of localization confidence was improved significantly, whereas the precision and accuracy of the task did not improve compared to when we did not correct for the wave attenuation and dispersion. These results show that focusing waves towards a target location has a direct influence on our confidence of localizing vibrotactile stimuli on the arm. Therefore, we anticipate that our findings can benefit industries int Biorefineries are considered an integral part in the transition to sustainable bio-based economies as they can convert renewable biological resources into various bio-based products, while co-products are recycled and energy is produced out of the residuals. In this thesis, it is suggested to apply this biorefinery concept to revive the sugar industry of Jamaica, where currently only raw sugar is produced. For this, the development of a conceptual process design itself and the feasibility of the implementation is studied as the entire chain of utilizing biomass is influenced by both technical, environmental, social and economic aspects. With the Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework, the information obtained during the fieldwork about how (new) technologies function in the Jamaican agricultural industry are translated into context-specific design constraints. Those design constraints are used in the development of the context-specific conceptual process design for the Jamaican sugar industry. Three scenarios of the proposed design including the material balances and financial viability are discussed. The ""status-quo"" scenario predicts the bankruptcy of some of the sugar factories due to the reduced possibility to sell raw sugar, which will also leave the farmers without income. The ""engineering-view"" scenario was found to fail due to the unrealistic assumptions that all the products can be sold, that the farming yields can be improved, and that the Jamaican sugar sector can be seen as one. In the ""most-realistic"" scenario, it is considered that the energy generation from bagasse covers the energy demand for the processes and that the amount of plantation white sugar, anhydrous bio-ethanol and bio-pellets annually produced from 30,000 hectares of sugarcane land are considered to be 100,000 tonnes, 51 million liters, and 80,600 tonnes, respectively. It is suggested that this ""most-realistic"" scenario is able to revive the Jamaican sugar industry and to support the establishment of the sustainable bio-based economy, however the financial viability of the project and the inclusiveness of the various actors have to be taken into account.erested in including localized vibrotactile feedback on the human body surface.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

The project is done for the Delft Institute of Positive Design in collaboration with Marten van Doorn from Bartimeus. When glasses or contact lenses are not sufficient enough to correct someone’s vision, visually impairment is diagnosed. The Netherlands counts 345.000 people who are visually impaired or blind. On estimate, 2020 will count 380.000 visually impaired people (Keunen, 2011). This is an increase of 20% since 2009, due to aging and diabetes (Bartimeus, 2017).  Especially when it comes to mobility, visually impaired people (VIPs) are continuously challenged. They use a cane to detect passing obstacles and recognition points. However, the cane does not lead the route to these recognitions points which make the visually impaired in need for other assisting solutions. Dependency and autonomy seem to clash with each other: Assistive technologies provide additional certainty within the field of mobility but often taking away a piece of autonomy. Autonomy is defined as “freedom from external control or influence; independence” (Stevenson &amp; Lindberg, 2010). Being autonomous is a psychological need for well-being (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995), which will be the primary focus of this project. This result into the following assignment: Assignment Design a mobility tool for visually impaired people that lets them experience a feeling of autonomy. New developments seem to fail because of their distance from real-world settings (Loomis, Klatzky &amp;  Giudice, 2012; Maidenbaum, 2014). Besides, Loomis et al. states that many assistive technologies are a result of a solution to a practical problem and that the outcome is based on the type of engineering that is available. This approach to new product development is known as the engineering trap. Therefor the primary approach is to stay as close as possible to the real-world setting by designing for autonomy with empathy with the main goal to contribute to the well-being of visually impaired people in the field of mobility.  This is done by looking the context from different angels: : the own experience lens, the VIP experience lens ant the expert lens-  This is done by doing research and design explorations. These explorations create insights of VIP’s daily life -including benefits and struggles- required theoretical research, own experiences (as being visually impaired), observations and interviews. This resulted in a list of VIP superpowers, mobility mindsets, main mobility concerns, four dimensions of autonomy a list for characteristics for autonomous assistive tools. These insights are translated into an opportunity to design. In the current situation, being in control is an important aspect for VIPs to be able to know the route, walk smoothly and prevent mistakes, although the definition of autonomy is about freedom from external factors. There seems to be an opportunity to design for impulsivity within the mobility context. Therefore, the following question will serve as the leading question for the next explorations:  Opportunity Is there room for impulsivity while being in control? To be able to understand the meaning of impulsivity in the VIP mobility context, four cycles of design explorations are done. Every iteration loop starts with a different definition of impulsivity based on the previous iteration. Next, ideas are generated and evaluated on autonomy. These iterations resulted in the final impulsivity definition, the three design characteristics and the design goal. The definition of impulsivity states that; Impulsivity definition Make a small mental detour. In the current situation, VIPs have a number of fixed routes in their mind. They do need help in this route if they got lost in orientation due to distractions caused by noisy traffic, obstacle or noisy weather conditions. Mostly they ask for confirmation when they ask for help, to retake their control on their current orientation. It is established that one of the design characteristics describes that feeling autonomous is not about receiving less help, but it is about the type of help. So how can the design support VIPs in their mobility activity, instead of helping them?  If VIPs feel supported, it will open the possibility that there is no need for 100% focus. So they will walk their route as good as possible and have the possibility to make a small mental detour by paying attention to the unpractical elements of the route. Therefore, the following design brief is formulated:  Design brief Design a supporting device that illustrates the current position within a preprogrammed known route on demand, that opens the opportunity for a small mental detour by paying attention to the unpractical elements of the environment. The design translates this design goal into the concept design: Walkmen. The design Walkmen is a support tool which is a GPS connected voice recorder on your smart-phone. With Walkmen, you can track routes and create your mobility tool, which can be used as support tool. The design is tested from different perspectives: my own experience, VIP’s experience and experts’ discussion. The perspectives are the same as those used in explorations done at the beginning of the project. Overall, the tests made me realize that the need for concept design is urgent. People are intrigued by freedom that the device provides, so they are able to make their own personal reference tool which is easily accessible. As an additional deliverable, a booklet is made with principles for designers, who want to design for autonomy for people who are in need for assistance. To conclude, daily life is not designed for VIPs, but designed by and for sighted people. Unfortunately, many tools for VIPs are nowadays designed by sighted people to provide assistance to fill the gap of the missing visual senses. Within this project it is found that the mobility tool for VIPs should be a support tool instead of an assistive tool in order to evoke a feeling of autonomy. Walkmen is a result of the approach taken which includes the autonomous design characteristics and, according to the validation, evokes a feeling of autonomy.","Autonomy; Visually impaired people; Assistive tools; Mobility; positive design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Navigation and localization of this robot is currently performed manually. This is a difficult process that is greatly complicated during operation. This is mainly due to the availability of relative positioning sensors only, which are prone to error build-up and noise, and to the difficulty of interpreting optical underwater images in turbid water conditions. Instead, operators must rely on acoustic images from a forward-looking sonar. In the field of mobile robotics, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an often used technique to improve navigation and localization by utilizing visual information. The objective of this thesis is to develop a sonar-based SLAM framework, tailored to working environment of the Fleet Cleaner robot. The thesis scope has been restricted to the conceptual design of such a framework and the implementation of one of the subsystems, visual odometry. <br/>A conceptual design of a SLAM system is proposed using a systematic approach. Different working principles are evaluated according to operating conditions and requirements that specify desired behavior. Analysis of operating conditions reveal the limitations of sonar imagery, such as a high signal-to-noise ratio and inhomogeneous intensity patterns. In addition, the environment is sparse, with few distinct recognizable landmarks, limiting feature-based approaches. Because of these limitations, visual odometry is essential to reduce error build-up between loop closure corrections.<br/>A Fourier-based approach to visual odometry is implemented, taking the whole image view into account instead of extracted features. By analyzing the dominant peak in the phase correlation matrix, the in-plane sonar motion between consecutive image frames can be estimated. Several image processing steps are necessary to improve peak sharpness, increasing the quality of registration.<br/>To validate the proposed method, an experiment was conducted during cleaning of the Pioneering Spirit, the world’s largest construction vessel. Under normal circumstances, visual odometry showed less error build-up in the position estimate than wheel odometry. However, outliers appear when driving near the waterline, caused by reflections and wave reverberations. Ultimately, the proposed visual odometry method improves the current positioning system and serves as a basis for an integral SLAM implementation.<br","Ship hull cleaning robot; Forward looking sonar; SLAM; Visual odometry; Phase correlation; Image registration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-08","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Ordering products, produce and meals online, to be delivered at your door, is becoming increasingly common. This leads to an increase in demand for home deliveries. From the operational cost perspective of logistic service providers (LSP), the so called last mile of the delivery is very expensive. The last mile is the very last part of the journey. For parcel delivery, this is typically the trip from the LSP’s distribution centre to the consumer home. LSP’s are contracted to deliver parcels to the consumer. Therefore, retailers are in fact the customer from a LSP’s perspective. Improving cost and quality of delivery services is important for LSP’s for two reasons. Firstly, to lower operational cost in order to improve their market position. Secondly, to leverage a better consumer experience to the retailers. There are innovations – often involving aspects of automation – which may optimize this last mile, therewith potentially reducing the operational cost of delivery and enhancing flexibility and quality for the consumers, in theory making them interesting investments. This research focusses on the consumer side of this topic, and looks into their preferences by means of discrete choice modelling in order to determine the consumer value of these innovations. Preferences can be specific to a type of commodity. For example, different trade-offs may be made when ordering a book rather than ordering a pizza. To capture these differences to a certain extent, this research takes into consideration parcel delivery and meal delivery.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Maintenance takes places at specialised shops such as KLM Engine Services (KLM ES). Part of KLM Engineering &amp; Maintenance (KLM E&amp;M), KLM ES provides maintenance ser- vices to aircraft engines belonging both to KLM and to external customers. Gas Path Analysis (GPA) is a technique which can aid KLM ES in its maintenance process. As a gas turbine deteriorates over time, its performance will change. These changes in performance can be measured in the gas path of the engine. Using GPA the degraded component can be identified, after which corrective steps can be taken. This analysis gives more insight into the condition of a gas turbine than the traditional method in which only the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin is taken into account. At KLM ES GPA is performed using Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP), currently with the capability to analyse the General Electric (GE) CF6-80 and CFMI CFM56-7B. Recently KLM ES has started maintenance on the GE GEnx-1B, powering the Boeing 787.

The objective of this research is to extend the use of GPA at KLM ES to the GEnx-1B, by creating a model in GSP capable of providing accurate GPA results for the GEnx-1B using both test cell and on-wing measurements. A GSP model has been created based on test cell measurements, taken at different power settings, of an average GEnx-1B. The range of power settings over which the model is capable of simulating the engine has been extended using take-off snapshots taken on-wing. Off-design performance simulation in GSP is based on component maps, describing the performance of the compressors and turbines of a gas turbine. Component maps describing the behaviour of the GEnx-1B components are proprietary to GE and unavailable in the public domain. Therefore maps representing a CF6-80, which are based on publicly available maps and are accessible at KLM ES, have been tuned to match the measured GEnx- 1B performance. The tuned model is capable of simulating the reference engine in take-off conditions well. Some modelling errors remain, however these do not hamper the usability of the model of GPA. Although the GEnx-1B is a much more modern engine than a CF6-80, it has fewer sensors installed in its gas path. Most importantly no pressure measurement is taken in the fan bypass, after the booster and after the High Pressure Turbine (HPT). During modelling this increased the uncertainty involved in tuning the component maps and required additional assumptions to be made to fix the model in the design point. Furthermore it has its effect on the application of GPA using GSP. The GPA method implemented in GSP is Adaptive Modelling (AM). AM is directly dependent on the amount of parameters measured in an engine, it requires an equal amount of available measurements as engine parameters it can adapt to compute an engine its condition. As previous work focused on engines with more measurements available, more research was required to investigate the possibility of applying AM to the GEnx-1B. It is found that the lack of a pressure sensor after the HPT affects GPA the most. With this sensor missing, deterioration on the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) is contributed to an HPT efficiency loss by the AM component. Having no pressure measurement after the booster does not severely impact AM results. Lack of a thrust measurement, or equivalent pressure measurement, results in having no information available on the fan when on-wing snapshots are analysed. Overall it was concluded that the model would still be usable to analyse the condition of GEnx-1Bs in operation, or in the test cell after maintenance. The model has been tested using snapshots of test cell measurements available from multiple engines and using on-wing take-off snapshots of the whole KLM fleet. Results based on test cell snapshots correlate well with the work done during the shopvisits and with the EGT margin as reported by the test cell software. Analysis of on-wing snapshots also shows a good relation with the EGT margin as computed by the engine. Furthermore deterioration is attributed to the components on which it would be expected. On-wing results are affected by scatter, which also influences the choice of reference dataset. A suggestion is made for a reference dataset, enabling the analysis of all KLM GEnx-1Bs considered. Overall it is proved that it is possible to analyse a modern engine such as the GEnx-1B with GSP, both in the test cell and in operation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The importation of wine is expected to grow from 2 million cases in 2007 to 50 million cases in 2017. The potential market is estimated at between 50 million and 250 million Chinese drinkers (Hays, 2015). This headline figure points out that there is a shift in wine consumption from the traditional producer countries, namely western countries to new wine lovers in the US and China. This makes the east Asian wine market particularly interesting for wine retailers across the globe to explore. However, the assumption that a majority of wine consumers in developing wine drinking countries are novice wine drinkers. This suggests there is a lot of room for cross-cultural design (van Boeijen, 2015) and design for food adaption, with novice wine drinkers. Cultural relevance Food and beverages carry history when they are consumed. The act of drinking wine has much resemblance to the culture that one belongs to. “To a Frenchmen, knowing how to drink is a national technique which serves to qualify him, to demonstrate at once his performance, his control and his sociability” (Barthes, Lavers &amp; Cape, 1993). There is convincing historical and contemporary evidence to show that the adoption of ‘foreign’ drinks often involves the adoption of the culturally established drinking patterns (SIRC, 1998). However, there is a debate about: should wine drinking developing countries adopt the same drinking practice from the developed countries, or is it more interesting to encourage them to develop their own drinking rituals relevant to specific drinking context? Who is the target? Culturally Based Wine Illiterates, (abbreviated as CBWI), are defined as the wine drinkers who lack the knowledge, skills and behaviour related to wine. This theory was deducted from the food literacy theory by Vidgen, &amp; Gallegos (2014). Due to the absence of drinking context, and the high barrier to entry in getting to know wine, their confidence in various wine-related practices is affected negatively, hence it becomes more difficult when choosing a wine to consume. This preliminary research question helped to kick start the project: “How to help designers to design a shopping experience for Culturally-Based Wine Illiterates?” However, in the journey of investigating how to design a wine shopping experience. This topic can be broken down into two sub-steps to investigate. First is the human interaction with wine, and the second level is about the customer’s shopping experience with a given wine retail environment. Thereafter, the following sub-questions emerged: Human-wine interaction: Is knowledge of wine required for the consumer to enjoy the wine? What role does culture play in adopting foreign wine consumption practices? What we usually learn from the culture is a develop taste pallet for a particular type of food and habit of eating, how could a wine illiterate find their way in wine drinking? Shopping experience: How does culture shape one’s expectation from a shopping experience? Given the condition that for CBWI, the reference system in the realm of wine is missing, what kind of difficulties do they experience in the shopping experience?","Retail Design; Wine experiences; Chinese wine consumer behaviour; Culturally Based Wine Illiterates; Experience economy; Cross-cultural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","Wine retail experience design",""

This early recognition of imminent heart failure is done by evaluating certain risk factors. It is the general assumption that the myocardial stiffness is correlated to diastolic disfunction. During the heart cycle, shear waves are generated by the different moving substances inside the heart, like flowing blood and moving muscle tissue. The propagation velocity of shear waves depends on the tissue stiffness. Thus, by examining shear waves an indication of the myocardial stiffness can be obtained. Currently, no comparable accurate non-invasive method for obtaining an early indication of imminent heart failure is available on the market. In this project, classic phonocardiogram recordings recorded with a custom cost-efficient synchronized recorder system are combined with high frame rate images from the Zonare ZS3 ultrasound imaging machine.

Furthermore, this type of solar cell merges advantages of c-Si with Si thin film technology that allows for adjustment and tuning of bandgap and Fermi energy in deposited layers, and thus, modifying material properties that also impact the carrier collection. As heterointerfaces tailor to band offset and potential barriers for collecting carriers, the transport is described by thermionic emission and tunneling mechanisms. Moreover, Si thin film layers typically exhibit a defective matrix with characteristic traps and charge distribution that affect solar cell external parameters. Such phenomena involves the so called trap assisted tunneling (TAT) together with trap recombination mechanisms in a complex physical system.<br/><br/>In this work, the effect of TAT mechanisms on IBC-SHJ is studied by means of numerical simulations based on TCAD Sentaurus. Firstly, the TAT model is implemented as non-local process. It was found that TAT exhibits a negligible effect on electron collection, but dominates transport mechanisms in case of hole contact. Such an effect depends on band alignment at the doped layer/transparent conductive oxide (TCO) interface, where band-to-band tunneling in combination with TAT describe the transport of holes. In particular, TCO carrier concentration in combination with activation energy of deposited layer allows the collection by either TAT or band-to-band tunneling. In more detail, the density of traps described typically as dangling bond improves the transport of collecting carriers. Thus, the collection of carriers is evaluated in terms of energy and trap concentration, demonstrating that traps with an energy level of 0.5 to 0.7eV over the valence band enhances the FF, and thus, the solar cell performance. <br/><br/>Finally, the complete model is calibrated by comparing measured with simulated external parameters from a reference solar cell with and without TAT mechanisms. From this analysis, it is demonstrated that solar cell external parameters deploys more consistent values for Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination associated to bulk lifetime and surface recombination velocity using TAT model.","Trap assisted tunneling; IBC-SHJ; amorphous silicon; modelling; Sentaurus TCAD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-21","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, since it has very limited pre-treatment process, membrane fouling is a common problem due to the direct contact between the membrane and sewage water. Sewage water contains a lot of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that can block the membrane pores. One of the most persistent EPS is sodium alginate which responsible for the gel layer formation on the membrane surface. <br/><br/>Removal of the alginate gel layer can be done by implementing chemical cleaning. However, too frequent chemical cleaning can damage the membrane and environmentally dangerous. Therefore, to make this new concept of sewer mining more feasible, the correct cleaning method to remove the fouling layer need to be found. From this point, the research objective for this research is formulated as “Investigation of fouling control methods that can prolong the time before chemical cleaning needs to be performed to achieve higher water production.”<br/><br/>Several methods such as forward flush, iron coating and calcium carbonate coating were investigated. Alginate filtration was done under constant pressure experiment and the effectivity of each cleaning method was calculated by measuring the change in water permeability after the cleaning. The results show that the iron and calcium carbonate coating followed by 5 min forward flush are able to achieve a permeability recovery of 40 to 90 %. Iron coating required 400 mg/l of iron hydroxide to be dossed and a minimum of 5 min reaction times with hydrogen peroxide to have a high permeability recovery. On the other hand, only 1 minute is required by 200 mg/l calcium carbonate dosing concentration with citric acid as a cleaning solution to achieve a similar improvement as the iron hydroxide coating.

(mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor); Hoppe, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Market-oriented electricity sector reforms have spread across the world in the last decades, with the aim to increase efficiency and stimulate investments. In many cases the outcomes of these reforms did not met up with expectations in terms of among others pricing, social welfare and efficiency. An often mentioned reason for these undesired outcomes is that the ‘content’ (the reform, the intervention), did not match the ‘context’ (of a country in which the reforms take place). Egypt is a developing country which adopted in 2015 the New Electricity law, that laid the legal foundation to restructure its electricity sector into a competitive one. The aim of this research is to investigate what the most suitable restructuring modality is for an efficient and reliable electricity sector in Egypt, given the institutional and political-economic context in which these reforms have to take place. The research question for this research is as follows: Which restructuring modality for Egypt’s market-oriented electricity sector reforms is the most suitable for an efficient and reliable electricity supply, considering the institutional and political-economic context? The majority of the countries that reformed their electricity sectors followed the ‘standard model’ which provided a sequence and steps for implementing these reforms, and became a global trend during the 1990s. This model has been defined differently by multiple authors, but roughly follows the same steps: corporatization, commercialization, requisite legislation, an independent regulator, sector restructuring, IPPs, divestiture of generation assets, divestiture of distribution assets, and competition (wholesale and retail markets). However, after 25 years since this model has been advocated, it has not been fully realized anywhere in Africa. Instead, different varieties emerged, often referred to as ‘hybrid power markets’; a market structure somewhere between the pre-reform structure and retail competition. Several authors and organizations made an attempt to categorize these different structures. For this research, five types of restructuring are distinguished; a vertically integrated monopoly, a vertically integrated monopoly with IPPs, unbundling with IPPs, a wholesale market, and a wholesale market with retail competition. Each with different advantages, disadvantages and pre-conditions. Many studies have been conducted on the reasons for the undesired outcomes of electricity sector reform in developing countries. Among others, it was not part of broader institutional reform, there was political instability, public opposition, or not enough regulatory capacity. Most reasons are contextual factors, which justifies the extensive contextual analysis of the case of Egypt. These reasons have been translated as criteria into a framework to assess which type of restructuring fits the best with a certain context. The earlier distinguished five restructuring modalities each have a different institutional set-up, role of the state and the private sector, and therefore pre-conditions to be met in order to successfully implement this particular structure. This framework can help practitioners to assess which of the five restructuring modalities fits the best in a certain country context. This framework has been developed with multiple assumptions since criterions are interrelated, not mutually exclusive or difficult to measure. A framework like this has not been made before, so there was no previous work to build on. The criteria have been operationalized and will for this research be applied on the case of Egypt. Now that the framework to assess the case of Egypt has been developed, the technical and political-economic context was assessed. The more technical contextual analysis provided an overview of Egypt’s electricity sector (its institutional structure, the value chain and an elaboration on the proposed reforms). After this a Political Economic Analysis has been done. These two analysis combined, together with information out of interviews with experts and stakeholders, the framework with the defined criteria has been applied on the case of Egypt. After the application of the framework on the case of Egypt, it became clear that crucial pre-conditions for a competitive wholesale market are not present in Egypt. These include among others, political commitment, regulatory independence, cost-reflective tariffs, public acceptance and a good investment climate. In the long run (&gt;25 years), a wholesale market might be possible but for the short to medium term (as stipulated in the Electricity Law) this is too optimistic, due among others to the ‘cultural’ changes within the government that have to take place. Instead, the government should focus on improving the status quo; a legally unbundled and state dominated structure with IPPs, before ‘moving on’ to the next, more competitive, type of restructuring, being a wholesale market. Improving the status quo means in this case; continuation of the subsidy reform, and the IMF reform program in general, strengthening the independence and effectiveness of the regulator, and capacity building within the involved ministries and authorities. These measures, primarily focused on the second level of Williamson’s four layer model, will take time. Longer than the timeline of the reforms as outlined in the Electricity Law. This recommendation does not imply that a competitive wholesale market cannot work in Egypt. With 100 million customers and a population growth rate of 2% per year, there are ample opportunities for private parties to invest and operate in Egypt’s electricity market. But to push now for a competitive market without the necessary pre-conditions and transparency, will delay the process (as is currently happening) and creates uncertainty among all the stakeholders that are needed to make such a market work. The literature provided multiple examples of countries where market-oriented reforms happened too fast, with undesired outcomes as a result. Liberalization is not a goal in itself. It is merely a mean to achieve the overall goal of the Egyptian government: a reliable and efficient electricity supply. Strengthening the current structure with a focus on the pre-conditions needed for a competitive market, is for now, according to this research the mean to achieve this. Discussion and suggestion for future research The developed framework can be useful for policy makers and other practitioners in the field of electricity sector reform in developing countries, considering the large amount of vertically integrated utilities in Africa alone. This framework is however the first of its kind and open for improvement and especially extensive validation. Based on the results of the research suggestions for future research are: 1. The research done is from a qualitative nature. A quantitative/modelling approach to electricity sector reform in Egypt can be valuable as well. 2. Influence of intermittent sources and decentralized production on a suitable restructuring modality and the standard model. These issues were less urgent in the early 2000s when most literature about electricity sector in developing countries was written. 3. Development of an extensive sequencing and prioritization framework for Egypt’s electricity sector reforms. 4. A framework with weighted criteria to determine a suitable restructuring modality. 5.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Solar Photovoltaics has been a major source of clean renewable energy. Globally, PV has seen an exponential rise in installed capacity in the last decade. Better accessibility of PV technologies have created new opportunities for Urban<br/>applications. Building Integrated PV is one such promising application where PV technologies are used to generate power as well as function as a building element like facade. With dual function of PV modules, visuals plays a key role. This thesis explores one such technology ColorBlast™that utilises digital printed ceramic ink to give PV modules colour.<br/>Currently, various colour module technologies exist but most of them lack custamisability. A module which can be customised to have any desired colour to fit an application perfectly is in high demand. ColorBlast™is a colour<br/>photovoltaic technology developed by Kameleon Solar in the Netherlands. ColorBlast adds colour to a module by partially covering the surface of a module with digitally printed ceramic ink. ColorBlast modules can therefore be made with any colour including images.<br/>In thesis looks into evaluating the performance of ColorBlast modules with any desired colours including images.<br/>The most optimal way to cover the module with the ceramic ink to fit the application is explored. Furthermore, ways to improve both the visual and electrical performance are suggested.<br/>Visual performance of the module was found to depend upon the amount of surface covered by the ink and the colour of the ink. The most effective way to evenly distribute colour across the module was to print small hexagonal<br/>dots of area 2mm2-4mm2 and to spread it across the entire surface of the module such that the total printed area was always less than 50% of the surface of the module. By doing so, the module when viewed from a distance appears to<br/>have a homogeneous colour. This homogeneous colour is different to the printed colour and the relation between the two was evaluated. This concept was also extended onto modules with images.<br/>Different colour inks were found to have different transmission and reflection spectra. By measuring the transmission and reflection spectra for various inks and their combinations, the relation between the combined spectra and the proportions of primary constituents of the secondary and tertiary colours were determined. This was used to determine the change in incident light as seen by the cell. Further, it was observed that all of the transmitted light and 30% of the reflected light from the printed surface was incident on the surface of the module to generate power. The power production of a ColorBlast™module was predicted given the colour that was printed and the coverage factor.<br/>These were also extended to ColorBlast™with images and the predicted values were found to match the observed values with less than 1% error.<br/>When images are printed, each cell would produce different current and this would create hotspots and shorten the lifespan of the cell. Methods to reduce this by altering the current production of cells were discussed.<br/>The power loss for a ColorBlast™module was found to depend on the angle of incidence. The yearly energy production for a ColorBlast module in an installation at Helmond, Netherlands was estimated using and was found that ColorBlast modules in this application produce 28% less power in a year.<br/>Only the current production methods of ColorBlast with mono-crystalline Si cells and ceramic ink were studied.<br/>Further research on ColorBlast with different ceramic inks and different Solar cells will give a better insight on how to reduce power loss and improve visuals.","Photovoltaic; Colour modules; ColorBlast; Ceramic ink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-21","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Given that the Venusian surroundings can have significant impact on the spacecraft trajectory, the main objective of this project is to develop a reasonable macro-model for Magellan and investigate its impact on the modeled non-gravitational forces, and consequently on the orbit solution of the spacecraft.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Auxetic materials are increasingly used in the field of sports, defense, bio-medicine, and acoustic-filtering due to their unconventional behavior of exhibiting a negative Poisson's effect. The prospective use of auxetics to mitigate shock and impact forces have proven the relevance of research on auxetics. It becomes of paramount importance to understand their behavior and mechanics of deformation, especially regarding their response to dynamic loading conditions. Although auxetics have caught attention from several researchers, a detailed overview of computational modeling of auxetics is still missing and the deformation behavior of auxetics subjected to different loading conditions is an unfolded topic in structural mechanics. <br/><br/>In this thesis, computational tools are developed and validated to investigate the effect of auxeticity in a linear elastic continuum and a re-entrant honeycomb structure under different static and dynamic loading conditions. The possibility to assess the global behavior of an assembly of re-entrant honeycomb unit cells by the analysis of an equivalent continuum model with the same global dimensions and homogenized mechanical properties has been examined. The dynamic analysis of a continuum model of an isotropic auxetic material presented the influence of auxeticity in increasing the ratio of shear wave velocity to dilatation wave velocity. The finite element analysis of a simply supported auxetic beam subjected to impact at mid-span affirmed the hypothesis that in auxetics, the material flows towards the point of impact, thus increasing the indentation resistance. Computational challenges in analyzing a beam impact problem are discussed through the comparison of results from the standard finite element analysis, modal analysis, and the B-Bar method. It is recommended to further develop the proposed models to have a more robust approach on analyzing the continuum beam impact problem. <br/><br/>The assembly of a re-entrant honeycomb structure used in the finite element simulations were modelled with different unit cells by the variation of the two dominant geometrical parameters of the unit cell members. The results highlighted the strong correlation between the effective mechanical properties and the geometrical parameters, therefore indicating the possibility of achieving the desired values of the Poisson's ratio by simply modifying the necessary geometrical parameters. The results also showed that it is possible to obtain a Poisson's ratio more negative than -1 which can be exploited to design a displacement amplifier especially suitable for defense applications. The close comparison of the analytical and the computational results provided a groundwork to extend the numerical study to geometrical nonlinear analysis and other loading conditions like bi-axial loading and bending at the structural level. The comparison of results obtained from the analysis of an assembled cellular structure and an equivalent continuum model subjected to bi-axial loading and bending demonstrated the possibility of assessing the global behavior of cellular structure using the continuum model.<br/><br/>Dynamic analyses of a re-entrant honeycomb structure revealed that the wave propagation phenomenon in a re-entrant honeycomb structure is a result of several reflections, transmissions, mode conversions and superposition of waves occurring at the connection of cell members. The proportion of reflection, transmission and mode conversion of incident wave when it passes the connection can be controlled by varying the re-entrant angle between the cell members. For the lower frequency regime, the speed of wave propagation in re-entrant structures can be estimated using the continuum approach.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in a secondary study, the influence of the geometrical parameters of a re-entrant honeycomb structure to exhibit the stop-pass band was examined. Recommendations are provided for the further development of computational tools to analyze the three-dimensional and disordered re-entrant structures. In addition, it is also suggested to investigate the beam impact problem in the cellular model, the effect of rigidity of connection of cell members and research the possibility of having an isotropic re-entrant honeycomb structure as the present model is orthotropic in nature.","Auxetics; Negative Poisson's ratio; Re-entrant Honeycomb; Impact Resistance; Wave Propagation; Computational Mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-30","","","","","",""

Investigation of the paths taken to transit into turbulence is a front-runner among other methods followed to characterise turbulent flows. This is of particular importance in aerospace and energy industries for the design of wings and gas turbines. Early research used Linear Stability Theory (LST) to analyse the stability of the flow; with the increase in computational power, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has been developed to solve the flow field entirely. Most of the research on LTT has been centered on ideal fluids with limited focus on the effects of high temperature. The impact of other strong non-ideal effects on LTT such as dense gas effects have not been investigated. This work aims to study the effects of dense gas on LTT for boundary layer flows of toluene over a flat plate.Flows over a flat plate boundary layer are investigated in 3 stages. First, the base flow is solved for ideal air and non-ideal toluene for 6 different Eckert numbers (Ec). Second, the base flow is provided as an input to solve the eigenvalues of the stability equations for both fluids and each Ec using an in-house MATLAB code. The unstable eigenmode is identified and tracked. The growth rates and phase velocities are calculated and compared between ideal air and toluene. Third, DNS simulations are performed using a FORTRAN code, to solve the governing equations of compressible flows for different Ec. The simulations are performed on a pre-processed base flow solution, subjected to 2D sinusoidal perturbations forced into the computation domain at the wall. A no-slip and adiabatic wall boundary conditions are applied to the flat plate with a sponge region at the outlet and the top of the computation domain. The growth rates and phase velocities of these perturbations are calculated and validated with the predictions made by LST. Finally, a perturbation energy budget analysis is conducted to study the nature of the unique results obtained.The LST results show that as Ec number increases, all flows over a flat plate become more stable. For toluene flows, the stabilising effect of increasing Ec is more pronounced and all flows with Ec &gt; 0.15 are stable and have no modal instabilities. The results from the DNS simulations validate these predictions from LST and match perfectly in growing conditions, but deviate from one another in stable conditions. The deviation in results are hypothesised to be the contribution of multiple decaying modes to stable behaviour of the flow. Furthermore, perturbation energy budget analysis showed that for Ec = 0.05 and 0.10, the spatial growth of perturbations are positive due to a positive production term and negative for Ec = 0.15, with a negative production term. The negative production term is attributed to the negative integral of the perturbation profile.","Laminar-turbulent transition; Linear stability theory; Direct numerical simulations; flat plate boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Indeed, the size and location of logistic systems are dependent on the location of functional systems, amongst others, which could be driven by logistic systems in turn. To solve this iterative problem, a novel Logistic Model was created and integrated in the TU Delft Packing approach. Based on a network representation of the ship's structural subdivision, a novel path finding and selection approach, initial positions of functional systems and upfront defined logistic relations between these functional systems, the size and location of logistic systems has been determined for and integrated in each concept design created by the TU Delft Packing approach.

In this thesis report a method for Total Surface Current Vector (TSCV) retrieval using an experimental Bidirectional (BiDi) Along-Track Interferometric (ATI) acquisition mode with TanDEM-X is presented. Errors of retrieval results from simulated data and from real data are studied to assess the quality of the proposed method. The available data consists of a StripMap acquisition at the coast of Tromso and a data set acquired over Novaya Zemlya.<br/>The measurement concept relies on the ATI phase, which provides an estimate of the first moment of the Doppler spectrum associated to total surface velocity. Observing with two beams squinted as far as 13.2 degree apart in azimuth on ground, allows the Doppler velocity to be observed in line of sight of the beams. Projection to the ocean surface gives a velocity field. This Doppler velocity field consists of a Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) weighted average of velocities of sea-state dependent biases such as short wind generated waves, long swell waves and underlying currents.<br/>Assuming the surface velocity is dominated by wind generated waves and underlying currents, the method attempts to solve for TSCV simultaneously with the surface wind vector by coupling geophysical model functions (GMF) for returned Doppler Centroid (DC) and NRCS from an ocean surface shaped by wind.<br/>For NRCS the empirical GMF XMOD2 for X-band radar is used, based on the same regression algorithm as the widely used CMOD5 in scatterometry. For DC a GMF based on statistics of the sea surface and the Kirchhoff Approximation developed by IFREMER is used.<br/>A cost function of the wind vector is defined as the squared difference between NRCS observations and values of the GMF in both beams. The wind speed magnitude and wind direction for which this cost function is minimal provide an estimate to the local wind vector and evaluating the GMF for DC with the estimated wind vector results in a component of surface motion caused by wind generated waves. Wind wave induced surface velocities and TSCV can then be separated.<br/>Retrieval from simulated data shows that the wind retrieval algorithm gives an ambiguous result for the wind direction. To constrain the solution ECMWF ERA-5 reanalysis wind data is added to the cost function as an additional term with a low weight factor.<br/>Error analyses on the propagation of data errors shows success of the method relies on calibration quality that itself depends on local conditions of the acquired data. Comparison of retrieved wind using different GMF's indicates there is a high uncertainty in the models. The average of retrieved wind vector field over the image is highly similar to the lower resolution ECMWF ERA-5 wind vector data. TSCV results appear good for data with small ATI phase errors, but are dependent on the accuracy of used GMF's.","ATI; ocean surface current measurement; SAR; Dual-Beam interferometry; wind retrieval","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the FoF, applications like regular monitoring and controlling of components (e.g. temperature) are introducing the need of massive deployment of sensors and actuators. Additionally, sensors which are monitoring time-critical components of the factory (e.g. pressure in power plants) should experience low delays with a high reliability. The current LTE-based technology for machine-type communications, namely Cat-M1, imposes limitations in supporting massive connectivity and application with low delay and high reliability requirements, primarily due to the so-called ‘Random Access’ (RA) procedure which is used by the devices to establish a connection with the base station, before the actual transmission of their data. The key objectives of this study are to assess the RA procedure currently used in Cat-M1 networks as a baseline, and furthermore design and evaluate a new RA procedure for 5G networks, which targets typical FoF applications and their requirements. Based on the simulation assessment of the procedures studied, it was found that the so-called ‘Two-Step RA procedure’ is performing the best regarding end-to-end delay. Specifically, it was found that e.g. in a FoF network with 3000 devices an end-to-end delay of 16 ms can be achieved with 99.99% reliability, introducing a gain of 64 ms compared to the end-to-end delay in Cat-M1 networks.","5G; random access procedures; wireless communication; factories of the future; massive connectivity; low delay applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In therapeutic sessions psychologists help children to overcome their fears and develop effective coping strategies. In addition, the department monitors the development of children that have an increased risk of obstruction in their cognitive development with psychological tests. Treatment and evaluation sessions are performed in a so called 'playroom'. The current playroom does not support the psychologists in the wide range of activities they perform. The department addressed this demand in the form of this graduation project. <br/><br/>Research in the context provided insight into the usage of the playroom, its users and their experiences. The main problem identified for the current environment is that it does not support the psychologists in the different sessions they perform. A flexible environment is wished which can easily be changed from an atmosphere where the child is able to concentrate (stimulant free) to an atmosphere that invites the child to play (stimulant). In addition, the importance of the child feeling at ease at the start of a session became apparent. It was discovered that the journey that the child makes before he/she enters the playroom is of significant influence on this. Children that visit the department for the first time are nervous and do not feel at ease when entering the playroom for the first time. Two design directions were identified. One focusing on improving the therapeutic environment and the other on improving the journey towards this environment. This resulted into one final design 'Gentle First Contact' which consists of a tactfully designed patient journey and a master plan for a new therapeutic environment.<br/><br/>The master plan for a new therapeutic environment consists of a proposed design for the room and recommendations concerning colour, lightening and sound.

The elements are designed in line with the new vision for WKZ in which every department is related to an animal.

On the other hand, the subspace-greedy method provides suboptimal accuracy with much lower computational time. Here we construct the hybrid combination methods using those two baseline methods by interchanging their intermediate steps: the refinement step and the source localization step. To assess their practicability in a real-life application such as virtual reality games and robot navigation, the performance of these hybrid methods were tested against the close microphones arrangement on the sphere's surface. However, this new microphones' constellation brings up a low dimensional problem. To deal with this matter, we use the weighted least squares as the source localization procedure.

Several disciplines are considered into this subject. The manual and sequential design approach used so far is not sufficient to guarantee optimized systems because interactions between the different components are disregarded. Therefore, engineering companies are looking for a multidisciplinary, modular, user-friendly and easy tool to be applied during the preliminary design assessment. This should take into consideration almost every crucial aspect of OWF design. Moreover, it should be able to perform some overall layout optimization, i.e. providing the best turbine positioning w.r.t. the energy yield, the costs, the cables, the installation and the O&amp;M, ensuring some good constraint-handling techniques and guaranteeing a sufficient degree of robustness, precision, flexibility and speed. Therefore, the concept of MDAO (Multisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization) workflow has been introduced. With respect to the common sequential design procedure, which optimizes the wind farm components separately, the MDAO analysis helps the user deal with the interactions between different design areas whilst automating the design process. The result is a design where all the parts are jointly optimized.Within the MDAO domain, two components are identified. The former is called analysis block and it comprehends all the modular tools which refer to a specific physical/economic discipline; the latter is the driver, i.e. an optimizing procedure which calls the analysis block in each iteration.This thesis focuses mostly on the analysis of the driver. In particular, the first goal is to identify the best optimizing strategy to be adopted, thanks to several quantitative assessment criteria. The second research goal is studying to what extent the different design areas - aerodynamics, support structure, cable topology etc. - affect the result of the optimization. The third research objective is to see whether the chosen optimizing procedures are able to deal with more complex design situations, such as more constraints or longer design vectors. In the end, an additional analysis on the effect of neighbouring wind farms on the layout optimization has been done, in order to see whether the optimization should consider the effect of those wind farms (disturbed wind conditions) or whether the results from the undisturbed case can be still valuable if re-computed in disturbed conditions.","offshore wind energy; Wind farm layout optimization; Optimization strategies; Neighbouring wind farm; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-20","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Blockchain as an aircraft spare part track and capability is not only strategically relevant for cost-conscious innovating MROs, it also does not impose a risk to the robustness of their business model in most scenarios. MROs should engage in a regulatory-backed Blockchain consortium through which they share limited component data throughout the entire industry. If this is not possible, they can retreat from the consortium under the notion that their business model is threatened.

(mentor); Hopman, J.J. (mentor); Daniels, Nick (mentor); Akkerman, I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This thesis research is conducted on behalf of the Delft University of Technology and Bureau Veritas Rotterdam BV, and the goal is to improve ship evacuation by analyzing this aspect early on in the design process. First, this summary will provide a background on the difficulties involved with the ship evacuation process . Next, an explanation is given why this thesis proposes a different model. And lastly, how this model is validated is elaborated upon.<br/><br/>A ship evacuation is a highly complex process and it is one of the most important aspects concerning the safety of crew and passengers on-board. This process is affected by various factors, largely by the general arrangement. The layout of a ship varies throughout the design period but the most design freedom occurs during the early stage. An estimated 90% of the decisions which have major impact on final design have been made in this stage. As a result, this stage holds the most potential to improve the ship evacuation performance. This stage is characterized by a lack of detailed layout information available, which results in reduced accuracy in evacuation prediction. As of 1st of July 2020 all passenger ships with more than 36 passengers have to perform an evacuation analysis based on guidelines created by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The guidelines describe two methods, a simplified method for the early design stage, and an advanced method for the detailed or final design stage. The simplified method translates the ship design to a hydraulic network which in turn results in various method limitations. The goal of an evacuation analysis is, among other things, to provide the designer with information about possible congestion points, identify areas of counter- and cross flows, prove that the escape arrangements are sufficiently flexible, and prove that the evacuation time does not exceed a threshold.<br/><br/>Evacuation models capable of performing an evacuation analysis tend to have four general components that define the various aspects influencing the process. The four components are configuration, environmental, procedural, and behavior component. Including evacuee behavior in an evacuation model tends to be difficult due to the complexity and lack of research available. Evacuation models can be categorized using various descriptors however resolution tends to dominate. High resolution models are called macroscopic models whereas low resolution models are called microscopic models. Microscopic models simulate each individual evacuee as an agent with certain attributes, such as walking speed and destination. Most early stage evacuation analysis are macroscopic models and simulate the population as a whole. A different macroscopic approach is proposed by Kana and Singer, which uses probability theory to incorporate the stochastic nature of an evacuation process. This method consists of a Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) to calculate the most probable evacuation routes. Policies are determined for each small geometric area, called a state, in the layout. These policies affect evacuation routes. The evacuation process can then be simulated by using the MDP policies and an initial population distribution. The initial population distributions are defined by the Fire Safety Systems Code. Design variations can be compared based on the calculated optimal routes, the time it takes for the process to converge, and how the population is distributed among the exits. A lack of literature is noticed that investigates the relationship between early stage ship design and the ship evacuation performance. Two different studies were found which can be used to validate the MDP methodology. The first validation study determines which exit configuration is most optimal from an egress perspective. Kurdi et al. defined four different layouts for two population sizes. Having exits on all sides was determined to be the most efficient layout. The MDP model consisted of the same setup as the validation study. The MDP method is able to identify the same exit configuration as most efficient based on the population distributed among the exits and simulation convergence times. The second validation study evaluates two different frigate layouts with varying passageway configuration. One layout has a single passageway throughout the ship. The other layout has a parallel passageway configuration. Casarosa applied a microscopic model to calculate a range of performance metrics for 7 different scenarios. All evacuees were modeled as singular agents with different behavior and objectives. 3 out of 7 scenarios were emergency scenarios, where only 1 scenario corresponds with the MDP assumptions. Discrepancy between models is considered as a result of limited, and confidential, layout information used by Casarosa. The MDP method was able to differentiate between the two layout configurations and can identify critical areas in the layout. However, due to the assumptions, it cannot be determined to what extend the method inputs were similar. Nevertheless, both validation studies showed the potential of using a Markov-Decision-Process based method to evaluate early stage ship designs on evacuation performance.<br","Early stage ship design; Evacuation model; Markov Decision Processes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Abbink, D.A. (mentor); van 't Veer, A.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Crew of small fast ships often experience exces- sive vertical accelerations when sailing in waves, leading to discomfort and injuries. In an attempt to avoid this, in good visibility experienced operators reduce speed voluntarily when they anticipate that the next vertical peak acceleration will be unacceptably large. However, at night and during excessive spray, the operator can hardly see the environment which makes it almost impossible to anticipate wave driven events. On top of that, this approach carries the risk of operator misjudgment due to loss of concentration or fatigue. In this paper, the potential of haptic feedback to support the operator in preventing dangerously large vertical accelerations is inves- tigated. A stochastic based approach was used in combination with a high end ship simulator to construct a haptic algorithm which gives a maximum advisable propeller speed setting based on an estimate of the current sea state. In order to test the effectiveness of this approach, a human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted using a within-subject design with 24 conveniently sampled participants. In this experiment the effect of haptic assistance is compared to manual control under both good and reduced visibility conditions. A key advantage of implemented haptic feedback algorithms is that the human remains in the control loop and can continuously decide to overrule the haptic advice. From the experiment it is found that the workload experienced by the operators is significantly decreased when using haptic feedback. However, no significant decrease in the number of excessive vertical accelerations was found using the current setup. A possible explanation for this result is the lack of motion cues and the inexperience of the participants. Therefore, it is recommended to extend the setup with a motion platform and conduct future experiments with experienced operators.","haptic feedback; small fast ships","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","Haptic control for small fast ships",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The aviation sector and its associated activities contribute to climate change, damage to the environment, community noise, and local air pollution. As a consequence it affects the health and quality of life of citizens that live close to airports, and through climate change every person on earth. To reduce the impact of air travel and thereby accelerate growth, new technologies are being investigated. One area of research looks into the opportunities of using batteries and electric motors as additional energy source and power converter. Besides solving some of the current problems, these new technologies could enable radical new forms of aviation and create new business models such as on-demand personalized air travel.<br/><br/>Because the design rules of novel hybrid-electric aircraft differ significantly compared to that of conventional aircraft, new methods must be developed tailored for this new technology. Due to the additional variables introduced by using hybrid-electric propulsion systems, a simple sizing study quickly becomes a multi-disciplinary optimization problem. Furthermore, these new propulsion systems should not be benchmarked in an isolated way due to synergistic benefits with other disciplines. To close the gap between clean sheet designs and retrofits, it has been concluded that research focusing on feasible concepts in the near future is required.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to define the implications of using hybrid electric propulsion systems in general aviation aircraft. The influence of design, operational and mission choices on optimal performance are identified through optimization studies. The design space includes the geometry of the main wing and the operational variables of the propulsion system. The performance is either measured in terms of fuel or total energy consumption per kilometer for design ranges between 50 and 1000 km.<br/><br/>To perform the quantitative analyses, a conceptual design framework has been developed. Models of all propulsion systems have been developed that simulate their performance. Every part of the tool is either verified with experimental data or has already been verified in literature. A quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic solver has been modified to determine the aerodynamic characteristics with minimal computational time. The battery performance is modeled as function of time and rapidly sized such that the required power can be delivered by the smallest battery possible. A multi-disciplinary optimization approach has been used to integrate all modules and converge to an optimal design as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>First of all, a difference is found in terms of optimal configuration and operation of an aircraft when designed specifically for minimal fuel or for minimal total energy, leading to a maximum difference of 5% in terms of energy consumption. A trade-off between designing for aerodynamic efficiency versus the ability to carry batteries is part of the optimization routine. It has been shown that aircraft optimized for fuel consumption carry systematically more batteries compared to aircraft optimized for total energy consumption, always leading to a heavier aircraft with larger wings. Regardless of objective, the aerodynamic efficiency becomes more important for an increasing range while the ability to carry batteries decreases.<br/><br/>Three variables have been defined that determine the amount of hybridization in terms of power and energy without the need for constraint functions, as any combination of these variables lead an inherently feasible design: a climb coefficient that determines the rate of climb as a fraction of the maximum rate of climb, the fraction of the cruise that needs to be performed full electric, and a hybridization factor that determines the throttle of the internal combustion engine.<br/><br/>Given a certain required power at the power management system, there exist one specific throttle that leads to the maximum effective efficiency of the internal combustion engine. This throttle depends on the round trip efficiency of the battery charge-discharge cycle. When the internal combustion engine is scalable, the optimizer always makes sure that the most efficient throttle matches the power requirements during cruise, i.e. it avoids recharging.<br/><br/>The maximum possible range is highly determined by the required cruise velocity, given a fixed internal combustion engine. By scaling the internal combustion engine such that it is powerful enough to deliver the required power for cruise, the maximum range can be significantly increased. Furthermore, the optimal cruise altitude is found to be increasing with range and cruise velocity. At a cruise speed of 60 m/s the optimal cruise altitude coincides with the lower bound of 2 km whereas the optimal altitude at a cruise speed of 90 m/s increases from 2 km to 4 km for design ranges from 350 km to 700 km. In the latter case, the cruise altitude settles at 4 km for longer ranges.<br/><br/>The maximum range at which full electric cruise is possible is found to be the most efficient range in terms of energy consumption. This range increases linearly with the battery specific energy, providing designers a good initial estimation tool.<br/><br/>This research adds to the scientific body of knowledge as it presents a method that solves the multi-disciplinary optimization problem associated with the design of hybrid electric aircraft. Furthermore, through multiple optimization studies it provides insight in the influence of the design choices, operational choices, constraints, and mission profiles on the optimal performance of general aviation hybrid electric aircraft.","Aircraft design; hybrid electric propulsion; General Aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An investigation into the root causes of dust liberation and a chute redesign with improvements in dust liberation potential has been performed in this research. The biggest challenges of this redesign being that the case study chute is a multimaterial, movable chute with differing flow rates and a redirection of material by 90±. The main, root causes of dust liberation have been found to be material impact, air entrainment and compact containment of the granular flow. Measurements at the current transfer chute have been performed to investigate and quantify the problems of the case study chute. Direct measurement of dust in and around transfer chute is often circumvented to measure related issues such as material degradation and air flow measurements, since this makes localizing dust liberation sources and quantification difficult. Therefore, stopped-belt sampling has been performed to find material degradation in a case study chute at Tata Steel, given that impacts cause degradation as well as dust liberation. No conclusive evidence was found due to a lack of samples. Iron ore pellets and sinter were dynamically calibrated using an inclined surface wear tester and simulations in EDEM software were performed for 800 t/h and 1600 t/h flow rates. Three problem areas were found where impacts and bulk density increases provided indications of potential dust liberation. A redesign proposal that uses a hood and spoon concept with movable hood, where the cut-off of the movable chute head needed to be heightened to fit a spoon that can improve flow conditions, was proposed. Improvements in the identified problem areas were found in simulations of the redesign.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The development of structural glass has been moving towards more transparent structures.<br/>The thermal properties of glass can be used to create heat bonds. Heat bonds can be produced in two ways: welding and fusing. With welding, the regions that are to be connected are locally heated. With kiln formed fusing, the elements to be bonded will be globally heated in an oven. This results in the research question: What is the best method, among glass welding and kiln formed glass fusing, to produce heat bonded systems for applications in glass structures?<br/>In theory, safety measures consist of three basic strategies: creating secondary load transfer mechanisms, protectioning and overdimensioning.<br/>These strategies can be used on the scale of the system and the structure. The heat bonded system could theoretically be laminated, reinforced and tempered. On a structural level, safety can be ensured by a combination of the strategies. <br/>To produce glass welds, the glass is preheated in an oven. A small opening in the oven is made and a line burner is used to heat the to be welded area from both sides. One element is pressed down on the other to make the connection. The oven is closed and the specimen is annealed.<br/>Finite element models have been used to analyze thermal shock failure during the weld production process. The recommendations for production were to use an additional flame on the bottom of the specimen or to maintain the surroundings at elevated temperature. The latter option is applied in the experiments. <br/>The results were three transparent, all-glass, soda lime T-shaped objects. Little residual stress remained in the products. <br/>The fused objects were globally heated in an oven. The glass was fused in moulds, made of a gypsum plaster. The products were translucent, all-glass, soda lime, T-shaped objects. The objects deformed significantly during production. Little residual stress remained in the products.<br/>Throughout the experiments, factors have changed. An aspect with no direct influence on the product was quenching after maximum temperature. Adapting the mould and polishing the glass edges prior to fusing had an influence on the objects' shape or texture. None of the factors influenced the order of magnitude of the deformation or the seam between the elements.<br/>A structural test has been performed to compare the specimens with a glass T-shape bonded with transparent UV-curing adhesive. The connections were loaded in shear. The results of the failure loads and stress at failure are of the same order of magnitude. The largest spread was among the fused specimens, the smallest among the welded. <br/>The cause of failure is most probably a combination of elevated stress due to the stiffness and support of the test set-up and peak stress due to irregularities on the glass surface. Other causes could have contributed to failure.<br/>The welded glass product requires most time, energy, skill and money. The adhesive product requires least time and energy. The welded and fused objects had neither acceptable dimensional accuracy, nor a smooth fillet in the joint.<br/>In the current state of development, glass fusion results in less residual stress, requires less skill and is cheaper to produce. Glass welding results in a transparent glass to glass connection and its structural performance is promising. Further research is encouraged into the heat bonded and adhesive connections to create fully transparent connections for structural glass.","structural glass; glass; glass weld; glass fusion; heat bond","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Therefore, whether to upgrade the infrastructure or not, and how to do so has become a key issue for the deployment of automated vehicles. To cope with the wide range of uncertainties involved, this study uses two of the main driving forces, namely, public expenditure and collaboration level among stakeholders to develop plausible scenarios in order to explore feasible infrastructure requirements for various future scenarios. Two rounds of interviews with manufacturers, road operators and academicians were conducted.

(mentor); Mikulski, Maciej (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Waterborn transport currently runs on diesel driven Internal Combustion Engines<br/>(ICE). To reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions an option is to shift towards<br/>alternative fuels, like alcohols. This thesis focusses on methanol in ICEs. The<br/>combustion of methanol in ICEs can be done in numerous manners, where fuel<br/>altering, external ignition and dual fuel concepts are the most commonly known.<br/>Methanol is chosen as fuel due to its renewable character, which is a discussion<br/>point. Methanol is mostly produced in a gasification process of coal and Natural<br/>Gas (NG), whom are not renewable fuels, however methanol can be produced from<br/>the gasification of biomass or hydrogenation of CO2. Producing methanol from<br/>hydrogenation of CO2 is not economical beneficial at this stage, the knowledge and<br/>experience for this method is limited, meaning this will be gained in the next<br/>couple of years resulting in lower prices. A couple of vessels are already running<br/>on methanol, where dual fuel and fuel blending concepts are predominance. The<br/>conventional dual fuel is therefore modelled in thesis with a Vibe based model and<br/>a two zone model.<br/><br/>Currently marine engines are Compression Ignition (CI) engines running on<br/>diesel as fuel. Methanol has other properties compared to diesel. The biggest<br/>difference is the lower cetane number, which is an indication on the fuels<br/>self-ignition abilities. This defective self-ignition abilities of methanol results in the<br/>necessity of adjusting a marine engine when using methanol as fuel. The most<br/>redundant and known method is the conventional dual fuel engine. The diesel<br/>injectors might need adjustments due to the smaller diesel input and there is need<br/>for a methanol injector. Methanol can be injected in the input air duct. Two<br/>different models are available for moddeling dual fuel combustion, namely the<br/>Vibe based model and the two zone model. The two zone model is available for NG<br/>and needs to be adjusted for methanol applications and the Vibe based model is<br/>already available for a methanol applications. Experiments are done on a methanol<br/>diesel conventional dual fuel engine and the results are described in a paper [1].<br/><br/>The Vibe model is a model that, in the basics, is build on reaction kinetics and<br/>combustion duration resulting in ’shape parameters’, whom shape the Combustion<br/>Reaction Rate (CRR). The model was constructed from the experimental pressure<br/>trace converted into CRR by the ’Heat Release Model’, which was used in the<br/>’in-cylinder model’ to establish the shape parameters. When the shape parameters<br/>are known the in-cylinder model can run by itself (without the use of the heat<br/>release model) producing a pressure and temperature versus crank angle traces.<br/>The Start Of Combustion (SOC) and the End Of Combustion (EOC) are assumed.<br/>The shaping parameters are valid for specific cases and therefore the model is not<br/>predictive when changing the fuel composition or Start Of Injection (SOI).<br/><br/>The two zone model is a model based on two zones, the burnt zone and the<br/>unburnt zone. The burnt zone is created by fuel injection and diffusion caused by flame speed. In the burnt zone combustion can take place where the CRR is<br/>dependent on a version of the Arrhenius equation. The SOC is calculated with<br/>another version of the Arrhenius equation. Predictive behavior was expected for<br/>the two zone model, however the results contradict.<br/><br/>The two models generate a pressure trace. To compare the two models the so<br/>called ’post processing’ model is introduced. This ’post processing model’ is based<br/>on the ’Heat Release Model’ from the Vibe based model, meaning that for the<br/>calibrated case the HHR of the ’Vibe based model’ is correct. The pressure traces<br/>generated by the two models are inserted into the post processing model where the<br/>output is the Heat Release Rate (HRR), Indicated Thermal Efficiency (ITE),<br/>maximum mean in-cylinder temperature and Initial Mean Effective Pressure<br/>(IMEP). The post processing model is first validated to the experiments, which<br/>resulted in an acceptable match. The calculated mechanical efficiencies are between<br/>80% and 90% which is conform reality.<br/><br/>The Vibe based model results in slightly higher values for IMEP and ITE<br/>compared to the post processing model. When changing the blend ratio to less<br/>methanol use the IMEP and ITE decreases and the mean max in-cylinder<br/>temperature increases similar to the experiments. The HRR does not show the<br/>premixed combustion, but it is in the same range as the experiments. The two zone<br/>model results in a better fit for the HRR when looking at the shape for the<br/>calibrated case. When changing the SOI or the blend ratio, the model generates can<br/>even negative efficiencies or no results at all.<br/><br/>Both models are suitable for a calibrated case, however when changing the<br/>input settings, both models do not work predictive as wanted. <br","Methanol; Dual fuel; Diesel; Marine; Modeling; Internal combustion engines; ICE; Renewable; Sustainable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-19","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Mobile robots can be used to automate transportation of components between production steps. To do so, a task scheduler assigns transportation tasks to robots and a path planner calculates trajectories for robots to follow to complete their tasks.<br/><br/>In scientific literature, path planning and task scheduling are treated as separate problems. Typically, path planners use initial and goal positions as a given and task schedulers consider tasks of fixed duration. In this thesis, the integration of task scheduling and path planning is treated, resulting in three contributions. First, a novel cost function to minimise the duration of paths is proposed for an existing Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the multi-robot path planning problem. Second, a new MILP formulation is developed for the scheduling problem of tasks with deadlines to be completed by mobile robots. Third, two methods for integrating the path planner and task scheduler are proposed. Through simulations these methods are compared with an integration method that uses rule-based scheduling, which assigns tasks to robots in a predefined order.<br/><br/>Simulation results show that the novel path planning objective function improves upon that from the literature by striking a balance between duration, distance, energy use and computation time. Furthermore, integration methods using the MILP scheduler have trouble outperforming a rule-based approach, caused by a practical limit on the computation time. Moreover, compared with single-robot path planning the use of multi-robot path planning is shown to improve performance at the cost of higher computation time. However, this improvement is negligible for environments with a lot of free space, where robots can easily avoid each other without making detours.<br/><br/>These results lead to the conclusion that the MILP path planner with the new path planning objective function performs well when integrated with a task scheduler. For restrictive physical environments, multi-robot path planning can further improve results. On the other hand, for practical applications a scheduling method other than the MILP scheduler should be employed to integrate task scheduling and path planning. The scheduling method should at least outperform rule-based scheduling with a practical limit on computation time, even if an optimal solution is not guaranteed.","Path Planning; Task scheduling; Robots; MILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-19","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The different cavitation regimes were obtained by modifying the global static pressure and flow velocity in the flow loop. Based on this, three different cloud cavitation shedding regimes were identified. One of the mechanisms appears at high cavitation number and can be attributed to the presence of a re-entrant liquid jet. Another dominant shedding mechanism was found at lower cavitation number, with the presence of propagating bubbly shock waves. A transition regime was also observed where both mechanisms seem to coexist. A two phases flow model is implemented in the open-source software OpenFOAM.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","For the numerical analysis, an open source Lattice BoltzmannMethod (LBM) tool called OpenLB is used. The tool combines the Boltzmann equation together with Large-Eddy Simulation (LES), as turbulence model, to simulate the fluid behavior. The combination of LBM-LES which is used by OpenLB is relatively new within the CFD realm. To asses, the performance of OpenLB in the field of flow characteristics, drag prediction and pressure patterns a generic heavy duty bluff vehicle called, Generalised European Transport Model (GETS), is used. The inherent unsteady nature of both LBM and LES are complementary to each other, where LES is accurate in prediction of vortex shedding behind bluff bodies and with the easy parallelization of LBM<br/>computational time can be saved. A bluff vehicle such as the GETS model, where separation is expected, is the<br/>perfect model to test the performance of OpenLB and compare it with established phenomena of bluff bodies<br/>in literature and wind tunnel tests. By changing the configuration of the GETS model, variation in frontedge<br/>radii and additional boat tails, a better insight into emerging trends can be observed and compared,<br/>to validate the open source CFD tool. Furthermore, to investigate if there is potential in OpenLB for future<br/>projects.<br/>In addition to numerical analysis and a wind tunnel experiment is performed to obtain drag coefficients<br/>for the various model configurations. The experimental analysis was performed at Reynolds number varying<br/>from 8000 to 60000, based in the square root of the frontal surface. This means that a 1:50 scale model of the<br/>original GETS model is used. Mainly, the drag force of themodelwith different configurations are measured to<br/>validate the numerical results. The relative low Reynolds number tested in this study is due to the limitations<br/>set byOpenLB. The absence of grid refinement, the use of LES as turbulencemodel and lack of a wall function,<br/>constrains the Reynold numbers that can be simulated with keeping computational time in mind. Therefore<br/>a choice was made to only simulate the Reynolds number of 8000, 24000 and 48000 and compare the effect it<br/>has on the flow characterizer, drag coefficient and pressure.<br/>It was shown that the model with the smallest front-edge radius had the highest drag coefficient. This was<br/>the effect of a separation bubble over the front of the model. With increasing the radius the drag is also reduced,<br/>observed both by numerical analysis and conducted experiments in literature. The flow is guided over<br/>the rounding which gives a more favorable pressure gradient and therefore reduces the separation bubble<br/>that arises over the front-edge. Additionally, the effect of applying a simple Bounce-Back or Bouzidi boundary<br/>condition on the model is investigated. The interpolative nature of Bouzidi approximates the staircase<br/>shape of the rounding with a curve, in contrary to the bounce-back boundary condition. The drag difference<br/>between the two boundary conditions was 7.3%, which is moderate but it highly affects the flow over<br/>the front. The flow characteristics are simulated at two different heights, one at ground proximity and the<br/>other at a higher distance fromthe ground. The comparison is made because with the experimental analysis<br/>the model was placed somewhat higher from the wind tunnel floor to avoid interference with thewind tunnel<br/>boundary layer. Normally themodel is situated at the ride height of a real-life truck. The position of themodel<br/>influences the location of unequal sized vortices aft of the model. At ground proximity, the largest vortex is<br/>at the top whereas at a higher ride height this is vice versa. Which complies with Particle Image Velocimetry<br/>(PIV) performed by van Raemdonck [78]. The ride height did slightly affect the drag coefficient but was<br/>within a reasonable difference of less than 3%. Another observation that is made is, with increasing Reynolds<br/>the drag coefficient decreases. This is valid for all the front-edge radii for both numerical and experimental<br/>analysis.<br/>The addition of the tail lowered the drag of the models, this trend is ascertained by both numerical and<br/>experimental analysis. With increasing tail angle the drag reduction also increaseswhich is caused by increasing<br/>pressure over the rear part of themodel. There are some exceptions. Experimental results show that with<br/>the largest tail deflection of 18± the drag is increased. This can be the influence of how the tail is attached to<br/>themodel and the material used to create the model. A CADmodel that is used in the numerical simulation,<br/>every angle and dimension is perfect to the specifications. However, with wind tunnel models this not the<br/>case and therefore has an influence on the results. In general, the numerical and experimental drag difference<br/>is rather high, varying from 50% at low Reynolds numbers to 10% at higher Reynolds numbers. This is<br/>mainly the cause of the force balance used to measure the forces in the wind tunnel. The balance is designed for larger models at higher inlet velocities which generate a larger force. So, at smaller forces, the balance is<br/>not that sensitive which gives a wider spread in results at lower Reynolds numbers.<br/>Comparing the flow characteristics of the model with the different configurations a few things can be<br/>noticed. That the separation bubble is reduced with increasing radius. Also, the strength of the recirculation<br/>region of the bubble is reduced. This is one of the reasons why the drag coefficient is reduced with increasing<br/>front-edge radius. Furthermore, the effect of the additional tail on the separation bubble is also visible. The<br/>flow over the rear is accelerated by the tilted plates of the tail, which affects the boundary layer over the entire<br/>model, it re-energizes regions of low-velocity flow reducing the size of the separation bubble. Comparing<br/>the simulated flow behavior of boat tails with a slant angle of 6± 12± and 18± to literature shows satisfactory<br/>results. The addition of the tail has three major effects on the flow aft of the tail. First, reduced the wake size.<br/>Second, pushed the wake more aft so it has less influence in the model and third, delaying separation over<br/>the tail and guiding flow more inward to reduce the vortex strength. All of these core functions of the boat tail<br/>are simulated correctly. At each simulated angle the flow characteristic match that described in literature.<br/>The pressure coefficient could not be compared because the position of measurement was not equal.<br/>Due to an absence of a wall function the pressure at the wall of the OpenLB simulation are zero therefore no<br/>true comparison with literature can be made. In literature the pressure is often measured at the face of the<br/>body. Hence, no qualitative comparison could be made about the magnitude and the shape of the pressure<br/>distribution. However, certain trends are visible with the pressure plots. The larger boundary layer that is<br/>caused by a sharp front-edge radius decreases the pressure over the aft of the model, whereas, with a larger<br/>front rounding the pressure is increased. The addition of a tail clearly increases the base drag and therefore<br/>reduces the drag contribution. The pumping effect, that is very common with bluff bodies, is also observed<br/>with the help of the pressure plot. The pumping effect is, in fact, a periodic motion that sheds rear-end<br/>vortices generating a longitudinal oscillatory motion. This is reflected in the pressure coefficient plot which<br/>shows the back and forth motion with increasing and decreasing pressure coefficient.<br/>In conclusion, it can be stated that OpenLB is not yet ready to be used for the mainstream engineering<br/>problems. The absence of certain key features limits the tool in many ways. Using LES without grid refinement<br/>and wall function only low Reynolds numbers can be simulated. Overall, the flow characteristics that<br/>are simulated with the various model configurations are accurate even if the Reynolds numbers are not the<br/>same order of magnitude. The drag prediction of the simulations are underestimated if compared to the experimental<br/>results. This could be due to the choice of the LES model or the effect of too much dissipation<br/>which reduced the drag coefficient. The force balance used in the wind tunnel has also a major influence<br/>on the results, by being not sensitive enough at lower Reynolds numbers. Although the pressure coefficient<br/>did not match with that of literature some important bluff body phenomenon could be observed from the<br/>trends.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Joint impedance is known to vary nonlinearly during movement caused by varying joint angle and muscle activation. The nonlinear behaviour can be described using linear time-varying models under certain assumption. Recently a number of time-varying system identification algorithms to estimate joint impedance have been developed. System identification algorithms are typically validated in simulation. These algorithms have not yet been compared using the same simulated data or validated using real experimental data in this application. In this study the algorithms are assessed on their ability to estimate joint stiffness using three data sets. The first data set is from a simulation model representing joint dynamics with time-varying stiffness and damping. The second data set is from a mechanical variable stiffness device. A mapping of the true stiffness of the device was extracted by interpolating the estimated stiffness of time-invariant trials. The last data set is real experimental data from a human ankle with varying contraction levels to which small position perturbations were applied. The simulation study and the experimental mechanical study suggest that when estimating stiffness the linear parameter varying (LPV) method has a bias, the kernel based regression (KBR) method overall has the highest error, the ensemble impulse response function (eIRF) method needs many repetitions, the basis impulse response function (bIRF) method is able to achieve the lowest error, the short data segment (SDS) method is the most robust to different perturbation signals, and the ensemble spectral methods (ESM and mESM) are able to achieve reasonable results. The results of the experimental human study show that the estimated stiffness by the ensemble and short data segment methods have a trend similar to that of the EMG signal, albeit with different offsets. The bIRF, SDS, ESM and mESM make a reasonable compromise between smoothness and required repetitions.","Joint impedance; System identification; Time-varying; Human motor control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key step in test development for digital logic ICs is automatic test pattern generation (ATPG). Cell-aware test (CAT) is a next-generation test pattern generation approach; its novel feature is that it explicitly addresses cell-internal defects (as opposed to relying on serendipitous coverage by traditional ATPG). CAT consists of two stages - cell-aware library characterization (CA-LC) and cell-aware ATPG. Library characterization uses parasitics-extracted transistor-level netlists to model open and short defects candidates, which are then simulated with an exhaustive set of cell-level test patterns. The results are encoded in the form of defect detection matrices (DDMs). Cell-aware ATPG uses this information to determine a set of test patterns such that, as many as possible cell-internal defects in the circuit are covered. As an industrial standard-cell library contains hundreds of cells, library characterization is a time consuming task. The target defect set must be realistic and complete, but not unnecessarily large. The objective of this thesis is to improve the library characterization stage of the Cadence CAT flow by effectively and efficiently modelling realistic defects, while trying to minimize the time required for characterization. To achieve this, several improvements to the existing flow are proposed. (1) defining a set of customized settings for the parasitics extraction tool for generating transistor-level netlists, which are well-suited for cell-aware defect modelling (2) elimination of potential defects, which were superfluous elements being inserted into the netlist (3) using super-hard defect resistance values for modelling opens and shorts (4) reduction in simulation time by modifying the software flow and, (5) inserting a single short defect between two net pairs to reduce the size of the target defect set. For the 45nm generic library (GPDK045) from Cadence, these modifications resulted in an improvement in test quality by uncovering as many as 1114 false detections and a reduction of 6% in the characterization time. The number of short defects to be simulated reduced by 97.7%.

However, in the past decade wind energy field has made quite a big leap in making this way of energy generation cheaper and more competitive. As a result, the price of onshore wind energy has already reached the price of fossil fuel power generation. The progress has been made with offshore wind turbine technology as well, however ever increasing energy demand has forced industry to push the limits even further. Attempts are being made to build wind farms further offshore where wind resource is much higher and where more space is available. This on the other side requires new technological development and finding new ways to decrease the cost of energy.<br/>This thesis is a part of a larger project (DOT - Delft Offshore Turbine) which represents one such attempt to make the offshore wind energy much more competitive by combining wind turbine and hydraulic turbine technology. DOT company works on the development of the fluid power transmission in offshore wind turbines, using seawater as medium. The idea is that every wind turbine drives a hydraulic pump. Each turbine thus creates a flow of water under high pressure which is converted to electricity using a Pelton turbine generator. The main objective of this thesis is to identify and try to overcome challenges in design of Pelton turbines for high water pressures, variable flow rates and<br/>seawater conditions. In order to accomplish this objective, theoretical, experimental and numerical approach was used.<br/>Theoretical approach was used to develop a tool for initial Pelton turbine design. Small program was developed in Python programming language which enabled faster and easier turbine dimensioning for any operating conditions based on standard Pelton turbine design procedure. Next, test rig was designed and built as part of the experimental investigation. Test was divided in two phases. Phase I was meant to show the influence of the flow rate, pressure and pressure fluctuations on the development and quality of the water jet. Pressure is measured at the inlet of the injector and flow visualization of the jet was conducted with the high speed camera. Experimental set-up for Phase<br/>II was concluded while performing experimentation has been left out for a future research project. As last step, CFD simulation of the designed model was conducted using Ansys CFX commercial solver and results were presented and discussed.<br/>Although, all three approaches are conducted independently each of them contributed to answering the research questions and giving a better insight in problem definition.

This paper is the first attempt to perform a substance flow analysis of cobalt at a city level. The analysis resulted in a generic cobalt city flow model that can be adjusted for another CRM or city. The model is meant to help create a better, more accurate national, and subsequently EU level, analysis. The generic city flow model is the first step to extrapolate the bottom-up approach to get reliable results on a broader scale. A case study for the city of The Hague quantified the main cobalt flows within the city. Based on the results it was possible to suggest policy recommendations regarding critical raw materials at an urban level. The main recommendations were the lack of specific data from several sectors and the need for collaboration between governments, statistical offices and entrepreneurs. Those actors should work together to create a database accessible for researchers.","Critical Raw Materials; Recycling; Cobalt; Urban Mining; Urban Mines; Material Flow Analysis; metal recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

During this research four major insights of the current consumer experience in the G-Star stores were derived which led to the following problem definition:<br/><br/>Currently, G-Star RAW’s products are not experienced in full potential by the consumers since the product stories and features are communicated and presented unclear and inconsistent across their various physical stores and shops. For this reason, consumers are not able to value the full potential of the products. This is considered as an influencer of missing out on sales potential. G-Star believes that the physical stores and shops are fulfilling an important role in the coming 5 years (until 2023) to enable consumers to experience their products and therefore their role needs to be researched.<br/><br/>To research this problem definition the Vision in Product Design method is used. This approach is used to deconstruct the current context and interactions to be able to design a new vision which functions as a starting point to reconstruct a new context and interactions.<br/>The most important outcome of the deconstruction phase is that G-Star is trying to set up a new identity to appear more emphatic to the consumer. This new appearance is toning down the other values of G-Star and therefore the identity of the brand is experienced less strong by the consumer. Besides that, are the services that G-Star provides in their stores focussed on making instant sales are therefore not matching the needs of the current consumer.<br/>To find out how G-Star can improve their service to the consumer in the coming five years, a research to formulate a new retail vision is executed during the reconstruction phase. In the envisioned context consumers are constantly dealing with an overload of influences in a world where they are always connected to others. This provokes the insecurity of how to express their individual identity. To take this insecurity away from consumers the following statement has been created for G-Star:<br/><br/>I want G-Star to empower people to stand out individually and to express their unique values by approaching them in an assuring way.<br/><br/>To be assuring to the consumer the interaction should contain the following qualities: clarifying, fascinating, evaluating and unconstrained. To enable this interaction in their physical brand environments G-Star should appear as unpretentious and bold. <br/> <br/>The design that is created to facilitate this interaction is called a physical identity environment. In these environments are consumer able to mold their own identity with identity expressions of G-Star. The products of G-Star will be presented in ‘attitude areas’ and therefore they will be able to value the G-Star products by relating the attitudes to their own identity.<br","Retail Design; Consumer Behaviour; Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

A wide variety of opinions exist, ranging from the view that patients should assume at least some responsibility for their own treatment, to the position that it is unwise to encourage such participation because patients do not have the specialised knowledge required to make treatment decisions (Degner, Sloan, 1992). The difficult process of shared decision making (SDM), is a process in which the physician shares with the patient all relevant risk and benefit information on all treatment alternatives and the patient shares with the physician all relevant personal information that might make one treatment or side effect more or less tolerable than others (King, Eckman, &amp; Moulton, 2011). SDM is currently being advocated by both healthcare professionals and patients as the ideal for decision making (Stiggelbout, Pieterse, &amp; De Haes, 2015). The process of SDM is difficult to implement, for example because it has proven difficult to create access to balanced and easy to understand information for patients. The difficulty of implementing SDM also applies to adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions regarding patients with colon cancer. This decision-making moment occurs after surgery when the pTNM-classification (UICC, 2010) shows a certain value which suggests if adjuvant chemotherapy is applicable. During the multidisciplinary consultation (IKNL, n.d.) the best treatment option is discussed in the eyes of the physicians. This is then shared with the patient during the consultation with the oncological surgeon. During the next consultation with the oncologist, it is expected of the patient to make a final treatment decision. Different research methodologies like literature research, semi-structured interviews and observations were performed to obtain the understanding of the current decision-making procedure concerning adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. The insights obtained from the observations and semi-structured interviews, were used to create the patient physician experience journey. Combining this with the theoretical framework, the design goal for this project emerged.   The aim of the design process was to Create a User Interface for a web application that ensures that both patient and physician are aware of the different possible treatment options, understand what these treatment options involve concerning risks, treatment options and possible outcome, according to the principles of risk communication, and that interaction can take place, so that the preferences and values of both patient and physician can be shared, to support the process of SDM concerning adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer patients. From the patient physician experience journey, combined with the theoretical framework, the IPD was created through multiple iteration steps, involving physicians, patients, and potential patients. The IPD allows the patient to find general information about adjuvant chemotherapy, and triggers the patient to think about their preferences and values concerning quality of life, which can be scored and communicated with the treating physicians. Added to that, the patient and physician are both enabled to gain insights from prediction information about life expectancy. The IPD allows both patient and physician to be aware of the same amount of information and to understand what this information entails, which, according to the literature, is the condition to be able to implement the SDM process properly. Because this project was carried out in the name of IKNL, the IPD was created for a small fraction of the numerical information database they possess, with the purpose to be able to project the principle of the IPD on their entire database to help as many cancer patients as possible with their valuable information. When patients are more involved in making treatment decisions based on the process of SDM, it may have influenced the patient experience in a positive was, leading to a better quality of life of the patient. When the quality of life of the patient is improved due to the provided care, it can be said that the quality of care has also improved.","Shared decision making; Health Care; Cancer Care; IKNL; Numerical information","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

The network of actors is the social dimension, where the technical system is the technical dimension of the socio -technical system. The development of the technical dimension can already be assessed through the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). The development of the network of actors, or the social dimension; the dimension that mostly causes problems cannot be assessed at this time. <br/>It is, therefore, the aim of this thesis to create a numerical scale that indicates the development of the social dimension of a socio -technical system; the Network Readiness Level (NRL). The scale indicates the development at a low level of analysis; individual projects adding to the bigger socio -technical system. To draft the NRL -scale, the following research question should be answered: ‘What should a numerical indicator to assess the readiness of the social dimension of a socio -technical system look like? <br/>To answer the research question, a list of properties, facilitators and barriers of influence on a socio –technical system was drafted, based on literature. The list was validated by experts based on semi –structure interviews and a sorting exercise. The experts were originating from cases on renewable energy development of Tata Steel IJmuiden . A total of three cases on the development of a wind park, developing solar power at TSIJ, and developing a District Heating network were used. All cases were selected based on their socio -technical characteristics. The outcomes of the interviews served as an input for a 4-step result analysis that lead to the final outcome of this thesis: the NRL –indicator. <br/>The NRL -indicator is a methodology to assess the readiness of a network of actors based on a numerical scale. It serves to indicate the level of development, and addresses what causes the development to lag behind. The NRL -indicator exists of 16 criteria of a collaboration, and a scale of seven levels (NRL1 -NRL7). The methodology includes three important characteristics of a development: dynamic character, different criteria present at the same time, and the development process of the criteria. By combining these criteria, the NRL -indicator is capable of providing a complete overview of the factors of influence on a socio –technological development. The NRL –indicator presents something, a numerical scale to assess the readiness of the social side, which has never been presented before. <br/>This research on the NRL –indicator thus proposes a completely new methodology that could be valuable for managers, policy makers, and other actors in the network of actors of any socio -technical system. Future research is needed to validate the methodology, and prove its applicability. Not only in renewable energy development, but in multiple socio -technical systems, like: construction, pharma, transportation, communication, public -private partnerships, and innovation. <br","Socio -technical system; Network of Actors; renewable energy; TRL; Social dimension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Fibre-reinforced composites have become increasingly attractive for many engineering applicationsin the last decades. A very interesting aspect of these materials is that their mechanical properties canbe tailored for optimum strength and stiffness by controlling the orientation of the fibers embeddedin the matrix material. Composites are characterized by high strength properties, strong corrosionresistance, improved damage tolerance and can lead to considerable weight and cost reduction whencompared to their metallic counterparts. However, accurate modelling of damage in composites is stillan active research topic, as their progressive failure involves the interaction of various intra- and inter-laminar damage mechanisms, which often lead to complex fracture paths. To this regard, the FloatingNode Method (FNM) proved to be particularly suited for the modelling of complex cracking scenarioswithin a finite element. However, its use has so far been limited to geometric linear analyses, wheredeformations and rotations are small enough and the conventional linear FEM formulation is used. Thisthesis work investigates the modelling of geometric non-linear fracture problems in composites usingthe Floating Node Method. A co-rotational approach is proposed as a convenient, conceptually simpleway to include geometric non-linear effects in problems characterized by large rotations but smalldeformations. This approach allows re-use of the conventional linear FEM formulation by separatingrigid body and purely deformational motions at the element level. The co-rotational procedure, firstimplemented and validated on a linear solid brick element, is subsequently applied to the FloatingNode (FN) element. Finally, a demonstration of the element’s potential in capturing geometric non-linear effects is offered, addressing the modelling of crush and impact loading on composite laminates.","Finite Element Method; Geometric non-linear; Fracture modelling; Composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

The obstacle categories are (1) organisational inertia, (2) the changing role of governments, (3) cooperation with other governmental institutions and market parties and (4) the theme obstacles related to execution. The opportunity category is (1) (social) benefits and the theme is (2) cooperation and knowledge sharing.<br/><br/>The most frequently addressed opportunity category was social benefits. Interviewees stressed that Smart Mobility is a mean, not a goal. Social benefits were named in all sorts and shapes: social benefits for the liveability of cities, quality of life, sustainability, sense of safety, and social prosperity.<br/><br/>The most frequently addressed obstacle category was organisational inertia.

Adequate monetary policy is a crucial part of a well performing economy. Central banks are able to deploy multiple monetary policy measures. <br/>Setting the rate on marginal lending facilities, on main refinance operations, and on deposit facilities, the rates that respectively determine the amount that the central bank charges banks that lend money overnight, the amount charged on loans from the central bank with a maturity up to a week, and the amount with which banks are remunerated when they store money overnight at the central banks, are powerful tools to influence the interest rates in the other parts of the economy and also impact factors such as economic activity and GDP development. Even though banks are able to lend from each other, it is unlikely that they will do this outside the boundaries of the interest corridor set by the central bank, as this is unfavourable for one of the banks involved. <br/>Open market operations are a way for the central bank to control the amount of money in the economy directly. By buying or selling short term bonds the central bank can inject or retract money in and from the economy. When this does not have the desired effect, other parts of the yield curve and other segments of the economy can be targeted by buying and selling debt with longer maturities. This is called quantitative easing. However, in order for an asset purchase program to be successful, the money that is injected should start flowing through the economy, hence the central bank alone is not solely responsible for the success of monetary policy.<br/>Macro prudential regulation is another monetary policy measure. Macro prudential measures are typically aimed at bolstering stability in the financial sector. Due to the fractional reserve banking system, banks can create credit and can directly exert influence on the money supply. Macro prudential regulation limits this ability and, besides stabilizing the financial sector, therefore also limits the money supply. Again, the central bank is dependent on the behaviour of other actors in its efforts to control the economy. <br/>A profound understanding of the causal mechanism is a prerequisite for the implementation of monetary policy measures. Unprecedented situations ask for tailored solutions which is only possible when a policy maker is familiar with the dynamics in the system. A final challenge stems from the fact that most of these dynamics are disputed in economics, leaving room for more than one explanation for the same phenomenon. These challenges, identifying the causal mechanisms relevant to the success of monetary policy and discerning different views on these mechanisms, are addressed in this work.<br/>This research, focussed at the Dutch economy, does not attempt to find the correct theory, yet embraces two theories as uncertainty to come with monetary policy recommendations. By exploring different theories and learning about their respective translations to models, in particular stock flow based models, this work is after an answer to the question: <br/>“What is the impact of monetary policy and macro prudential regulation on the GDP development, price development, and employment in the Dutch economy?” <br/>While monetary policy is focused at macro-economic performance indicators and macro prudential regulation is aimed at financial stability, macro prudential regulation also impacts macro-economic performance indicators. The purpose of this study is to examine how both monetary policy and macro prudential regulation have their effect on key performance indicators in the Dutch economy, such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, while the stability of the financial sector lies outside the scope of this work. <br/>A stock flow model with five actors will act as surrogate economy to run both Keynesian and classic simulations of the Dutch Economy. These five (groups of) actors are the consumers, the producers, the banks, the government and the central bank. By understanding what drives and constrains these actors, the interaction between those actors can be explained. From this interaction between these actors, that take place on the goods market, the financial market, and the labour market, follows the emergent behaviour that can be captured in three performance indicators: GDP development, price development and employment. <br/>While the purpose of this work is to present a Keynesian and a classical model suitable for the analysis of the effects of monetary policy and macro prudential regulation, and explain the mechanism in these models, this works includes the simulation of a few scenarios of the model. From these simulations follows that when monetary policy is conducted, it is important to keep a healthy balance between setting interest rates and purchasing assets. An abundance of asset purchases causes an underperforming economy with a GDP far below the capacity of the Dutch economy and high unemployment in the Keynesian model structure. A monetary policy with too much weight on interest rate manipulation with respect to the asset purchase possibilities, causes a bubble in the classical model structure. This works recommends setting the deposit facility rate between -0.015 and 0.01, keep a corridor between the deposit facility rate and the marginal lending rate of 200 basis points and limit the size of asset purchase programs to a tenth of the gross domestic product. <br","System Dynamcis; Monetary Policy; Macro-economic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

The novel posit number representation system, as introduced by John L. Gustafson, claims to be able to provide more accurate answers to mathematical problems with equal or less number of bits compared to the well-established IEEE 754 floating point standard. In this work, the performance of the posit number format in terms of decimal accuracy is analyzed and compared to alternative number representations. A framework for performing high-precision posit arithmetic in reconfigurable logic is presented. The supported arithmetic operations can be performed without rounding off intermediate results, minimizing the loss of decimal accuracy. The proposed posit arithmetic units achieve approximately 250 MPOPS for addition, 160 MPOPS for multiplication and 180 MPOPS for accumulation operations. A hardware accelerator for performing Level 1 BLAS operations on (sparse) posit column vectors is presented. For the calculation of the vector dot product for an input vector length of 10^6 elements, a speedup of approximately 15000x compared to software is achieved. The decimal accuracy is improved by one decimal of accuracy on average compared to posit emulation in software, and two additional decimals of accuracy are achieved compared to calculation using the IEEE 754 floating point format. A study of the application of posit arithmetic in the field of bioinformatics is performed. The effect on decimal accuracy of the pair-HMM forward algorithm by replacing traditional floating point arithmetic with posit arithmetic is analyzed. It is shown that the maximum achievable decimal accuracy using posit arithmetic is higher compared to the IEEE floating point format for the same number of required bits. The design of a hardware accelerator for the pair-HMM forward algorithm using posit arithmetic is proposed for two different interfaces: a streaming-based accelerator and an accelerator interfacing with Apache Arrow columnar data, both connected by the CAPI (SNAP) platform. Overall, the posit number format beats the IEEE floating point number format in terms of decimal accuracy, ranging from an improvement of 0.5 to 1 additional decimal of accuracy for the performed test cases. A throughput of 1.6 and 1 giga cell updates per second is measured for both accelerator implementations, respectively.<br","posit; unum; accelerator; accuracy; precision; decimal accuracy; fpga; float; ieee 754","en","master thesis","","","","","","ISBN 978-94-6186-957-9","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Involving citizens in the allocation of the public budget for addressing specific challenges is a novel approach to participatory decision-making. This thesis examines the applicability of the Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) as a participatory budgeting tool to improve the economic assessment of investments with public funds on Urban Storm Water Management (USWM). The PVE method was developed by Mouter, Koster and Dekker (2017) to overcome the economical dispute on the use of consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the valuation of investments with public funds. The PVE-method could be a valuable means to improve the assessment of public investment opportunities and facilitate participation in the decision-making process. However, due to a lack of experience with the actual application of the method in different sectors, scientists and practitioners lack the knowledge to understand whether and how the PVE- method can be applied in different fields and administrative levels of public decision-making. The PVE-method has so far only been applied twice; in a transportation study in the Metropolitan Region of Amsterdam (Mouter, Koster &amp; Dekker, 2017) and in a national Water Safety study by the ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands (Mouter, Koster, Dekker &amp; Borst, 2018a, 2018b). These applications of the PVE-method are significantly different from applying the PVE-method to assess measures for USWM in terms of the scale level of the administration and specific characteristics of the USWM context. Therefore, the applicability of the PVE-method on a municipal level is assessed through the development of a case study in the municipality of The Hague that focused on the topical societal challenge of managing superfluous storm water in the urban environment. In this context, the application of the PVE could help to steer future investments in climate adaptation and USWM strategies, such that the highest value-for-money can be achieved.","Participatory Value Evaluation; Participatory Budgeting; Urban Storm Water Management; Willingness to Allocate; Participation; Willingness to Pay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

So far, the reconstructions of these scans have been done using Maximum Likelihood Estimate Maximization (ML-EM). This thesis proposes the incorporation of a smoothing prior, changing the reconstruction method to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. First, both algorithms are optimized in terms of filter usage so further comparisons can be done between only the best filtered versions of the reconstructions. It is then shown that increasing the smoothing constant decreases the noise, but decreases the contrast even more. That said, even a relatively low smoothing constant takes care of high activity voxels near the chest wall that hinder easy lesion identification. Using a low smoothing constant thus solves a major issue ML-EM algorithms have without compromising the contrast-to-noise ratio too much.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These problems, which are the result of a traumatic experience at the intensive care, are grouped under the diagnosis post intensive care syndrome (PICS). This research focuses on the mental health issues of this syndrome among pediatric patients and their parents. Evidence shows that the experience of children and their parents at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) may impact their chances of developing mental problems afterwards. The research objective of this project is therefore defined as “how can design be used to improve the user experience of children and their parents at the pediatric intensive care unit in such a way that it reduces their chances of developing post-intensive care syndrome?”.<br/>Analyzed is how experience at the PICU can influence the risk factors known for developing PICS. The defined important factors were for the parents a lack of involvement and lack of confidence, for the patients a lack of a secure feeling and an overall lack of the feeling of closeness. It is argued that by improving these factors, parts of the risk factors of mental problems are avoided and therefore the chances of developing mental health problems decreases.<br/><br/>It is analyzed how these factors can be improved by design. It was found that the feelings of closeness and security could be strengthened by providing a daily special ritual which children could do together with their parents. Furthermore, guiding the parents in what to do during such a ritual increases their feeling of being in control, which improves their confidence. Specifically, the bedtime moment was chosen as a focus because this often is the last moment of the day the children spend with their parents which means that it can evoke many negative feelings. <br/><br/>These aspects are incorporated in a design called “Sparkling Moments”. This design uses projection in the room to change the environment and create a special moment for parent and child together. By adding different triggers during the day, parents are able to prepare this moment for their child by bringing objects and asking questions, increasing their feeling of confidence. Moreover, these triggers are bringing an aura of positivity to the normal intensive care situation. Furthermore, by being visible through the netting of the curtain, caregivers are made aware the moment is happening. This can make them wait a moment, ensuring patient and parents are not disturbed and perceive the moment as safe; nothing bad will happen at that time.<br/><br/>The usage of the projector and its ability to create a moment for parent and child was evaluated by user tests and hospital evaluation. As expected, an imitate and cozy atmosphere was created with the projection, allowing parent and child to feel much closer to each other. Moreover, the free and open character of the design was perceived very well.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The demand for sustainable high-rise buildings is growing. Such sustainable high-rise could be realized by the use of mass timber for the structural design instead of more conventional building materials such as steel and concrete. Timber is a renewable resource which can be CO<sub>2</sub> neutral if reforestation takes place to close its carbon cycle. In addition, the light-weight of timber reduces the loads on the foundation, and the timber could be used as an architectural feature as well. The height boundaries for tall timber buildings are currently extending, as illustrated by the ongoing realization of a 70 metres tall timber building in Amsterdam. However, the light-weight of timber make tall timber buildings prone to dynamic wind loading. In addition, the current trend to design slender high-rise further increases the wind-induced dynamic response of the building. <br/><br/>In this thesis, the technical feasibility of a super tall hybrid wood-concrete building was evaluated and its wind-induced dynamic behaviour was optimized. To this end a 300m tall building of timber and concrete was designed for construction in the city-centre of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Due to the absence of seismic activity in the area, wind loading was identified as the governing parameter for lateral stability design. The structural design was therefore optimized to satisfy serviceability criteria for lateral drift and occupant comfort. Based on these requirements, the structure was designed as a reinforced concrete core surrounded by a glued-laminated timber (GLT) frame and floor slabs consisting of a cross-laminated timber (CLT) panel with a thin concrete top layer. Lateral stability was ensured by an outrigger/belt-truss system at three levels, resulting in a significant increase of the global stiffness in the structure, and in a reduction of the maximum lateral inter-storey drift by a factor two. <br/><br/>In order to fully design a 300m tall wood-concrete hybrid building, design aspects such as the floor plan, core layout, lateral stability system and timber frame were designed first. The floor plan layout and storey height were based on a typical office building. The length from the perimeter to the core of the building was set to 9 metres and a storey height 3.75 metres was applied. These dimensions ensured that enough sunlight would fall into the office spaces. The entrance level with double storey height was performed in reinforced concrete to create a more open layout and to achieve a higher safety in the case of accidental blast loading.<br/><br/>Stiffness optimization of the structure was carried out in order to satisfy the serviceability criteria for lateral inter-storey drift and displacement. Consequently, a parametric study of the cross-sectional dimension of the columns, of the thickness of the reinforced concrete core wall, and of the outrigger/belt-truss layout was performed. The cross-sectional dimension of the columns and the thickness of the core wall were tapered down over the height of the structure. A diagonally- and orthogonally-oriented layout of the outrigger trusses were compared. For the final design the orthogonally-oriented layout was applied, because it resulted in more lateral stiffness of the structure. Each outrigger level consists of 8 outrigger trusses which are orthogonally oriented with respect to the reinforced concrete core, and a belt-truss surrounds the perimeter of the structure. The outrigger levels were also designed to accommodate the mechanical, electrical and public health system (MEP) facilities. <br/><br/>Due to the large tension forces caused by lateral wind loading the connection design of the GLT frame is paramount for the feasibility of a hybrid wood-concrete tall building. The outrigger trusses transfer large tension and compression forces to the perimeter columns, making the outrigger connections critical for the overall stiffness of the structure. Therefore, the connections in the outrigger truss, as well as the belt truss, were designed with two slotted-in steel plates and dowels. Beam-to-columns and beam-to-wall connections were designed with only one slotted-in steel plate and dowels. Column splices were carried out with glued-in rods and bolts. In-between the column splices adjustment devices were installed to compensate for the vertical differential shortening of the reinforced concrete core and mass timber frame. Consequently, an additional steel plate with the required adjustment thickness could be placed between the bolted steel plates of the connection. Continuous columns were applied over a height of 4-storey levels in order to reduce the number of expensive steel-timber connections. Due to transportation constraints, the length of the columns was limited to 15 metres.  <br/>Vortex shedding and end-effects of the wind due to lateral wind loading cause peak response accelerations mainly in the across-wind direction. For a return period of 50 years of wind loading to satisfy the serviceability criterion for the occupant comfort, the peak response acceleration should be lower than 0.390 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This criterion is dependent on the natural frequency of the structure which is equal to 0.130 Hz. To improve the structure's dynamic behaviour, a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) and a chamfered corner modification were applied, resulting in a decrease of the peak acceleration to a level satisfying the occupant comfort criterion. <br/><br/>The tall building was considered as consequence class 3 (CC3), meaning that a fire-resistance time of at least 120 minutes should be guaranteed. To this end, the mass timber structural elements were covered with protective cladding and a sprinkler system was applied in the building. The reinforcement bars in the concrete core wall were placed at a 35 mm cover to satisfy the required fire resistance time. The fasteners in the dowel-type connection were sealed with wooden plugs and the slotted-in steel plates are hidden and covered by the timber beam element. Dowels, bolts and steel plates in the column splice connection were protected by a double layer of gypsum plasterboard. During a fire, the protective cladding would eventually fall off and charring of the mass timber element would start. The developing char-layer would protect the rest of the cross-section against the fire load. In the GLT beams, a charring depth of 34 mm developed after 120 minutes of fire loading, and as a consequence all steel plates, connectors, and dowels were placed at a minimum distance of about 40 mm from the outer surface. <br/><br/>The designed tall and slender hybrid wood-concrete structure satisfied the serviceability criteria for lateral displacements and accelerations, and the critical connections in the timber frame are able to resist the large forces in the structure. However, a hybrid wood-concrete super tall building required shape optimization and a tuned mass damper to avoid peak acceleration levels exceeding the occupant comfort criterion. Furthermore, the design process established in this case study could serve as a roadmap for the design of future hybrid wood-concrete super tall buildings. <br","tall timber building; wind-induced dynamic behaviour; occupant comfort; tuned mass damper; shape optimization; High-Rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and in 2040, more than 111 million people are expected to have the disease. Vision loss in glaucoma is caused by the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) primarily in the optic nerve head (ONH). Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a well-known causative risk factor for glaucoma, highlighting the importance of biomechanics in the disease. All current therapies are focused on lowering IOP levels. However, these therapies are not effective for all patients. One limiting factor in the search for new therapies is the lack of knowledge about the cell processes that lead from biomechanical insult to RGC apoptosis. To better understand this relationship, animal models are used and amongst these models, rats are widely-used due to their pathophysiological similarities to human glaucoma. However, there are anatomical differences between the rat and human ONH, and these differences are likely to affect rat ONH biomechanics. Moreover, there are some anatomical alterations occur in the rat ONH due to remodeling and damage in the early stages of the disease. Computational modeling is a suitable approach for characterizing ONH biomechanics due to the complex anatomy of the posterior rat eye and there has been no previous attempt to characterize the glaucomatous rat eye ONH biomechanics. The aim of this thesis is to characterize glaucomatous rat ONH biomechanics by building two individual-specific glaucomatous rat ONH finite element models (FEMs). By comparing the 1st (mean and the 95th percentile) and 3rd (mean and the 5th percentile) principal strains on the anterior ON with previously built healthy rat eye individual-specific FEMs, the effect of geometrical differences occurred due to remodeling and damage in the early stages of the glaucoma were aimed to be better understood. The 1st principal strain (mean and 95th percentile) relative percentage differences between the glaucomatous and healthy rat eyes under the IOP of 30mmHg were found to be 37.74% and 69.66% for the MR04, and 35.66% and 66.02% for the MR05 rats. The 3rd principal strain (mean and 5th percentile) relative percentage differences were found to be 12.28% and 35.23% for the MR04, and 10.31% and 11.05% for the MR05 rats, in which the glaucomatous rat eyes had higher magnitude strains. When the experimentally measured mean IOP values were applied to the glaucomatous rat eye models, these calculated relative percentage differences were increased. Moreover, when the strain patterns in the anterior ON were observed, larger strains were located in the inferior ON in both of the glaucomatous rat eyes. Thus, the localization of high strain patterns observed in this study for the glaucomatous eyes were similar to the healthy rat eyes, which were dominantly located at the inferior ON. However, the magnitudes of the principal strains in the glaucomatous rat eye anterior ON were elevated due to the geometrical differences caused by remodeling and damage during the early stages of the disease.","glaucomatous rat eye; finite element modeling; individual-specific","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Turbulence modelling corresponds to one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics and mathematics. This phenomenon is marked by the emergence of chaotic vortex structures in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, and it corresponds to the leading-order effect in the majority of the flows observed in nature. Due to the importance of turbulence modelling, researchers have designed RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes) turbulence models to understand their mean flow behavior. However, one important limitation present in traditional RANS turbulence models is given by their focus on isothermal incompressible fluids, which present constant molecular properties. In order to overcome these limitations, the research previously done at the Process \&amp; Energy Department of the TU Delft has established new scaling theories for variable-property flows, which bring the greatest degree of universal collapse observed to date. The application of these scaling theories to traditional RANS turbulence models has greatly improved their performance, although multiple-equation models still require further tuning.The present thesis work thus consisted in applying the principles of Machine Learning (ML) to build improved data-driven RANS turbulence models; using the DNS database assembled by the research group. Special emphasis was placed in an emerging technique called FIML (Field Inversion Machine Learning). This technique splits the process of building ML corrections into an initial data mining stage known as Field Inversion, and a subsequent Machine Learning stage where a predictive system is trained using the corrections found.<br/>During the present study, several advances were proposed for the previous methodology. The first contribution is given by the synthesis of a direct Hessian-free Field Inversion optimizer, which continuously seeks the best learning hyper-parameters to use while remaining unconditionally stable. As a result, the Field Inversion optimization process can be fully automatized for any RANS turbulence model. This marked a large contrast with respect to the Field Inversion optimizers employed in leading publications, where probabilistic Bayesian inversion algorithms are used. These algorithms can result unnecessarily complex, since they perform a side-study of the probabilities associated to obtaining certain parameters, whereas the FIML approach only requires the final (or average) parameter distributions chosen. Beyond the previous discussion, performing a rigorous probabilistic analysis of a Field Inversion problem requires an expensive technique called MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo) sampling, which results intractable in large-scale systems. As a result, the probabilistic analysis performed by standard Field Inversion optimizers is based on strong Gaussian assumptions, whose effect cannot be immediately quantified.<br/>The overall Field Inversion methodology developed during the present work was further enhanced by creating a Sympy script to derive the algebraic expressions required to perform Field Inversion, which can be imported into any programming language. Thanks to this methodology, the running times registered in Python were improved by a factor of x1000 compared to the use of Automatic Differentiation libraries. Additionally, a strategy was created to build explicit source term corrections for any RANS turbulence model without compromising the numerical stability of the optimizers. This innovation allowed Field Inversion optimizers to perform an unbiased analysis of any governing equation.<br/>Regarding the Neural Network systems built, the theoretical review performed revealed that logarithmic neurons could be added to the first layer of a Neural Network, such that the optimizer was able to identify the best parameter groups available. Important parameters can be found in this category, such as the Reynolds number, the Prandtl number, or any intermediate combinations. As a result, it was possible to build Neural Networks which could automatically discover adequate input features for the subsequent hidden layers, and the overall modelling process was greatly simplified. Furthermore, the present thesis work includes the derivation of a new intelligent relaxation factor methodology, which was created to eliminate any spurious corrections predicted by Neural Networks that may cause divergence. The methodology created scales well to large-scale systems, and it was able to perform an intelligent selection of the best corrections to keep in less than a millisecond during the tests performed.<br/>The final Field Inversion study centered in the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) and the MK turbulence models, since these models presented the lowest and the highest initial modelling errors respectively. The Field Inversion corrections obtained for the SA turbulence model presented a high degree of over-fitting and inconsistent patterns, which did not form a good basis to train Neural Networks. These issues were attributed to the high initial accuracy exhibited by the SA model, which implied that improvements could only be achieved through direct over-fitting. Similar trends were obtained during a secondary study performed for the turbulent Prandtl number, which also presented inconsistent trends marginally deviating from one. However, the Field Inversion corrections built for the MK turbulence model presented consistent trends, which were suitable for a Machine Learning study. After an exhaustive analysis, it was detected that the predictions made by Neural Networks for the source terms required by the k-equation of the MK turbulence model resulted more stable, and that the use of the intelligent relaxation factor methodology corresponded to an important asset. The FIML study for the MK turbulence model thus concluded with satisfactory results.<br/>From a global perspective, it was detected that the Field Inversion corrections built for RANS turbulence models presented a high degree of variability, which seems to be caused by their numerical properties instead of the actual flow physics. This insight was based on the derivation of a new turbulence parameter for rectangular channel flows, which was able to collapse the turbulence statistics of all the DNS flows studied into similar trajectory curves. As a result, it was finally concluded that the FIML methodology developed can be employed to perform successful Machine Learning studies, but also that new turbulence parameters should be developed in order to create more reliable predictive systems in the future.","Machine Learning; CFD Optimization; RANS turbulence modelling; Field Inversion; Logarithmic Neurons","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

Many coastal communities are vulnerable to the impact of sea-level rise (SLR) that can amplify the episodic erosion from storms and drive structural erosion. The way communities adapt to SLR hinge critically on future SLR projections. One of the major uncertainties is the potential rapid disintegration of large fractions of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) that can accelerate sea-level rise, albeit neglected in the latest SLR estimates of the 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'. Accounting for rapid AIS mass loss in coastal impact assessments is essential for risk-averse coastal managers that disfavour events with large consequences. <br/><br/>Although methods to predict future erosion estimates under SLR have been developed, hitherto no study has assessed the impact of different cases of AIS dynamics to erosion estimates. Here, a case-study to the island of Sint Maarten is considered to evaluate the implications for strategies to manage coastal erosion under SLR uncertainty. Regional SLR projections are made for a case consistent with the IPCC, a case with a skewed probability distribution function of the AIS dynamics and a high-end scenario of Antarctic mass loss. SLR projections are incorporated within a probabilistic erosion framework using synthetic storm time series for two beaches on the island. Future retreat distances from storms and long term coastal recession are calculated, and the different scenarios are compared and contrasted.<br/><br/>For a future 1/100 year retreat distance of storm erosion, often used for zoning policies, estimates may be exceeded up to 1.11-2.22 times as frequent for inclusion of skewness, and 2.22-67 times as frequent for the high-end scenario compared to the IPCC case. These numbers further increase when additional climate model uncertainty is introduced. In terms of long-term recession, the 1% exceedance probability in 2100 for the IPCC case has a 2-4.5% exceedance probability for a skewed distribution function and a 37-88% exceedance probability under a high-end scenario of the AIS. Lower exceedance probabilities, essential for risk-averse coastal managers, are underestimated relatively more leading to potential disillusion about the safety level that is set.<br/><br/>In conclusion, precluding AIS uncertainty from SLR projections that feed coastal impact assessments may lead to ill-informed decisions on SLR adaptation. Risk-averse coastal managers should thus be better informed on deep uncertainty in SLR projections to prevent maladaptation of vulnerable areas. <br","Antarctica; Sea-level rise; decision-making; Coastal erosion; risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

By analyzing the EDS influences and the tilting mechanism of double-tilt sample holders, the need for a remote-center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism as a tilting mechanism is identified. Because existing RCM mechanism design strategies limit the design flexibility, a novel design strategy is developed. The novel strategy gives more flexibility in terms of the use of space, design for stiffness and it gives variable input/output link rotation ratio functionality. A compliant proof-of-principle mechanism, which is designed using the novel RCM mechanism design strategy, is manufactured to characterize the accuracy, force/displacement behavior and the input/output link rotation ratio. Analytical, numerical and experimental results are compared, and it can be concluded that the compliant RCM mechanism has potential to be used in double-tilt sample holders.","Classification; Compliant Mechanisms; Design strategy; energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; kinematics; remote-center-of-motion; sample holder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Shell mechanisms are of recent interest for designing exoskeletons that are inconspicuous. One of the challenges in designing shell mechanisms is getting as much compliance as possible in certain directions while keeping the other directions sufficiently stiff. <br/><br/>Prestressing is a technique that is used to change the stiffness of compliant mechanisms and it makes it possible to generate compliant mechanisms that have zero or negative stiffness.

In the ideal scenario the size of the smallest resolved object features is limited by the wave properties of light, with a number of techniques developed to overcome this limit. In real life measurements the image quality is additionally deteriorated by the non-uniformities in refractive index along the beam propagation path, called aberrations. Adaptive Optics, introduced in 1950’s independently by Horace Babcock and Vladimir Linnik is a set of methods used to overcome the effect of aberrations and thus improve the image quality. Initially used in military applications for tracking satellites, it later found civilian applications as advances in computing made it practical.<br/>Adaptive Optics use principles of feedback control to correct aberrations, and thus a measurement of controlled variable is required. The most commonly measured quantity is first derivative of wavefront provided by the Shack-Hartmann sensor. Another possibility is to measure wavefront Laplacian, i.e. curvature, using the sensor proposed by Roddier in 1988. With the correct use of this sensor the deformable mirror actuators are decoupled from each other, enabling fast and accurate control of high order systems and potentially analog feedback loop.<br/>In this thesis, the Roddier curvature wavefront sensor is studied. A number of modifications in the original sensor geometry and operating principles are made in order to make the system more robust and easy to implement in laboratory environment. Performance of the modified curvature wavefront sensor is evaluated in both simulation environment and physical setup.<br/>Finally, application of the curvature sensor to measure wind velocity is demonstrated.","Adaptive Optics; Imaging; Wavefront Sensor; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Industrial and transportation sectors are still considered the highest consumers of oil. The petrochemicals sector’s demand for oil is increasing sharply and expected to continue in that fashion for the upcoming years. As oil fields age and mature, extraction of oil via primary and secondary techniques becomes, to an extent, inefficient. That encourages more research and development in enhance oil recovery (EOR) methods. In EOR, the aim is to either change a physical or chemical property of reservoir fluid in order to improve the oil recovery factor. The techniques can be categorized as thermal, physical, chemical or gaseous. In this experimental study, the lessons learned from gas flooding methods and surfactant flooding methods are taken into account in order to come up with a novel Foam-Assisted Chemical Flooding (FACF) procedure that aims to enhance the oil recovery factor to its maximum. In this approach, a surfactant slug solution is injected into a core at residual oil after water flooding conditions to mobilize trapped oil by capillary pressure. Then, a surfactant drive solution is co-injected with N2 for foam generation to serve as mobility buffer displacing the accumulated mobilized oil. The experimental study is performed under reservoir conditions of 90 ±1oC temperature and 20 bar of back pressure. In this study, surfactant stability is tested in synthetic formation brine. Then, phase behaviour tests are conducted to identify the capability of the surfactant to reduce o/w interfacial tension (IFT) to ultra-low values. The resulting solutions are categorized into their associated Winsor Types and classified based on salinity as under-optimum, optimum and over-optimum. A final surfactant slug solution is formulated based on these tests. Afterwards, bulk foam tests are performed in absence and presence of crude oil to test surfactant foaming ability and the resulting from stability and strength. Core-flood experiments are carried out to assess the possibility of generating foam in porous media in absence of crude oil and at residual oil to waterflooding. Full EOR FACF experiments are conducted, two at under-optimum and two at optimum salinity conditions. Two FACF experiments are performed with the assistance of medical CT scanner. In one FACF experiment, the foam is pre-generated utilizing a mixing tee and then injected into the Bentheimer sandstone. The study reported here showed that surfactants are not stable in synthetic seawater injection brine, as it tends to form complexes in presence of divalent ions, and subsequently generate precipitations. Stability was achieved by removing the divalent ions from the synthetic brine. In addition, phase behaviour study yielded that surfactant (A) is a better o/w IFT reduction agent than surfactant (B). A distinct layer of micro-emulsion was observed in excess of water and oil phases. On the other hand, surfactant (B) displayed better foaming abilities than surfactant (A) in absence of crude oil. Using surfactant (B), foam was generated in multiple qualities in a Bentheimer sandstone core-flood experiments in absence of crude oil. The critical foam gas fraction was found to be 75%. However, attempts to generate foam in porous media at residual oil to water flooding conditions were not successful. In three FACF core-flooding experiments, weak and unstable foam was generated during the surfactant drive co-injection phase. Whereas, in the last FACF experiment where a mixing tee was utilized, pressure drop and gas breakthrough data show that stable foam was generated. The CT images from two FACF experiments, one at optimum and the other at under-optimum salinity conditions displayed unstable water front in waterflooding phase, and unfavourable mobility conditions, during the surfactant slug injection. However, the effect of salinity conditions was seen in the different oil bank shapes in both experiments. The one at under-optimum salinity condition showed more unstable front. The study reported here showed that the FACF technology yields improving oil recovery of 70±5%, 77±5% and 73±5% for the FACF experiments where it was very challenging to generate foam in-situ and reached up to 80±5% of oil initially in place in the case where foam was pre-generated outside the core (55%, 61%, 59% and 46% are the oil recovery factors after waterflooding, respectively). The study revealed that drive foam strength has a bigger impact than its surfactant slug salinity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The features are aimed to improve the accuracy of off-the-shelf Asset Tracking Profile (ATP) and Indoor Positioning Service (IPS) including two modes – Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) mode and Angle-of-Departure (AoD) mode. In this thesis, we only focus on the AoA mode.<br/><br/>The new standard raises several challenges. First, the direction finding algorithm shall be derived sincethe standard gives only the framework. The algorithm shall cope with dense multipath effects in indoorenvironments and identify the angle of Line-of-Sight (LOS) component. Second, the new standard specifiesthe usage of an RF switch such that a single receiver can access multiple antennas. This mechanism reducesthe device cost and complexity but poses difficulties to the array processing. There are inevitably informationloss during antenna switching. It also raises requirements of channel stationarity and efficient compensationof CFO. Third, towards the system implementation, practical considerations that deviate the ideal datamodelshall be taken into account. These considerations include the effect of mutual coupling (MC), and the phase imbalance of the RF switch. During this project, these effects have been studied to obtain insight on theinfluence on algorithmperformance and compensation techniques.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we formulated the data model for a single receiver using a uniformlinear multiple antennasystem with an RF switch. The importance of CFO compensation, channel stationarity, and the color of noiseare addressed. A maximum likelihood (ML) based CFO estimation algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, we modeled the effect of mutual coupling and imbalance of switch. Next, we analyzed why the delay estimation is not feasible within the context of Bluetooth LE. We proposed two Line-of-Sight direction identification (LOS-Id) algorithms based on the power signature in the data covariance matrix, which are referred to as MUSIC LOS-Id and CLEAN-MUSIC LOS-Id. Further performance improvements are achieved by making use of the frequency hopping feature of Bluetooth. By aggregatingmore than one packets at different frequencies, the performance can be improved substantially. This technique is called the multi-tone technique, or packet aggregation (PA).<br/><br/>For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methods and models, a Bluetooth LE simulator is built. The performance verification is divided into two phases that differentiate themselves by the channel model. In the first phase, a simulated channel model, which is obtained by applying the ray tracer in an empty rectangular room, is used. The mutual coupling effect is simulated using the Antenna Toolbox in Matlab. The switch characteristics are verified by measurements using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). In the second phase, the real channel is measured with the VNA. Three campaigns of measurements are carried out with a 1x4, 1x8, and 2x4 antenna array respectively. Performance is evaluated by applying both channel models. The simulations reveal that the multipath effect is the dominant influencing factor of the performance in our indoor scenario, while the mutual coupling and the switch imbalance have little influence. The results also show that both proposed LOS-Id algorithms yield satisfying accuracy. However, we paid less attention to the CLEAN-MUSIC algorithm because of its complexity even though it indeed performs better than MUSIC LOS-Id in our simulated scenario. Finally, the usage of multi-tone technique improves the LOS-Id performance substantially. With an 8-element ULA and aggregating 8 tones, the MUSIC LOS-Id algorithm can achieve 10 degrees of RMSE for 90% of transmission positions with measured channels, and 3 degrees of RMSE for 50% of transmission positions.","Bluetooth Low Energy; Direction Finding; Antenna Switching; LOS Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-09-13","","","","","",""

Organ-on-chip based microfluidic systems today aim at doing so by dynamically culturing living cells in them. These are preferred owing to their small feature sizes, laminar flows, high throughput, small reagent quantities, and reduced dependency on animal studies. Substrate topography even at the submicron and nanoscale is known to induce osteogenesis by infleuncing cells at ligand/receptor levels but poses a major challenge in terms of fabrication and upscaling. The two photon polymerisation (2PP) process allows producing features in a spatially and dimensionally controlled fashion. The method is typically known for fabricating micro-sized structures but remains largely unexplored for producing features in the submicron/nano scale. This study aims at creating reproducible submicron pillar based topographies using 2PP and integrating them into a microfluidic device for studying their effect on bone regeneration. Uniform submicron patterns were produced using optimal process parameters and writing strategy. Further, the patterns were expanded to areas up to 2 mm $\times$ 1.7 mm and their uniformity was assessed. To demonstrate multiscale fabrication, these were also integrated onto a 2PP fabricated micro-scaffold in a single step process. The topography enhanced the surface hydrophilicity and could withstand flow rates of up to 8 ml/min. The human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) dynamically cultured in these integrated devices showed a healthy morphology on the pattern with no visible signs of cytotoxicity even after a period of 5 days. This study marks a step towards printing controlled submicron topographies using 2PP that can be upscaled (both spatially and dimensionally), incorporated into biocompatible microfluidic chips, and thus help in achieving the optimal microenvironment for bone regeneration studies in the future.","bone regeneration; Organ-on-a-chip; microfluidics; Submicron; multiscale; Topography; two-photon polymerization; Mesenchymal stem cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Performed full-scale tests were not able to be loaded the pile upon failure, as the pile can resist forces which are significantly larger than its design capacity. This type of pile is known for its large tensile capacity and it is used often to bear major loads in large structures, but the ultimate true capacity has not been identified yet. A better understanding in the behaviour of a MV pile can be crucial in an optimal design of such structures, as construction costs and obtained safety level can be reduced. From provided full-scale tests the uncertainties about the shape of the circumference of the injected grout body and the acting soil pressures have been reduced. Further a different relation is found between the mobilized shaft friction and the cone resistance. As the soil becomes stiffer and holds a larger cone resistance, more shaft friction is mobilized.A two-dimensional numerical model of a cross section of the pile is generated to obtain the actual shape of the circumference and the maximum shaft friction after installation. The measured grout discharges and mobilized shaft friction from pile tests were in the same range as the results obtained from this model, validating that the results of the model are within reason. All available full-scale tests were extrapolated by application of the model and generated similar capacities as the method by measured shaft friction, setting a minimum boundary for α_t at 1.4%. A second numerical model of a complete full-scale tested pile is successfully generated, including the adaptations of obtained parameters from the other model. The adaptations consist of a new circumference, different relation for EA and larger values for the maximum shaft friction. The model showed results which are in the same range as the analytical derivations regarding the course of forces and mobilized shaft friction. The modelled results do however differ slightly in value. This difference in results can be explained by the absence of detailed soil investigation. The lack of detailed geotechnical parameters would increase the accuracy of the model, as the model is very sensitive to variation in the geotechnical parameters. The produced adaptations of multiple parameters have proven however to be a better indication of the total capacity than the current norms. Therefore the norm can be adapted into a more progressive code based on the produced relations of this thesis. The adaptations in EA relation, circumference and mobilized shaft friction comprehend the behaviour of the Muller Verpress pile with a better understanding. Changing these parameters are preferred over the adaptation of the α_t factor, as the theoretical background remains in the design rule.","M.V.-piles; Data Analysis; Plaxis 2D; Pile circumference; Mobilized shaft friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Although, these scour holes were anticipated in the design phase recent bathymetry measurements show that they are growing deeper than initially predicted. Uncertainties in the predictions of the equilibrium dimensions partially arise from the presence, thickness and erodibility of clay layers, but first and foremost from a lack of understanding of the flow conditions in the vicinity of the scour holes. High flow velocities are still observed near the bed in the scour holes, that can be associated with high bed shear stresses. This implies that an equilibrium state has not yet been reached and that the scour holes still become deeper. The presence of these high flow velocities is not fully understood, making predictions on the development of the scour holes and mitigation strategies difficult. As a result, the risk of geotechnical instabilities increases, which may potentially endanger the stability of the ES-SSB.<br/><br/>The objective of this master thesis is to obtain more fundamental understanding of the flow patterns and turbulence structure in the vicinity of tidal barriers, such as the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, and how these may contribute to ongoing scour.

The objective is to find such a fleet allocation plan in which the total amount of emitted CO2 is minimised. Two different designs are suggested: a 'hub design' and an 'open network design'. For the hub network design, a couple of nodes are defined as hub where transhipment can take place. Paths from origin to destination are only possible by using at least one hub. This means that demand travels from origin to hub to destination. For the Open network design, transhipment is possible at every node. Paths from origin to destination are possible in one direct way or by using a hub. This means that two kinds of paths are possible, from origin to destination or from origin to hub to destination. By using a case study at PostNL, a carrier in the Dutch parcel delivery industry, this paper concludes that the application of Physical Internet characteristics do have its influence. In particular, the openness of a network result in a reduction in total amount of emitted CO2. During the case study at PostNL, it became clear that a CO2 reduction of 6% is possible when the elements of Physical Internet were applied on a hub network design. The open network design is able to reduce the total amount of emitted CO2 by 16%. When the demand is known by forehand this paper concludes that a less restricted network results in less CO2 emissions emitted. Destinations should be severed by more than one hub or directly by the origin depot. Transhipment should be possible at as much as nodes as possible. Concerning a case in the parcel delivery industry, it is hard to make forecasting more reliable on a daily base due to the short time windows of delivery. This means that a carrier as PostNL should innovate in the flow of information from shippers to make the application of Physical Internet feasible.","CO2 reduction; network optimisation; Physical Internet; Service network design; Fleet allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-12","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The report also proposes a reliability assessment on FT converter topologies and the effect of layering redundancy. An existing lab setup is used as a case study to create a new control system. The redundant case functions with multiple sets of phases, a fault will disable the faulted set leaving the sound phases operational.<br/>The new system aims to utilise all remaining sound phases (5 out of 6) in case of an OCF. Operating the drive system in this post-fault condition will leave the system unbalanced, leading to Common Mode (CM) voltage and current. The new system therefore has to operate with the remaining sound phases, whilst reducing the CM disturbance. It is expected that this can be achieved by modifying the control system. Expanding the control system from dq to dq0 allowed control of the zero-sequence current, the CMC.<br/>Applying the CMR control allows reduction of CMC in pre- and post-fault condition at nominal load. For post-fault this did result in a current overload of 344.21% in one of the stator phases relative to the pre-fault current. This overload should be taken into account when designing a machine for a specific applications by reducing the post-fault load or over-sizing the machine. The CMR control system proposes an approach to control the machine and reduce the CMC during post-OCF condition. The reliability assessment compared traditional VSI to OW to the extra switching leg converter. Each assessed for one, two and three sets of three phases, also for split and common DC bus. The extra<br/>switching leg and OW topology showed the highest reliability across all phase set configurations. The application of a common DC bus has greatly reduced reliability compared to a split DC bus. The reliability gain of the extra switching leg and OW converter is relatively small compared to the traditional VSI, it is concluded that the traditional VSI is a cost effective converter for achieving FT, if applied redundant.","fault tolerance; PMSM; Reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While newly built buildings will be of nearly zero energy standard by 31 December 2020 (public-owned buildings after 31 December 2018), new buildings form only 1% of the addition to the existing building stock which implies that to attain nearly zero energy standard for all building stock, large-scale renovations must be performed. However, the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard is not yet cost optimal. To improve the economic feasibility, it is important to find the parameters that have an impact on the cost-optimality of nearly zero energy renovations and the extent of their impact, the results of which can be used to drive the renovation to the nearly zero energy standard in an economically feasible manner. The primary objective of this thesis is the identification of the most important drivers of the economic feasibility of renovating houses in The Netherlands to nearly zero energy standard. The parameters were deduced from a framework available in the literature. The extent of influence was determined by performing partial sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis. Five key parameters had an impact on the NPV- energy price, energy consumption (presented as four separate sub-parameters: electricity and gas consumption both before and after renovation), renovation cost, project life cycle and discount rate. In absolute terms, gas consumption before renovation had the highest impact followed by, renovation cost, electricity consumption after renovation, discount rate, a shift of energy price to the low price scenario, life cycle of the project and electricity consumption before renovation. The gas consumption after renovation and the shift of energy price to the high prices scenario did not have a significant effect on the NPV. The most important drivers of economic feasibility of nearly zero energy renovations are reduction in the renovation cost, discounting the benefits at a lower (social) discount rate until the end of the service life of the house, increasing the retail price of natural gas, decreasing the retail price of electricity and regulation of user behavior in reducing rebound effect (the reduction in the expected energy savings primarily due to occupant’s behavior such as requirement of further comfort). Based on the obtained results, policy recommendations were provided to the Government. Suggestions for further studies include listing all parameters and determining their effect on the NPV, identifying the complete list of indirect benefits that accrue to the citizens of The Netherlands and their valuation using contingent valuation techniques, and performing a cost benefit analysis at the macroeconomic level which will not only consider wider benefits such as infrastructure savings, but also reflect the true value of indirect benefits through reduced externalities and improvement in the productivity of the people on the economy.","nearly zero energy houses; renovation; cost-benefit analysis; The Netherlands; Sensitivity Analysis; policy implementation; economic feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Identification of surrounding vessels based on visual data offers an alternative to AIS information (Automatic Identification System), the current standard in vessel identification, which can be spoofed. One visual approach employs human expertise and manually identifies vessels guided by a ship catalog. In order to minimize or potentially eliminate human error and performance limitations, there is strong interest in developing an automated vessel classification pipeline. One such pipeline is currently being developed at TNO, capable of classifying over 500 separate classes. A crucial part of the classification pipeline is retrieving an accurate contour of a vessel from a digital image.<br/> To address this important challenge, this thesis proposes an advanced deep learning pipeline to automatically segment the vessel image into background (e.g. sky and sea) and the object of interest (a vessel). Deep learning models based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) have achieved high performance on the task of semantic segmentation. Several networks such as CRF-RNN, PSPNet, DeepLab and Mask R-CNN are employed to determine a baseline performance. We will focus on identifying the cause of poor or failing segmentations and aim to construct a robust network capable of handling these challenges. By sampling disturbances, caused by ship distance and camera noise, augmented data sets are built to tune networks to input from on-site images. Additionally, experiments are done to evaluate the influence of different levels of disturbances.<br/> Previous approaches implementing the CRF-RNN network achieved top 1 and top 5 classification accuracies of 31.1% and 44.0% respectively. Employing the DeepLab network, trained to convergence on artificial noise augmented data, we report top 1 and top 5 accuracy of 68.9% and 88.8% respectively. Additionally, implementing an ensemble of classifiers, performance is increased to 73.0% and 91.7% for top 1 and top 5 accuracy respectively. This best result is comparable to the classification results with human annotated ship silhouettes. The human performance accuracy is 73.4% on top 1, and 91.3% on top 5 classification performance. Finally, we show that training on a collection of different levels of image disturbances results in a network that is robust against increasing disturbance in images, while retaining performance on clean images.<br","Semantic Segmentation; Deep Learning; Data Augmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Due to the intermittent character of renewable electricity sources and increasing decentralized electricity production, grid operators are facing challenges in balancing electricity- demand and supply within grid operations. These characteristics make it challenging for operators to forecast in- and outflowing electricity in the grid. This often leads to disadvantageous frequency-, voltage-, and electricity fluctuations in the grid. The implementation of smart grid technologies allows the easier integration of sustainable electricity sources and to increase the grid’s reliability. Additionally, more components can be integrated in the grid system that can provide grid regulating services. In the context of sustainability, it’s interesting to stress the potential of grid services delivered by parked electric vehicles. The principle of a Car as Power Plant (CaPP), where vehicles can provide electricity back to the grid via Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) technology, can potentially solve challenges that grid operators are currently facing. This can be designed in such a way that the operation becomes beneficial for all parties involved. This research implies a techno-economic assessment of a power manager device; which is a multifunctional device that includes an energy management system (EMS), allows for vehicles to charge and discharge and functions as a converter (from direct current to alternating current). The power manager enables electric vehicles to deliver ancillary services when operating in V2G mode. This research stresses the economic- and environmental benefits of a power manager; once it’s integrated in grid-connected commercial- and residential buildings. Emphasis is put on buildings in future energy systems, which are equipped with DC loads and contain features that make the building operate in a more sustainable manner than today. For this purpose, several cases have been modeled to address the cost benefits of a power manager within a buildings’ electrical system. The cost optimization is conducted by means of the HOMER optimization software. Environmental- and financial benefits could be achieved in a behind-the-meter operation, in case electricity flows are managed smartly and ancillary services are delivered to the grid. Price arbitrage and peak shaving were among the most emphasized ancillary services. By integrating electric vehicles by means of a power manager, the batteries of parked electric vehicles could get an extra function, besides being primarily used for driving purposes. Several cases have been optimized by applying a dispatch strategy, considering different components in the microgrid (solar panels, DC electrical loads, battery electric vehicles). These dispatch algorithms were embedded in the power manager’s energy management system.This research has shown that, once the vehicles’ battery capacity was aggregated for grid facilitating purposes in a behind-the-meter operation, parties could achieve financial- and environmental benefits. This could be realized by integrating permanently parked vehicles within commercial- and residential buildings’ electrical systems by means of a power manager. When a power manager was added to a building’s system without integrated solar panels, annual cost savings of € 35 and € 60 could be achieved respectively for residential- and commercial buildings by accounting for price arbitrage services. Once a power manager device was added to a building’s electrical system with integrated solar panels, the renewable energy fraction of the system increased from 53.9 to 57.4 for a residential building and from 68.0 to 70.8 in a commercial building. Altogether, price arbitrage practices primarily caused financial benefits, while peak shaving services resulted in an increase in the system’s renewability. It’s presumed that a power manager’s economic- and environmental benefits could increase once a larger battery capacity is obtained by aggregating BEVs in a ‘before-the-meter’ operation. Favorable regulations and privacy matters need to be established and discussed to make a power manager device run at its full potential. Additionally, it’s important to determine what party will be fulfilling the aggregating role, and therewith, takes the responsibility for demand response operations. For this, a potential business case is established for the implementation of a power manager in the Dutch market.","Energy management system; V2G; Grid ancillary services; Power manager; Peak shaving; Price arbitrage; Electric vehicles; Business model innovation; Car as Power Plant; Dispatch strategy; the Green Village","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Car as Power Plant (CaPP) | the Green Village","51.9981518, 4.370690500000023"

These challenges highlight the need for a greater amount of implementation of renewable energy projects. This thesis tackles one such potential project, the modeling of a tidal barrage power plant based in the Gulf of Khambhat off the Western coast of India. The Gulf of Khambhat has a high tidal range of 8-11 m, and has a large amount of energy that is theoretically available. However, only a fraction of this energy is expected to be extractable. A focus was placed on modeling the entire operation of the tidal barrage power plant and understanding the interactions of the local regime with thepower plant.Based on the results, several details about the tidal barrage power plant could be ascertained. 2 possible locations are available for placing the turbines, where sufficient depthsare present. The locations vary in the resultant tidal range available and also in the way the discharge empties/fills the basin. Based on the tidal range alone, the location on the farright of the tidal basin is deemed ideal. The turbine’s resistance to the flow also influenced the energy generation of the power plant. This influence was compared to the case without any resistance, and it was shown that in some scenarios, the resistance provided a positive influence on the energy generation. It was also shown that the barrage itself increases the tidal range available at the site.The 2 biggest influence by the local conditions were the shallowness of the basin and the presence of the tidal flats. These two factors negatively impact the energy generationin the area. The tidal flats in particular act as an obstruction to the flow, preventing a uniform filling and emptying of the basin during operation. The effects of these tidal flats are more pronounced as the water levels during operation drop. Due to this, a greater amount of energy is lost in the 2 way generation mode.The removal of these tidal flats by dredging would create a more uniform depth withing the basin and would lead to a higher energy generation, with upto 34% increase seen in the 2 way generation scenarios.Further, the strengths of the 2D modeling process was seen. For any future tidal resource assessment, not modeling the local conditions could provide highly inaccurate values of the energy generation possible.","Tidal energy; Tidal basin; 2D modeling; Delft 3D; Renewable Energy; Kalpasar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A better understanding of these events could prove beneficial towards improving a multitude of facets concerning the management of the Dutch road network. Traditional traffic event detection, based on significant changes in traffic flow/speed characteristics, is often limited by sparse road sensor coverage. More importantly, traditional detection methods are unable to categorize and describe traffic events.<br/><br/>The aim of this study is to explore to which extent geosocial data (e.g., data from Twitter and Waze) could enrich traditional traffic data (e.g., traffic speed/flow data), in order to improve the detection, categorization, and description of traffic events in the Netherlands. In order to achieve this, a pipeline was designed for extracting knowledge on traffic events from geosocial data sources. We collected geosocial data from Twitter, Waze, and TomTom and used traffic data provided by DiTTLab. We specifically focused on reports by real road users, which we define as natural persons that report on their own account, therefore excluding all legal person entity accounts such as public/private organizations, and bots. A machine learning approach was applied to automatically classify tweets as either traffic event related or not. In order to categorize tweets into a traffic event category, a rule-based traffic domain annotator was created. Additionally, a geocoding method to link tweets to a geographic location was developed. As Waze and TomTom event reports are classified and geocoded by default, we could cluster these reports together with the processed tweets based on their categorical, spatial and temporal extent into a combined traffic event. These combined traffic event reports were then linked to traffic data, based on corresponding spatial and temporal aspects. In order to present the collected data, a web-based interactive map application was built.<br/><br/>This methodology was applied to data collected over the period from 05-12-2017 to 17-02-2018. From the set of collected tweets approximately 6.71% proved traffic event related. Based on a linear support vector machine classification model we achieved an average f1-score of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.954, for detecting traffic event-related tweets. The rule-based traffic domain annotator showed an average f1-score of 0.874, and an accuracy of 0.964. The geocoding method proved able to geocode tweets to a location that covers all place indicators in a tweet in 86% of the evaluated cases. The remaining 14% of the tweets either got geocoded to a part of relevant indicators or to no relevant indicators at all. Our clustering approach is able to cluster 39.61% of the event reports into a traffic event report cluster consisting out of more than one event report, from which 48.66% could be linked to traffic data.<br/><br/>All in all, based on the achieved results, this work shows that geosocial data can be used to enrich traffic data towards the improvement of the detection, categorization, and description of non-recurrent traffic events.","Traffic Events; Traffic Congestion; Social Media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Aims: It is shown that due to the dynamic calculation of the near and far angle, the simulated driver is less sensitive to change of the Kp or Kc parameter value during a drive. Static calculation of the near and far angle showed a wider range of drivers that can be identified before the start of the drive, but is less adaptable to change during the drive. Methods: The range for the two parameters Kc and Kp was determined by setting two boundaries, whilst keeping the other parameters constant: the lateral position is bound to an absolute value of 1.8 meter and the steering wheel reversal rate to a maximum of 6. A ten by ten resolution range is subsequently established to form the basis for the simulations. The simulated results from the nonlinear and linear model are assessed on three criteria: realism, identifiability and descriptiveness. The three criteria show the realistic fit of the simulated data in comparison to real driver data. Results: Static calculation of the near and far angle can capture a broader set of human drivers front end if the parameter set of the driver is know front end.

Therefore the transition towards a renewable transport and energy system is becoming more and more important. Electric vehicles are a big part of this transition and therefor the use of them should be promoted. However drawbacks such as operating range and charging time are obstacles for this transition. To help in this transition wireless charging has been investigated in recent years. <br/><br/>In this thesis the design and implementation of a misalignment tolerant control scheme for a bidirectional inductive power transfer is discussed. This control scheme allows the transformer coils to be misalignment while ensuring that the maximum power transfer efficiency of the inductive link is tracked. To do this the resonance frequency of the primary or secondary current is tracked. Furthermore two dc/dc converters are used before the inverter and after the rectifier, here one is used for controlling the power while the other is tracking the maximum power transfer efficiency point (MEPT). In order to calculate this MEPT, the coupling of the transformer coils is calculated using the primary (or secondary, depending on the direction of power) dc link currents and voltages. <br/><br/>The first part of thesis is a literature review including an investigation of the dynamics of a series-series resonant tank, part of this analysis is about the bifurcation phenomena. Since for control purposes it is important to determine the conditions for bifurcation free operation and the effects of bifurcation. Next, the best control scheme for controlling the output power is discussed and finally the proposed misalignment tolerant control scheme is proposed including how to estimate the transformer coupling and how to track the resonance frequency. It was found that using the MEPT control scheme bifurcation is always avoided. <br/><br/>The second part of this thesis about the dynamic modelling and the design of the controllers. This dynamic model is comprised out of three different models, two of which are the dc/dc converters and one is the inductive link (specified from inverter input to rectifier output). These models are then combined in order to get the frequency response of the entire system. Based on this model the voltage controllers are designed. <br/><br/>The third and final part of this thesis is about the practical implementation of the needed hardware en the results obtained using the MEPT control scheme. In the end an improvement in efficiency of 5\% was achieved at optimal alignment, up to 23\% increase under 8 cm misalignment.

The clusters themselves reveal interesting attacking capabilities, such as port scans, and the same Command and Control server responding to different malware families.

Network-decentralised means that each agent only has knowledge about its own state and the state of its neighbouring agents. In this thesis the multi-agent system consists of holonomic robots moving in a 2-dimensional configuration space. Each agent is equipped with a collision avoidance algorithm which does not need unmeasurable information from other agents, hence it is completely decentralised. The collision avoidance algorithm gen- erates a reference velocity which is always away and (counter-clockwise) around a possible collision. Cooperation of the agents is reached by estimating their position and moving in an assigned formation by only communicating with neighbouring agents, hence the strategy is network-decentralised. The communication network of the agents is modelled as a graph and described by the associated incidence matrix. This thesis combines for the first time the network-decentralised estimation method proposed by Giordano et al. [1] together with the network-decentralized control method proposed by Blanchini et al. [2] and a collision avoidance algorithm. When anonymity in coordination is possible the agents are able to switch target location. Each agent solves a local optimisation problem to minimise the total distance travelled by itself and its neighbouring agents. The agent with the highest cost sav- ings is allowed to reallocate the target locations. The results obtained in the simulations are very promising and suggest that the proposed algorithms can be successfully implemented to efficiently coordinate agents and avoid collisions in real-world applications.","Collision Avoidance; Decentralized Control; Multi-Agent System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Heerink, Nick (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Delivering air power is the main goal of an Air Force. Military aircraft used to deliver this air power are required to be maintained in accordance with a so-called Aircraft Maintenance Program (AMP). Utilization of military aircraft is assumed to be constant when constructing an AMP. In reality, usage can drastically change over both short- and long-term periods as a result of political choices, as well as sudden deployments and changing mission types. These changes in usage will have its effect on system condition and by extension on required maintenance. In order to guarantee optimal efficiency and effectiveness of the AMP, these changes in usage should be taken into account while reviewing the AMP. Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) can be used to support in analysing usage on a detailed level. A tool which is able to incorporate both historical and (expected) future usage will be of great help to a maintenance engineer responsible for reviewing the AMP on a yearly basis.<br/>In this research, a tool has been developed able to support in maintenance decisions on interval adjustments and incorporating system usage. Various methods and algorithms are incorporated of which some are novel contributions in their own right. The developed tool uses HUMS data, flight planning data, and design data to provide a possible adjustment on maintenance intervals. The tool takes both historical usage and expected future usage into account. The model is able to translate usage profiles (as defined by the operator) into usage on a very detailed level. This translation creates possibilities to determine usage effects on system condition. Translation to this detailed level of usage is achieved by processing HUMS data through rule-based flight regime recognition algorithms. Finally, the model includes a method to carry out a simplified business case to show possible gains resulting from the proposed interval adjustment. <br/>The model is tested by applying case study data originated from the Apache helicopter of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF). The used data to train and test the model covers three years of operation: 2014-2016. Concerning accrued fatigue damage, case study results show an average severity factor of 0.37. This factor is based on the accrued fatigue damage resulting from usage conform the design spectra as defined by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The maintenance intervals, currently used by the RNLAF and defined in the AMP, are based on these design spectra. Validation of the model is carried out by making use of a dedicated validation dataset (covering the year 2017). Both historical and expected (extreme severe) future usage are incorporated to set up business cases for three Fatigue Life Limited (FLL) Critical Safety Items (CSIs). These business cases revealed potential gains in component and maintenance cost when adapting the proposed interval adjustment. For these three components, the model proposed interval escalations of 42%, 44%, and 94% where both historical and expected future usage is taken into account. <br","Flight Regime Recognition; condition based maintenance; Prognostics; Health and Usage Monitoring Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2028-09-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This has led to a large emphasis from both scientific and aviation safety communities on the prevention of aircraft upset conditions.

This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of a Vertical Situation Display (VSD) with ecological enhancements visualizing changes in the flight performance envelope. <br/>Sixteen pilots were tasked to fly approach and go-around scenarios with both a baseline and an ecological VSD, some of the scenarios containing flight control failures. Results show that the new display makes pilots maintain larger margins in velocity, thus spending less time below the advised minimum speed limit in final approach. However, these larger velocity margins also led to larger errors with respect to target velocities. Flight control failures were more often and more quickly discovered, and pilots reported feeling better able to predict dangerous situations. No significant differences in workload were recorded. These results conclude that the new VSD design enhances safety performance, but simultaneously raise the question whether the effect of enlarged safety margins is desirable if it causes a reduction in velocity tracking.","Ecological Interface Design; Vertical Situation Display; Flight envelope","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-09","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The annual average precipitation of 800-1250 mm/y is theoretically sufficient for farmers to be year-round self-sufficient. However, the majority of precipitation falls in a 4-month wet season spanning from late May to October. As a consequence, the region is subjected to both seasonal flooding and long periods of drought. The dry season agriculture is of moderate intensity, takes place at small-scale and is groundwater dependent. In the near future it is not unthinkable that extraction exceeds natural recharge and groundwater withdrawal is no longer sustainable in the northern Ghana regions. The small-holder farmers' use of Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) systems can potentially contribute to the continued sustainable use of groundwater in northern Ghana. An ASR system acts as a seasonal bridge. The system recharges flood water and extracts groundwater in periods of drought. A feasibility study on the sustainable use of an ASR system in northern Ghana has been performed by taking present conditions and multiple system improvements into account.<br/><br/>Aquifer tests are carried out at five study sites in northern Ghana to determine local geohydrological conditions. The TTim analytic element modelling environment is used to analyze the obtained groundwater drawdown data and derive parameters for subsurface characteristics. TTim allows for the inclusion of additional model parameters (e.g. borehole storage, well skin resistance and multiple model layers) and outperforms the analytic Theis method in this research. Although some uncertainties are present in the derived subsurface parameters, plausible values for transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) are suggested to be present in the ranges of respectively 1 to 100 (m2/d) and 1e-3 to 1e-2 (-).<br/><br/>The year-round performance of a northern Ghana single ASR system is studied with a MODFLOW model. The potential types of ASR system improvements that are examined are (a) the extension of daily pumping time, (b) the enlargement of the borehole diameter, and (c) the reduction of the well skin resistance. The ASR systems sensitivities to changing environmental conditions are explored by (a) the degradation of well depth by clogging, (b) the shortening of the wet season inundation time, and (c) the reduction of the wet season inundation levels. Research results show that well maintenance is key for the performance of existing (and new) ASR systems. The recharge and discharge volumes can be improved by cleaning of the borehole depth and well screen. In the case of a new ASR system, the performance can positively be influenced by an enlargement of the borehole diameter. Furthermore, the construction of a proper permeable well skin (screen and gravel-pack around the well) can also result in increased system capacities. Despite the imposed options of system modifications, the geographic position of an ASR system remains of utmost importance for system performance. The construction of an ASR system at a location sensitive to flooding (riverbank overtopping or rainfall based) can be beneficial from a sustainable perspective. Recharge volumes are normative for the sustainable use of an ASR system. The recharges are (approximately linear) dependent on the time-span and levels of inundation. Moreover, the research contains soil scenarios, and demonstrates that the ASR system performs significantly better in regions with higher transmissivity (T) values.<br/><br/>To give insight on some financial aspects of an operational ASR system, the obtained (improved) ASR system discharge capacities are transformed to agricultural and financial yields. A subdivision of the dry season into a tomato and a groundnut cropping season demonstrates that financial yields are crop type dependent. The ASR system revenues are dominantly affected by the choice in crop type(s) and crop-specific market prices. The yields are compared to the ASR system pumping costs. The importance of pump selection is demonstrated by the implementation of the Pedrollo 4"" submersible pump efficiencies. The use of a pump that is tuned to local conditions can be beneficial for the operational costs of an ASR system. Although no distinctive conclusion on the financial feasibility can be drawn, the examined system improvements are substantially beneficial for the revenues of a northern Ghana ASR system.<br","Aquifer Storage and Recovery; ASR; TTim; MODFLOW; Pumping test; northern Ghana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9.432919, -0.848452"

Announcements of bigger offshore wind turbines, the interest in new locations for offshore wind farms in harsher environments and the appearance of zero subsidy bids are proof of a rapid development. The next generation turbines are expected to be significantly larger and heavier compared with the current operating turbines. This poses new requirements for safe and efficient installation, requirements that go beyond the capabilities of existing jack-up installation vessels and equipment. Therefore, to avoid bottlenecks for future development, new installation equipment is needed. The goal of this thesis is to find an efficient way for installation of future offshore wind turbines with a rated power of up to 20MW.<br/><br/>The characteristics of these large size turbines were studied by examining the relation between the rated power and the rotor diameter of operating offshore wind turbines. The derived dependencies between the desired power and the required area of the rotor were validated with data from announced turbines. Extrapolating these dependencies has resulted in a prediction for the 20MW turbine of a rotor diameter of 250 metres, a hub height of 160 metres above sea level and a nacelle with a mass of around 1100 tonnes.<br/><br/>To be able to develop new concepts for the installation of these turbines, interviews were conducted with industry experts and criteria were derived. Next, upscaling of the equipment of the current jack-up vessel was investigated, already existing concepts were reviewed and new concepts were developed. Based on the set criteria, a suitable installation concept was chosen. <br/><br/>The chosen concept eliminates the need for lifting the heaviest component (the nacelle) to the highest height (hub height) by dividing the tower of the turbine into several segments. It consists of a temporary installation frame that can be placed from a jack-up vessel on top of the foundation of an offshore wind turbine. While installing the frame on the foundation with a crane, the nacelle, hub and blades are mounted together on the deck of the jack-up vessel, forming the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA). Then, the RNA together with the first segment of the tower is placed in the frame, skidded sideways and brought up by a built-in jacking mechanism in the frame. It needs to be brought up 45 metres, so the following segment of 40 metres can be skidded underneath. While jacking the first segment, the following segment is placed next to the lift frame and prepared to be skidded. After the skidding of the next segment is finished, the previous segment is lowered on top of the other segment and they are mounted together. While fastening the connection, the jacking mechanism is lowered by recycling the strokes so it can start lifting the next segment. This is repeated until the complete turbine has been installed. When all the tower segments are installed, the turbine can be commissioned and the frame is retrieved.<br/><br/>Optimisation of the concept has been performed by highlighting the logistical process regarding placement of the frame, lifting of the turbine and retrieval of the frame. A concept design is presented that can install the future offshore wind turbines with a rated power of up to 20MW. It is able to install the large size turbines faster compared to upscaling the existing installation equipment, it can be used for several turbine sizes and it only requires small modifications on the design of an offshore wind turbine.<br/><br/>The concept consists of a jack-up vessel from where the installation is performed offshore. This was preferred over a floating vessel, since movement of the jack-up vessel is reduced significantly when lifted out of the water. For wider applicability of the developed concept, for example on a free floating vessel, (non jack-up), further research is required to reduce motions between the turbine and the foundation.<br","Offshore Wind Turbine; Installation; Transportation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-10","","","","","",""

A transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces the amputated limb. Although trauma related amputations are going down annually, there is still the need for prostheses that are capable of restoring normal biological knee function. Active micro-processor knees are a type of transfemoral prosthesis that can supply energy for activities therefore making many activities of daily living like chair and stair negotiation possible, how-ever these devices are not yet commercially available as it does not yet meet the requirement of robust and unambiguous mode switching. One aspect of active microprocessor knees that needs improvement is the intent recognition system that perceives the intent of the user. A novel hybrid intent recognition algorithm based on machine learning using solely mechanical signals was developed and tested in this thesis. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing be-tween the modes Standing, Sitting, Walking, Ramp Ascent, Ramp Descent, Stair Ascent and Stair Descent. The analysis of the algorithm was done on an open source healthy subject gait data set containing a total of 476 trials. The analysis involved determining recognition error rates and decision times for a novel subject’s data. The proposed algorithm fuses data from Inertial Measurement Units(IMUs) worn on the shank and knee joint encoders to make the decisions. The algorithm can achieve an overall error rate of 14.28%, the error rate reduces to 2.62% when grouping the Ramp Ascent and Ramp Descent together with the Walking mode.Decision times are, on average 9.59ms after a transition for critical transitions between stair modes and walking. For transitions between less critical modes like sitting and standing, decisions are taken with a maximum delay of 610ms. All transitions were successfully detected in 229 out of the 476 trials. The remaining trials had misclassifications due to improper labeling and variations in gait speed among the users. A preliminary analysis into adding ground reaction forces and moments indicates that the error rates can be decreased with it’s use. The research concludes that a hybrid classifier in which ramp walking is treated as level ground walking is a good starting point for implementing on the transfemoral prosthesis.","Prosthesis; Intent Recognition; Gait characteristics; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Eutectic freeze crystallisation (EFC) has been identified as a potential technology that can assist to achieve such goal. High quality of salt and ice can be retrieved with this treatment with a note of high energy efficiency. In this paper, based on an actual case of a Spanish silica production company, freeze and eutectic freeze crystallisation are found to be applicable to a complex RO concentrate, which involved Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, SiO2. Quality ice and mirabilite products were also produced, which the impurities attached can be further washed away easily. The influence of the impurities on the eutectic point of sodium sulphate solution is investigated. A conservative recovery rate of 42wt% and 55wt% are obtained respectively for mirabilite and ice. Heat transfer characteristics of the equipment are also conducted, the boundary layers in the working solution and in the coolant have a clear influence on the overall heat transfer. A heat transfer of 404W/K-m2 is obtained for the EFC cooling, which is found to be comparable to past study. Energy consumption for a complete EFC process on the RO concentrate is estimated to be 0.1437 kWh/kg-solution, which is only 22% of the energy consumed in heat crystallisation. Column crystalliser is suggested to be a possible method to resolve impurities accumulation issue. Torque was also identified to indicate nucleation and crystallisation during the process. A crystal size distribution model is developed and can be used to evaluate or predict the performance of an EFC system. During the thesis study, a successful demonstration and training was provided to the staff from Fundació CTM Centre Tecnològic, which is the respondent for the Spanish case and will later perform a EFC experiment in the treatment plant.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Bayesian updating is a technique to probabilistically update the model prediction based on measurement data. One of the solutions to obtaining this data is test loading a quay wall. How to perform a test load and possible other solutions to obtaining the measurement data are not part of this research. The research focusses on how to use the data one obtains from a test loading. The effectiveness of test loading is reviewed by performing Bayesian updates with several fictitious measurement cases. Both Blum and a finite element model are updated based on fictitious strain and displacement measurements. The results show that Bayesian updating successfully reduces the standard deviations in all model predictions. This has a significant impact on the calculated reliability indices. The key benefit of performing a Bayesian update is that a statistically most likely combination of stochastic input parameters is determined. The thesis gives recommendations towards an application of Bayesian updating in practice and as fictitious measurement cases are used, an overall strategy is given for obtaining the required measurement data in practice.","Bayesian updating; Quay structures; Probabilisitic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

We show that (1) a previously suggested method to detect an ocean on an exoplanet, based on the shift of the peak value of the degree of polarization towards the Brewster angle, is sensitive to atmospheric surface pressure, (2) the clouds are not necessarily a limiting factor for detecting an ocean when a gas layer on top of the cloud is considered and a set of wavelengths is used, (3) the phase curves of the different wavelengths intersect in one point whose location could help estimating the cloud fraction and that (4) such an intersection in the polarized flux could be observed in the presence of an ocean for surface pressures up to 10 bar and cloud fractions up to 95%, while it never occurs in the absence of an ocean.

For this reason, SET works-out designs with a natural impermeable clay layer, an artificial underwater concrete floor or an artificial impermeable gel layer. Additionally, designs with different retaining walls and grout anchors or struts are worked-out. The design of an excavation pit must meet structural and environmental requirements. A vertical, horizontal and moment equilibrium must hold in the excavation pit. In urban areas, the most important concern is avoiding inadmissible damage or hindrance to adjacent structures, because the surrounding buildings are owned by third parties and deformations, causing damage to these buildings, happen quick. For this reason, the design of the excavation pit must meet the settlement requirements of the surrounding buildings. For each design, “Economisch Meest Voordelige Inschrijving” (EMVI) (Economically Most Attractive Tender) scores are used to quantify each design on durability, the impact on the surroundings, hindrance and risk. EMVI in combination with the cost estimates is used to find the design with the best cost to quality ratio. Rijkswaterstaat has determined a “Milieu Kosten Indicator” (MKI) (Environmental Cost Indicator) value for each building material. In this thesis, this value is used to quantify the environmental impact of a design<br/><br/>An analysis was made on the capabilities that a design tool should have. A literature study was performed on the BIM technologies. From this analysis six BIM technologies are included in the development of the tool. These are: parametric design, algorithmic design, collaborative design, central repository, interoperability and standardization. Additionally, for the development of the design tool, different programming languages and development platforms were considered. A combination of Python and JavaScript together with the Web-based Graphics Library (WebGL) was found to be most suitable. A Python back-end processes the data and runs a design algorithm, while the web-based front-end facilitates collocative design and 3D visualisations. The sever, created with the Python module Django, is used for the communication between Python and JavaScript. The JavaScript module Three.js is used to utilize the WebGL capabilities. <br/><br/>The development of the design tool, called SET (Smart Engineering Tool), is based on the method of rapid prototyping. This includes prototyping, test and review, refine and iterate. The prototyping process is split into four stages: (1) Interoperability and Standardization, (2) Design algorithm, (3) Collaboration, Interaction and 3D Visuals and (4) Integration. In each of these stages, an essential part of SET was developed. SET is interoperable with Plaxis 2D, a geotechnical finite element program and uses the input of GIS and RockWorks. SET’s internal design algorithm determines what excavation site designs should be calculated by Plaxis. This is based on user settings, and the boundary conditions, surrounding and environmental requirements. The boundary conditions are extracted from GIS files and from RockWorks models. The surrounding buildings are extracted from GIS, and RockWorks supplies the soil stratification. The design tool interprets these boundary conditions and standardizes the data. All data is transferred to a parallel computer, where finite element calculations are performed in Plaxis. Plaxis calculates the vertical, horizontal and moment equilibria and the deformations of the soil. SET analyses the successful Plaxis results and performs a unity check on bending moments in the retaining walls together with an analysis on the settlements requirements of the surrounding buildings. SET is tested and reviewed, by a geotechnical expert and an engineer, with two test cases. The results of these tests cases were analysed and validated. The functionalities and the user-friendliness of the tool have been scrutinized. Based on these tests, SET was reviewed, and refinements and iterations of the design tool emerged. <br/><br/><br/><br/>During the development of SET, Witteveen+Bos was working on a tender. The tendered project is a design of a bus lane next to the existing train tracks and is called “Hoogwaardig Openbaar Vervoer in het Gooi” (high quality public transport), in short “HOV in ‘t Gooi”. The currently level intersection of the bus lane with the ‘Oosterengweg’ was used to test SET with two test cases. A tunnel for the Oosterengweg underneath the train track and bus lane, was the first case and a tunnel for the train tracks and bus lane underneath the Oosterengweg, was the second case. The first case, was a similar solution as the final tender design of Witteveen+Bos. The second case however, was an “out of the box” design and which was initially deemed unfeasible by Witteveen+Bos. The testcases took around one hour to prepare in SET. For both test cases, the corresponding Plaxis calculations took around a day of computation time to finish. As a result, SET found many feasible designs for both test cases, in two days. The design of the train and bus tunnel, that was deemed unfeasible, was found to be feasible and almost a third of the cost compared to the Oosterengweg tunnel. However, it must be noted that the costs to redirect the train tracks and the maximum obstruction time of the train was not included in these designs. <br/><br/>It can be concluded that SET is partly BIM level-3. The foundations of the SET lie in BIM level-1 and -2. The design tool supports 2D and 3D visuals and parametric design is used in an object-oriented manner for the design of the excavation pit. The tool does not use the all-enveloping BIM standard IFC. However, the design tool does use standardization. Based on requirements from the surroundings and the environment, SET helps to explore a large number of designs in a short period of time and visualizes different designs in 3D and in an interactive graph. The data is managed from a server, which acts as a central repository. Stakeholders can access this server from a web browser and are able to analyse their preferred designs within the extended design space. <br/><br/>SET shows 6 major benefits. (1) During the conceptual design phase, the feasibility of designs in a large design space can be analysed without being labour intensive and within a short amount of time. (2) The decisions concerning the final design can be postponed to the very end. Thus, designs that would conventionally be deemed unfeasible in the conceptual stage can emerge as feasible in later stages. (3) The possibility of a collaborative platform stimulates shared and parallel decision making. Each stakeholder can incorporate various requirements, limitations and responsibilities into the model, which utilizes the knowledge and expertise of each stakeholder. (4) The design tool can be used from the very beginning in meetings and discussions with clients to convey information in real time, by the means of 3D visuals. Clients can be granted remote access to SET and evaluate design solutions from the comfort of their office, without sharing valuable scripts and sensitive or private data. (5) Calculations can be processed automatically on a parallel server without the supervision of an engineer. (6) SET integrates multiple design tools like GIS, RockWorks and Plaxis. Overall, SET reduces the required labour to create a design and increases the productivity of an engineer. This reduces the costs of the design process and allows engineers to create “out of the box designs”.<br/> <br","BIM; Parametric design; Interoperability; Standardization; Algorithmic design; Collaborative design; BIM level 3; excavation pits; Design tool; smart decision tool; Plaxis 2D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

To allow application of natural investigation procedures in such scenarios, haptic interfaces with several degrees of freedom (DOF) are necessary, which allow the interaction with a variety of solid objects as well as different surrounding mediums. The goal of this work is to develop an algorithm for a high-DOF hand exoskeleton as haptic interface connected to five points on the human hand, that enables the perception of virtual fluids by rendering the fluids’ prominent proprioceptive characteristic (viscosity). To allow simultaneous rendering of virtual solid objects of varying stiffness, a high update rate should be maintained. To quantify human perception of the rendered fluid, two user studies are carried out. The first investigates the ability to perceive fluids of low viscosity such as water, while the second deals with the discrimination ability for higher viscous virtual fluids. For virtual fluids with low viscosity, it is found that a linear relationship exists between the rendered and perceived viscosity with a scaling factor of 2. Fluids with high viscosity (&gt; 10 Pa s) can be discriminated well, achieving similar values for the Weber fractions (w = 0.3) as are found in real interactions with fluids. The results of both experiments prove that properties of fluids rendered using simplified models to allow high update frequencies (833 Hz) can still be discriminated by human users.","human machine interaction; multi-finger force feedback; proprioception; drag forces; fluid dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-06","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

However, these renewable sources such as wind and solar have fluctuating power output. This fluctuation causes strain on the power system and can cause imbalances between generation and load which may result in frequency instability. In the current liberalized energy market, the system operator uses ancillary services market to procure frequency containment reserve (FCR) which arrests undesirable frequency excursions within the first few seconds after the occurrence of an imbalance and ensures satisfactory primary frequency control. The system operator also procures frequency restoration reserve (FRR) which helps restore the frequency to its nominal value. <br/>Electrolyzers can manage their demand of electrical energy for production of hydrogen (i.e. power-to-gas conversion) and it is possible to store that generated hydrogen for long periods which is an advantage compared to battery storage. This hydrogen can be used for several applications (e.g. transportation), and part of it can be used by fuel cells to provide electrical power back to the power system when needed. One of the technologies used in electrolyzers and fuel cells is the proton exchange membrane (PEM). Fuel cells and electrolyzers based on PEM technology are capable of rapidly changing the power set point to increase or decrease the power demand or supply, respectively. <br/>This thesis studies the PEM electrolyzers and fuel cells and their ability to support the frequency stability through participation in the ancillary services market. Based on DIgSILENT PowerFactory software package, this thesis develops generic dynamic models for PEM fuel cell and electrolyzer for frequency stability studies and uses these models to assess their effectiveness in providing frequency support and participation in the FCR market. Numerical simulations are performed on two dynamic test systems: The North Netherlands 380 kV transmission and its extension to include a reduced size representation of the transmission systems covering the North-West Germany and South Denmark. Both dynamic test systems are developed in PowerFactory based on the detailed model of continental Europe built in PSS®E software package.<br/>The developed model for the fuel cell shows close resemblance to the literature data for both dynamic and static performance especially in the linear operating range. The simulation results show that PEM devices can provide frequency support in the FCR market and results in improved frequency nadir and reduced oscillations during the post-disturbance period which is considerably better than what can be achieved by using the currently in operation primary frequency control of the conventional power plants with synchronous generators.<br/>The numerical simulations also include sensitivity analysis to changing system operating conditions such as network size, location of PEM devices and system inertia. It is found that changing the location of the PEM devices or the size of the network does not affect the performance in supporting the frequency. Also, it is found that PEM devices provide significantly improved frequency response compared with synchronous generators at lower system inertia levels. Sensitivity analysis to changing control parameters for PEM devices such as the bid size and frequency droop showed that increasing the bid size or droop results in improved frequency response in the form of lower nadir.<br/>Some confidential information within this thesis have been removed.

However, offshore wind turbines are founded on large diameter monopiles with an L/D ratio &lt; 8, which are rather rigid piles. There are concerns about the applicability of the standard p-y approach to piles that have low L/D ratios and it is expected that other soil reaction terms such as base shear, base moment and distributed moment also play a role in rigid pile behaviour (Davidson &amp; Donovan, 1983). Due to the increasing demand for renewable energy, the offshore industry is taking a leap when it comes to the development of offshore wind parks. Because power generated by a wind turbine is directly related to rotor diameter and thus to monopile dimensions, it is expected that monopiles with even lower L/D ratios will become standard. With the prospect that 27 % of European energy should be generated by renewable energy sources by 2030 (EUCO 169/14, 2014), efficient design methods for offshore wind turbine foundations are desired. Therefore, in this thesis, the performance of the current design approach is analysed and an investigation is conducted into the development of a new design method for large diameter piles in sand that are tailored to the offshore wind industry. In 2013, the PISA (PIle Soil Analysis) project, a joint industry research project, has been established to develop a new design method for large diameter monopiles under lateral loading. As part of the project, pile load tests (PLTs) and cone penetration tests (CPTs) were performed in Dunkirk, in sand. This new (unpublished) design method includes the derivation of soil springs, that represent the additional soil reaction terms, by using complicated Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations which require input from advanced laboratory tests. Even though these calculations are accurate, they are also time-consuming. In the past two decades, several cone penetration test (CPT)-based p-y methods have been published. With these methods, p-y soil springs are derived directly from CPT data and used as input in a pile-response model, avoiding the necessity of advanced laboratory testing and FEM calculations. In this thesis, the performance of CPT-based p-y methods, compared to the current approach is evaluated by using the API RP 2GEO p-y method (2011) together with CPT-based p-y methods published by Novello (1999), Dyson &amp; Randolph (2001), Li, Igoe &amp; Gavin (2014) and Suryasentana &amp; Lehane (2016) to simulate the pile behaviour of short (L/D=3), medium (L/D=5.25) and large (L/D=8) piles that were tested in Dunkirk during the PISA project. A pile-response model is built in MATLAB to perform these calculations quickly and accurately. It is found that the API p-y method generally overestimates the pile response compared to results of CPT-based p-y methods and PLT measurements, especially for the short pile. Therefore it can be concluded that the current API p-y approach is not sufficient for predicting short pile behaviour. The CPT-based p-y methods predict stiffer responses, yet not stiff enough to match PLT measurements of the short pile. This strengthens the expectations that for short pile behaviour, apart from the p-y term, also other soil reaction terms play a role. Still, the largest contribution to pile displacement y is determined by the lateral soil pressure p (Byrne, et al., 2015a). Therefore, the development of a new p-y method based on the longest pile (L/D=8) that was available from the PISA PLT data set is investigated first. This investigation involves processing PISA PLT data into pile displacement- and soil pressure profiles. During this process, it is found that the direct differentiation of raw PISA measurement data comes with problems and results into wiggly soil pressure profiles. Curve fitting the moment profile has been applied in an attempt to overcome this issue. In this thesis, all ‘simple’ MATLAB curve fitting techniques have been analysed for the pile with L/D=8. The curve fitting techniques that have been investigated can be separated into four different types: global polynomials, interpolation splines, smoothing splines and least-squares splines. The ‘simple’ MATLAB curve fitting techniques in combination with the PISA PLT data did not result in a trustworthy pressure profile. Hence it was not feasible to continue the research into a new CPT-based p-y method based on the ‘simple’ MATLAB curve fitting techniques and the PISA data that was available. However, a future work approach is presented that can be used as a guideline for further research into the development of a new CPT-based design method for large diameter monopiles. A step-by-step approach is given for the complete derivation of CPT-based p-y curves from PLT data, together with the first steps for deriving springs for the additional soil reaction terms. The future work approach elaborates on data gathering, PLT testing, PLT data processing, curve fitting, how to the link p-y curves to qc data, and what formulas can be used as a preliminary basis for the derivation of the base shear, base moment and distributed moment. Following the future work approach created in this thesis, an accurate and cost efficient design method for offshore wind turbines could be developed that positively contributes to the energy transition and a sustainable environment.","p-y curve; PISA project; Offshore Wind Turbine; lateral pile displacement; CPT-based correlations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-01","","","","","",""

An example of such an application is neural brain probes. This thesis focuses on the introduction of parylene and platinum to the F2R technology. This is a challenging task, as many different technologies have to be introduced and modified. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis was to develop a fabrication process that allows for the electrical and mechanical evaluation of flexible parylene-platinum based electrodes and interconnects. In order to electrically and mechanically evaluate the devices, test structures were designed. These test structures make the electrical and mechanical evaluation possible and can be used for further evaluation of future developments. Furthermore, several fabrication technology modules have been developed. The effect of particles on the stability of the device has been reduced by investigating their origin. The step coverage of platinum was improved by optimizing the dry etching of parylene. This was done by introducing CF4 to the etching process, which resulted in a desired 45° slope of sidewall of the parylene structures. Also, the patterning of platinum was improved by separating the etching process into two steps. This resulted in fenceless and clean metallization. Since the adhesion of the layers is of major importance for in-body applications, the adhesion of parylene and platinum was investigated. By exploring several adhesion promoting techniques, the overall adhesion of the devices was found to be good, and therefore sufficient for electrochemical characterization. All the previous technology modules were integrated where possible, and have led to the fabrication of flexible parylene-platinum based devices. These test devices consist of a silicon island with bond pads and flexible part with electrodes and a comb-meander structure. Rolling tests have shown that the devices can be rolled to an inner diameter of &lt;1 mm without damaging the interconnects.

A validation procedure will study the effect of grid size (using grid convergence<br/>study) and type of simulation (2-Dimensional/3-Dimensional) used to model the experiment numerically. The final goal of the study is to understand the relationship between the overflowing discharge and the additional force generated due to the non-aeration of the over-flow jet. The entrainment of air from the cavity under the over-flow jet is also of prime interest in this study.<br/>Overall, the numerical results indicate that non-aeration could provide about 17.85% additional force leading to failure by sliding/overturning. It was observed that the forcing on the caisson is not constant but cyclic. This is<br/>a key result from this study affecting the design of the caisson breakwater. Additionally, the aeration mechanism and overflow jet breakup during the flow were also investigated. A mechanism for aeration of the cavity has been proposed as observed in the numerical model results. However, due to the limited scope of the study and time constraints, further investigations with respect to the overflow discharges was not possible.","Breakwater Overtopping; OpenFOAM; CFD modelling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","39.27581, 141.88569"

Conceptual studies on semi-closed cycles, where part of the engine mass flow rate is recirculated through the engine core, have shown that a significant reduction in engine weight can be obtained in comparison with equivalent open cycle solutions. This thesis presents a preliminary design and optimization study of semi-closed cycle engines for high altitude UAV applications. A detailed thermodynamic and mechanical model has been created to correlate component performance and weight variation as function of thermodynamic design parameters. The model has been coupled with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to optimize various engine cycles and to assess the trade-off between minimum SFC and minimum engine weight. Results have shown that a considerable degree of compactness can be obtained with this novel configuration, leading to an overall engine weight approximately two time lower than conventional open cycles.","Semi-closed cycles; UAV propulsion; Small gas turbines; Novel cycle modeling; Cycle thermodynamics; Performance comparison; Multi-objective optimization; NPSS (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation)","en","master thesis","","","","","","Thesis in cooperation with the University of Sydney, Australia.","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

First, homogeneous Lévy models are defined and an already known nonparametric method, using Fourier techniques and call and put option prices, for estimating the parameters of the model is described based on Belomestny and Reiẞ (2006a). Previous research suggests that there is a need for an extension of this concept since option prices with different maturities produce significantly different results. After all, the assumption that the parameters of the model are the same for any time window is not realistic and better results could be achieved once this premise is rejected. That is why inhomogeneous Lévy processes are introduced and studied in this report. The estimation method for the homogeneous model from Belomestny and Reiẞ (2006a) is extended to fit into the inhomogeneous framework. Next, asymptotic normality of the estimators is proven for these processes in this setting and confidence intervals are constructed using the finite sample variance method. Asymptotic normality has already been shown and confidence intervals have been constructed in the homogeneous framework in the continuous observational model by Söhl (2014). Finally, data is simulated from an inhomogeneous Merton model to test the performance of the method and options from the S&amp;P 500 index are used as a real-world application.","Statistics; Inhomogeneous Levy processes; Confidence intervals; Asymptotic normality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From every 10.000 drug candidates that are introduced to the preclinical phase, only 5 are chosen to be tested for clinical trials. In order to overcome the challenges with current drug screening and toxicity tests, Organ-On-Chip (OOC) systems have been developed. OOCs mainly include a biocompatible membrane or a substrate on which cells or tissue slices are cultured. To perform drug screening tests, the OOC devices need to have a microchannel for drug delivery.<br/>As an example of this class of devices, Brain-On-Chip is presented in this thesis which is developed by TU Delft in collaboration with Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC). The chip houses a brain slice and electrical activity of the brain tissue is studied before and after cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction. The device consists of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane embedding a microchannel. The PDMS membrane houses the brain tissue and the microchannel delivers chemical needed for CSD induction to a specific region of the tissue.<br/>The main goal of this project is fabrication of the microchannel. To do so, an ultra-thick photoresist (PR) has been characterized which is used for the microchannel fabrication. Unlike most of current OOC fabrications, the Brian-on-chip device presented in this study is fabricated by a clean-room compatible procedure. This may result in a mass-production fabrication and a rapid commercialization. This study aims to validate the Brain-On-Chip by mice brain tissue provided by LUMC.

Since the late 80's, Allseas has been working on the design and construction of the Pioneering Spirit, a heavy lift vessel designed for the single-lift installation and removal of offshore topsides. From 2019, it is scheduled to be able to single-lift install or remove jackets with the jacket lift system.<br/><br/>The jacket lift system is located at the aft of the vessel and consists of two 170 meter tilting lift beams, hinged around the stern. During a jacket removal, the jacket is cut-off at the bottom, hoisted from the tip of the beams, partially rotated, and then tilted inboard. In between the hoisting and tilting is the transition phase. At the interface between jacket and the tilting lift beams, jacket support structures are located. In this thesis, the behaviour of the free-hanging of the jacket and the loads on these support structures due to the mating with the jacket are researched. <br/><br/>Jacket removal operations will take place in open sea and are thus subjected to environmental actions. The jacket, suspended from the tip of the beams, is excited due to fluid acceleration and velocity causing inertia forces and predominantly drag forces on the slender members of the jacket, as well as the excitation of the vessel through the suspension point. These motions are calculated with two different approaches. A direct-time domain model is developed of the jacket as submerged pendulum. To accelerate model simulations, the jacket is modelled as one single cylinder with different equivalent diameters to account for the total of drag and inertia. The second model is a full geometrical time-domain model simulation in AQWA.<br/><br/>In the design sea state, simulations showed that the most probable maximum momentum of the jacket due to environmental excitation is 4.5 106 kg m/s, and the motions of the centre of gravity of the jacket are all within a range of 1 meter, for the single and double pendulum and the full model. The influence of the environmental actions on motions of the structure is concluded to be small. This suggest that the jacket mating loads are governed by the tilting velocity of the tilting lift beams and the motion of its tip. The jacket mating simulations are done in the full AQWA model approach.<br/><br/>Fenders are modelled to absorb energy during the jacket mating. A sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters that have most influence on the mating phase characteristics are the tilting velocity and the stiffness of the fender. From still water conditions it seems that by increasing or decreasing the tilting velocity, this can affect the number of re-bounces and the maximum deflection. With increasing sea state, the duration and intensity of the mating phase increases. The fender deflection will increase for increasing significant wave height. The wave period does not have a significant influence on the maximum fender force. The amount of re-bounces reduces significantly for higher damping coefficients, while its influence on maximum deflection decreases. <br/><br/>The maximum force on the jacket support structures caused by the static gravitational force by the jacket once it is fully tilted is approximately 10 times higher than the maximum occurring force exerted on one of the fenders. Therefore, this static gravitational force is critical for the design of the jacket support structure, not the force caused by the mating.<br","Pioneering Spirit; mating loads; pendulum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-04","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

ABN AMRO also decided to implement a large scale agile framework tailored to their company. Agile methodologies are known to work well at small scale and in an IT context, however at ABN AMRO they’ve implemented it for over 6000 employees from both business and IT departments. Unsurprisingly ABN AMRO faces challenges within this agile organisation. One area in which they’re struggling is managing innovation in a way that aligns with the flow of the tailored and scaled agile organisation. The objective was therefore; To design solution that better aligns innovation processes with the flow of the tailored and scale agile landscape. In addition, literature on large scale tailored agile transformation and innovation management within financial services firms is scarce. Both areas are relevant, however no research was found that combined these topics. Therefor in this thesis we attempt to find challenges for innovation management in a large scale tailored agile framework. In order to both find an answer to this question and help ABN AMRO the challenge was approached from two different streams. Firstly, a revelatory single-case study on ABN AMRO’s tailored agile framework served to understand how they tailored agile at such a large scale and what the challenges were. Secondly, through semi structured interviews with 18 ABN AMRO employees, their innovation management efforts were investigated as well as the challenges they experience with it. Both the challenges from a large scale agile perspective and the company-wide innovation management were merged into a set of six new challenges; “governance on innovation in the agile organisation”, “deficiency of exploration skills”, “getting innovation on the backlog”, “Lack of clear guidance &amp; leadership on innovation”, “Dependencies &amp; Limited Autonomy”, and “Organisational and Cultural legacy”. Based on these challenges a new design challenge was posited which was to design a solution that stimulates ownership and awareness amongst idea owners in the grid landscape towards customer problems and needs. This solution needed to provide clear guidance to enable autonomous and successful realisation of these customer centric innovations in the product and system oriented agile organisation. As a solution to the design challenge and in order to help ABN AMRO with their innovation management efforts, the “User Needs Integration Canvas” was created which is an innovation process that focuses on bridging the gap between customer needs and the complex nature of ABN AMRO’s agile organisation. This study further finds that agile methods don’t cover the innovation process in full, and thus extra efforts and support should go towards managing incremental innovation, the front-end of innovation specifically. In addition traditional financial service providers carry cultural legacy, lack innovation legacy and explorative competences. The role of the individual, with their skills, mindset and behaviour are imperative in in the journey towards a nimbler and more innovative financial service provider. There is no shortcut in becoming an innovative company, whilst a large scale agile framework is a step in the right direction, still a lot of time, effort and patience is needed beyond this ste","Agile; innovation management; Financial services; Large Scale Agile; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This also counts for ING, the largest financial institution in the Netherlands. ING’s purpose is to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. This purpose is maintained throughout the bank by making innovation part of their main strategy: going beyond banking, disrupt core banking and moving towards being a platform where banking is one of the essentials. There are although some hurdles to overcome. ING can roughly be divided in the Retail and Wholesale Bank. Within ING, the Chief Innovation Office is responsible for the innovation strategy as a whole and the initiatives with a Horizon 3 and Retail background. Next to CInO, there is the Wholesale Bank Innovation Office, who is reponsible for the innovation strategy within the Wholesale Bank as well as the Horizon 1 and 2 initiatives with a Retail background. This project is conducted from the WBIO. Innovation within ING is mostly about creating new ventures. These could be home-grown initiatives or external FinTechs where the ING Innovation Fund has invested in. Venture building is relatively new to ING, the goal of the WBIO is to have launched 50 ventures in 2020. There is only one problem: there is no continuously filled innovation funnel. The innovation funnel represents the initiatives divided over several stages according to ING’s innovation methodology PACE. In order to keep the innovation funnel constantly filled, a natural inflow of ideas is necessary. Therefore the ING problem statement is defined as follows: Find a solution to generate a continuous input of ideas from employees within ING to keep the Innovation Funnel constantly filled. In the disovery phase, a deepdive is made into the topic of this thesis: ideation. First a company analysis is performed where innovation within ING is being researched. The innovative entities ING has built can be divided in 4 different categories: the PACE methodology, CInO and WBIO, Intrapreneurship and the Agile transition ING has started in 2015. After the company analysis is performed, the qualitative research started. After a qualitative research is done by interviewing several stakehoders within ING according to ideation and innovation. Also observations are done in three different kinds of ideation sessions. The qualitative research phase brought several insights behind the problem of a discontinuously filled innovation funnel. These insights were integrated further on in the design statement from where the development phase started. Innovation and ideation is although communicated top-down still not embedded enough in organisational culture. Innovation projects are for instance not recognized enough by some departments, employees feel a bit anxious and sceptical towards the big changes the bank is going through and although employees would like to be a part of innovation within ING, they are often not sure how to. Observations of ideation sessions however showed how much participants like to do something else than their daily job and how surprised they are with their creativity when stimulated the right way. The Design Statement is therefore formulated as follows: I’m going to design a solution for ING employees that will enhance their creative capabilities and that will provide the inspiration to change their mindset that is necessary to perform ideation, so that the innovation funnel will be continuously filled. From the Design Statement, the ideation phase of this design project started. Four different ideation sessions were conducted with ING teams, SPD students and individually. The common outcome of these ideation sessions is that innovation should be made tangible to the ING employees. Innovation and ideation should be brought into their own ciricle of influence. The second important outcome was that innovation should come from intrinsic motivation and passion. When being passionate about a project, employees are willing to take the next step and come up with creative solutions. From these insights, 2 concepts were created: Meet &amp; Match and Inner Circle of Innovation. Validation with end users was done to define that the Meet &amp; Match concept was chosen as most favourite. One design iteration was done to create the final concept: Pulse. Pulse is the new ideation platform by ING. The goal of Pulse is to make every ING employee part of innovation in an approachable way in order by inspiring them through creative facilitators, generated ideas and fellow passionate colleagues. The main elements of Pulse are existing from an application and a meetup, where the to be hired Ideation Lead will facilitate ideation meetups. The topics for these ideation meetups are initiated by Pulse members, the ING employees. These topics could be anything: from a deeply rooted internal problem to an uncovered client need. The Ideation Lead will make sure that ING’s strategy and value spaces are maintained and select the right topics for the sessions. Ideas generated in the meetups will be uploaded back on the app where other Pulse members can react and apply for the follow-up session. In the end Pulse will make sure that innovation is approachable to all ING’s employees. It doesn’t matter whether you are an innovation driver or a complience manager; the common sharer is the passion or interest for a certain topic. Further research should be done in orther to expand Pulse into a complete intrapreneurship platform. The follow-up session after the ideas are generated is an aspect that should be looked into furthermore to create one platform for ideas and the people within ING that would be interesting to develop this idea into a valuable venture for ING. Innovation within ING is something that is in constant motion, and they are definitely not the only corporate. This graduation thesis can be seen as a case study for ideation optimization and employee engagement within innovation performed at ING.","Corporate Innovation; Idea generation; Venture Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

By doing so, one can choose the most efficient way of modeling the substructures, before synthesizing the full system model. This method is known as Dynamic Substructuring (DS). One method of DS, is Frequency Based Substructuring(FBS). It couples free interface Frequency Response Functions (FRFs), which suits well with experimental measurement. With the growing complexity of structures, numerical models lack the accuracy needed, motivating the use of experimental models. Experimental modeling requires correct modeling of the interface dynamics. One of the methods to model the interface is the Virtual Point method, but obtaining correct interface dynamics remains challenging. The method suffers from errors that originate from improper bookkeeping, contaminated measurement data, design of experiment, and the choice of reduction basis. Another issue with experimental models is that it does not have the dense Degrees of Freedom (DoF) space of a numerical model. For complex substructures that have a high number of interfaces, either a large number of measurement equipment or exhausting roving measurements are required.<br/>This thesis aims to create a more robust environment for Experimental DS in two ways: - By providing new quality indicators and methods such that the experimental component models using the Virtual Point method have a more correct description of the interface. - By application of a new method (SEMM) to an industrial case. This expansion method exploits the dense DoF space of a numerical model with the dynamical properties of the measured substructure, which drastically reduces the number of sensors needed for a large measurement.<br/><br/>Almost all of the quality indicators and methods presented show promising contributions to the field of Frequency Based Substructuring. The impact optimization scheme presented in this thesis unfortunately fails due to being too sensitive to noise typical in experiment. SEMM is succesfully applied to the industrial case. The DS study also shows good similarity with validation data.","Experimental; Dynamic; Substructuring; Engineering Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-03","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

The Ampelmann system consists of a transfer deck which is mounted on a hexapod and a gangway. The hexapod is a so-called Steward platform which compensates the host vessel’s deck motions in six degrees of freedom using six hydraulic cylinders so the transfer deck stays motionless during operation and the gangway is a telescopic access bridge which provides access to the offshore structures.<br/><br/>Dynamic Positioning is being used to maintain the host vessel at a fixed position. If failure of Dynamic Positioning occurs during operation, the gangway might be pushed against the fixed offshore structure. Hence, the gangway might be subjected to exceptional load cases. The strength and the stability of the gangway are unknown under such conditions. The objective of this thesis was to perform Buckling Analysis of the gangway to understand the behavior of the structure under exceptional load cases which had not yet been studied by Ampelmann Operations.<br/><br/>The Buckling Analysis of the gangway needs to be performed using numerical modelling tools such as Finite Element Method (FEM). The gangway is a complex structure which consists of too many components. First of all, the gangway was simplified and modeled using ANSYS. Regarding the modelling of the gangway, due to lack of experience with modelling and analysis in ANSYS, first a simplified version of the gangway was created and analyzed. After completing the analysis successfully for the simple version, the actual version of the gangway was analyzed accordingly. <br/><br/>The objective of this study was to perform a structural failure analysis of the gangway due to buckling. There are two methods available in ANSYS program for buckling analysis: (푖) linear eigenvalue buckling (푖푖) nonlinear buckling. Both methods were used and the results are compared to recommend the optimal method for future analysis.<br/><br/>Based on the results, the magnitude of the buckling load is overestimated for both models using linear eigenvalue buckling analysis. Hence, it can be concluded that using this method would lead to non-conservative results. Another disadvantage of using this method is that the magnitudes of displacements are arbitrary. Hence the displacements values do not have a physical use. Moreover, the behavior of the structure after initial buckling (the so called post-buckling regime) cannot be determined using linear buckling analysis. However there are two advantages to perform linear buckling analysis. First, it is relatively inexpensive and fast analysis to get a first insight into the buckling behavior. Second, the buckled mode shapes can be used as initial geometric imperfections for nonlinear buckling analysis in order to provide more realistic results.<br/><br/>Based on this research, a combination of both methods is recommended to perform a complete buckling analysis. First, linear buckling analysis must be performed to find the critical load as the first estimate for nonlinear buckling load. The mode shapes found in linear buckling analysis could also be used as initial imperfections for nonlinear models. Next, nonlinear buckling analysis must be performed to find the limit point. After finding the limit point, nonlinear stabilization can be used to track the post-buckling regime and to find the collapse load.","Buckling Analysis; Linear Buckling; Nonlinear Buckling; FEM Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-03","","","","","",""

This water is often polluted by naturally occurring arsenic, causing the largest scale poisoning through drinking water in the world (D. v. Halem, S. Bakker, G. Amy, &amp; J. Van Dijk, 2009). In this report, a highly arsenic affected area in Bangladesh has been investigated. The main objective of this research is to obtain more insight in the three aspects of the DELTAP project: geology, water quality monitoring and safe water supply. It is aimed to analyse the relation between arsenic contamination and the local geology, to monitor the drinking water quality using mobile applications and to design and construct a water treatment unit. An important aspect of this research is to develop a monitoring and maintenance protocol in order to ensure safe water supply in the future. In the study area, 150 households have been selected and the water quality has been tested. The water quality has been assessed by measuring four chemical parameters and five physical parameters, using simple strip tests and mobile water quality applications. The results of the strip tests have been compared to the results of ICP-MS analysis in order to check the performance of the tests and the mobile apps. The arsenic and iron strip tests showed good performance. However, the manganese and mmonium strip tests did not perform well. Furthermore, no relations between the presence of arsenic and other chemicals have been found. It can be concluded that simple strip tests in combination with mobile applications are a promising tool for water quality monitoring, applying the Mobile Crowd Participation strategy. Since arsenic in groundwater has a geological origin, the relation between arsenic concentration in the groundwater and geology should be understood distinctly. In order to get a better understanding of this relationship, multiple tools and theories have been investigated and tested. Firstly, a geo information system has been used to map arsenic concentrations that have been obtained from the performed water quality tests. Based on the spatial analysis of the arsenic concentrations, three drillings have been performed: one drilling in a high, medium and low arsenic contaminated area. By use of the SASMIT tool, a link between sediment colour and arsenic contamination has been observed. Furthermore, geomorphological data and satellite images have been used to identify geological features in landscape which could also be linked to arsenic levels. The sediment colour found in drillings is in good accordance with the arsenic levels found in groundwater and thus, proves to be a useful tool to predict arsenic concentrations in the fieldwork area. However, the geological features in the research area are hard to identify and link to the measured arsenic concentrations. A water treatment unit has been designed and constructed in order to provide safe water to 5 to 10 households. Based on the iron and arsenic concentrations from the ICP-MS results and on practical considerations, a suitable location for the water treatment unit has been selected. The ratio of these parameters is important to remove arsenic from the groundwater efficiently. The water treatment unit is based on oxidation of arsenic along with iron and subsequent filtration with a rapid sand filter. Both chemical and biotic oxidation of arsenic and iron are ensured by setting up a biofilm carrier column before the rapid sand and anthracite filter unit. Finally, a parallel resin column has been installed to remove the residual arsenic. The water quality throughout the system varied substantially during the timeline of the project. The produced safe water at the end of the fieldwork did not meet the drinking water standards set by the WHO. Nevertheless, several recommendations have been provided and, in the future, more intensive backwash of the water treatment unit might be the key to produce and distribute safe water. Overall, a deeper knowledge on arsenic contamination and their effects have been achieved, and the improvement of the Bangladeshis live quality has been attempted.","Arsenic; Multidisciplinary project; Bangladesh; Deltap; biocarrier","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP262","24.4, 88.7"

The effect that truck platooning will have on the other traffic receives less attention. In this thesis a methodology is proposed to model truck platoons, including a platoon level controller for lane changing. The model is used to estimate the on-ramp length that vehicles require in order to safely merge into the highway while interacting with platoons and the model is used to estimate the on-ramp length that truck platoons require in order to merge onto the highway if they would do so in platoon formation. Results show that onramps need to be at least 300 meters for other traffic to safely into the highway. For platoons to safely merge into the highway the required distance is heavily dependent on the crowdedness of the highway, ranging between 400-1000 meters of required on-ramp length.","Truck platoon; micro-simulation; on-ramp; road usage; lane change model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""
