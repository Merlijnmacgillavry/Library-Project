Nissan has already successfully predicted the intent to make lane changes in a driving simulator with just six electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes on the movement related cortical potential using Machine Learning. This thesis assesses if the prediction can be improved with EEG layouts containing more electrodes. A large data set was recorded with a similar lane change paradigm in a driving simulator as Nissan’s original study. Seven predefined EEG layouts were assessed: including 4, 9, 18, 25, 32, 48 and 64 electrodes. The linear discriminant analysis classifier was used offline to classify two classes: driving straight or steering. Secondly, to assess if a different selection of electrodes could have performed better, partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to select electrodes based on importance. Lastly, it was also assessed if the classifier could predict the direction of lane change as well as intention, in other words, if the data set consisted of three classes: steering left, steering right and driving straight. There was a statistical difference between the performance of the seven layouts with two classes, but from Layout 3 (with 18 electrodes) and up this difference was no longer significant. The selection of electrodes based on PLS did not prove to be better than the predefined layouts. When the data is divided into three classes, for the prediction of direction, similar results were seen: there was a statistical difference between the layouts and Layout 3 proved to be sufficient. Performance improves with more electrodes, but this effect plateaus. Layout 3 contained a satisfactory amount of electrodes, namely 18, to predict lane change intent. Moreover, the direction of the intended lane change can also be predicted sufficiently with this layout.","machine learning; EEG; driver's intent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-03-31","","","","","",""

The open-source project enjoys active interest and participation from both academia and industry in applications spanning from autonomous vehicles to industrial robotics. ROS 2's success is underpinned by its disposition for collaborative development as well as its rich third-party package system. This has enabled developers to rapidly design, apply, and share their work while abstracting away the tedium of reimplementing common software constructs. Since the incarnation of ROS 1, ROS has shifted its focus away from medium-power workstations towards embedded systems. These efforts have born out ROS 2, a revision of the original ROS concept with a goal of supporting real-time applications.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ROS 2 suffers from several major drawbacks that diminish its feasibility for applications with real-time requirements. Its idomatic C++ library contains an executor with a noncomformant callback scheduling model, which is neither priority aware or capable of preemptive callback execution. This makes ROS 2 considerably less time-predictable, as high-priority callbacks may suffer from priority inversions, and common real-time scheduling policies cannot be applied. Furthermore, ROS 2 is built upon a distributed messaging system, with system functions split across callbacks linked through a publish-subscribe communication mechanism. This frustrates the development of solutions for ROS, as it still requires developers cope with distributed chains of execution that must contend with precedence relations, synchronisation devices, and message passing overhead.<br/><br/>In response to these deficiencies, this thesis presents five major contributions: (1) two new executor implementations, with support for both callback prioritisation and preemptive callback execution. (2) a new priority-synthesis algorithm, which uses a graph model to map a set of callback-chain priorities to callbacks within ROS applications. (3) A simple feasibility test for ROS 2 applications based on callback chains. (4) A schedulability test for ROS 2 applications with harmonic chains. (5) A novel testing framework, which integrates the priority-synthesis algorithm, and enables the easy and rapid generation of test applications for development purposes. <br/><br/>The evaluation reveals that the new executors deliver superior performance in metrics such as worst-case response time, deadline misses, and jitter. On applications with up to 60% utilisation under rate-monotonic scheduling, the new executor implementations deliver no deadline misses, as opposed to the standard executor encountering them at just 10%. Finally, on high priority chains, the new executors can deliver up to 1300% times less jitter over the standard.","ROS 2; callback chains; schedulability; response-time analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering | Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); van Geloven, N. (mentor); le Cessie, S. (mentor); Jongbloed, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis examines statistical methods to find the right timing of intrauterine insemination treatment relative to the start of the follow-up of the couples. Intrauterine insemination is a fertility treatment conducted by injecting refined sperm into a woman's uterus. Lots of research has been done on timing of steps within one IUI cycle. However, not a lot of research has been done on investigating if couples should be advised to start with the IUI immediately after consulting a fertility clinic, or wait a few more months to see if the pregnancy occurs naturally during this time. To analyze this problem, treatment strategies are defined in the following way: a couple stays on expectant management until some predetermined time when the first IUI cycle is started, unless they become pregnant before that time. Strategies analyzed involve starting the treatment at 0, 3, 6 or 9 months, or not at all until the end of the analysis, which is 1.5 years after diagnosis. Pregnancy probability for each couple is estimated with a multi-state Cox proportional hazards model. Then, the model is connected to the causal inference setting in order to compute the counterfactual pregnancy probability of each couple in the population. This thesis explores how multi-state models can be used to answer causal questions. To do this, a 3-state multi-state model is carefully connected to the causal inference theory and the assumptions this framework relies on are listed and commented upon. Treatment strategies are implemented through making an intervention on the IUI starting time. Then, a causal inference method, G-computation, is used to estimate the expected pregnancy probability of all couples in the population, given that everyone follows the same treatment strategy. Then, individual pregnancy probabilities are averaged in order to obtain the expected pregnancy rates in the population for each strategy. Methodology combining multi-state models and causal inference is new and only one similar study has been found so far in the literature. Multi-state models are currently used mostly for predictive analyses and it is of great interest to use them to answer causal questions as well. The results of this study show that there is no significant effect of the time the IUI has been started on the pregnancy rate in the population after 1.5 years, but there is significant difference between being and not being treated.","IUI; Multi-state models; Survival analysis; Causal Inference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And 59% of participants were dealing with a (very) poor ability to separate work and private life. As such, there was a significant need of students to help them through the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout this thesis, tips and inspiration for home-work environment modifications were gathered and form the main content of this thesis. This content was distributed and evaluated with an iterative approach. With a focus on improving work-related wellbeing by creating the perception of a second room to work from at home. The content can be divided into; physical barrier, visual division, and ergonomic setup. And tackle the different aspects of a second room; creating separation within the room, creating a different vibe to a part of the room, and the setup within the room.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Design decisions which are made in the preliminary ship design phase have a significant influence on the performance and total cost of a ship. These design decisions are mostly made with very little knowledge of the ship design problem. In fact, it is the personal experience of the naval architect which plays a significant role in this phase of the design process. In the world of rapidly increasing possibilities with artificial intelligence it is hard to imagine that these decisive design choices are based on a naval architect’s personal experience. Especially when one takes into account the large capital and operational costs of ships. The development of C-Job’s Maritime Intelligence Tool (MIT) in 2019 has shown that reference data can better be exploited in this phase of the ship design process. As a result, theoretical reductions of the resistance and weight of the vessel go up to 19% and 10% respectively, using this tool. When the availability of reference data is limited, the trustworthiness of this tool cannot be guaranteed. This is especially unfavorable at the boundaries of a design space, as it is expected that novel and innovative ship design can be found here. Thus, in order to support naval architects in all regions of a design space, a solution must be found. First, research is done into design approaches in the preliminary ship design phase. In this research, naval architects of C-Job with different backgrounds were interviewed. During these interviews it became clear that time, budget and customer ambitions are important motives in this phase. As a result, a lot of ship design decisions in the preliminary ship design phase are based on the naval architect’s personal experience. The more the design is developed, the more insight is gained into the complexity of that ship design. As a result,more design decisions could be based on this gained insight, instead of the personal experience. During these interviews, challenges were identified and discussed that the naval architects face, before the Maritime Intelligence tool can be used in practice. Based on these challenges a list of tool requirements was determined and potential solutions were sought. Three solutions were found to be promising for this thesis. These were serial hybrid modelling, parallel hybrid modelling and constrained black box identification. The parallel hybrid model is chosen, primarily because of the independent operations of the data-driven sub-model (Black Box model) and the knowledge-driven sub-model (White Box model) in a parallel hybrid model. There are two requirements for parallel hybrid modelling. The first requirement is a method to estimate a ship design parameter. The second requirement is the availability of the true values of the same design parameter of reference vessels. These were both only available for the design parameter lightship weight. In the proposed parallel hybrid model, the white box model is used to estimate the lightship weight. Thereafter the black box model is trained to predict the difference between this estimation and the actual lightship weight, based on reference data. The proposed parallel hybrid model is subjected to multiple experiments to assess the performance. The R2-score and 10-fold cross validation are used to determine the performance. First the performance of the white box, black box and parallel hybrid model is discussed. Thereafter, the relation between the availability of reference data and the predicting capability is researched. The final experiment was to research the performance of the three different models in interpolation and extrapolation gaps. Based on these experiments it was concluded that for a training data set of 50 reference vessels or smaller, the parallel hybrid model was the best model. For larger training data sets, the black box and parallel hybrid model performed similarly. For interpolation and extrapolation problems the white box model should be chosen. Additionally, a method is presented to update the used white box model. As a result, it is expected that high performance scores can also be obtained without the use of artificial intelligence tools.","Preliminary Design; Ship Design; Parallel Hybrid modelling; Grey box modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(graduation committee); Lohmiller, Jochen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the future, Human Driven Vehicles (HDV's) are expected to interact with Automated Vehicles (AV’s) and Connected AV’s (CAV’s). Due to the differences in the expected driving behavior of AV’s (ACC) and CAV’s (CACC) compared to HDV’s, the nature of traffic breakdown phenomena in the future can be expected to change. AV’s (ACC) and CAV’s (CACC) refer to AV’s enabled with Adaptive Cruise Control functionality and CAV’s enabled with Co-operative ACC functionality respectively. Currently, there are traffic management measures which address traffic breakdown for the current situation. With the expected changes in breakdown phenomena in the future, will the current measures be effective in addressing the different nature of breakdown in the future? This research answered this question through simulation (Vissim), by focusing into the effectiveness of one of the current measures. The current measure whose effectiveness was analyzed is Variable Speed limits (VSL) applied through the concept of feedback Mainstream Traffic Flow Control, MTFC-VSL, at on-ramp merge sections. Before conducting simulations, it was hypothesized that MTFC-VSL control effectiveness in addressing traffic breakdown increases as CAV’s (with ACC and CACC functionality) penetration rate increases in mixed traffic, because CAV’s can be expected to precisely follow the speed limits. Mixed traffic in this research comprised of HDV’s and CAV’s (with ACC and CACC functionality). CAV’s (with ACC and CACC functionality) implies that CAV’s majorly differ with that of HDV’s in car following behavior and not in lane change behavior. Simulation results and analysis revealed that the hypothesis doesn’t hold good. Improvements in average Travel Time (TT) of mainline vehicles and average network speed due to the presence of MTFC-VSL control compared to the absence of it, deteriorated as penetration rate of CAV’s (with ACC and CACC functionality) increased until 20% in mixed traffic. For further penetration rates the improvements fluctuates. On-ramp vehicles for most of the scenarios of mixed traffic, are better off without MTFC-VSL control as the presence of it increases the vehicles average TT. MTFC-VSL control doesn’t effectively address the capacity drop phenomenon for various scenarios of mixed traffic. Lastly, it was found that for less than 20% CAV’s (with ACC and CACC functionality) penetration rate in mixed traffic, MTFC-VSL control effectiveness can be expected to overall increase if Intelligent Speed Adaptation is installed as an On-Board Unit in HDV’s, as it limits HDV’s exceeding the speed limits.It must be noted that, MTFC-VSL control was set up considering the practical considerations of implementing in real life, which can also be expected to play a significant role in hypothesis not being valid. Given the ineffectiveness of MTFC-VSL control for various scenarios of mixed traffic, the future traffic management measures should focus on the causes of breakdown phenomena which aren’t addressed by MTFC-VSL control. One of the proposed measures is a combination of a merging assistant strategy &amp; MTFC-VSL control to better address traffic breakdown than MTFC-VSL alone. Merging assistant strategy utilizes the connectivity feature of CAV’s to foster smoother merging of on-ramp vehicles which isn’t addressed by MTFC-VSL control.","Traffic Breakdown; Mixed traffic; Merge sections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

While navigating through these areas, vessels get assisted by the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS). VTS operators (VTSO) are monitoring the vessels in ports and provide the navigating skippers with the required information to ensure the safety and efficiency of the vessel traffic in the port. Information is communicated using very high frequency (VHF) radios on the corresponding VHF-channels of the sectors. In busy sectors in the port, these VHF-channels are very crowded, which results in unclear situations and high workloads for the VTSOs. The Rotterdam Port Authority is currently investigating measures to reduce VHF-traffic. To define effective measures, it is required to understand by which factors the VHF-communications are triggered. In this thesis, a quantitative method has been developed to investigate whether VHF-communications are caused by certain properties of a fairway system. The method is based on analysing VHF-traffic and identify factors that lead to an increase in these communications. The main component is digitizing the VHF-communications, which is achieved by converting spoken VHF-audio bands to text, then dividing this text into different conversations and finally classifying each phrase according to place, time and content. Subsequently, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the VHF-communications are linked to spatial and temporal characteristics of a property of the fairway system, to analyse whether the occurrence of a particular form of VHF-communication is related to the occurrence of that particular property of the waterway system. The method can be applied to investigate the individual influence of several fairway properties, but in this research the focus is on analysing to what extent the fairway property “blocked view” leads to the development of VHF-communications. To investigate whether VHF-communications are related to the occurrence of visual obstructions, a method is developed to estimate the visibility for varying locations and vessel parameters.","VHF; Visibility analysis; Vessel Traffic Management; Viewshed; Digitalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.89415477989864,4.313606411368083"

Most prevalent joints are the knee, hip and hands, including the wrist. In order to enable early treatment of wrist OA, an early-detection method of cartilage loss, a characteristic symptom of OA, is needed. , CT images of the wrist bones. cannot visualize the cartilage itself, but instead use the distance between adjacent bones, to estimate the cartilage thickness. To enable such estimations, bones need to be segmented, which is a laborious task, that would impede any early diagnosis implementation. So automated segmentation of the wrist bones is desired for cost effective and objective assessments. However fully automatic segmentation of CT images is still a technical challenge. Deep learning techniques are considered a potentially successful approach to automate image processing.<br/>The aim of this study is therefore to design and validate an automatic segmentation method of the capitate from CT-images based on a deep learning approach. For the automated segmentation method of CT images we selected UNet, a type of Convolutional Neural Network. A total of 10 CT images of the capitate, were divided into 3 groups to train (6), validate (2) and test (2) the network, while their corresponding segmented images were used as ground truth. Training and validation set were used during training to build the model, while test set was used after training to evaluate the performance of the model. <br/>Quantitative evaluation of similarity between automatic segmentation by the network and the ground truth was expressed by the Dice coefficient (test data 1: 0.94, test data 2: 0.91) and the Hausdorff distance (test data1: 2.06mm, test data2: 2.55mm). Automatic segmentation took 6.7s for test data 1 and 8.1s for test data 2. The proposed approach holds promise for applications in fully automatic segmentation of wrist bones, as its performance, characterized by Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, is in par with those from other techniques of the same application. The next step in successful clinical implementation of the method is to improve the accuracy, for instance, by using a larger data size, after which the model can be further applied as an automatic quantitative metric in diagnosis of wrist OA.","deep learning; Wrist joint; CT images","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Smit, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background: Osseointegration is a relatively new alternative for a socket to attach an artificial limb to the stump of an amputee. In a surgical procedure, a metal implant is permanently anchored and integrated into the bone of the stump. Amputees with an osseointegrated prosthesis have indicated that they experience better physical control over their prosthetic leg, compared to using their previous socket prosthesis. Especially the control over enough ground clearance during the swing phase during gait results in less tripping experiences. However, there is no objective evidence to demonstrate that osseointegration yields less tripping, and eventually less (near-) falls. A wearable system that would automatically detect trips or stumbles of the amputees during daily life would therefore be welcome. It would enable a sound scientific evaluation of the claimed benefits of an osseointegrated prosthesis over a socket prosthesis. Moreover, information about the quantity and type of stumbles would aid in the development of individual rehabilitation training programs to improve balance during gait and prevent falls. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop and validate the stumblemeter, consisting of a wearable sensor and its signal processing, to detect and classify stumbling events in a dataset comprising of a wide variety of daily movements, that is feasible to use in clinical practice. Methods: Ten test subjects wore a single inertial measurement unit, measuring accelerations and angular velocities in three dimensions, at a frequency of 100 Hz, stored onboard. The matchbox sized sensor was sticked to the shank, close to the tibia, 20 cm below the knee. A special stumbling device was built to evoke real-world unexpected stumbles while walking on a treadmill. Subjects also performed multiple Activities of Daily Living, movements that are common in daily life. For data processing, first an event-defined window segmentation technique was used to trace high peaks in acceleration which could potentially be stumbles. In this reduced dataset, all windows were labelled with the aid of video annotation. Subsequently, discriminative features were extracted and fed to train multiple supervised machine learning algorithms. Trained machine learning algorithms were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results: The subjects stumbled a total of 276 times, both using an elevating recovery strategy and a lowering recovery strategy. For the final model, two Support Vector Machine models with optimized hyperparameters are used in series. The first model is used to detect stumbles in the reduced dataset containing just potential stumbles. In our dataset, stumbles were detected with 98.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The second model is used to classify the recovery type of the detected stumbles and does so with 95.3% accuracy. Moreover, the algorithms were implemented in an app that can be used clinically. Conclusions: We have created a stumblemeter consisting of just one sensor and an algorithm that was validated to detect and classify stumbles in a dataset comprising a wide variety of movements. It is expected that the stumblemeter will work as desired in the amputee population as amputees use similar stumble recovery strategies. To check this expectation, a follow up study should validate the stumblemeter in prosthesis users. The use of a small unintrusive sensor, that can log up to one week, together with the user friendly app, makes the stumblemeter ready for use in a clinical trial and potentially for clinical care.","stumble detection; tripping; osseointegrating; machine learning; amputee; IMU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","Resilience has been gaining importance as a key element that prepares the supply chains to respond after disruptions. In this thesis, the material supply chain resilience framework is used to study the supply chain of tin before and during the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tin is a small-scale market compared to other major metals but its importance is increasing thanks to its possible applications in the next-generation lithium-ion batteries, fundamental for the energy transition. Besides, Tin is one of the main elements used in the semiconductor industry which is at the centre of the trade war between the US and China. In order to increase its potential and be used in “next-gen” batteries, tin supply chains must show resilience. Using qualitative and quantitative data and modelling, this paper aimed to explore the resilience of the supply chain of tin. The research showed that Tin demonstrated considerable resilience during the COVID-19 disruptions ,thanks to the semiconductors and Chinese demand, both of which increased during the second quarter of 2020. Currently, almost half of tin production goes to solders, which explains the high dependency between the tin market and the semiconductor market. China is the biggest producer and consumer of tin, which makes the demand for tin dependent on Chinese demand. The analysis of the resilience mechanisms showed stockpiling and diversity of supply are integrated into the supply chain but their contribution to resilience remain low. Substitution could not be considered a resilience mechanism due to the lack of substitutes for tin solders. The resilience mechanisms would gain importance in the future of tin if it would be used in new technologies. The model presented in this thesis estimates the amount of tin that will be used by 2030. With this in mind, recycling of tin must be increased to support the future demand. Consequently, Governments and companies must invest in technologies in order to increase the recycling of E-waste. Lastly, the development of the relations between the US and China will also interest the tin supply chain.

The DRL algorithm is trained and evaluated in a simulation environment by mounting a camera on a robotic arm. The use of different reward scheme and exploration strategy during DRL training shows their effect on training performance. The DRL training performance is assessed by illustrating the maximum visible tomato-target fraction per episode, the steps needed per episode, the trajectory of the robot's end-effector, and the initial and final tomato-target viewpoint in each episode.

(mentor); de Kater, E.P. (graduation committee); Breedveld, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background: The goal of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is to perform surgery by minimal damaging the body. Compared to traditional open surgery MIS results in faster recovery and lower mortality, and is therefore the preferred method for performing a biopsy. Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is a type of MIS where an instrument enters the body through a natural orifice to reach the target. During NOTES an instrument enters the body through a natural orifice to reach the target. Upon entering the body via a natural orifice, first the target area needs to be reached and second, the targeted tissue needs to be transported out of the body for further examination. Currently used instruments for NOTES are suboptimal for transport through tubular organs due to damaging the tissue. In this study, a friction-based transport mechanism, inspired by eggs of parasitic wasps, was developed as an improved tool for NOTES. Additionally, the possibility to steer this instrument was examined as well. Methods: State of the art mechanisms were analysed and selected based on their potential for being used as a flexible system for locomotion through a tubular organ and tissue transport. Requirements of this instrument were determined which were divided into requirements for the flexible shaft and for the actuation of the locomotion and transport mechanism. Requirements were also determined for the additional wish for the instrument to be steerable. Based on these requirements a final design of a flexible shaft and actuation was developed. The design process for steerability of the flexible shaft is described as well, resulting in a tip that can be added to the flexible shaft to add steerability. Performance of the flexible shaft was evaluated based on locomotion through a tube, tissue transport and steerability in a simulated setting. The flexible shaft was tested if it is possible to locomote through a tube, transport tissue and can be steered. Results: The developed instrument was able to locomote in a straight direction and three different configurations: with a bending radius of 80 mm, 105 mm and 130mm and a bending angle of 45°, 30° and 15°, respectively. The locomotion rate in the straight direction was 6.17±0.27 mm/cycle and was 5.21±0.21 mm/cycle in the maximum bent direction (bending radius of 80 mm). The instrument was adequate for the intended use: (1) insertion into a tube, (2) locomote through the tube, and (3) transport tissue out of the tube using the flexible shaft. Adding the tip and attached steering wire ropes with manual operation allowed the shaft to be steered up to an angle of 90° with a bending radius of 58 mm. Discussion and conclusion: A flexible shaft instrument was developed that was able to locomote and transport tissue through a tube. Additionally, a steering tip was designed that allowed to steer the instrument from outside the body/tube. While lower locomotion rates were observed for lower bending radii, the developed design shows great potential for an instrument to perform NOTES with minimal burden for the patient.","Flexible; Friction-based; Locomotion; Transport; Bio-inspired; Minimally invasive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Recent technological advancements have led to the development of the""Organ-On-Chip""(OOC) technology. OOCs are miniaturized micro-engineered devices which aim to accurately recapitulate the physiological conditions of different organs. In order to develop a Heart-On-Chip (HOC) device as an in-vitro screening platform for cardiotoxicity, it is essential to integrate micro-electrodes (MEAs) in a flexible polymeric substrate that can be manufactured with standard micro-fabrication techniques. Besides electrical stimulation and recording, the device should be capable of accommodating the different cellular structures of the human heart along with its vasculature, which is in continual exposure to perfusion with fluid. In this manner, a platform that is cleanroom-compatible, scalable and physiologically representative of the human heart can be developed.The OOC device of Bi/ond provides an ideal platform in which MEAs can be successfully integrated. The device also offers microfluidic channels that supply the cardiac co-culture with the necessary perfusion to mimic the blood flow through the heart. In order to integrate TiN MEAs in the Bi/ond platform,several technological challenges need to be tackled. In previous work, polymers were often utilized as the insulation layer for the metal interconnects. Processing of polymers in a silicon-based cleanroom environment requires additional dedicated equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the feasibility of alternative dielectric, cleanroom-compatible materials, such as silicon nitride. Secondly, the metal lines experience considerable amounts of stress at the interface of the flexible membrane and the rigid silicon frame during the fabrication and post-fabrication process. By customizing the mechanical design of the PDMS membrane as well as the metal interconnects, the stress developed at the interface can be reduced, which can ultimately improve the yield of the devices due to the formation of fewer cracks in the metal lines.In this thesis, three goals were defined and achieved in order to develop a proof-of-concept for a HOC device with silicon nitride encapsulated TiN MEA in a thick PDMS layer, which can be further integrated in a microfluidic device. First, a study of the compatibility and characterization of SiNx insulation layers with PDMS membranes was performed. The adhesion between the nitride and PDMS membrane was improved by sandwiching a thin silicon oxide layer in-between the nitride and the PDMS. Additionally, the optimum deposition techniques for the nitride layers were demonstrated. Secondly, the yield of the devices was improved by optimizing the designs of the interconnects and the shape of the PDMS membranes. A novel turtle shaped design for the membrane was developed which helped to redistribute the stress at the interface. This novel design resulted in a yield higher than 75%.Thirdly, a silicon-based cleanroom compatible fabrication protocol was optimized and defined for processing a HOC device with a TiN MEA encapsulated by SiNx in a 200μm thick PDMS membrane.Moreover, based on the techniques developed by Bi/ond, this device module was successfully integrated in a microfluidic device. Finally, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to confirm the functionality of the electrodes. The average impedance value at 1 kHz of three working electrodes was measured to be in the order of 800 kΩ, proving that an electrical connection was successfully established between the embedded TiN electrodes and the bondpads on the silicon frame.","Heart-On-Chip; Microelectrode arrays; TiN; Silicon nitride insulation; Microfluidic Valve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

An experimental approach is chosen, whereby specimens with 1, 9 and 81 parallel struts are tested. A decreased fatigue life is found for the specimens with more but thinner struts. This decrease is attributed to manufacturing related effects that occur upon producing smaller elements. The failure of the multiple load path structures showed a step-wise pattern. Due to this, the decreased variation in fatigue life and decreased sensitivity to initial damage, multiple load path structures are more damage tolerant. However, in design a balanced decision should be made upon applying these structures, due to the decreased fatigue life.","Additive Manufacturing; Damage Tolerance; Fatigue; Design for Additive Manufacturing; SLM; L-PBF; Gradual failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Scientist all over the world made it clear that if we stay on the current patterns and we don't reduce drastically our greenhouse gas emissions, we are gonna end up with the extinction of the human species. The urgency of the problem seems to be clear to most people, what we need now are immediate actions to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Among all different sectors, the residential sector is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and most of the energy is used for space heating (SH) and electrical appliances. In the specific case of the Netherlands, most energy provided to the residential sector is produced by means of natural gas, and the goal of the country is to replace natural gas with net-zero CO2 solutions. In this thesis work, a solar-assisted ground-source heat pump (SAGSHP) system for space heating for a typical Dutch terraced house is thoroughly investigated. In particular a 115 m2 house with 3 people living in it. The main different components of the system are investigate by looking at the state-of-the-art technology to understand what are the different system components that would be more convenient to use in the Netherlands in terms of efficiency, costs, etc. After the different system components have been selected and a general layout of the system is determined, the different components are designed and modelled using Matlab or Simulink environment. Finally, the whole system is assembled together and simulated in a Simulink environment. The simulation runs over a period of one year using a simulation time step of 6 minutes (0.1 hours). In particular two different cases have been used for the simulation. The base case used is an year where the ambient conditions used (ambient temperature and irradiance intensity) are values averaged over a period of twenty years (1991-2020). The second case is the simulation of a very cold year to see how the system performs in extreme cases. The simulated year is the year 2010. The obtained results are presented and discussed to draw conclusions and future work recommendations. The final goal of this work is to understand the competitiveness of the system with respect to a traditional gas boiler in terms of CO2 emission reduction, performance and costs. From this work it was possible to conclude that the chosen SAGSHP system performs slightly better in colder climates where a higher heat load requirement is needed. From the base case study used in this work, it was concluded that the modelled SAGSHP system can achieve a system seasonal coefficient of performance (SSCOP) of about 3.8 and it can significantly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions generated, up to about 2.8 ton of CO2 every year. From an economical point of view, the system levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is still higher than the LCOE of a traditional gas boiler system due to the high initial investment associated with SAGSHP systems.","SAGSHP; Solar-assisted ground-source heat pumps; modelling; MATLAB; Matlab Simulink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These disease are caused by micrometer to nanometer sized microorganisms like bacteria, pathogens, and viruses. They are of various types, with each having its own unique effect on the infected host. It becomes self evident that only early detection, quarantine and treatment of the infected can curtail a possible exonential growth rate of infections and the possibility of mutation of a given virus to a more virulent strain. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in december 2019 has brought about a unified global effort to characterise and curtail the virus. This effort has met with some difficulties, the inability to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 proceeds from the unavailability of simple, reliable, cheap and rapid testing methods. Lab based testing during epidemics cannot cater for the overwhelming number of test to be done. In such a Pandemic situation, an interplay of the above situational dynamics, begs the need for very sensitive and efficient point of care device that simplifies diagnoses of SARs-CoV-2 virus. The WHO stipulates that all such point of care devices should meet with following standards: (i) affordable; (ii)sensitive; (iii) specific; (iv) user-friendly; (v) rapid and robust; (vi)equipment-free;and (vii) deliverable to end-users. In this thesis, an immunoassay based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to investigate SARs-CoV-2 antibody for its characteristic Raman finger print. Characterization of SERS substrate like Nanoporous gold, gold nanoparticles deposited on topaz and sputtered on borosilicate glass showed a decent enhancement factor of about 10^3 to 10^4 , it was also observed on all SERS substrate that a 1µm height of deposited nanoparticles was sufficient for SERS enhancement. The immobilization of the Genetex SARs-CoV-2 was done using Cysteamine hydrochloride and Lomants reagent, linkage was only possible only after sufficient cleaning was effected on the SERS substrates, the Raman spectrum obtained was same for both protocols, however noise and substrate instability was observed.

The characteristic disufide band, Aliphatic and Aromatic bands, Amide I and Amide III bands were identified for both linking protocols and tentatively assigned. since adsorption of the thiol monolayers was from solution a Langmuir growth model is proposed as the means of thiol growth and orientation.","Raman; Immunoreaction; Antibody","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The delineation of the regions of interest (ROIs) plays an important role in the radiotherapy workflow. The ROIs include the gross tumor volume (GTV), the clinical target volume (CTV), the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). There are however uncertainties related to the delineation of the ROIs due to inter­observer variability between radiation oncologists caused by e.g., a lack of consensus on anatomic definition or a lack of contrast in medical images. The largest inter­observer variability has been found in esophageal cancers, head and neck cancers, and lung cancers. To pre­ vent inter­observer variability, auto­contouring software can be used to delineate the ROIs. There are however also uncertainties in the delineations made by auto­contouring software. The purpose of this study was to perform an accurate evaluation of the dosimetric effect of delineation uncertainties. To do so, first a method to characterize the delineation uncertainties had to be found. The delineations uncertainties were characterized with principal component analysis (PCA). By performing PCA on a set of delineations, the eigenmodes which represent the variations between the delineations can be found and new random delineations based on the eigenmodes can be formed. To determine the dosimetric impact of the delineation uncertainties, two cases were investigated: (1) the dosimetric impact of delineation uncertainties for a fixed dose distribution; and (2) the dosimetric impact of delin­ eation uncertainties for a dose distribution reoptimized for every possible realization of a delineation. For the fixed dose distribution, Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) was used as a meta­model for the dose volume histogram (DVH) of the target, and for the reoptimized dose distribution PCE served as a meta­model for the total dose distribution and the DVHs of the target and other ROIs. The delineation uncertainties of two data sets were analyzed: (1) 12 manual delineations of the GTV of a hepatocellular carcinoma patient; and (2) 90 auto­contours of the CTV and brainstem of a head and neck patient. The variation of the manual delineations of the GTV could be accurately described by 5 eigenmodes, while 45 eigenmodes were needed to describe the variations of the brainstem auto­ contours. The delineation uncertainties in the auto­contours of the CTV could not be characterized by PCA due to the shape of the CTV. The dosimetric effect of the delineation uncertainties of the manual delineations for a fixed dose distri­ bution was investigated for both an intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plan and a volumetric­ modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan for 10,000 random delineations of the CTV. For this patient the CTV was equal to the GTV. In the VMAT plan, the CTV received sufficient dose for all delineations, but the PTV was underdosed in 17.1% of the delineations. In the IMPT plan, the CTV was underdosed in 69.0% of the delineations. This percentage of underdosed CTV delineations in the IMPT plan was reduced when the plan was made robustly. The results for the fixed IMPT dose distribution should however be verified with a more accurate PCE model. A proof of principle for the PCE as a meta­model for the reoptimized dose distribution and DVHs of the target and other ROIs was shown. However, a more accurate PCE model with a higher polynomial order would be needed to analyze the effects of the reoptimization on the dose delivered to the ROIs. It has been shown that the dosimetric impact of delineation uncertainties can be modelled using PCE. This is a first step towards systematically and quantitatively taking into account delineation uncertainties in radiotherapy treatment planning. In future research the analysis of the dosimetric impact of the un­ certainties can e.g., be used in adaptive radiotherapy in which auto­contouring is used. By knowing the dosimetric impact of the uncertainty, treatment plans could be optimized such that a structure receives its target dose with a certain probability or critical areas where the dosimetric impact of the delineation uncertainties is large could be flagged such that these areas are checked before treatment.","Radiotherapy; Polynomial Chaos Expansion; Delineation uncertainties; Contouring uncertainties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two ASTR injection periods suffering from clogging were intensely monitored during several weeks in 2019 to 2020. The wells were rehabilitated by methods of backflushing and mechanical cleaning (high-pressure jetting) and sampled to obtain information on the kind of clogging material. The recharge water is nutrient rich (PO4: 2-18 mgL-1, NO3: 6-50 mgL-1, NH4: 0.1-0.6 mgL-1, DOC: 25-32 mgL-1) and attained significantly turbid conditions (usually between 5-20 NTU; up to 160 NTU) caused by the removal of resuspended biochemical material in the tile drainage network by extreme precipitation and extensive drain discharge events. Consequentially, the 40 µm spin Klin-disc filters as pre-treatment step experienced reduced functionality due to clogging when subjected to high turbid loads. Microbial processes within the ASTR piping system additionally caused fluctuations in turbidity by periodic on/off operation, indicating a high potential for (bio)physical and biological clogging in the injection wells. Microscopic and (hydro)geochemical analysis of injectant and backflushed suspended solids demonstrated a significant contribution of injected Fe-hydroxyapatite flocs and biochemical material incorporating siliceous clay and silt particles below 40 µm, while pyrite and possibly calcite precipitants were flushed from the aquifer matrix when removing suspended matter from the wells. The injection of suspended material caused clogging predominantly by physical mechanisms. During standstill, the hydrochemical environment in the well indicated substantial microbial activity by reduced redox conditions in the well and the mobilization of Fe(II), Mn(II), P, and Ca, indicating the vulnerability for biological clogging. Improving the feasibility of the ASTR system requires the high clogging potential of TDW to be reduced. It is recommended to adopt a settling tank, rapid sand filtration followed by slow sand filtration as pre-treatment steps to reduce the physical and biological clogging potential. Various other recommendations to reduce the clogging risks are discussed further. Regarding the well rehabilitation, methods of compressed-air ‘jutteren’ are recommended to recovery the well performance by effectively removing residual clogging material from the gravelpack and borehole wall.","MAR; Well clogging; Tile drainage water; ASTR; Agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Urban Water Engineering","AgriMAR","52.888360, 4.822103"

Repetitious training is necessary for patients to regain and maintain this ability. Compared with the conventional rehabilitation process, gamified rehabilitation has the potential to provide patients with a more engaging experience with helpful feedback. Extensive research has focused on the game design and rehabilitation technologies, however, less attention is paid to the personalization and adaptation within the game. In this thesis, we propose a generic adaptation scheme to support physiotherapists in conducting gait training. The scheme features the parameterized generation of the levels which can be steered dynamically based on the player model and therapists’ intervention. Two difficulty adjustment methods are adopted to provide patients with a personalized rehabilitation experience, which are (i) parameters- progression schemes manipulating multiple parameters in two systematic ways for creating levels with appropriate difficulty, and (ii) meaningful integration of separate rehabilitation exercises for providing variety in difficulty transition. Our goal is to assess how adaptive steering of a procedural game level generator can support a physiotherapist in achieving the desired rehabilitation goals. We implemented our design in a standalone prototype for conducting gait training in a three-dimensional overground body weight support system RYSEN. A set of mini-games was first developed through a mapping from therapy goals to the movement challenges in the gameplay. The difficulty adjustment methods were adopted in these games. Apart from the automatic game system, the prototype provides a real-time interface for therapists, which ensures their control of the rehabilitation session. Nine physiotherapists took part in the evaluation with their focus on the difficulty adjustment. The results show that our approach can assist physiotherapists in providing (i) helpful diversity for patients in everyday gait training, (ii) adequate challenge levels for a wider group of patients in various gait exercises, (iii) useful game controls to tailor the level of challenges for patients when necessary.","adaptive games; procedural content generation; gait rehabilitation; serious game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, there are high uncertainties in the future posed by unforeseen changing factors such as global climate change and urbanization which makes it a challenge for decision-makers to develop strategies for these water supply systems in the long-term planning. The concept of resilience is introduced by many studies to address those uncertainties The objective of this thesis is to provide an approach for decision-makers to develop a resilience water supply system in small towns for long-term decision planning to answer the following research question: ‘How can a water supply system in a small African town be resilient and provide sufficient water in the future?’ This thesis presents a methodology that is resilience-based and develops reduced future supply and increased future demand scenarios for the small town in a period of 30 years.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The high quality public transport network implemented by R-net, short for Randstadnet, follows a product formula on multiple public transport modalities (bus, tram, metro, and train) and acts as a quality mark. R-net is a collaboration between six public transport authorities and nine operators. However, currently R-net is confusing the traveller and losing credibility among its stakeholders. Ultimately, an aligned future vision and collaboration structure is missing. This project creates a future vision, illustrates how R-net should look like in this future and proposes a strategy for how to reach this. In 2040, commuting with the high quality public transport network is the norm. The vision is based on relevant trends and the future fulfilment of the six fundamental needs of the commuter; comfort, autonomy, security, recognition, competence and morality. It presents a seamless door-to-door travel experience integrating different modalities. Three concepts were created to explore how R-net should look like in this future vision. These were combined to the final future role of R-net: B1-net, for a journey without worries. B1-net will be the facilitator for collaboration with the stakeholders in the future high quality public transport network with the help of a mobility roundtable structure. Furthermore, it will provide certainty to the traveller by being in direct contact with them, utilise a certification structure and enable safe data sharing. The communication with the traveller happens via a mascot of a bee. The bee flies along with the traveller in their journey providing this certainty. The experience of the traveller in the vision and concept of the high quality public transport network addresses their fundamental needs and provides certainty. Therefore it will be more attractive and has the possibility to attract more travellers to the network instead of their car. This is beneficial to reach societal goals, like CO2 reduction. For the transition from R-net into B1-net, an organisation strategy is proposed with the help of the analogy of how bees make honey. First, R-net will need to ‘prepare’, collect nectar. A reconstruction will take place to a full-time commitment and the customer service for the traveller is started. This is followed by ‘starting the real process’ which represents how a bee shares its nectar. The public transport authorities are persuaded to join the network and the mobility roundtable is initiated. Hereafter, the honey is capped with beeswax which explains ‘seal the deal’. Public transport operators already connected to R-net are persuaded and the first B1-certificat is allocated. The next step is ‘nurture and expand’, like filling more cells in the honeycomb. This step is about expanding the network and keep revising the requirements for the certificate until in 2040 there is a complete ecosystem of the high quality public transport network. When the honey is ready. The strategy is implemented in a roadmap together with the traveller needs, trends and launch strategy to give a complete overview of how to reach the vision: Commuting with the high quality public transport network is the norm.","Design; Mobility; Mobility as a Service; Public transport; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-30","","","","","",""

Despite the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing protocols, and unique facilities to screen individuals, the increase of infection rates among HCW is high. This has enormous consequences as HCW cannot provide direct patient care, thereby decreasing the workforce’s availability during the pandemic and has fuelled the urgent need for a non-invasive IR system to screen for potential cases of infections. Existing remote screening systems are susceptible to shortcomings caused by location and technique used for measurement, distance-ambient temperature associated inaccuracies and inefﬁcient integration of hardware and software modules, invalidating their utility in the current situation.

Cooling these components becomes increasingly challenging as high power densities require cooling with large heat fluxes. Topology optimization (TO) of thermo-fluids can be used to find cooling interface geometries which achieve high heat transfer with realistic pumping power. However, current methods for thermo-fluid TO show several issues. Firstly, the fluid models used for thermo-fluid TO show weaknesses that cause deviating behavior compared to conventional fluid models, which can result in large under- or overestimation of heat transfer especially when applied to turbulent flow. Secondly, although this deviating behavior is known to result in inferior modeling accuracy, the achievable accuracy of thermo-fluid TO has never been quantified. Lastly, TO currently requires many modeling parameters to be specified manually. Since these parameters largely affect the accuracy of the thermo-fluid solver, tedious parameter tuning is part of the TO design process. This thesis firstly presents a framework which allows quantitative analysis of the modeling accuracy achievable with density-based thermo-fluid models in 2D. The framework reveals several effects causing errors in turbulent flow, as well as a predictability of density-based boundary layer flows. Secondly, a method is tested which minimizes errors of the density-based thermo-fluid models by meta-optimizing the modeling parameters. Applied to a test-case with turbulent flow, this method achieves up to 27% reduction of the modeling error compared to a parameter sweep. When applied to a laminar TO, it achieves similar accuracy as a manually tuned TO without needing any tuning. A second mitigation method which adjusts the thermal conductivity of porous solid material to compensate for erroneous convective heat transfer is infeasible, as it provides less accurate results than the first method. Lastly, a post-processing method which uses the meta-optimized data is tested and found to provide better accuracy than a conventional post-processing method.","Topology Optimization; Density Method; Thermo-fluid; Fluid Flow; Meta-Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The implementation strategy consists of a card set and a poster to show contemporary developments in using data in the design process, a service concept, a practical tool kit to start using the data and an organizational implementation roadmap. Throughout the project, a co-creation approach was used by working on one of the commercial vehicle concept projects. This resulted in barriers, enablers and drivers of different approaches for the team. First, I consulted literature on design and data to create an overview of the approaches in this field. I concluded that contemporary approaches use open data such as social platforms to find users expressed thoughts and feelings, or (owned) sensor data to find users functional needs in measurable behaviour. In a case study the insights from literature are visualized in the form of cards to create a tangible artefact for evaluating the different approaches and also act as later reference. This was the first deliverable of this project. The case study resulted in a set of preliminary set of drivers, enablers and barriers for using data. Next, a design intervention was done in the team’s service design project. Together the qualitative insights gathered and analysed. Then I chose parameters for “a behavioural data profile” and designed a service concept based on these parameters. In this service concept behavioural data of the user is used as input for personalized service functionalities. This allows the team to research behaviour and create the foundation for more advanced research. From this step I translated the learned lessons into a final set of barriers, enablers and drivers. This set allows the team to use this specific approach in future projects as well. The main barriers are now defined as: (1) Designers and researchers having different perspectives when setting up research projects resulting in an inability to create the described design concept. (2) There is no clear indication for the design team where and how to use data in the design process. To overcome these barriers a practical tool-kit was designed to allow the team to bridge the gap between the qualitatively gathered data and defining a product-service concept based on a data profile. The value of this practical tool-kit is supported by literature showing the trend towards in-situ research approaches and an evaluation process. The roadmap, the final deliverable of this project, presents directions for applying this approach and presents steps for further organizational implementation. For future research I recommend developing an accessible persona dashboard of the implemented services for Ford to perform easier and more focussed research in the relations between the different sub-functionalities of the vehicle. The practical tool-kit, set of cards and the roadmap help the team in answering their question: “how to use data to better understand our users and their behaviour” by indicating an appropriate approach, an example project and a practical tool-kit.","Data; Data enabled; service design; Method; toolkit; Strategy development; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-30","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

For a high-scale implementation of electrolyzers, high operation current densities and low overpotentials are essential. Currently available options do not offer this and are limited by the low mass transfer of CO2 in the system. We envision using catalyst-coated capacitive particles (slurry electrodes) to be a solution: a system where the reaction site can be brought to the reagent, instead of the other way around. This thesis is a first step in the direction of a slurry electrode flow cell and aims to produce silver nanoparticles deposited on activated carbon particles to function as catalysts in such a system. The goal of the synthesis procedures was to produce a capacitive powder (activated carbon) with efficient deposition of silver nanoparticles spheres) ranging 5-20 nm in diameter. Based on literature, the most interesting methods for synthesis were selected to be: solution-based methods with only activated carbon, with added polyvinylpyrrolidone, with added sucrose, electrodeposition and impregnation. The resulting powders were analyzed using ICP-OES and TEM, showing that only impregnation and electrodeposition can yield the desired powders with a near-100% silver deposition efficiency and particles &lt; 20 nm in size. Next, the impregnation and electrodepostion samples were prepared into a 15 wt% slurry, and a third slurry was made with bare AC as a blank. The catalysis experiments were executed in a flow cell (electrode area = 4 cm2), with currents ranging from -5 to -15 mA/cm2. Within this range of currents, extreme potentials up to -10 V (measured over working electrode versus counter electrode) were measured. The potentials on the anode and cathode side of the cell were also measured individually using reference electrodes, showing that the anodic side of the cell reached +5 V, whereas the cathodic side of this cell reached only -1 V. Additionally, CV scans before and after the experiments confirm that the cell’s conductivity decreased within an experiment, however, this degradation is reversed for a new experiment. These observations combined lead us to believe that the cause of the cell problems is located on the anodic side of the system, and is most likely resistance from oxygen bubbles, which needs to be solved to allow cell operation at higher current densities. Since the aim of the project was CO2 reduction on the slurry electrodes, the outgoing gases from the cathode were measured in a GC. The blank was included to demonstrate the catalytic effect of the silver nanoparticles, yet the highest CO flow (around 0.05 ml/min) was measured at the lowest current density during this blank experiment. Calculating the Faradaic efficiency (FE) suggests that 33% of the electrons in that experiment was used for this conversion. The other measurements, at higher currents or with silver present, did not reach an FE of 10%. This combination leads to the conclusion that the observed CO is most likely not produced by CO2 reduction. A hypothesis was made that this CO was already present at the powder’s surface and released during the experiment, however XPS data showed that there were no noticeable differences in the content of oxygen-bound carbon between the coated samples and the bare sample. Thus, the source of the CO is at this stage unknown. Future work towards proving CO2 taking place on the slurry electrode should first investigate the source of the observed CO, which requires testing the influence of the different carbon sources present in the system. Additionally, the blank experiment should be improved: using a bare carbon slurry that underwent the same procedure as the coated slurry (without the precursor present) eliminates any differences in the powder.","CO2 reduction; electrolyzer; flow cell; Silver nanoparticles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is organised only by adults who mostly have nothing to do with it, and it shows — both youth care workers and youth themselves have had enough. Every solution to the youth care problem in the Netherlands leads to new problems, making it a wicked problem which does not have one apparent solution which works. Therefore, the best solution to tackle it is to work with bottom-up organisations. De Garage2020 is such a bottom-up organisation, working in multidisciplinary teams all around the country to design innovations which focus on youth care prevention. They work together with youth to get to the best solutions, but unfortunately that still leaves a gap between them and youth they are designing for, especially because they themselves are adults and they still make the decisions. Therefore, de Garage2020 Rotterdam wants to start a new youth initiative, completely led and executed by youth: the JongerenGarage (translated to English as ‘Youth Garage’). The goal of the JongerenGarage would be to design for the utopian youth care in the Netherlands. This thesis is aimed on providing insight into how and if design can facilitate the empowerment of youth in youth initiatives. In this thesis, I am presenting a framework which shows the complex mechanisms that take place. Through this framework, concepts are presented, from which a prototype is developed and used as a case study of a trial youth initiative. This trial went differently than expected, which shows that the perception of what is good and what is bad differs between youth and adults, but also between a non-designer and a designer. Therefore, two things can be concluded: The first is that when designing for the empowerment of youth, an adult cannot expect youth to behave like adults. Youth go through several developmental phases and therefore may have a complete different view on what is right or wrong in terms of working and communication. Second, when conducting a diffuse design process, in which a designer enables others to co-design together, a designer cannot expect non-designers to go through the design process as the designer intended, as they have far less experience. All in all, both of these conclusions imply the same: Expectations have to be let go when designing for others’ processes. This can be done through constant reflection and self-awareness.","codesign; diffuse design; participatory design; youth initiatives; reflective practice; communities of practice; boundary crossing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Palensky, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","At present, the energy transition is increasingly being driven by the integration of renewable energy into the grid. However, this weather-dependent energy generation imposes challenges to the system operators since the deviations between the forecasted and the actual generation keep increasing due to this intermittent generation. Moreover, new consumption patterns and the emergence of new types of loads in the distribution grids, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, increase the dynamics and complexity of the power system. Therefore, distribution grids need to become more active, being able to monitor the real-time changes and controlling the different network elements. In this context, operational flexibility is seen by the DSOs as a suitable solution for keeping the power balance of the system during a specific time period, coping with fluctuations and responding to variations of electricity supply and demand. For this purpose, the impact of the integration of different flexibility sources in the distribution grid has to be assessed by the DSO in order to overcome the operational challenges that it is currently facing. In order to assess the performance of flexibility in a network, this thesis proposes how to model an active distribution network based on the Dutch standards. Taking as a reference a distribution grid built on the software Vision Network Analysis, a converter was developed in order to export the network data to the input data needed in the data matrices of the open-source tool Matpower. The second step was centred upon the development of controls that simulated the action of different flexibility sources, applied to the Matpower network. For this research, flexibility from the PV distributed generation, flexible loads with demand response and short-term flexible storage have been considered. With the aim of performing a comparative assessment of the impact of these flexibility sources, the operating limits of the test network have been simulated under three different demand levels for a complete day. The base line scenario keeps the demand levels already set for the network, while the under-scaled scenario assumes a 40\% lower demand for the complete day. Additionally, an over-scaled scenario has been proposed, which considers the expected demand increase for 2030 with the corresponding integration of heat pumps and electric vehicles. In general, higher demand rates imposed longer undervoltage peaks. Then, the effect of the flexibility sources was assessed by means of the 1-hour resolution controls. It was found that the voltage regulation performed by the droop control applied to distributed generators was minimum and not useful for this type of study. On the other hand, the combination of demand response and flexible storage can deal with all the voltage deviations beyond the allowed limits. The analysis for each case will depend on the limit set for the power curtailment by demand response and the size of the necessary flexible storage system to reach a complete voltage regulation along the network. This analysis demonstrates the influence of reactive power in voltage control, as well as the influence of active power in the loading levels of the network branches. Based on these factors and in order to provide the DSO with operational indicators for the quantification of short-term flexibility, four indicators have been proposed in order to compare the needs of flexibility between networks and the performance of flexibility sources in terms of voltage regulation and loadings of the branches.","distribution system operator; Distribution Grid; power flow modeling; flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Super­resolution ultrasound­imaging can provide such high resolution by detecting individual microbub­ bles (MBs) in a flow circuit. This method relies on the dynamic appearance of MBs, which appear as point scatterers on the US image, mixed with tissue signal. The detection of these MBs require good spatio­temporal resolution and suppression of the tissue signal. These requirements are met by using high­frame­rate plane or diverging wave imaging combined with tissue suppression methods. In this project, the effect of pulse inversion (PI) and harmonic filtering or singular value decomposition (SVD) filtering on the MB detection in slow flow was evaluated. This effect was measured in a soft­tissue­ mimicking phantom containing a 400 휇m diameter wall­less channel. Methods: The US acquisition was done with a Verasonics V1 system, using a convex (C5­2) probe. Two sequences for coherent compound diverging­wave imaging were designed: the first for imaging in the fundamental (F) mode and the second for PI. The axial and lateral resolution were measured and the localization precision determined. Next, the effect of changing the number of compound angles, voltage, flow velocity, the receive mode (fundamental or harmonic), SVD­filtering and tissue motion on the MB detections was evaluated in four experiments. Results: The results of the system characterization showed an average lateral &amp; axial resolution in F­ mode of 2.5 mm and 1 mm, respectively. In PI­mode the lateral &amp; axial resolution was higher because of imaging at higher frequencies (2.0 mm and 0.8 mm, respectively). The MB localization precision was 20 휇m lateral and 6 휇m axial, from which we deduce that ultrasound localization microscopy improves spatial resolution with an average factor of 75. The results of the MB detection experiments showed a decrease of MB detections when the number of compounding angles increased. Possibly because of less false detections, since compound imaging results in improvement of contrast and a reduction in speckle and artifacts. No direct relation between the increase of transmit voltage and MB detection was found. In the SVD­filtered PI­mode data, the increase of flow velocity from 1 till 2 till 4 mm/s was accompanied by an increase in MB detections and a decrease in the false positive detections. At low flow velocities, the difference in spatial coherence between tissue and MBs was low which could have resulted in poor differentiation. Receiving in the harmonic­mode, resulted in a small spatial shift of the location of the MB detections because of asymmetry of the used radio­frequency filter. Besides, in the harmonic receive­mode the total number of MB detections dropped. A probable explanation is that less false MB detection were made because of suppression of flash artifacts. When tissue mo­ tion was induced, this led to higher MB detections in the non­filtered PI mode than in the stationary case. However, these can also be motion artifacts which are falsely detected as MBs. SVD­filtering or harmonic­filtering of these acquisitions resulted in practically zero MB detections. Conclusion: We conclude that non­filtered PI results in more true­positive MB detections than harmonic­ filtering and SVD­filtering when flow velocities are low. When tissue motion is negligible, PI­imaging results in good SR images, with a possible disturbance of flash artefacts.","Ultrafast ultrasound; super-resolution; micro-bubbles; Filtering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","","52.0866, 5.1799"

(mentor); Broersen, Sjors (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the future, the energy supply will primarily consist of energy from renewables, which makes energy producers and grid operators fear that grid security and reliability could be threatened. On top of a more fluctuating supply, energy demand is also expected to increase in the coming years, especially if heating will be electrical when gas is phased out. Demand-side management, and more specifically demand response, could be a way to make demand match supply better and limit the foreseen energy shortages. A smart grid and smart metering technology can be implemented to overcome the hurdles of grid integration of renewables. Consequently, the implementation of a smart grid could potentially steer consumer electricity usage and allow for automated demand shifting. This thesis analyzes consumer participation in demand response in an electricity grid with a high share of renewables. The effect of multiple price- and incentive-based interventions are tested for different consumer populations and supply scenarios. The aim is to improve the understanding of the effect of consumer heterogeneity on the participation in demand response. An agent-based model was constructed that represents the energy system as a copper plate model and incorporates the rule-based behavior of different consumer types. This model was used to answer the main research question: How can a simulation model be used to analyze the influence of consumer heterogeneity on the success of demand response enhancing policies in future electricity networks? The consumer types that were included are the green, the cost-conscious, the convenience-oriented and the indifferent energy consumer. Subsequently, five personal values were identified as important moderators for consumer participation, namely the values of price, environment, comfort, safety and social norm. Different interventions and combinations of interventions were compared based on the three model KPIs energy shortage, total electricity cost and required storage. The comparison of the interventions and intervention combinations showed that the differences in energy shortage between the policies were limited and were mainly determined by supply. For a constant supply, the results revealed that the simultaneous implementation of all policies was most effective to reduce shortages, followed by the policy combinations that included the cost comparison with a reduction. Naturally, these combinations also resulted in lower electricity costs for the consumers. The cost comparison and reduction policy and default shifting could increase consumer participation most when used as a separate intervention. Some main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the interventions. First of all, supply was the most important influence on energy shortages. Depending on the shortage period characteristics, shortages could not always be solved completely by demand response, but a higher amount of demand shifters can improve the situation significantly. However, not all consumer types could be motivated to switch to a shifting contract, which means that the consumer population is an important influence on the effectiveness of policies. From this thesis it can be concluded that a simulation study is a successful way to create an inclusive model of the technical, economic and behavioral system components. The model was able to provide a system-level overview of the system dynamics and improved the understanding of interactions between interventions and consumers. Therefore, this model can be used in future case studies to analyze the potential consumer participation and recommend suitable interventions to increase this.","Agent-Based Modeling; Deep uncertainty; demand response; Smart grid; Energy consumer behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Through decentralization of air traffic control, this strain can be released and airspace capacity, safety and flight efficiency can be increased. The Modified Voltage Potential is a decentralized conflict detection and resolution method based on a force field analogy. Once a conflict has been detected, repelling velocity vectors are determined on board of the involved aircraft to find a conflict-free trajectory. The Modified Voltage Potential has proven to be effective and efficient in various studies, although unintentional behavior is shown when an aircraft has a conflicting trajectory with multiple aircraft at the same time. In these multi-aircraft conflicts, the suggested solution is found by summing the pair-wise resolution vectors. When a left hand-sided maneuver is suggested to solve one conflict, but a right hand-side maneuver is suggested to solve a second conflict, the summed solution does not result in a conflict-free trajectory. On the other hand, when both conflicts are solved by an equal left hand sided maneuver, the sum will suggest a maneuver twice the required size. Unintentional behavior is currently mitigated by recursive conflict resolution. This paper investigates if further improvements can be made by weighting the pair-wise resolution vectors. The effects of weights on conflict resolution mechanics are investigated through a series of multi-aircraft conflict situations. By means of free flight simulation, it is shown that weights can improve airspace stability, flight efficiency, and stability in a high-density free-flight environment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This problem is known as the Train Unit Shunting Problem (TUSP), which is a hard combinatorial optimization problem faced by railway operators. The TUSP is currently solved using human heuristics, which is difficult and time-consuming. Reinforcement learning approaches have been developed in the last few years to efficiently approach this problem. In this research we develop, in a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, an heuristic for random exploration to efficiently search the state-action space and two heuristics for train routing strategies, which aim at improving the performance and quality of the produced route plans. On one hand, we develop the Type-Based Routing Strategy, based on the idea of parking trains of the same rolling stock type on the same tracks. On the other hand, we develop the In-Residence Time Routing Strategy, based on parking trains ordered according to their departure time. Both routing strategies consists of four components: (1) standard parking rules, (2) combination and split rules, (3) conflict resolution rules and (4) unnecessary movements rules. The goal is to incorporate information from the logistics side of the problem into the framework. We demonstrated the performance of the heuristics developed in two real-life cases in the Dutch railway network. The results of the experiments carried out demonstrate the potential of the resulting framework to produce more efficient route plans and to adapt to different problems designs such as different matching problems types and different shunting yards.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Data evaluation approaches commonly either process them as stacks of randomly ordered spectra or as flat images. This thesis aims at combining both, lateral and spectral, aspects of hyperspectral data during data evaluation. Different approaches, such as lateral distance and neighbor pixel augmentation, will be explored with modern factorization techniques, such as t-stochastic neighbor embedding and self-organizing maps, and supported by artificial neural networks. The routines developed are applied on selected X-ray fluorescence data (XRF) sets from the field of materials science and cultural heritage. The altered augmented data set concept consists in augmenting the spectrum of a central pixel with the mean spectrum of its eight neighboring pixels. This new method is applied to the data set of a bi-modal Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloy. Clustering the optimized augmented data set with t-SNE reveals the existence of four components: phase with strong titanium signal, phase with strong vanadium signal, the first phase on top of the second phase and the second phase on top of the first phase. The later was not identified by clustering with t-SNE the data set augmented with all the spectra of its eight neighboring pixels. Clustering the XRF data set of a 13th century B.C. Egyptian mural painting with Self Organising Map (SOM) indicates areas with different thicknesses of copper and iron containing pigments. Clustering with Fast interpolation-based t-SNE (FIt-SNE) also reveals information about the painting sequence and the composition of a mixture of pigments. The pigments are not separable with a simple observation of the XRF elemental distribution images. Moreover, FIt-SNE dramatically accelerates t-SNE and can provide well-separated clusters. These properties are especially useful for large data sets, containing mixture of pigments. Finally, I introduce an optimised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for training the photograph of a painting with the elemental distribution images, obtained by its XRF data set. The elemental distribution images are upscaled with Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network. In this way, we can identify with more accuracy the exact location of the damages and retouches on a 17th century A.C. easel painting (portrait of Hortense Manchini), since the result image is of high resolution.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Selek, Ibrahim (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The implementation of timber as a load-bearing and stabilizing material for high-rise structures has significantly increased over the last decades due to its potential of reducing the environmental footprint of a structure. Timber structures present a reduced global stiffness and self-weight compared to structures incorporating traditional construction materials, making them prone to high accelerations caused by wind load which affects the structural integrity and user comfort. The acceleration of a structure is a highly complex parameter that must be determined using modal analysis computed by a full-scale finite element model, and is significantly influenced by the magnitude of the wind and vertical loads, as well as the global stiffness of the structure. During the preliminary design phase, it is the responsibility of structural engineers to determine the feasibility of the design and estimate the amount of material required and the distribution of the structural elements. However, this process must be done under a limited amount of time, forcing engineers to rely on rules of thumb and previous experience, which are not currently available for the design of timber high-rise structures. Therefore, the goal of this investigation is to perform a parametric study to determine the influence of various parameters on the design of timber high-rise structures and assist structural engineers in making well-argued decisions during the preliminary design phase. The preliminary design parameters to be studied in the parametric study are: stability system design, connection stiffness and building height. The ranges for the parameters were selected based on extreme values such that clear trends regarding their influence on design could be visualized. This decision limits the design feasibility of some configurations studied in this investigation. The selected stability systems to be studied are glulam frame, CLT core and glulam diagrid. The design verification for each design alternative is done using ULS and SLS criteria provided by Eurocode, as well as a simplified method to estimate the dynamic response of the structure. Finally, the sizing of the structural elements and data collection was done by the implementation of evolutionary algorithms. From the data collected it was determined that the most influential design parameter for the design of timber high-rise structures is the stability system selection given that it determines the global stiffness, which showed a significantly higher influence on the dynamic response of the structure than its self-weight. Moreover, the efficiency of the different stability systems was assessed based on the maximum slenderness they could achieve compared to the amount of material they required. Based on this definition, it was determined that the glulam diagrid is two times more efficient than the CLT core and three times more efficient than the glulam frame. The efficiency of the glulam diagrid is caused by its high global stiffness provided by the triangular configuration of the diagonal elements. These observations prove that the effect of timber’s low density can be mitigated by the implementation of efficient stability systems. The influence of connection stiffness was determined to be directly related to the ability of the stability system to provide lateral stability to the structure. The influence of this parameter on form stable structures such as the CLT core and the glulam diagrid, proved to be nearly negligible, while for non-form stable structures such as the glulam frame it proved to be highly influential. However, it was also determined that the addition of rotational stiffness in the connections causes an exponential increase of the costs and environmental footprint of the structure, which decreases their design feasibility. Finally, the influence of building height on the design is visualized by its effect on the dynamic response of the structure caused by the logarithmic increase of the wind speed as this parameter increases, as well as a decrease of the global stiffness proportional to the efficiency of the stability system.","timber; timber high-rise; parametric study; Influence study; wind-induced dynamic behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Therefore, this research answers the following research question: Can capacity building be included in agricultural projects focused on smallholder farmers in developing countries, and if so, how? A case study about women smallholder farmers in Kerala, India, is conducted. Findings show that not only the knowledge and skills are hindering a woman smallholder farmer’s capacity to grow, but also her internal motivation, level of empowerment, ability to take risks, the perception towards farming and informal institutions are important for her capacity. Hence, this study proposes a framework with components to consider when developing a strategy for capacity building of women smallholder farmers.

In comparison with the quasi-static case, inertial effects are significant in dynamic crack propagation. The classical numerical tool for modeling dynamic crack propagation is the standard finite element method (FEM). However, the method suffers from problem of mesh-dependency. Enriched finite element procedures such as the eXtended/Generalized finite element method (X/GFEM) are able to solve this issue by adding enriched degrees of freedom (DOFs) to nodes of the original mesh, thereby providing full decoupling between the mesh and cracks. Yet, X/GFEM suffers from other issues that are inherent to the formulation such as the need for more complicated methods for applying non-zero Dirichlet boundary condition, and an intricate computer implementation. In the thesis, the Discontinuity-Enriched Finite Element Method (DE-FEM) is used to simulate dynamic crack propagation as an alternative to X/GFEM. DE-FEM also decouples cracks from the background mesh while solving X/GFEM’s aforementioned issues. This is achieved by adding enriched DOFs along cracks. Prescribing non-zero essential boundary conditions is as straightforward as in standard FEM. Moreover, DE-FEM’s enrichment strategy provides simplicity on crack propagation, as the crack tip node can be transformed into a crack segment node directly with little effort. Also, fewer enriched DOFs than in X/GFEM are appended while advancing cracks. In the numerical examples of either stationary crack with dynamic loading or dynamically propagating cracks, DE-FEM is able to reproduce analytical and/or experimental results. Both Bathe’s time integration method and the classical Newmark constant average acceleration method are applied and compared. Results show DE-FEM is a suitable candidate to solve dynamic fracture problems.","Finite element method; Enriched finite element method; Dynamic crack propagation; Linear Elastic Fracture mechanics; Discrete time integration; DE-FEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Today, there exists a great need to limit global warming, and an energy transition is vital to do so. With the upcoming changes in our energy system, bioenergy is widely discussed, resulting in a heated debate on including or excluding bioenergy in the energy transition. This study aims to identify the least controversial feedstocks out of 40 different ones and if they will help to resolve the controversies around bioenergy. Before a feedstock is deemed controversial, a background of bioenergy was established to see what role bioenergy has in today's energy system and in the future. A literature analysis identifies the role of bioenergy today. Using the 'IAMC 1.5C Scenario Explorer' hosted by IIASA the role in the future is identified. To determine the least controversial feedstocks, a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is performed. The PROMETHEE II method is used to perform the MCDA and the entropy weight method for weighting the criteria. The ranking and weighting make use of MATLAB. Since the aim is to classify feedstocks as the least controversial, the criteria are deduced from a literature analysis and represent the controversies of bioenergy. The first part of the report indicates a significant role in today's renewable energy system and a shift towards more modern bioenergy implementations like biofuels and bio-electricity. According to the scenario analysis, for the five different shared socio-economic pathways, bioenergy will be used. Besides the identification of a clear use of bioenergy in the future energy system, the scenario analysis of TFE of bioenergy indicated a shift towards modern bioenergy use. It was observed that the solid biomass use reduced and a strong increase in liquid biofuels in the transport sector will happen. These findings are in line with the predictions made by the IPCC. Also, this is in accordance with the observed growth rates and development trends found for today and in the recent years. This all results in the conclusion that bioenergy is important for the energy transition. Due to the observed research and development into biofuels and bio-electricity, traditional bioenergy will be phased out and replaced by modern bioenergy types. The next part of the report considers the controversies around bioenergy. The following controversies are identified and considered the most discussed ones: chain emissions, removal of carbon sinks, the carbon debt, land-use, competition with the food industry, and biodiversity. Identification of the controversies and with that the criteria are necessary for the feedstock ranking. The MCDA ranking shows that residues and wastes feedstocks are the least controversial, followed by alfalfa. The top eight high-scoring crops are alfalfa, oil palm, kenaf, mustard, cotton seeds, prairie grasses, camelina, and hemp. For this top eight, an additional ranking that included water use is done. This ranking shows that incorporating such a detail does not significantly change the results. It was seen that the top four was kept constant except when the simplest form of an MCDA is applied. Cotton seeds drops two to three places in rank. Prairie grasses replace cotton seed at place five when water use is considered. The most remarkable contradiction with literature is that oil palm ranks very high, and miscanthus is not present in the top eight. Oil palm is, in literature, considered a very controversial feedstock, and miscanthus shows promising features. These results indicate that either the data is not specific enough, or the criteria are not detailed enough. Another explanation is that the choice for an objective weighting method is not the best choice since it excludes opinions of the decision makers (the scientist participating in the debate). The debate is opinion and preference driven, which makes that a data based weighting method might not be ideal. Nevertheless, the rank of the waste streams is following the expectations. The results indicate that waste streams are to be used as primary feedstocks when controversies need to be resolved. The PROMETHEE II ranking shows this solution, and a sensitivity analysis supports the results. Reflection of the data for the feedstocks and the controversies shows that the use of residues and waste feedstocks can resolve several controversies with a relatively high degree of certainty (controversy of land use and competition with food industry) and others with some degree of certainty (controversy of chain emissions and biodiversity). Due to the global scope and simplifications, the data used could be improved. Therefore, further research is necessary to back-up the findings. Nevertheless, this research gives insight into the controversiality of several feedstocks and takes a first step in tackling the bioenergy debate.","Bioenergy; controversial debates; Bioenergy Feedstocks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

We show that neuron activation values can be distinguished by the class of the data point and contain meaningful information about the prediction of the network. Based on this information, we propose a new, gradient-free method for creating adversarial examples based on a genetic algorithm. By covering a larger part of the search space and manipulating the neuron activation values, our success rate exceeds most state-of-the-art methods, such as DeepFool and RFGSM.

Its daughter craft is a valuable asset for unplanned maintenance in the summer when it can operate safely, but it is often not deployable during the winter due to the rougher weather conditions. The main research question is: What are the deficiencies of current DCs, and how can these access vessels be modified to operate year-round at far-offshore wind farms? The results show that the current DC’s deficiencies lie in its current operational requirements. Also, performance in oblique waves is currently riskiest since that is when there are higher vertical accelerations or a combination of vertical and lateral accelerations. Furthermore, wave steepness has significantly more effect on accelerations that wave height. Lastly, future DC designs should be focussed on stable seakeeping performance during transfers rather than high-speed transit. An analysis into the seakeeping performance of four prototypes showed that it is feasible to increase the transfer requirement from Hs ≤ 1.5 m to 2.0 m ≤ Hs ≤ 2.5 m. The catamaran type DCs have a high potential to realise year-round accessibility to far-offshore wind farms due to their resulting performance in oblique waves.","Daughter craft; Systems Engineering; Offshore wind farms; Accessibility; Transfer phase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Installing lithium-ion batteries on new or refitted diesel-electric submarines has become increasingly interesting based on their relatively high energy density and specific energy. The characteristics compared to the currently implemented lead-acid batteries are known, meaning that the implementation of lithium-ion batteries on submarines can increase the submerged range and endurance based on their better specifications. Additionally, lithium-ion batteries require less maintenance and provide a relatively longer life expectancy compared to lead-acid batteries. However, lithium-ion batteries can develop a thermal runaway: a process which exponentially generates heat, leading to the risk of an explosion and fire. A thermal runaway can be initiated based on internal failure mechanisms and external causes, such as exceeding critical temperature limits. Understanding of the thermal behaviour of lithium-ion batteries is essential to reduce the probability of a thermal runaway. The probability of initiating a thermal runaway can be further reduced by auxiliary systems such as a cooling system and a battery management system. The main objective of this research is therefore to investigate the implications on preliminary submarine system design based on the thermal behaviour of lithium-ion batteries and to quantify the thermal behaviour and design implications. The relevance is that by quantifying the thermal behaviour, the cell temperatures can be estimated. As a consequence, awareness of the risk of a thermal runaway is established, while at the same time input for the dimensioning of a cooling system is provided. An analysis has been performed concerning the safety of lithium-ion batteries. The causes, the characteristics and the prevention methods regarding a thermal runaway have been studied in this research. The four stages of a thermal runaway are discussed, as well as the generation of toxic and flammable gasses. Moreover, the sources of heat generation in a lithium-ion cell have been described. The heat generation typically consists of reversible and irreversible heat components, of which the relative contributions have been described based on the charge or discharge rate. To support preliminary submarine design, a thermal model of a lithium-ion battery module has been created. The first model that has been created describes the electric behaviour of a lithium-ion battery cell that is typically implemented in marine applications. EST-Floattech has provided technical specifications of the lithium-ion pouch cell that is implemented in their modules. The second model determines the generated heat based on the electrical model and cell specific properties. The third model simulates a lithium-ion battery module, where heat is generated by multiple cells and heat transfer rates with the surroundings are modelled. A lumped thermal capacity approach has been implemented and cooling is modelled to provide insight in typical cooling rates regarding thermal management. Conclusions have been drawn regarding the temperatures of the cells in the module based on three operational profiles. Based on a submerged sprint, C-rates up to 1.0C can be sustained without cooling while remaining below the critical temperature limit of 55°C. For consecutive cycles during a covert transit or covert surveillance, cooling is typically necessary. Only at C-rates below 0.3C a covert transit can be sustained. Typical cooling rates vary between 60 W and 185 W, where the effects of cooling are most significant for covert transit and covert surveillance. Module optimisation provides increased cooling rates while increasing the energy density and specific energy. This results in a decreased mass and volume of the module, resulting in a significant amount of extra space in the entire battery system on board of a submarine. The largest improvement in thermal management can be realised by choosing the right conductive filler. Moreover, the cooling capacity has a significant influence on the cell temperatures. Cell temperatures remain relatively constant after the fourth cell in a row, meaning that modules are typically not limited by the number of cells.","Lithium-ion battery; Submarine; Thermal Runaway; Thermal modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Bakker, M.F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Plastics that originate from renewable sources, such as potatoes or fungi, are called biobased plastics. Because of their origin, biobased plastics pose as sustainable alternative to traditional plastics, which are made from oil, a fossil substance. CoffeeBased is a small company that manufactures biobased plastic products, using their own developed materials (CB materials). To make these even more sustainable, CoffeeBased adds coffee waste as filler material to the biobased plastics. This reduces waste accumulation while generating a unique material. The coffee waste, called spent coffee grounds (SCG), adds attractive properties to the CB material. This includes a distinct coffee scent, and in combination with colorants, a coffee-like color is achieved. These unique properties suit the ambience of coffee product environments, like corporate coffee corners. CoffeeBased currently implements their CB material in (products such as) coffee machine fronts, coffee cups and coffee stations. The panels applied in the coffee stations are the most relevant to this thesis. The panel consists of a coating, adhesive, and a core that is laminated with CB material, referred to as CB laminate (EMPA, 2019). Unfortunately, the CB laminate does not function properly in the desired user context, as it discolors and distorts. To prevent this impact from reducing its aesthetic appeal, optimization is required. Next to that, the sustainable character of the panel in its entirety is questionable, as the other components have not been analyzed on this characteristic. Therefore, the first design challenge is to find an integral solution to improve both the context resistance as the sustainable value. The second challenge is to design a condiment organizer, which could form the perfect occasion to test the proposed optimized panel. The function of the condiment organizer is to display and organize additives used in coffee machine beverages, called condiments. Next to the implementation of the panel, the design has to incorporate a form language that corresponds with other CoffeeBased products. Based on the desires of the end user, limits of the manufacturing facilities and the resources available to CoffeeBased, requirements were set. The sustainability requirements are set on incorporating more waste and more biobased materials whilst ensuring the emittance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) remains low. Keeping these requirements in mind, alternatives to the current components of the panel were looked for in market research. The theoretical best components were chosen and (physically) tested, which were CB2 as laminate material, Resysta NoWood by FiberPlast as core, BioImpact by Canect as adhesive and the clear lacquer by BioPin as coating. Four panel concepts are compared, each with different advantages. Increase in waste content is considered the most important optimization, as it suits the uniqueness of the CoffeeBased material. Therefore, the best suitable panel concept is the one composed of an EcoBoard core, CB1 laminate, BioImpact adhesive and BioPin lacquer. The optimized panel provides an increased sustainable value by a higher waste content of 83% and a biobased content increase of 12%, this while providing a potential VOC emittance reduction of 1%. Also, the concept entails edge band development, aiming to increase its aesthetic appeal and user context resistance. To tackle the second challenge, design ideas were generated based on the insights gained from brainstorm sessions. The four most promising ideas were presented to CoffeeBased, whose favorite was selected for further conceptualization. The final condiment organizer consists of a pre-assembled back frame, available with three, five or seven compartments. Condiment specific fronts can be selected by the user, based on their preference. Unfortunately, the necessary manufacturing method prevents the implementation of the optimized panel, thus a no-added formaldehyde plywood core is incorporated. Luckily, the aesthetic appearance does fit into the product portfolio of CoffeeBased, with its contour and surface engravements. Therefore, this thesis project does not only provide CoffeeBased with valuable sustainable panel solutions, but also a new product design for their product portfolio.","Sustainability; Coffee; Integrated Product Design; Biobased materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Within the scope of STM, an impartial and optimized collision avoidance advice based on the perspective of two manoeuvrable satellites could encourage more active collision avoidance and pre- vent on-orbit collisions. Using CDM data and operator input for the setup of the optimization, it was shown that in-track manoeuvres performed by either one or both of the satellites have a minimum usage of ∆V in combination with a small displacement and meet the collision probability threshold. Additionally, it was shown that the use of weights in the optimization cost function can influence the manoeuvre magnitude and the respective satellite that needs to perform the manoeuvre. Combining this optimization with a linearized propagation of the satellite states, a quick recommendation can be generated on the manoeuvre options for both satellites, which could help the development of an STM in terms of an impartial collision avoidance manoeuvre advice system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Abraham, E. (mentor); Kapelan, Z. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Foul sewer networks face many challenges related to new pressures and ageing infrastructure. There is a need to be able to evaluate how networks will be able to adapt to varying population densities, urban development and ecologic changes. Some suggest the use of exploratory models to test large numbers of network configurations, intended as alternative responses to the driving pressures. However, in order to carry out exploratory modelling, a trade-off between computational time and accuracy must be achieved. An approach to generate and size foul sewer networks which allow computational savings was developed in a collaboration between Eawag, ETH Zurich and TU Delft.This approach was used in this study to evaluate the computational time savings and accuracy of a generated sewer network in hydraulic performance assessment. Two case studies of 7km2 (Port Phillip) and 57km2 (Melbourne), and different land uses were used to evaluate the ability of the generated network to represent a real network. It was found that computational time was reduced for both case studies, by a maximum factor of 10. Hydraulic performance was compared under high, typical and low flow conditions. It was found that high flow parameters are better represented in small case studies, where network capacity reduction and topology differences are less evident between real and generated networks. For low flow conditions, percentages of network length at risk of sedimentation were well represented for both case studies, with the larger case study showing slightly better performance. Under typical flow conditions, it was shown that topology simplification in the generated network leads to significant changes in times of concentration between networks, and hydrograph discrepancies, especially for the larger case study. However, general trends, including distribution of pipe cumulative flow percentage for pipes in sedimentation, or pipe diameter for pipe surcharge, are well represented by the generated network. Therefore, it is found that the generated network should be used to evaluate hydraulic performance trends in generated networks, as well as global values (eg. flood volume) if the network differences (eg. capacity, path length) are taken into account. Finally, future work needs are highlighted which could strengthen the findings of this study, including use of real network flow and hydraulic performance data. Moreover, the computational time savings for a full assessment (rather than just hydraulic evaluations) should be quantified and compared.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With increased developments and interest in platooning and higher levels of automation (SAE level 3+), the need for safety systems that are capable of monitoring system health and maintain safe operation in faulty scenarios is increasing. Methods for the detection, isolation and identification of faults in automated and cooperative driving is increasing. Once the existence of a fault is known, one needs to classify its severity and decide between fail-operational and fail-safe mitigation to guarantee the safety of a faulty vehicle. The considered scenario in this research consists out of a vehicle suffering from a severe fault, such as a power steering or rear tyre failure, whilst driving in an ACC string of vehicles on the right most lane of a highway. To accommodate failures in an automated vehicle, as a first contribution of this thesis a functional-safety architecture is proposed, which can enable safe operation in faulty scenarios. This architecture uses a nominal channel, a health monitor and a safety channel to incorporate all steps between nominal vehicle operation and fault mitigation. To demonstrate the increase in safety potential of the first contribution, its tactical decision making and fail-safe mitigation modules are implemented as a second contribution. The fail-safe mitigation uses an optimization-based algorithm to bring the faulty vehicle to a safe-state, being parked on the road shoulder. This manoeuvre is performed using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). To further highlight safety improvements of the functional-safety architecture, the prediction model of the NMPC is reconfigured. It uses the information from the fault detection and isolation module to optimize the tracking performance of the controller. Assuming a string of ACC vehicles, results show different tactical decision making strategies the faulty-vehicle can perform to move to the road shoulder. The impact it has on the remainder of the string of vehicles shows a trade-off between stopping time and distance of the faulty vehicle and re-connection time for the remaining vehicles. Further results on the tracking performance of the NMPC show its robustness against severe faults and the increase in tracking performance when it uses the information from the proposed architecture. This highlights the safety improvement potential and need of both the functional-safety architecture and the fail-safe mitigation algorithm.","MPC; control; vehicle dynamics; Vehicle control; Automated Driving; Functional Safety Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Prediction of ICU readmission could support physicians in their decision to discharge patients from the ICU to lower care wards. Due to increasing ICU data availability, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the form of machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to build high-performing decision support tools. To have impact on patient outcomes, these decision support tools should have high discriminative performance and should be explainable to the ICU physician. The goal of this thesis was to compare several types of ML models on predictive performance and explainability for the prediction of ICU readmission for discharge decision support. The scientific paper that aims to answer this question can be found in Part III of this thesis. In a broader perspective, we proposed a framework for the development and implementation of clinically valuable AI-based decision support. <br/>First, a systematic review was conducted to examine current literature on ML prediction models for ICU readmission (Part I). We concluded that previously developed models reported inappropriate performance metrics and were not implemented in clinical practice. Furthermore, previous work did not compare explainable outcomes in terms of patient factors contributing to the risk of readmission between models. Secondly, we conducted a questionnaire among ICU physicians to investigate current discharge practices and their attitude towards the use of AI tools in their work processes (Part II). Although not all physicians agreed that the decision to discharge ICU patients is complex, most of them do believe in the clinical value of an AI-based discharge decision support tool. Thirdly, we developed several prediction models for ICU readmission and compared them on discriminative performance, calibration properties, and explainability (Part III). We concluded that advanced ML models did not outperform logistic regression in terms of discriminative performance and calibration properties. However, the explanations of XGBoost, a state-of-the-art ML algorithm, were more in line with the ICU physician’s clinical reasoning compared to logistic regression and neural networks. Lastly, we designed a study protocol to prospectively evaluate the predictive performance of Pacmed Critical, a CE-certified AI-based discharge decision support tool, and that of the ICU physician (Part IV). <br/>This thesis contributed to making the step from developing high-performing prediction models to clinical adoption of an ICU discharge decision support system. Due to small differences in discriminative power and calibration properties between models, the model best explainable to the physician and most in line with clinical reasoning should be chosen for decision support. Before final implementation, impact on patient outcomes and costs will need to be studied in prospective trials. <br","Intensive Care Unit; Readmission; Machine learning; Artificial Intelligence; Explainability; Decision Support; Prediction model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","Acceleration of the energy transition requires increased mining of materials. An important material for the energy transition is nickel, used in the stainless steel required for all energy infrastructure and an important component for both stationary batteries and batteries used in electric vehicles. Previous research has been done on the global nickel requirements for the energy transition at a high level of aggregation. In this thesis, exploratory system dynamics modelling and analysis was used to assess the resilience of the nickel supply chain and its nexus with the energy system at the level of individual mines. The development of the global nickel supply chain, and its energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions, was modelled and explored between 2015 and 2060 under different disruption scenarios, sustainability policies and uncertainties. A nickel demand of 6 - 18 million tonnes per year is projected by 2060 for the BAU scenario, with projections up to 38 million tonnes per year in the scenarios that aim to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 °C. The main contributors to this large demand are electric vehicle batteries. The nickel system is conditionally resilient to the energy transition, given sufficient exploration and annual capacity increase. To increase the resilience of the nickel system, policies that support innovation in battery material composition and lifetime and good end of life waste management of batteries can play an important role. Modelling the nickel supply chain at mine level leads to different behaviour compared to previous research where mines were aggregated. Insights obtained from the detailed modelling in this thesis include a higher demand than previously projected; the possibility of the average ore grade increasing over time as mines with lower ore grades are decommissioned; average final energy requirements that can decrease, increase or increase rapidly depending on a varying average ore grade, a varying composition of processing methods and a varying composition of by-products; average energy costs that differ depending on the projected electricity mix in the countries containing deposits; and a reduction in end of life nickel recycling rate for most scenarios due to an increasing share of batteries. The most important contribution of this thesis is not in the data and assumptions, but in the model itself, which can be adapted and refined in further research, where more stakeholder input is included, to make the outcomes more robust and useful for decision making. Other important avenues for further research include determining how much exploration is possible and how quickly mining capacity can be increased.","Energy transition; Supply chain resilience; Nickel; Energy-material nexus; System Dynamics; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Agent-Based Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Human-haptic conflict, caused by misalignment of intentions or different use of reference information, is a source of annoyance and controllers should be designed to eliminate it as much as possible. One way to influence how a haptic shared controller uses reference information is by adjusting the look-ahead time. In this research, a human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of varying the haptic look-ahead time in a shared-control preview tracking task. An HSC was designed according to the Four Design Choices philosophy that uses an internal HO model to provide a human-compatible reference. Results reveal a region where conflict is minimal, and no significant in conflict occurs. Subjective ratings by the participants show a similar yet larger region, for which no significant difference in usefulness and satisfaction is perceived. Meanwhile, despite showing a strong `exchange' of authority through human-haptic forces, the error remains low, indicating how the HO adapts to changes in the haptic controller in order to keep the tracking error satisfactory. The results of this research highlight the importance of properly tuning the haptic look-ahead time, while also revealing a `region of acceptance' for which participants are unlikely to notice any change in the haptic shared controller.","Haptic shared control; preview control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-25","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One of these uncertainties is the interaction between the deep sea mining collector and the seabed. Allseas collaborates with DeepGreen Metals to collect nodules in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean. The CCZ seabed consists of a very soft cohesive soil. During a blackout, the collector sinks considerably into the soil. It must be retrieved as losing such an expensive asset is not desired. The umbilical is intended to lift the collector from the seabed. However, the umbilical has its limits due to its lifting capacity. Therefore, research is done to estimate the breakout force of the collector and to find possible load reduction options to stay within the umbilical’s boundaries. The breakout process is time-dependent and contains multiple soil resistance forces. These soil resistance factors are the suction, adhesion, side resistance and added soil mass. The soil suction is the dominant force, adding resisting during a breakout. Different load reduction options (e.g. eccentric lifting, perforations) are discussed, to reduce the breakout force of the object. However, in previous research the extracted objects are rigid, while the tracks of the collector are flexible to some extent. Experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of flexibility on the breakout force compared to rigid objects. Four experiments are executed in the laboratory, to test four different effects on the breakout, namely: the flexibility, grousers, eccentric lift and in situ time experiments. A test setup is designed to execute these experiments and five different test samples are selected, varying in size and material properties. During the experiments, the samples are extracted from an artificial CCZ soil. The experimental results are used to calibrate and validate the model. The model is developed to simulate the breakout process and to make an estimation of the required force to lift the collector from the seabed. The model consists of three main components: the lifting mechanism, soil and the object that should be lifted. A combination of the literature survey, experiments and the model provides sufficient information to estimate the lifting force of the collector. Load reduction options can be applied to reduce the breakout force during a quick lift. During a slow lift the collector can be retrieved from the seabed without additional load reduction options.","Deep sea mining; Soft cohesive soil; Lifting force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-23","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The circular economy (CE) has been heralded as a solution addressing its economic and environmental challenges by promoting more efficient use of materials. Stakeholders throughout the entire industry need to adapt their business models towards more sustainable and cost effective circular alternatives. Examples of CE strategies are the utilization of subscription-based business models, de-materialization of product chains and the maximizing of physical assets’ useful life. For medical disposables, the CE transition is challenged by apparent limitations in economical, behavioural, and operational feasibility. This study involves the embedding of CE thinking into Philips image guided therapy devices (IGT-D) by incorporating the projected impact of circular adaptations into the decision-making process between project proposals. A model was developed to facilitate the appraisal and selection of CE opportunities within existing IGT-D products. It assesses their impacts to the business according to six categories: i) Marketing, ii) Resource investment, iii) Capital investment, iv) P&amp;L (profit and loss), v) Dependency and vi) Legal &amp; regulatory. This model calculates impact scores that reflect the efforts necessary to implement these proposals as well as their potential advantages. The usability and value of the model were assessed in a case series, which produced promising yet inconclusive results. Although the model demonstrated potential to fill in the knowledge gaps for implementation of circular proposals by assessing their impacts, its ability to assist the decision-making process between proposals is in need of further validation. Future research into CE adoption in IGT-D needs to determine its impacts based on real outcomes and may be used to validate the model’s projections.","Circular economy; Medical devices; Image guided therapy; Sustainability; Waste; Product development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-25","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","","52.344495, 4.916904"

In this context, most appropriate is defined as a fuel alternative which minimises required freight rate (RFR) while maximising overall performance on technological, environmental and other criteria. A decision support tool was devised combining a decision model based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) with a financial model based on discounted cash-flow (DCF). Additionally, an optimisation model was implemented to optimise for minimal required freight rate through slow steaming. The decision tool provides shipowners with a quantified impact on their current business if they do not transition to alternative fuels under a 'market based measure' (MBM) regulatory scenario, as well as best-alternatives if their current fuels do not meet regulations under an 'emission cap' (EC) scenario. The decision tool is evaluated under optimistic, average and pessimistic scenarios in 2020, 2030 and 2050. Under an emission cap scenario, the results showed an overall preference for Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD) as the most promising alternative maritime fuel both in terms of SMART performance and required freight rate, followed by upgraded bio-oil (UBO). Nevertheless, the average difference in required freight rate of alternative fuels compared to HFO remains substantial, at 43% and 38% higher for Fischer-Tropsch diesel under a 'no regulation' scenario and 'market based measures' scenario, respectively. It is therefore evident that without regulatory intervention, heavy fuel oil is expected to retain dominance based on cost. Even under a market based measure (MBM) scenario, the average required freight rate of HFO increases only by 3.4% overall. For LNG, market-based measures lead to an average increase in RFR of 4.1%. These results suggest that in order for the maritime industry to transition towards sustainable alternative fuels, policymakers, governments, international organisations and lenders need to align their policies to collectively enable a more sustainable shipping industry - not only by enforcing stricter regulations, but also by providing the correct financial incentives.","GHG reduction policies; Alternative fuels; Decision support tool; Required freight rate; Economic speed optimisation; Scenario analysis; Maritime industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Before the Tripp pilot went live in February 2021, several questions emerged: How could the Tripp Service be improved and scaled up effectively? Therefore, this graduation project assignment was raised: “Design an optimized shared vehicle Service for LeasePlan”.The optimized shared vehicle Service for LeasePlan Tripp consists of the current Service with the adaption of multiple building blocks that solve a design paradox. This design paradox is an obstacle for the current Tripp Service proposition and its future growth and needs to be overcome. The paradox is discovered in the analysis phase by conducting internal interviews with in-house experts and doing a trend research in academic literature. During the qualitative interviews in the Design phase, it was confirmed by the potential LeasePlan Tripp users and mentioned how it could be overcome. Users are willing to perceive a shared vehicle equally to a private vehicle if it is just as flexible and available. A shared vehicle should have the same feeling as a private.The Customer Journey of the current Service led to several Service opportunities, such as; providing a pro-active Service that is always one step ahead of the user &amp; embedding several marketing elements that increase usage and engagement. These opportunities are also processed into the proposed building blocks and improved Business Model for Tripp.The improved Business Model consists of an experience-oriented component that could be able to increase profits the Service will make over the years. Moreover, this improved Business Model allows LeasePlan to provide an even better experience to the user than when they are driving their own vehicle. This is done by providing luxurious vehicles and the organization of events that are especially for Tripp users. At the end of the project, the building blocks that had the most potential: integrating a dynamic pricing structure and a vehicle exchange platform, were presented in the future concept of LeasePlan Tripp. This future concept was assessed on its gaps and possible fixes, which was input for the final upscale advice.","Mobility as a Service; Service Design; Customer Journey; Business Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

After collecting 408 responses, a multiple linear regression revealed that on-board crowdedness was perceived as the most important risk factor. With discrete choice modelling we were able to calculate that an average traveller is willing to pay around 0,88 euros to reduce the seating occupancy with 10%. Furthermore, we were able to conclude that both the obligation to use face masks and extra cleansing of contact surfaces negatively influence the perceived risk and thereby increase the chances of going by train. Since extra cleansing is not extensively done yet in Dutch trains, it could, together with reducing crowding levels, be the key to nudge people back into the train.","COVID-19; Risk perception; Public transport; Hierarchical Information Integration; Stated Choice Experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Spaargaren, Gerben (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The combination of continuous sea level rise, and more frequent extreme river discharges will become a rapidly developing problem for the Rhine-Meuse delta over the course of the next century. The current Dutch delta management policy mostly revolves around the consistent improvement of the existing dikes to account for the increasing water levels in the region. An alternative solution to this problem is the Delta21 project. The Delta21 project proposes the construction of a large scale storage lake, and a high capacity pumping station at the Dutch coast. The project is meant to allow for the simultaneous closure of the storm-surge barriers on the Dutch coast, while actively discharging river water that would normally be pilling up behind the closed barriers. The Delta21 project foresees it will be able to save up to 5billion euros by the end of the century in dike reinforcement costs. In order to enable the flood safety operation of the Delta21 project, the project also requires the construction of a new storm-surge barrier in the Haringvliet ebb-tidal delta, roughly 10km away from the current Haringvlietsluices. The objective of this thesis is the conceptual design of the new Delta21 storm surge barrier, the New Haringvliet barrier. The aim of this design process is to identify critical design components, and requirements that could potentially be hurdles in the development of the New Haringvliet barrier, as well as the overall Delta21 project. For the hydrodynamic design of the barrier, a schematized 1D hydrodynamic model was used to get a first insight into the impact the new barrier will have on the on the tidal range in the tidal delta. As well as how much it could potentially impact the reintroduction of the tide to the Haringvliet. The reopening of the Haringvliet would be a part of Delta21's effort to restore some of the local ecological value to the region as a compensation measure for the project. Additionally, the model was also used to determine the effects of the construction of the barrier on the capability for the system to handle high river discharge rates. The findings of the assessment show that the selection of a small tidal opening in the New Haringvliet barrier will significantly negatively impact the capability for the system to discharge high river water, as well as limit the amount of tidal range that will be available in the system. It was determined that constructing the barrier with a tidal opening with an effective cross-section of 10000m2 will provide the best balance between hydrodynamic performance of the system, and barrier construction costs. An analysis of the possible Delta21 construction sequences was used to determine the preferred construction method for the barrier. In this analysis, an economic construction sequence alternative, and an environmental construction sequence alternative were developed, and consecutively evaluated using a multi-criteria analysis. This MCA revealed that the construction of the New Haringvliet barrier using prefab construction elements and techniques was the desired construction method for the project. The results of hydrodynamic and construction sequence assessment, were used as the basis for the barrier's spatial design. The structure was designed with a total of 20 vertical lift gates, each spanning 80m. This would bring the total tidal opening to 10400m2. Vertical lift gates were chosen for the design due to their great reliability and overall cost effectiveness, which are both important considerations for a barrier of this magnitude. On the southern side of the barrier a shipping lock will be the barrier's primary navigational opening. The final phase of the conceptual design focuses on the design of the gated barrier section, and includes the validation of the transport stability of the caisson, the design of the vertical lift gates, and the design of the scour protection and it's filter layers.","DELTA21; Storm surge barrier; conceptual design; Flood Risk; Hydraulic Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","DELTA21","51.882401, 3.982549"

Due to the limited computational performance of onboard hardware, aggressive flight approaches have relied on off-line trajectory optimization processes or non time-optimal methods. In this work we propose a computational efficient model predictive controller (MPC) that approaches time-optimal flight and runs onboard a consumer quadcopter. The proposed controller is built on the principle that constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) have a so-called 'bang-bang' solution. Our solution plans a bang-bang maneuver in the critical direction while aiming for a 'minimum-effort' approach in non-critical direction. Control parameters are computed by means of a bisection scheme using an analytical path prediction model. The controller has been compared with a classical PID controller and theoretical time-optimal trajectories in simulations. We identify the consequences of the OCP simplifications and propose a method to mitigate one of these effects. Finally, we have implemented the proposed controller onboard a consumer quadcopter and performed indoor flights to compare the controller's performance to a PID controller. Flight experiments have shown that the controller runs at 512hz onboard a Parrot Bebop quadcopter and is capable of fast, saturated flight, outperforming traditional PID controllers in waypoint-to-waypoint flight while requiring only minimal knowledge of the quadcopter's dynamics.","Optimal Control; Model Predictive Control; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; micro air vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Steur, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Legged locomotion is a discrete event system (DES) due to the ever changing contact states of each leg. As such, it requires a nonlinear modelling method to predict the trajectory of a legged robot. One such robot has been focused on throughout this thesis; the six legged ""Zebro''. With its half-circular legs, the Zebro is well suited for traversing uneven terrain and even climbing up small steps, making it the robot of choice for a lunar mission in the near future. A previous attempt at modelling the trajectory of a Zebro kinematically fell short when it came to modelling a curved path, with the reasoning behind this being how the Zebro's legs can visibly be seen slipping over the ground as it walks, the effect of which is never taken into account. A combination of kinematics and dynamics was used for the model in this thesis. The reason for this is that the Zebro's legs are actuated using position controlled motors, so the information available is the leg's angle and the speed at which the leg is rotating, rather than the torque. Therefore, kinematics were used to estimate the vertical motion of the Zebro due to the rotational speed of each leg, which could then be used to estimate the normal contact force on each leg. The traction forces could then be estimated using the normal force and a slippage model which has been experimentally identified in collaboration with a different research team at the TU Delft. With these forces, and the Newton-Euler equations of motion, the Zebro's path could be predicted. Applying a slippage model to a half-circular leg, rather than a wheel, required a new method of calculating the slip ratios which was based on Pacejka's formula, but adapted to also account for the case where a leg is standing on its toe. Furthermore, a contact detection algorithm was designed to kinematically predict which leg(s) lift off of the ground during a touchdown event. This was used to kinematically model the orientation of the Zebro during a tetrapod gait and was shown to correctly predict the complicated contact transitions during said gait. Another product of the research in this thesis is a new and improved algorithm for a turning tripod gait, which achieves smoother turning than beforehand by guaranteeing a smooth contact transition between two leg groups. That being said, it cannot yet be applied to the tetrapod gait, so the current gait scheduling algorithm is still required for a turning tetrapod gait. The results of the simulations showed the Zebro walking as expected, both in a straight line and when turning, but the simulations could not be validated quantitatively due to current events regarding COVID-19. For a qualitative review of the model, photographs were taken of the Zebro during walking gaits to compare to the simulations and showed that, while straightforward walking was predicted well, the turning circle of the model was significantly sharper than in reality. The reason for this is most likely a problem in the calculation of the slip ratios, since they were consistently unrealistically low, therefore requiring further research in future.","discrete event system; Zebro; legged locomotion; Legged Robots; Slip; Dynamics; Kinematics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A current trend, in recent decades, in spacecraft engineering is the miniaturization of satellites and their subsystems. One of these subsystems is for propulsion, which is important for orienting satellites and performing orbital manoeuvres. Currently one such micropropulsion system, being developed at the Space Engineering department at the Delft University of Technology, is called the ``Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster"". These thrusters are manufactured using Deep Reactive Ion Etching on silicon wafers. They operate by resistively heating the propellant, vaporizing and expanding it throughout the nozzle to create thrust. Currently, several experimental investigations have been conducted to formulate models that can predict the performance of these microthrusters, on a wide range of operating conditions, without the use of expensive testing. These models can then be validated comparing them to experimental data. Thrust tests were performed with nitrogen, for three different thrusters in ambient, cold conditions, for operating pressures of 2-5bars. From these tests, the discharge coefficient was predicted within 10\% of the experimental values. So the model's prediction of the discharge coefficient was valid. It was also immediately clear that the thruster was not designed for ambient conditions due its low specific impulse values of 7.6-22.7s, resulting in incomplete flow expansion in the nozzle. The current 1st generation thruster interface used at the department is limited to 150ºC due to its teflon material. Therefore, an alternate design using a printable circuit board was investigated to reach at least 600K, where the thruster would be glued to it using a thermally resistant, ceramic based glue (Thermeez 7020). Unfortunately, the design was limited to 150ºC due to the low adhesive quality of the glue, which meant that the thruster inlet could not be sealed off and a less suitable replacement glue had to be used. Heated thrust tests were performed for two thrusters up to around 150ºC in ambient conditions. For this increase in temperature , throat Reynolds numbers decreased from 2915 to 779, while the discharge coefficient increased from 0.71 to near 1. However, a less suitable mass flow sensor had to be used, so the validation of the model based on the hot thrust tests was inconclusive for discharge coefficient and the Isp efficiency. Overall, the goals for this experimental research study were partially reached. Thrust tests were conducted, using nitrogen as propellant, for cold conditions and up to 150ºC. The experiments could not substantially validate the prediction of the Isp efficiency, however the model is accurate to within 10% of the experimental values for the discharge coefficient. Experimental data from literature also could not validate the Isp efficiencies of the model, unless the fitting constant of the thrust coefficient relation was altered. It is recommended to focus on experimenting with the use of water as a propellant and make minor improvements to the thruster design, to obtain accurate performance data at higher temperatures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An issue that is often overlooked, however, is the deviation of drillhole locations with respect to their coordinates as designed in the blasting plan. This causes changes in the spatial distribution of explosive energy; some areas of the blast may receive a surplus of explosive energy, while others see a reduction. This results in less uniform fragmentation, producing more fines and increasing chances of oversized boulders, which reduces the efficiency of loading, hauling, and crushing operations. Additionally, deviated drillholes can lead to slope stability issues, flyrock, and uneven benches. To mitigate these problems, this study attempts to reduce differences in the explosive energy distribution (EED) through an optimization approach that adjusts the height of explosive columns in blastholes. A case study combines planned drillhole coordinates of two blast patterns with both simulated deviations and actual deviated drillhole locations. The corresponding benches are discretized into block models, for which the explosive energy distribution is calculated from the planned drillhole configuration as well as the deviated holes. The optimization objective is then to minimize block-to-block differences in explosive energy by making discrete adjustments to the height of individual column charges. Since mathematical programming is not possible due to the complexity of the evaluated formula, solutions are generated by metaheuristic algorithms. Among the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Tabu Search (TS), the latter is preferred for its local search neighborhood that gives superior computation times. An inconvenience of the block-to-block comparison is the introduction of very large differences in explosive energy in blocks nearest to deviated blastholes, which cannot be accounted for by any charge adjustments except reductions in the deviated hole itself. Because optimization should focus on manageable differences in lower-valued blocks, these high-valued blocks are discarded by applying a cap based on data percentiles. Obtained results show that optimized charging adjustments vary with the chosen percentile, which makes it challenging to define comprehensive truly optimal solutions. A bias for charge reductions at high percentiles gradually shifts towards a bias for charge increases at lower values. Because a bias-induced imbalance in the total amount of explosives (compared to the original charging) is undesirable, the setting closest to equilibrium is selected, which is the use of only the lower 50\% of data. In this configuration, optimization of the case study blast patterns results in improvements of the objective value of 0.53-1.54\%, or 2.14-3.94\% when only the blocks affected by the recommended charge adjustments are considered. The block-to-block comparison handles any interchangement of block values as unwanted differences, which should not always be the case. Therefore, the true improvements to the explosive energy distribution might be better expressed using an alternative optimization objective. Computation times could be further reduced by expanding on the developed algorithm, and combination with prior research would be helpful to include any GPS-related inaccuracies in the actual drillhole locations.","Optimization; Drilling and blasting; Explosives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

This useful tool of a low-medium accuracy, especially designed for a CubeSat mission, consists of simple analytical expressions derived from applying a curve-fitting technique to the output of a database formed by mass-optimal trajectories, all of them with a fixed time of flight of three years. Through these functions, the user is able to introduce as input some particular target orbital conditions defined by the eccentricity, mean anomaly and argument of pericenter, parameters never modelled before in this type of fast preliminary methods. Due to the nature of the PHOs, the target asteroids covered by this approach follow orbits with a similar heliocentric semi-major axis as the Earth, particularly selecting the ones with null inclination. As a result, relevant information of the desired trajectory is obtained in terms of ΔV, transfer angle and departure epoch, allowing to gain a valuable preliminary insight to determine a first-guess solution in only a few seconds. The accuracy achieved by the proposed tool when designing a transfer towards the previously described celestial bodies corresponds to 2.3% for ΔV, 1.7% for transfer angle and 4.7% for departure epoch.

The School of Life Amsterdam is an organisation that aligned with this personal vision for society with their mission of helping people get more fulfilment out of their lives. For The School this project was an opportunity to expand their target group. A strategic design process was used to design a vision and strategy for The School of Life Amsterdam. First, research was performed in three directions. 1. Self-development: Why is it important and what are obstacles in doing self-development? 2. The School of Life Amsterdam: What are their strengths and weaknesses, which opportunities can be identified? 3. (Potential) customers: Who are they and what do they think about self-development and The School of Life Amsterdam? The research was analysed and used to create a vision for The School of Life Amsterdam: Growth as a shared responsibility of both The School of Life Amsterdam and its customers. For The School, that means business and impact growth, and for the consumers, it means personal growth. The strategy is built on the research's insights, especially the appeal of The School has to customers, and the self-help paradox, meaning that people need to do self-development to realize the value of self-development. The strategy aims to make self-development a norm in society by using The School’s community, people who are already into self-development. The community members will be provided with the knowledge and tools to interact with people who are not yet aware of the value or doing self-development. The interactions will be based on ‘We-development’: Self-development as a means to create deeper and more meaningful connections. With more people doing self-development, the School of Life Amsterdam's market will expand. A roadmap with three phases was created to implement the strategy in the organisation. Finally, further recommendations for the project are that The School of Life Amsterdam creates a clear definition of fulfilment to measure its impact on customers. Next, the strategy’s value and impact needs to be evaluated during execution.

(mentor); Kuipers, Tim (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This report shows the development of a method that joins two chemically incompatible materials during Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). State of the art FDM printers can extrude more than one material during the printing process. Due to chemical incompatibility of many polymers, the selection for combining materials is limited. This gives the following goal: “Generate a method to create a dual material object, made of two chemically incompatible materials during the FDM production process”. Studies related to multi-material FDM printing are discussed to find a starting point of this project. The use of a form interlocking shape to join the two chemically incompatible materials is chosen for further investigation. The concept is a form interlocking shape. This shape consists of rows of bridges made of polylactic acid (PLA, rigid material). Thermoplastic urethane (TPU, flexible material) is extruded under and around these bridges to create an interlocking shape. The PLA bridges are created using a non-planar printing approach. As opposed to the regular FDM process (planar), we created a continuous bead across multiple layers (non-planar). A prosthetic hand is created for demonstrating the method. The PLA main body and phalanges are connected with TPU links to allow bending of the fingers. We focused on the criteria: strength, applicability and process continuity. Based on these criteria, we made design choices regarding form interlocking shape, printing procedure and sequence, size and geometry and slicing software. We created specimens for determining the force-displacement relationship and used the peak force as a measure of the interface performance. The proposed concept (bridge pattern) is tested against two benchmarks: the overlapping feature available in slicer Cura (current industry standard) and an interlocking shape printed using a planar approach. Our proposed concept resulted in a higher peak force than the overlapping feature: 491N compared to 415N, an increase of 18%. The planar interlocking shape resulted in a peak force of 504N, even higher than our proposed concept. This production method is relevant for multi-material products manufactured with FDM. Examples are given of products in robotics and prosthetics, compliant mechanisms and wearables. The prosthetic hand was chosen as a demonstrator. A qualitative evaluation was performed on this prosthetic hand: using manual force only, neither the interface bond or the materials (PLA and TPU) could be broken. We have shown a method that creates a stronger bond (vertical interface) between two chemically incompatible materials (PLA and TPU) than the current industry standard.","FDM printing; Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing; Joining; Materials; Prostheses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As for the emissions, the main task lies in controlling the air-fuel ratio in the lean regime as to control the emissions of NOx since they reach maximum discharge at the stoichiometric ratio whereas improper mixing can lead to an increase in CO emissions. Thus, the air and fuel interactions need to be studied to achieve control over emissions. To that end, good computational models are necessary to supplement the design process to control both the emissions and combustion instabilities. The latter can severely damage the combustion chamber. Therefore, the proper modeling of the fuel-air interfaces in high-pressures is pivotal as they differ significantly from the low-pressure injection. Various numerical droplet evaporation models are studied in trans/supercritical environments, the fluid is called supercritical when it's above the critical states whereas it is called transcritical when it passes the critical state. As for the droplets, two components were selected namely n-heptane and n-dodecane. The former for 0-D and 1-D models and the latter for 3-D models, the cases were dictated by the availability of experimental works. As for the 0-D and 1-D models, various correlations based on the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers were utilized. The Prandtl number and other non-dimensional numbers were computed by thermophysical property models based on the 1/3 rd rule rather than fixed values. In comparison, the developed 0-D and 1-D models conform to the experimental results and other computational studies ranging from perfect-gas to real-gas against the experimental work available in the literature. It is hypothesized that the differences in the computation of the latent heat of vaporization are more pronounced in the accuracy of the lifetime of the droplet rather than the density of the components. In 3-D models, the liquid-vapor interface is modeled by level-set and phase-field methods. Thermodynamic closure is achieved by the Peng- Robinson equation of state. Prandtl number assumption model is invoked for the computation of the liquid thermal conductivity, Chung model for the calculation of viscosity of mixtures, and Firoozabadi model for the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficient. A basic model is used for the computation of surface tension coefficient for the phase-field 3-D models. A qualitative agreement was observed between the 3D model under this study, numerical work, and the experimental campaign of microscopic droplets for all the three vaporization regimes namely classical, translational and diffusive mixing. All the models yielded olive-shaped droplets. Effects of mesh resolution on the phase-field quantities were studied and contrasted with the same mesh size for the level set method in a 2-D configuration. Recommendations include better surface tension models, thermal conductivity for gaseous mixtures, the inclusion of PC-SAFT equation of state, cross-diffusion terms, and high mesh resolution of the O(-7) m in the droplet region coupled with adaptive meshing based on the gradient of the phase-field parameter.","Droplet dynamics; transcritical; Phase-Field Modeling; Level-set method; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a model-based adaptive control technique, Model-Based Reference Control (MRAC), for predicting the adaptive control policy shown by human operators while controlling a time-varying system in a pursuit-tracking task. Ten participants took part in an experiment, where they were asked to control a time-varying system whose dynamics changed twice and approximated a single and double integrator dynamics. A MRAC controller is composed of a feedforward and a feedback controller and an internal model that is used to drive the adaptive control policy. The active gains, the internal model parameters and the learning rates, have been estimated via an non-linear optimization aimed at maximizing quality of fitting of the participants' control output. The participant's control behavior rapidly changed when the dynamics of the controlled system changed, in particular when going from controlling a first to second order system. The MRAC model was able to accurately capture the transient dynamics exhibited by the participants when the system changed approximately from a first to a double integrator while it failed to do so when the system changed from double to first integrator. In the latter case the MRAC gains changed too slowly. Therefore MRAC can be used to approximate human adaptations in pursuit tracking tasks when a change in the dynamics of the controlled system requires an increase in the rate feedback controller to ensure accurate tracking of the reference signal. <br/> <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Trainers increasingly use the developments in sports technology for analysis. But wheelchair athletes do not benefit as much from these developments. A wheelchair can, for instance, disturb signal transmission. Recently, a set of studies describe the development of a wheelchair measurement system, the Wheelchair Mobility Performance Monitor (WMPM). It monitors wheelchair kinematics based on a wheelchair model and two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The WMPM also gives relative location and orientation i.e. relative pose. But this does not allow for game analysis, which requires the absolute location of an athlete. A way to obtain the absolute location of an athlete is the use of Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. It is often used due to its relatively high ranging accuracy and affordability. However, UWB signal transmission can be disturbed due to Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLoS) situations, where the body of an athlete, or the wheelchair, is located between two UWB nodes. This reduces the localization precision and accuracy. Game dynamics, i.e. quick changes in direction and velocity, also reduce the UWB localization precision and accuracy. Separately, UWB and the WMPM are not sufficient for proper absolute pose tracking. But a combination of these systems, i.e. sensor fusion, could be a good alternative. To provide trainers with real-time tracking data, the sensor data of these systems need to be fused on an embedded system. This requires an efficient UWB localization solution. A recent algorithm by Larsson formulates a localization problem with an easier-to-compute linear eigenvalue approach. In this work, this approach is validated and compared with a previous implementation via simulations and measurements. We show a execution time that is 5 times faster, without accuracy loss. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is implemented to fuse WMPM and UWB data and it is improved with a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. An IR-camera system (Optitrack), providing the ground truth, is used to validate the UKF. The solution has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 20 cm in dynamic wheelchair situations. This work provides a basis for further development of a platform where WMPM and UWB are integrated for paralympic sports.","UWB; wheelchair; ukf","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

A suitable and integrated sensor system in the air bearings would complete the package of actuator and sensor.

A commercial light diffuser plate is used to increase the vision of an optical fiber. The effect of the light diffuser is experimentally tested with a test setup that can simulate the motion of a moving rectangular object that resembles a solar cell. Different transmission trends observed by the optical fiber are received for various angles of motion of the moving object. The detection range of an individual optical fiber is increased up to an 8mm radius around the optical fiber, dependant on the angle of motion of the object. The distributed sensor concept is verified by tracing the observed signals from the optical fiber back to object position and angle of motion.","Optical fibers; Distributed sensor; Optical sensors; Image analysis; Image processing; Edge detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Those parts of the trajectory along which the tube is supported by columns---which possess both axial and bending stiffness---requires the use of a model that allows to study a form of instability that is inherent to this type of support. Specifically, the stability is studied of a point mass with a lateral and vertical degree-of-freedom that moves with constant velocity along an infinite Euler-Bernoulli beam on coupled lateral-vertical periodically inhomogeneous foundation. The beam model is able to deflect in both the lateral and vertical direction and the concentrated mass is attached to this beam by a lateral and vertical contact spring. With the help of a perturbation method it is shown that the system's vibrations can become unstable. As for the model that only exhibits degrees-of-freedom in the vertical direction, the underlying physical phenomenon is parametric resonance, which occurs because of the periodic variation of the foundation stiffnesses. For the lateral-vertical model, this form of instability is referred to as combination parametric resonance, which yields four instability domains in the velocity-mass parameter space as opposed to the one domain for the vertical-only model. The center lines of these four domains depend strongly on the period of inhomogeneity; the larger the period, the higher the velocity at which instability occurs. Vehicle-structure interaction (i.e. the maglev system) also affects the center lines considerably; including contact springs between the beam and the point mass reduces the velocity at which instability occurs. To obtain the complete instability domains and to be able to investigate the mitigating effect of foundation damping, the method from another paper is recommended to be used for follow-up research.","Parametric resonance; Maglev; Hyperloop; periodic foundation; dynamic stability; Combination parametric resonance; Vehicle-structure interaction; Mathieu's equation; Euler-Bernoulli; Timoshenko; Lateral-vertical beam model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Fluctuations in the refractive index of the air delay incoming light randomly, resulting in blurred images. A deconvolution from wavefront sensing system is an adaptive optics system that measures the modes in which the light is corrupted (i.e. the wavefront) and corrects it using a process called deconvolution. The wavefront is measured using a wavefront sensor, which consists of an array of microlenses combined with an imaging sensor. Each microlens casts an image of the object unto the imaging sensor, resulting in a collection of images that are differently aberrated depending on their location on the sensor. Conventionally, the wavefront is calculated by measuring the shifts of each microlens image and integrating these shifts over the aperture. This method, however, discards information about the higher order deformations of the microlens images. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a novel method of wavefront reconstruction has been developed which makes use of artificial neural networks in order to extract this higher order information. In order to do this, the images produced by the microlenses are normalized, which is done using a modified version of the blind deconvolution algorithm called TIP. After the normalization, the microlens images are reduced to what they would look like if a point source was observed, instead of the object. With the influence of the object removed, an artificial neural network is used for the estimation of the wavefront. <br/><br/>By using this method, the wavefront can be reconstructed with twice the turbulence strength compared to what is possible with conventional methods.

The downscaled soil moisture products of VanderSat using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, were compared with an in-situ soil moisture network that operated between 2017 and 2018 and a newly placed network installed during a fieldwork trip early 2020. Soil moisture is a key variable in the hydro- logical cycle, but the understanding of soil moisture content in tropical areas like Myanmar is substandard. This study provides new insights, being one of the first of its kind in the tropics. The reliability of both in-situ soil moisture networks was analysed and indicated that the 2017 network could be used for the validation, and the 2020 network for a visual comparison, with a focus on the soil temperature as a source of error. The results of the validation showed high correlation with Pearson’s R ranging between 0.70 and 0.89. The highest correlations were found for the L-band, between 0.78 and 0.89 and for the location Hpayargyi. The root mean square difference (RMSD), unbiased RMSD and bias indicated that the accuracy and precision need improve- ment. For the ubRMSD values between 0.059 m3/m3 and 0.129 m3/m3 are found. The best result is found for the L-band at Hpayargyi, which is the only location/band combination that meets the target accuracy of 0.06 m3/m3 that is often set for SMAP satellite retrieval. The visual comparison of the 2020 network showed good agreement for the soil moisture measurement. When the in-situ soil temperature measurements were compared with the satellite retrieved land surface temperature measurement, however, this resulted in a large bias of approximately 15 degrees Celsius. To evaluate possible improvements for the validation result, several sources of errors were explored. Two sources concerning the in-situ network indicated the challenges of an in-situ network in a remote tropical area. The first showed that re-calibration of the sensor is necessary to improve representation of the ground truth. The second discussed the spatial mismatch between the point scale in-situ measurement and the downscaled satellite products, with a pixel size of 100x100m. The sparse in-situ network with four stations cannot represent the entire area and can therefore result in errors. The other sources of errors that were discussed originated from the retrieval algorithm of the Land Parameter Re- trieval Model. A parameterisation was performed to assess the sensitivity of the ubRMSD to the polarisation mixing factor (Q), the single scattering albedo (!) and the roughness parameters (h1 and h2). The parame- ters were optimised to achieve the lowest ubRMSD, the result indicated that an improvement of the ubRMSD up to 40% can be achieved. However the evidence that linked the optimised parameters to the tropics was not found and it was concluded that the optimising could be covering the large temperature bias, that is a direct input in the Land Parameter Retrieval Model. The large bias in the temperature was evaluated as a source of error. The bias can partially be explained by the masking of water bodies, where the dynamic ef- fect of the tropical monsoon on the water bodies is not taken into account. Another explanation for the bias could potentially be found in the emissivity that is determined by optimising the ¢T , which can cause im- perfections in the prediction of the temperature. It was concluded that the satellite retrieved soil moisture products show good correlation but need improvement in accuracy and precision. This can be accomplished by updating the in-situ soil moisture network, creating new water masks, solving the retrieval algorithm for the temperature bias and then optimising tropical specific location parameters.<br","Satellite; Soil Moisture; Remote sensing; Myanmar; Tropics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Post-Delta21 salinity intrusion is projected to be less extensive than pre-closure. Maximum intrusion is estimated to reach the westernmost Moerdijk ports mainly due to diminished tidal flow at the estuary mouth.- Freshwater intake in the Haringvliet is projected to be compromised for the majority of the year whereas freshwater intake in Hollands Diep is compromised during prolonged drought.- Salinity outwash from the Haringvliet on ebb tide is projected to be poor under both drought and normal conditions due to widespread salinity diffusion in lateral and vertical directions on flood tide. The Delta21 framework, in which this study is positioned, aims at increased flood safety and ecological restoration of the Haringvliet, a former estuary in the Dutch southwestern delta that has been closed as part of the Delta works. To achieve this, Delta21 proposes to reopen the Haringvliet freshwater basin to tidal effects in an attempt to restore its estuarine character. Implementation of Delta21 introduces the risk of compromising agricultural and industrial activities around the Haringvliet-Hollands Diep by reintroducing salinity and tidal movement in the basin. The central problem lies in quantifying the extent and stability of the expected periodic salt intrusion post-Delta21. This has been done by projecting a geographical bandwidth of salinity intrusion patterns depending on the severity of SLR (2020-2100) and low-to-mean Rhine-Meuse discharges (in 2100 CE) using a numerical model. Mitigation strategies are then recommended based on these numerical results. The OSR-HV model (owner: Port of Rotterdam) is used to run predictive scenarios of salinity intrusion for the lower reaches of the Rhine-Meuse basin. OSR-HV runs in TRIWAQ (Rijkswaterstaat), which is 3D numerical modelling software that employs coupled hydrodynamics and constituent transport thereby resolving salinity transport. An upper-end critical scenario consists of a Rhine (Lobith) discharge averaging 1000 m3/s for 31 days combined with 85cm SLR in 2100. This resulted in an intrusion pattern reaching the westernmost port of Moerdijk in Hollands Diep. Results show that the basin geometry, possibly nudged by Coriolis deflection, initially causes a preferential path of salinity intrusion along the southern bank of the Haringvliet. Lateral and vertical mixing is extensive in the western part of Haringvliet which is thought to be a combined effect of weakened tidal flow at the estuary mouth and robust and erratic geometry of the basin. Further up-estuary, the historical flood-ebb tidal channel structures is the main transporter of salinity. The Haringvliet shows distinctly different estuarine behaviour compared to the neighbouring Rotterdam Waterways where stratification is more stable, causing less up-estuary diffusion. The relative robustness of the Haringvliet and mild freshwater forcing give rise to extensive 3D mixing which subsequently limits the maximum horizontal excursion of salinity. Salinity intrusion into the Old Meuse is observed to aggravate upon opening of the Haringvliet sluices due to flow reversal in Spui which connects Haringvliet with the Rotterdam Waterways. This effect can even result in salt intrusion from the Rotterdam Waterways via Old Meuse and Spui back into the Haringvliet, causing a secondary spike in salinity on ebb tide there. Finally, height-limitation of the Haringvliet sluice gates is somewhat effective in countering horizontal excursion of salinity but runaway diffusion in the Haringvliet results in similar salinity profiles compared to full opening of the sluice gates. A shipping channel that crosses the current Haringvliet front delta is included in Delta21. This deep feature promotes advection of salt through the Haringvliet sluices. Subsequent diffusion patterns cause for poor washout of salinity from the basin upon ebb tide. Limiting the depth of this channel is recommended if salt intrusion is to be reduced. Full opening of the Haringvliet sluices furthermore causes approx. 0.50m lowering of Mean Low Water (MLW) near Moerdijk which affects busy shipping routes between Rotterdam-Moerdijk-Scheldt. Partial reduction of the conveying area of the Haringvliet sluices may be used to suppress the tidal wave penetration into Haringvliet-Hollands Diep. Significant gain in ecological value is likely post-Delta21 due to addition of approx. 1900 ha of intertidal areas and a 40 km salinity gradient (excl. front delta). Ample recommendations on further research have been made in this exploratory study. It is recommended to further study the effects of Delta21 interventions on macro hydrodynamics of the Dutch coastal shelf. The interconnected nature of the region requires a larger modelling domain to prevent the occurrence of non-physical effects obtained from the current numerical schematization. Furthermore, hydrological relations and bathymetry were generated from 2020 data. It is therefore recommended to precede the assessment of salinity intrusion into the Haringvliet with numerical projections on change to these environmental factors. Lastly, significant gain in accuracy may be obtained from applying spatially varying temperature and wind to the domain to better replicate baroclinic flows and turbulent mixing.","Haringvliet; Salt Intrusion; DELTA21; Climate projections; Stratification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DELTA21","51.832729, 4.049717"

For the last decades, interest rate products were often linked to IBOR rates. IBORs are short-term borrowing rates charged between global banks in the unsecured interbank market. The purpose of this thesis is to compare the Hull-White model to the Black-Karasinski model for the pricing of caps/floors on compounded rates. Both models are so-called short-rate models, which are widely used for interest rate modelling. Due to the IBOR reform, new products are expected to appear in the market. One type of these products is caps/floors linked to the new Risk-Free Rate (RFR). The new RFRs will be in-arrears backward-looking rates and, as a consequence, have an impact on the choice of pricing models.<br/>This thesis considers caps/floors on the new compounded RFR rates. For both models various pricing techniques for caps/floors on compounded rates are investigated. For the Hull-White model, the pricing kernel approach and a Monte Carlo simulation are explored. The pricing kernel approach yields an analytic formula for caps/floors on compounded rates. This formula is also used for the comparison. For the Black-Karasinski model, the pricing kernel approach, the trinomial tree method and the Monte Carlo simulation are considered. The pricing kernel approach yields a semi-analytic formula for caps/floors on compounded rates. However, in practice the computation time of this semi-analytic formula turned out to be substantial. Further, despite the fast computation time of the trinomial tree for LIBOR caps/floors, the trinomial tree method is rather slow for the caps/floors on compounded rates. As a result, the Monte Carlo simulation is the most suitable pricing technique, along the three<br/>explored methods, for caps/floors on compounded rates under the Black-Karasinski model. Therefore, the Monte Carlo simulation is used for pricing caps on compounded rates in the model comparison. <br/>Since there exists no liquid market yet for caps/floors linked to the new RFR, the models are calibrated to a proxy market. First, the Black-Karasinski model is calibrated to the proxy market using a heuristic approach. This heuristic approach is chosen as a compromise between computation time and accuracy. Then, the Hull-White model is calibrated to the Black-Karasinski model using the stripping method. Having both models calibrated, the price of caplets/floorlets on compounded rates are calculated. Thereafter, these prices are inverted to Bachelier implied volatilities for a uniform comparison.

This trend is highly susceptible to the rise of monopolies and oligarchs, as seen in the music industry today. In this industry, the top 5 streaming services and top 3 labels form oligarchs. Artist income is diminishing because these powerful intermediaries take large revenue cuts. Streaming services also have curatorial power: they decide the inner workings of their black box recommendation systems.  As an alternative for centralized Internet platforms, this thesis presents a theoretical framework for building a robot economy in software: autonomous software in which robots perform monetary transactions on their own. It allows for building infrastructure for the common good: software systems that (1) handle financial transactions in a fair way, as (2) decided by democratic engagement, (3) run transparently and autonomously, (4) are open to any participant (permissionless), (5) are decentralized and leaderless, (6) support a self-evolving codebase, and finally (7) can make intelligent decisions on their own using AI.  We show a proof-of-concept of this framework, by implementing features 1,3,4 and 5. We present a fully operational decentralized music streaming, publishing and discovery mobile app (called MusicDAO) with peer-to-peer donations to artists. It is built on a fully distributed, self-scaling network of Android phones. The app was released to the public, and was installed on 50+ devices. During this public trial, the decentral financial infrastructure was successful: most music streaming platforms take a 20-40% cut of music revenue; MusicDAO takes &lt;0.001%. Discovery and metadata search is operational with low latency. Peer-to-peer music streaming is operational, but its latency is not yet competitive.  Our framework and proof-of-concept are fruitful steps towards research into infrastructure for the common good: software systems that are governed by its users instead of by profit-driven corporations.","Distributed systems; Peer-to-peer streaming; Robot economy; Cryptocurrency; Decentralized Autonomous Organization; TrustChain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Price, R.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","By the end of 2019, 79.5 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide and 26 million were refugees. Over the last years migration has become an urgent political issue in Europe and more people are moving and crossing country borders due to wars, poverty and political instability. Migration is currently one of the main driving forces in conflict that increases the tension between communities and countries’ international relations. The refugee crisis has been shaping the political discourse in Europe since the peaceful place refugees were expecting to find when crossing European borders changed to a Eurocentric reality where refugees are seen as a problem affecting the European systems and their stability. This project dives into how the European society thinks and relates to migration and how it affects refugees’ social integration. How will European cities facilitate refugees' social integration in the European cultural identity of 2030? The focus on the integration domain of Social Connection provides the understanding of the relationships between refugees and the host communities in which they are being hosted. <br/>Furthermore, this project aims to understand how the clash between cultures and civilizations will transform the Europe of 2030 and influence the future of migration. The definition of the European context in 10 years from now is supported by the ViP (Vision in Product Design) methodology and its different stages. ViP provides a vision on the context of the future world and a frame of reference for future design interventions. A framework was developed in order to understand how refugees will behave inside this future world. The framework helped to translate the complex domain of migration into a tangible reference by breaking it into nine different directions and types of situations perceived by refugees when arriving in a host country. The direction chosen focuses on the facilitation of the social connections between refugees and host communities in order to break misconceptions and build a more positive and welcoming narrative. This direction removes a non-physical barrier that is preventing refugees to integrate by disrupting current narratives and perceptions and making the transition from refugees to humans where refugees move away from a position where they are perceived as a vulnerable group to a position of strength. A final design intervention was developed as a trigger that instigates critical thinking amongst the host society in order to reformulate misconceptions. A program provided by municipalities was designed with the aim of introducing refugees into the social space of local communities, delivering social connections and increasing community cohesion by encouraging conversations and face-to-face interactions between refugees and host communities at the local markets. The program gives refugees access to capital in order to produce and sell products based on their cultural background. By reverting the way businesses have been done, the concept of profit takes a new shape and morphs into building refugees’ social network inside local communities.","Migration; Social Polarization; Socio-Political Stagnation; Europe; Refugees; Vision in Product Design; Social Connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is researched if the addition of a wave prediction system can improve the ART’s performance. As the seakeeping of the SOV is most important for the installed motion compensated gangway, the workability is assessed for different control methods based on the design criteria of the gangway. The computations have been made in frequency domain. A one directional model is used with two degrees of freedom: the ship roll angle and the tank’s fluid angle. Due to the presence of a wave prediction system, a feed forward loop can be introduced in the control system. It is found that if the pump moment leads the wave excitation moment, the tank’s fluid will oscillate in a less power demanding way. This is caused by the better interaction of the action and reaction forces that are caused by the pump. The action force on the ship’s structure will always oppose the wave moment, but the force acting on the tank’s fluid will only stabilise the vessel at certain frequencies. To obtain a robust model, the feed forward loop is combined with a feedback controlled model. The stability of the models’ feedback loop is assessed using Nyquist plots and sensitivity plots. It is found that for the damping factor belonging to the ART of the SOV, the feedback loop is unconditionally stable. On topic of the powers related to the active ART the dissipated and actual power are analysed. Based on the dissipated powers it is found that for the same amount of dissipated power by the pump, the feed forward controlled model causes a lower root mean square value of the ship’s roll in comparison with the feedback controlled model. This is explained by the better interaction of the forces generated by the pump. Based on the obtained RAO for the roll motion, the workability of the SOV is assessed for a significant wave height of 3m. It is found that even though the seakeeping of the vessel increases because the roll response decreases, the gangway motions aren’t significantly affected by the active control of the ART. The reduction in roll response is not proportional to the reduction of the gangway motions since other vessel motions such as heave and sway also effect the gangway’s motions. All in all, it is concluded that adding a feed forward loop to a feedback controlled model improves the seakeeping of the SOV. However, to improve the workability of the SOV it is recommended to include a passive ART in the design, instead of an active ART. This is because the active control has little impact on the gangway’s motions compared to the passive ART.","Workability; Anti-roll tank; Seakeeping; Frequency domain; ART; Roll damping; Service Operation Vessel; Motion compensated gangway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-19","","","","","",""

The present method tracks progress of the manufacturing engineering phase based on how much mass is designed with respect to the design weight of the equipment. This so-called mass curves are used and fitted to an S-curve and represent the tracked progress. It is shown that the fitted mass curves represent the progress of the engineering phase with a systematic average error of 25 days. Additionally, mass data retrieved from completed projects are used to predict the S-curves shape of the ongoing project. The weighted average of tracked and Predicted S-curves is then used in a Monte Carlo simulation in order to estimate the progress of the ongoing project. The method was found to have a tracking accuracy of 0:6 4%, which translates into an uncertainty on the project duration and therefore on the equipment delivery date, by 2 weeks. This uncertainty is found to be the upper bound of typical grace periods agreed with most clients.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Facial emotion recognition from thermal images has gained more attention in recent years. Thermal cameras capture the heat emitted by objects and therefore thermal images are not sensitive to illumination changes. Furthermore, changes in temperature can indicate emotions and it is harder for humans to fake emotions in front of a thermal camera. However, a limitation is that, thermal cameras that capture high-resolution images are expensive, and cheaper thermal cameras often capture images with a low-resolution and/or contaminated with noise and blur. Besides, low-resolution thermal images can also arise when images are captured from a far distance or from moving persons. When using these low-resolution thermal images for facial emotion recognition this can negatively influence the emotion classification accuracy. To tackle the problem of low-resolution thermal facial expression images, super-resolution can be used. In this exploratory work, we propose the Thermal Face Super-Resolution Network (TFSRNet) and the Thermal Face Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (TFSRGAN) to recover high-resolution thermal facial expression images from low-resolution thermal facial expression images, with the goal to use the super-resolved images for thermal facial emotion recognition. The architecture TFSRNet is optimized to minimize the mean squared error (MSE), which results in images with a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). However, these images often contain an unsatisfying perceptual quality. To generate high-resolution images with a high perceptual quality we propose TFSRGAN. Both architectures use facial prior knowledge, such as facial landmark heatmaps and parsing maps, to enhance low-resolution thermal facial expression images. To emphasize the most important parts of each facial expression and to suppress irrelevant facial parts, we integrate the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) in both super-resolution architectures. The proposed super-resolution architectures are used to enhance low-resolution thermal facial expression images, which are obtained with three different degradation models, namely bi-cubic down-sampling (BI) on scale x2, x3 and x4, blurring followed by bi-cubic down-sampling (BD) on scale x3 and bi-cubic down-sampling followed by adding noise (DN) on scale x3. With an ablation study, the effectiveness of using facial prior knowledge and the attention mechanism CBAM for thermal super-resolution is shown. When using facial prior knowledge and the attention mechanism CBAM, the image quality of the super-resolved images improves. Furthermore, experiments show that images enhanced by TFSRNet outperform bi-cubic interpolated images, for degradation models BI x4, BD x3 and DN x3. Using these super-resolved images for thermal facial emotion recognition also leads to an increase of the emotion classification accuracy. In addition, images enhanced by TFSRGAN outperform bi-cubic interpolated images for degradation model DN x3. Although, this an exploratory work containing limitations, the experiments show the effectiveness of using facial prior knowledge and the attention mechanism CBAM for thermal facial expression super-resolution. In addition, thermal face super-resolution shows promising results for thermal facial emotion recognition where future work can build upon.","super-resolution; thermal images; facial emotion recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying Q&amp;P treatments to martensitic stainless steels with the aim to create stainless steels with the mechanical properties of Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS). The development of Q&amp;P stainless steels for lightweight structural applications could be a game changer for the automotive industry. The application of Q&amp;P stainless steels can increase the service life of a car, reduce maintenance cost and contribute to lowering CO2 emissions. In this thesis, Q&amp;P treatments with varying quenching temperatures were applied to two novel stainless steel alloys with composition 0.2C-0.35Si-0.7Mn-12.5Cr and 0.2C-0.35Si-3.0Mn-12.5Cr. The effect of quenching temperature and Mn content on the microstructure development was investigated using dilatometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) and phase field simulations. It was found that Mn addition lowers the optimal quenching temperature and increases the maximum retained austenite fraction that can be obtained by Q&amp;P treatment. Austenite phase fractions of approximately 0.22 and 0.3 were stabilized in the microstructures of the low-Mn and the high-Mn alloy, respectively. The carbon concentration of retained austenite increases with decreasing quenching temperature but is much lower than expected from the full partitioning assumption. The non-uniform distribution of primary martensite and untransformed austenite as well as carbide precipitation was seen as a means by which austenite enrichment and retention are reduced. Additionally, results from this study indicate that segregation of Mn and Cr affects the local Ms temperature and causes microstructural banding of primary martensite which leads to a non-uniform retained austenite distribution in the final microstructure.","quenching and partitioning; martensitic stainless steel; retained austenite; EBSD; manganese; microstructural banding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the OpenSim platform, a single upper-extremity model with closed-loop kinematics is available: the thoracoscapular shoulder model (TSM), which only includes muscle-elements crossing the shoulder-girdle, omitting upper-extremity musculature partially. OpenSim's native algorithms for subject-specific scaling of geometric- and muscle-length parameters function insufficiently for upper-extremity models, whilst inertial- and muscle-strength parameters are rarely scaled. Subject-specific models are impossible to validate in vivo, whilst indirect validation methods are limited. The goal of this study is to enable future OpenSim users to perform muscle-driven simulations with adequately scaled, subject-specific upper-extremity models. This study develops: (1) A generic model with the closed-loop kinematic structure of the TSM and all upper-extremity musculature; the thoracoscapular Delft shoulder and elbow model (TDSEM). (2) Subject-specific scaling tools for the TSM and TDSEM, performing geometric- and muscle-length parameter scaling based on optimization procedures, and inertial- and muscle-strength scaling based on a total muscle-volume estimation. (3) A method to estimate maximum isometric directional force at an end-effector with subject-specific models to indirectly validate the maximum force-generating capacity of these models. Geometric scaling accuracy is mainly limited by the accuracy of marker-data used. Both the TSM and TDSEM reached the desired RMS marker-error of ≤2cm and an average segmental-length error of ≤5%. Muscle-length parameter optimization fit is comparable to, or better than, studies employing similar algorithms. Scaled muscle-strength-, and inertial parameters are not validated, but the accuracy of the muscle-volume estimates they are derived from was known beforehand. The indirect validation method is not able to make estimations within ±10% of measured maximum forces. The method greatly overestimates measured values, regardless of the subject modelled or model used. Including upper-extremity musculature in the TDSEM results in improved muscle-driven analyses compared to the TSM. This can be improved further by improving the accuracy of muscle-elements attached to the radius, including ligaments in the model, and using a constraint to maintain glenohumeral stability. The presented scaling methods are recommended over OpenSim's native methods when scaling the TSM or TDSEM. The indirect validation method must be improved before it can be used to inform (in)validating conclusions about subject-specific models. For this, the effect of a constrained torso, task-specific practice, and inclusion of trained subjects on measurements must be evaluated and subject pose must be recorded. When combined with the stability constraint, estimation accuracy will likely improve greatly.","OpenSim; Upper-extremity; Shoulder; Musculoskeletal Model; Subject-specific; Scaling; Muscle-tendon parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is proven reliable and can be used as a method for strength prediction. ABAQUS has been chosen as a simulation tool due to its automatic and adaptive ability for computation and the dominancy in academic research. Current WAAM components research builds WAAM models with the heat source and printing path, which took an unacceptable time (could be several days) to simulate the behavior (distortion and residual stress) for meter-scale structural WAAM steel components. A semi-analytical model, which implicitly incorporated the behavior of the WAAM material by the direct use of components' mechanical test data as the FEA inputs, can speed up the strength prediction process. This research is built with a feasible process with unique steps for predicting WAAM components' strength. First, WAAM components’ lab tests from Van Bolderen [1] have been reviewed and numerically examined before being used for designing WAAM joints , which makes the data used more reliable. Four lab tests that have been reviewed and simulated are the tensile test, the compression test, the bending test, and the buckling test. Examined material non-linearity, anisotropy of the material, and the surface roughness have been applied to predict the strength of the joints. Five aims and five actions have been set and implemented in the design of WAAM printed gridshell joints. Moment-rotational curves for three joints are presented to acquire flexural stiffnesses and moment capacities. Second, the inclusion of the defined geometrical imperfections (the surface roughness and the lack of straightness) and material imperfections (anisotropy) to get better simulation results to yield closer results to lab experiments. The surface roughness is derived from the bending test, the lack of straightness is incorporated with the failure mode found from Linear Buckling Analysis (LBA), and the anisotropy is evaluated by building orthotropic material with the young's modulus from two WAAM printing directions (transverse and longitudinal) in the elastic range. Last, the codified guidance for WAAM printed components, which are defined as shell structures in EN 1993-1-6: Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures - Part 1-6: Strength and stability of shell structures, have been implemented. From the numerical simulation of four lab experiments, the tensile test simulation results show only maximum 0.5% errors (while compared yield strength, ultimate strength, and young's modulus to the lab result). Therefore, the material non-linearity from the lab test has been correctly used in the numerical simulation. The compression test results indicate the material non-linearity used in the three-dimensional objects is valid since the compression stress-strain curve fits the tensile engineering stress-stain curve well before the yield point (0.41% of errors with the comparisons of yield strength and young's modulus). The bending test can not precisely infer the errors of derived effective thickness mainly due to the lack of friction coefficient. However, the inclusion of the effective thickness reduces the error from 22.0% to 16.8%, and limited to 16.8% when compared to the lab test results, despite the fact that the value is from assumptions. The buckling test shows large buckling load errors (35%) that might due to the hand measured lack of straightness is too less, the effective thickness derived are too thick, or the defined geometrical imperfections are too simple that can't reflect the real printed conditions, which has local geometrical imperfections and deviations. The high sensitivity of the geometrical imperfections to the buckling load has also been found out from the analysis of scale factors with buckling loads. Few fraction increase of lack of straightness (0.2% to 0.4%) leads to tens of percentage error drop (19.6%) of buckling load compared to the lab results. Examined data that have been used in the analysis of joints are material non-linearity, the anisotropy of the material (build-in orthotropic manners), and the surface roughness. The target values of the flexural stiffness and moment capacity are insensitive to the lack of straightness due to the fact that the instability of the joint does not come from the buckling effect, the WAAM printed parts are not in slender shape, and the lack of straightness is small (L/791). Three WAAM printed joints have been designed, and the strength prediction have been carried out with the joint classification. At the end of this thesis, the conclusion is that there is potential to provide reliable strength prediction of the designed WAAM joints with the use of EN 1993-1-6: Eurocode 3 as guidance for building semi-analytical models for WAAM components and joints with the lab test material data and defined imperfections for two reasons. First, the simulation results yield closer values to the lab test results with the shell analysis process in EC3. In the compression test simulation, the inclusion of the possible geometrical imperfections shape found from LBA reduces the percentage errors decrease from 52.27% to 13.75%. In the bending test simulation, the inclusion of effective thickness leads to a closer value to the lab test (from 22% to around 16.8%). In the buckling test simulation, the implementation of effective thickness for surface roughness reduces around 10% to 15% error, and the inclusion of effective thickness combined with lack of straightness reduces roughly 40% of the error. Second, the parameters are examined before being used in the strength analysis of designed WAAM joints. The material non-linearity data is proven valid in the FEA with 3D geometry in tensile test and compression test simulations. The orthotropic behavior shows a minor effect in all four numerical simulations. The surface roughness combined with the use of assumed friction coefficient and the assumed equipment properties in the bending test simulation show limited error (around 17%). However, limited errors exist and undermine the strength prediction precision due to the assumptions of lacked lab test measurements and the simplification (parameterized) imperfections from WAAM components. Therefore, It is expected that more tests and works could be made to improve the strength prediction precision of WAAM components. Also, the FEA setup of the designed joints is referred to as the gridshell joints' lab experiments, therefore, providing a methodology for possible future examination of the strength of WAAM printing joints with lab experiments.","Wire and arc Additive Manufacturing; Strength prediction; Finite Element Analysis; Mechanical Testing; Steel Joints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.0126341,4.3555860"

Solar energy technologies have become one of the world’s leading methods of producing clean, sustainable energy. However, this technology has been facing some adversities in the field of thermal management. The majority of solar modules in the commercial market are monofacial modules, for which many thermal management solutions exist. For bifacial solar modules, this field is still being researched. This, together with the fact that bifacial modules are projected to reach a 40% market share by the year 2028, prompts the need for thermal management solutions for this technology. The proposed solution is an integrated heat sink (IHS) built in a bifacial solar module. This was thoroughly researched using the multiphysics, FEM-based software COMSOL. The geometry was drawn using the COMSOL environment and a hybrid mesh was created to accommodate the module. Initial issues and computation errors led to decreasing of model dimensions. A 1 cm by 1 cm glass bifacial module was created and debugged successfully. This model was then simulated using two COMSOL studies: ’Heat Transfer in Solids’ and ’Surface-to-Surface Radiation’. All of these simulations were performed using four illumination combinations (front illumination/back illumination [W/m2]): 1000/50; 1000/100; 1000/200 and 1000/300. After successful simulations of the 1 cm by 1 cm model, the model was scaled up to a 4 by 4 (67.31 cm by 67.31 cm) glass bifacial module. The results for both the 1 cm by 1 cm module and the 4 by 4 module were promising. In the case of 1000 W/m2 front illumination and 300 W/m2 back illumination, the 1 cm by 1 cm solar cell showed a temperature drop of 0.92 degrees Celsius and a relative efficiency gain of 0.359%. The solar cells in the 4 by 4 module showed a temperature drop of 1.33 degrees Celsius and a relative efficiency gain of 0.519%. Next, temperature simulations were performed with varying IHS thickness, from 1 mm to 10 mm. Taking into consideration that with increase thickness the temperature did not reduce significantly and that the module weight was being increased, a 1 mm IHS was found to be the most beneficial. Yield calculations were performed on a 2 by 2 (34.29 cm by 34.29 cm) bifacial module, both with and without the utilization of the IHS. It was found that with the utilization of the IHS, the financial gain was 0.05 euros/m2/year. Lastly, lifetime prediction analyses were performed to receive insight on the effect of the IHS on the lifetime of a bifacial module. It was found that the lifetime gain for a bifacial module with the IHS is about 26 days, corresponding to a relative lifetime gain of 0.68%. It should be noted however, that the lifetime of a module without the IHS under the simulation conditions was 10.27 years, far below commercially reported lifetimes. This is due to a high maximum operational temperature and a large difference between the minimum and maximum operational temperature. <br/>The proposed integrated heat sink showcased positive effects in temperature management and efficiency gain in bifacial solar modules. The use of a hybrid mesh proved beneficial for the computation time and different scenarios can now be simulated. However, yield calculations only showed a very small financial gain and lifetime prediction analyses showed a very small lifetime gain. Further improvements include a design that can increase the heat transfer of the IHS, such as varying the thickness of the bottom glass layer or utilizing a transparent backsheet. The possibility of connecting the IHS to the frame of the module to further increase the heat transfer to the environment should be investigated. Also, different material options for the IHS and the addition of heat dissipation fins should also be researched.","Bifacial PV; Thermal management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-18","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Kattenberg, Kit (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The current pandemic has drastically changed the primary care field. Suddenly, GP practices had to implement more digital or ‘care at a distance’ methods to keep interacting with patients. This was reflected by the strong increase in telephone consults and practices that used video calling for the first time. However, the sudden digital experience is not welcomed with open arms by patients and caregivers. 47% of the patient express that they are not positive about ‘care at a distance’ modalities (Meurs, 2020b), and approximately only a quarter of caregivers want to intensify e-consultation methods after the pandemic (Keuper, 2020). It is quite likely that after this pandemic, both groups return to the previous status quo, regardless of the benefits that eHealth and e-consultation can provide. The goal of this graduation project was to increase the adoption of e-consultation in primary care together with IZER. The graduation project followed the roadmapping process, starting with an analysis consisting of a literature study, qualitative interviews, and observations. During the research, caregivers and patients were thoroughly analysed to search for trends and wishes about (digital) primary care. The major discovered trends were the need for higher efficiency in the process due to the high effort of digitalisation, the demanded shift in control to the patient, the need for accessibility for the patient, the wish for digital to support the process, and the need for good communication. The result is DagKo: the Data-driven complaint support for patients in primary care (Data-gedreven Klacht Ondersteuning). DagKo is a software service that supports patients to do their triage independently and guides them towards the best next step concerning their complaint and medical history. The service uses data from previous patients with similar situations to analyse the most efficient and effective methods in a specific situation. Additionally, new consultation options are added to enhance the right care in the right situation. These additions consist of a data-driven virtual doctor, a monitoring program and a quickly accessible doctor service. The needs and wishes of the patients and caregivers were translated into DagKo. The software provides increased accessibility and control for the patients. It is an app that listens carefully to the user and gives options for the best suitable care. Because of the smart use of data, caregivers will be supported with suitable advice during their triage. Caregivers just have to confirm the suggested modality. This will result in an increase in efficiency for the caregivers, letting them give more attention to patients that need it by spending less time on simple situations. During the user-testing, patients experienced the two characteristics of the concept, the option to choose and data-driven advice based on effectiveness and efficiency, as positive. The additional modalities were ranked relatively positively, but due to the futuristic aspects were also harder to grasp. Caregivers also expressed support for the concept of DagKo. The caregiver acknowledged the potential of the gain in efficiency and it was recognized that the service is especially useful for filtering easier complaints.","Primary care; General practitioner; Medical decision support system; Patient; Patient-centred; Healthcare Design; Patient journey; Caregiver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Haffner, M.E.A. (graduation committee); Boumeester, H.J.F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to several factors, under which the widespread flexibilization in the job market and the fact that it ended up becoming more difficult to take out a mortgage, middle-income households ended up not having access to owner-occupied housing in Dutch urban areas. Also, middle-income households’ incomes are too high to qualify for the social housing segment. Therefore, they depend on private rental housing in the Randstad. However, there is a shortage of private rental housing. Due to this lack of private rental housing, rental housing prices have increased tremendously. And this occurred while households’ incomes have not been rising to the same extent. Furthermore, organisations that rely on key workers have a more difficult time finding employees in urban areas. Middle-income households, including the households that can potentially fill up these vacancies, are often forced to move to other areas to find housing that fits their preferences. Therefore, it is essential to gain knowledge of how private rental housing for middle-income households can become affordable. Having knowledge of housing affordability in relation to housing preferences is vital to understand how the private rental housing supply for middle-income households can be increased and preserved in urban areas. Therefore, this research seeks to answer: “How can the rental housing supply in urban areas in the Netherlands, that is affordable for middle-income households, be increased following their preferences?” With this research question posed, the research aims to provide insight into middle-income households' housing affordability. It also aims to present the middle-income households’ rental housing preferences. To reach this aim, the methodology applied in this research is a mixed-method with an embedded design. This research made use of the WoON 2018 data and the semi-structured interview method. To conclude, the findings of this research were validated by an expert panel. The comprehensive quantitative research, regarding what middle-income’s housing preferences are, demonstrated that these preferences are not sufficiently affordably facilitated in Groot-Amsterdam. Delving into these results together with the qualitative research, this study determined what instruments could be used to increase and preserve the affordable rental housing supply for middle-income households following their housing preferences. This research evinced that in Groot-Amsterdam, housing with five rooms is not sufficiently facilitated in the mid-segment rental housing supply. Additionally, for the couple, couple-one-child, couple-two-children, couple-three-children, and one-parent-three-children households earning a gross annual income near €36,798, mid-segment rental housing is not affordable. In order to provide affordable housing for all middle-income households, the central government should assume a more active role in steering toward increasing the mid-segment rental housing supply. Thereby, they should enlarge the housing associations’ playing field. Furthermore, they should limit their role to spatial planning, providing infrastructure, and providing monetary means. Next to that, there should be a balance between municipal demands on development programmes and land prices. Together, the municipality and market actors should determine the demands of the development programme. An independent third party should calculate the residual land value.","housing preferences; private rental housing; housing affordability; the Randstad; Groot-Amsterdam; middle-income households; steering instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Giuffré, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The use of centrifugal compressors is widespread in many different industrial applications, namely refrigeration cycles, oil and gas rotating equipments, automotive turbochargers and small aero-engines. Compared to their axial counterpart, centrifugal compressors can provide the same compression ratio within less compression stages, trading-off efficiency with compactness. Current development in this sector involves the tuning of design process to accommodate analysis of turbomachinery operating with non-conventional working fluids that exhibit non-ideal fluid-dynamic behaviour. However, best practices for the preliminary design of centrifugal compressors still rely on the perfect gas assumption. On the other hand, the improvement of the preliminary design tools may result in significant reduction of time and resources spent during the detailed design step by leveraging Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In this scenario, the present research aims to devise guidelines for the preliminary design of centrifugal compressors operating with non-ideal compressible flows by assessing the performance limits of the machine using a meanline design framework, coupled, where possible, to physics-based loss models. Loss models derived from first principles are preferred to semi-empirical loss correlations as they require less tuning with machine-specific (thus, also working fluid-specific) experimental data. In this work, two major loss sources, namely the blade boundary layer loss and the tip leakage loss, are analyzed in detail. For both loss mechanisms, the physics-based loss model are derived, and their results are compared to CFD results to check their validity and accuracy. Due to time constraints, the remaining loss sources are modelled using semi-empirical correlations available in literature. The outcome of this work are design maps for centrifugal compressors operating with different working fluids and thermodynamic conditions, which highlight the impact of non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD) on the optimum design region as well as the maximum theoretical stage efficiency. The novel framework could be further extended and replace the traditional design guidelines based on the perfect gas assumption, aiming to improve compressor preliminary design and contribute to the development of next-generation high-performance turbomachinery.","meanline design; centrifugal compressor; physics-based loss models; NICFD; performance limit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The increasing world population requires more food, and the food needs to be of a higher standard. Currently, the increase and high quality food production by farming are becoming difficult due to more inconsistency of the climate. Plant breed companies use old-fashioned science in their attempts to overcome the agriculture challenges. For plant breeding, multiple plants are combined to develop a plant crop with desired characteristics that can withstand to the environmental challenges, produce high quality crops and provide the production volumes according to the required specifications. If such a crop is developed using breeding, a batch of plant seeds will be produced to sell the plant seeds all over the world. Two main problems do come from breeding and production of these newly developed crops, firstly breeders need information about the plants for efficient plant breeding, and secondly, the quality of the produced plant seeds has to be ensured. The quality of the plant seeds is an important factor to sell the produced plant seeds over the world to growers and farmers. To ensure the quality of the seeds, phenotype experts obtain the information and perform quality assessments of the seeds and grown plants. To obtain information on plants, the experts use plant phenotyping in which the characteristics of the plant are described and evaluated. The evaluation of the plant characteristics provides a quality assessment of the batch of produced plant seeds. The quality assessment is done by growing the plant seed to seedlings and compare the grown seedlings with each other. The visual comparison between the seedlings is used to give a quality label to the produced batch of seeds. At the moment this visualization and subjective comparison of seedlings is the state of the art. Experts did not believe it is possible to assess the seedlings otherwise. To move away from the subjective approach, Rijk Zwaan BV is looking into more objective measurement systems to obtain plant information. The objective plant information of the seedlings provides solutions of objectively assessing quality and inform plant breeders with extra information making the plant breeding process more efficient. In this study, the feasibility of a digital phenotyping system able to give plant information and a quality assessment of the seedlings was examined. To show the possibilities of the system a model of a digital seedling quality system was developed. By applying the literature of plant phenotyping systems, a phenotype and quality assessment data pipeline were established. The data pipeline was developed to be understandable and transparent for the experts to ensure acceptance of a digital system. The plant phenotype pipeline consists out of multiple components. Each component of the plant phenotype data pipeline has been developed to form the seedling quality system model. The developed model is called SeeQS (Seedling Quality System) and is able to seek out the quality of the seedlings and provide phenotype information of the seedlings. SeeQS was evaluated using multiple samples of pepper seedlings to show the performance and capabilities of a digital phenotyping-based quality system. The system performance shows to be very capable and accurate to assess the quality of seedlings and give plant measurements. The model shows that it is possible to assess the quality of seedlings using a digital phenotyping-based system. Due to the transparency of the developed model, the experts understand the versatility of the digital system. Now, the phenotype experts accept the possibility of a digital system to obtain plant information and give a quality assessment. Due to these positive results, the company wants to continue with the development and implementation of a digital seedling quality and phenotyping system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-03-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The intermodal freight relies on the use of standardized containers for this transport. All empty containers need to be shipped back to the areas where there is a demand for empty containers. Since a standard container is the shame shape, independent of whether it is loaded or empty, all nodes in the intermodal system have a significant portion of empty container moves. Holland Container Innovations saw a solution to this problem of empty container repositioning, in the form of a 40ft foldable container, which can save on relocation costs of empty containers. HCI wants to expand its portfolio with a 20ft foldable design as well. Therefore, in this report the design process for the design of a viable 20ft foldable container is described. The end result of this project will be a concept that is adaptable to a full commercial design. The same folding method of the 40ft design is applied to the 20ft design, since it has already been proven to be viable. In addition, this opens up possibilities for synergies between the 20ft and 40ft design, as well as faster acceptation by other stakeholders, due to similarity with the already proven design. A critical design problem for applying the 4fold design to the 20ft container is the folded container height. The new 20ft design needs to meet a five to one bundle size, meaning that the folded container needs to be one fifth the height of a normal container. The height reduction requirements let to several dimensional design problems in which the design needed to be altered in order to house the parts needed for the folding process. A number of components were redesigned to fulfil the height requirements. After solving the spatial design problems, the 20ft foldable design was evaluated based on the ISO requirements. Initial hand calculations and FEM analysis of critical components have shown that the design fulfils the ISO load cases, as well as the operational requirements outlined by HCI For further development of the 20ft foldable container, the design can be made lighter to reduce the margin of error, and in turn allow for a reduction in material to be used, by performing a full FEM analysis. Although the weight and cost requirements have passed for this design, improvements in these values will always benefit the viability of the design.","design based research; Concept Design; Container","en","master thesis","","","","","","Thesis is a detailed design of a foldable container and as such contains some commercial value","","2026-03-18","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

We investigated the parameters that influence vibration and transient phenomena in pipelines and more specifically in sea outfalls and we studied the pressure response in time and frequency domain. In a first step, we defined a typical pipe to be studied in our experiments. Then we adapted an open-source MATLAB MOC code that runs simulations to our typical pipeline with several outlet conditions. The code was compared and validated with Allievi software in a tank-pipe-valve-tank system to simulate water hammer and verifying the code that we adapted. Finally, we included a coastal wave spectrum in the code to simulate sea waves at the pipe's outlet. With this project, we showed the link between resonance frequencies for the three first mode of vibration in function of several input parameters and the location of the pressure peaks within the pipe and the levels of pressure at resonance. The peak frequencies inside the pipe can be as large as 95 times the excitation pressure.","Fluid dynamics; methods of characteristics; MATLAB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.0126341,4.3555860"

With the global sustainability ambitions, new technologies and innovations have been in development by a vast amount of parties. Electric aviation is one of these innovations within the developing sustainable aviation industry. Therefore, the scope of the project revolves around electric aviation, executed in collaboration with Royal Schiphol Group (RSG) and its Innovation Hub department. The Innovation Hub's main role within RSG is to provide research and set in motion radical innovations to be implemented, of which Sustainable Aviation. The research questions within the scope are therefore defined as follows: What are the current developments in the electric aviation industry? And how can RSG facilitate the transition towards sustainable aviation within the aviation industry?Geels' (2002) system transition theory serves as the foundation for the research approach, structuring the thesis in two phases accordingly to the research questions which define the scope; research and concept phase (figure 0). Within the research phase, the landscape drivers have been analysed, depicting a sustainability pull through global sustainability ambitions and a technology push through the developments in the battery technology. With these developments, multiple niche innovations have emerged over the past years, consequently making electric aviation feasible for specific use cases. The most prominent parties developing these niche innovations are Heart Aerospace, developing a 19 passenger electric aircraft with a range of 400 km, and Eviation Alice, developing a 9 passenger electric aircraft with a range of 815 km. The socio-technical (ST) system transition towards sustainable aviation is the goal of electric aviation. This transition is enabled by the interaction of technology and people. Based on this, the landscape cultural trends have been analysed and used as a basis for the comparison of the use of modalities within the mobility industry. Thus, deriving a potential ideal use case for electric aviation of 300-400 km, potentially increasing in range depending on the battery developments in the future. The current expectation is that batteries increase in energy density from 260 Wh/kg to 600 Wh/kg by the end of the decade. This range is the foundation for the entry use case, the concept of the thesis. The range of 300-400 km is one of six metrics used to develop the entry use case. The others are passenger substitution potential, network potential, location in the Netherlands, innovation resources and viral factor. In line with RSG its values, network potential has been the deciding factors when choosing the entry use case, with other potential entry use cases available when altering the deciding factor. This entry use case is between Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm, as this has both a high passenger substitution potential with a critical strategic motive. Scandinavia aims to implement electric aviation on their airports, enabling a higher certainty and willingness to collaborate towards the development and implementation of electric aviation. With this entry use case, several bottlenecks emerge. As a pioneer in the sustainable aviation industry, RSG has a seven step plan to overcome these bottlenecks, of which creating a coalition of industry stakeholders collaborating in researching and developing the electric aviation industry. With this actionable plan, RSG has the ability to accelerate the transition towards a sustainable aviation industry, as well as progress in the research for the implementation of electric aviation.","Innovation Management; System; Strategic; Entry use case; Socio-technical system; Socio-technical transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A previously proposed model, the ‘supervisory control algorithm’, describes human adaptive behavior using binary decision moments at specific decision region limits of the error and error rate signal. This model was assessed using a compensatory pitch tracking task with sudden variations in controlled element dynamics. An experiment was conducted with six participants in a fixed-base simulator at Delft University of Technology. During the runs the participants had to perform the tracking task as accurately as possible and had to indicate detected controlled element dynamics transitions by pressing a button. The results indicate that the original decision region limits from the supervisory control algorithm do not apply to the way human operators adapt in the set-up of this experiment. From the button press data only one percent yielded a result in compliance with the algorithm, demonstrating the large discrepancy between these decision regions and the actual human detection limits in this experiment task. A final analysis is performed using a detection method based on deviations in statistical properties of pre-transitional tracking. This method demonstrated simulation results close to realistic values with a detection threshold around four times the standard deviations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-03-17","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tummers, M.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the growing energy demand and global warming renewable energy is currently of interest. To deal with the production intermittency of renewable energy, energy might be stored in hydrogen. Hydrogen can be converted into electricity with a fuel cell or by combusting hydrogen in a gas turbine. Gas turbines are more suitable for large power outputs. Large power outputs require large volumetric flow rate through the gas turbine. The large volumetric flow rate causes high gas velocities and results in a turbulent flow. Using hydrogen instead of natural gas as energy resource changes the stable operating regime and increases flame flashback propensity. Current studies done at the Technical University of Munich and the Technical University of Delft suggest flame confinement, burner wall temperature and velocity fluctuations are vital to the flashback process. Des-pite the recent studies flashback is yet not completely understood. \\ This research focuses on premixed turbulent hydrogen and hydrocarbon combustion to further investigate the possibilities of using hydrogen in a gas turbine. The aim of this research is to gain more insight in the flashback process by varying velocity fluctuations while keeping the bulk velocity constant. The first objective is to gain insight in the relation between bulk velocity at flashback and velocity fluctuations. The second objective is to gain insight in the relation between bulk velocity at flashback and low velocity streaks upstream the flame front. The third research objective is to gain insight in the relation between flame front, boundary layer obstruction and bulk velocity at flashback. \\ All experiments were conducted with a Bunsen burner. A screw, acting as boundary layer obstruction, was placed below the burner rim to locally disturb the flow. The influence of the local disturbance on bulk velocity at flashback was investigated by mapping flashback propensity and by examining non-reacting and reacting pipe flow with planar Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The fuel compositions studied in this research are DNG, hydrogen and mixtures containing 20, 40, 60 or 80 volumetric percentage $H_2$. \\ The flashback maps show that bulk velocity at flashback increases with obstruction height for all gas mixtures. The obstruction height is the height from burner wall to screw tip. The results obtained through the non-reacting field experiment confirmed that the flow was fully-developed and turbulent. Furthermore, the results showed that obstruction height locally increased velocity fluctuations. The average velocity downstream the obstruction slightly decreased with increasing obstruction height. The reacting field was examined during flashback and during stable operation to relate flashback propensity and time-averaged flow characteristics with statistical analysis. The results showed flame front axial distance from the burner rim decreases with increasing obstruction height, indicating that a flame produced by a burner with boundary layer obstruction is more prone to flashback. The flow characteristics just upstream the flame front were analyzed because once the conditions upstream the flame front are suitable, flashback occurs. \\ A flashback prediction model developed at the TU Munich was modified to account for the obstruction height. The modelled results indicate that, in an unconfined set-up, flashback might be described with time-averaged flow characteristics and that the turbulent burning velocity is strongly correlated to the bulk velocity at flashback. Histograms of the instantaneous velocity showed that obstruction height has no influence on low velocity streaks and thus it seems low velocity streaks are not dominant in the flashback process of premixed unconfined flames. The absence of low velocity streaks for different obstruction heights indicates that flashback of unconfined flames is a different process than flashback of confined flames.","Flashback, Hydrogen, Hydrocarbon, Turbulence, boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research approach refers to Vision in Product design (ViP), which includes exploring the domain. The context factors were gathered based on the literature, interview experts and non-experts, and observations. The research was formed in a world view, summarizing the driving forces around loneliness. The vision was formulated from the context research, including a design statement, interaction vision, and product qualities. From the research summary, loneliness can happen for a variety of reasons. However, one thing that every lonely person has is a lack of control. In contrast, a driving force that keeps a person away from being lonely is a sense of security, including self-awareness, sense of place, and belongingness. Following this insight, the design goal was to enhance people’s sense of security by giving them agency in the environment. Ideation involved creative sessions and individual brainstorming. The outcome was the Sound of a city, a sound creation tool using augmented reality, letting users create their sounds and add to their location. The design was validated through user testing of the interaction between users and the environment. In conclusion, the Sound of a city provided users a positive experience in having their personal (sound) touch in the public space. Participants agreed that this could make them bond with the places, resulting in more security. This master thesis contributed to bring some potential results in bringing sense of security to postpone the loneliness.","Loneliness; Public domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

A relatively new online participation method is Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE). It aims to facilitate mass citizen participation and to be inclusive. Everyone who wants to participate in the process should get the change to do so. At the same time PVE is an evaluation method for public policy. To be able to provide an accurate advice about the preferences of citizens regarding a set of policy options, the sample under study needs to be representative. Representativity and inclusivity seem to conflict with each other as making the research available for the public very often leads to a biased sample. The aim of this study is to examine the consequences of the trade-off between representativity and inclusivity for the usability of PVE in the policy context.","Representativity; Inclusivity; Participatory Value Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease caused by the ingestion of gluten affecting people with a genetic disposition. Gluten is a protein that can be found in wheat, rye and barley but it can also be used as protein filler in ice creams and soup. The only treatment for patients is to follow a strict gluten-free diet. Due to the restrictive nature of the diet, coeliac people have to develop new habits and routines to overcome uncomfortable situations at home and social situations. Different studies demonstrated that coeliac people are affected emotionally by social events. Coeliac people have to avoid food contained food, be aware of the gluten cross-contamination and find proper gluten-free options. This might lead to the development of anxiety and stress. This is a master report that gathers the research and the design activities to investigate how to create a safe environment for coeliac people during social events. The project was developed through converging and diverging design approaches involving remote user research, literature review and iterative cycles of ideations, development and testing. The project focused mainly on two areas: the perception of the gluten-free diet and the coping strategies or problem-solving skills used during social events. The research approach includes context research as base knowledge about coeliac disease, the challenges of the gluten-free diet, and coping strategies. The user research involved coeliac people to lead the development of a solution that would embrace their needs and values. At the end of the user research, a Framework was developed to describe the context of the social events for coeliac people. The design goal of the project was identified as the project aims to enhance the feeling of security for coeliac people by increasing empathy and decreasing negative emotions. Different concepts were developed according to iterative conceptualizations and evaluation tests of low fidelity prototypes with participants. The insights gathered helped to generate a final concept. The final concept is an event planner app that gives information about how to create a safe environment for coeliac people and more. The final user tests have been conducted in part in person and part remotely with participants who evaluated the possibility to create a safe environment and create empathy. The results demonstrated that by using the final concept it is possible to generate a safe environment and generate empathy. Participants had the possibility to immerse themselves in the challenges that coeliac people face daily. Coeliac people indeed felt to be secure cause people would have the correct information about the preparation of the environment and gluten-free food.","Coeliac Disease; Interaction; design for safety; social events","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Rodenburg, Freek (mentor); Aalbers, Kees (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The size of vessels has increased significantly over the last decades and will increase even further in the decades to come. This trend is mainly visible in the size of container ships. A decade ago the largest container ship had a capacity of 13.500 TEU, nowadays the largest container ship has a capacity of almost 24.000 TEU. The capacity of the largest container ship has almost doubled in only one decade. Due to their increasing size, vessels tend to become more flexible and their structural natural frequencies move towards the range of typical wave frequencies. Excitation of these structural modes will lead to resonant hull vibrations. The traditional method to determine wave loads and the response of vessels due to these wave loads is based on the assumption that the vessel acts as a rigid body. For large vessels, which tend to be more flexible, this is not a reliable method. A method is required that takes into account the fluid-structure interaction, which is in this case called hydroelasticity. The most used method to approach hydroelasticity is based on modal decomposition and was first established by Bishop \&amp; Price in 1979. Since then, this method has been developed into commercial software and is nowadays accessible to the industry. However, the currently available commercial software is limited to first order hydroelasticity. Larger vessels become more flexible, but even the largest vessels still have their first structural natural frequency above the range of typical wave frequencies. It is thus very unlikely that first order theory can explain the excitation of these structural modes. However, several evidences of resonance around the wet natural frequencies have been reported. The structural modes could be excited by second order wave loads. Second order wave loads contain sum-frequency terms that occur at higher frequencies than the encountered wave frequencies. These second order wave loads have been considered for elastic bodies by including these loads in the method based on modal decomposition. It is expected that the second order hydroelastic response has a significant contribution to the total response for very large vessels. Pioneering Spirit is currently the largest construction vessel in the world. The vessel is designed for the single-lift installation and removal of large oil and gas platforms. A correct prediction of the response of this vessel requires a hydroelastic analysis. The vessel has its structural natural frequencies far above the range of expected wave frequencies, but evidences of resonance around the wet natural frequencies have been reported for this vessel. This research focuses on explaining the observed response by considering second order wave loads. The second order hydroelastic response is obtained with the method based on modal decomposition with a non-commercial version of Hydrostar. It was found that the second order wave loads cause the observed high-frequent response of the vessel. The main disadvantage of this method is that the second order hydroelastic response can not be computed with the use of commercial software. This makes it impossible to predict the hydroelastic response of the vessel in the future for different drafts and loading conditions. An alternative method is proposed to overcome this problem. This method is based on multi-body dynamics. The advantage of this method is that there is commercial software that can obtain second order wave loads for multiple interacting bodies. A multi-body model is created for Pioneering Spirit by dividing the vessel into a number of rigid bodies. These bodies are connected to each other by beam elements. The linear transfer functions obtained with this method are compared to the ones obtained with modal decomposition and show good agreement. This multi-body model is then used to obtain the second order hydroelastic response of the vessel by calculating the second order wave loads and substituting these loads in the equation of motion. The second order hydroelastic response shows very little resemblance with the method based on modal decomposition and with the measured response. It is found that in the calculated second order wave loads, a part of the second order wave loads is missing. This part has a significant contribution to the sum-frequency terms of the second order wave loads according to a number of studies. Taking into account this missing part should lead to a more accurate approximation of the second order wave loads and eventually to a more accurate approximation of the second order hydroelastic response obtained with multi-body dynamics.","Hydroelasticity; Modal decomposition; multi-body dynamics; Springing; fluid-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); van Erp, J. (graduation committee); de Jong, P.L.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">For the fashion industry, 2020 was a year of change. As the covid-19 pandemic ravaged the world, the industry suffered its worst year on record (Business of Fashion, 2021). Consumer behaviour shifted, and supply chains were disrupted. The industry had to rethink their business and define the 'new normal', which meant adapting to trends and focusing on digital solutions.   One of the solutions could be digital fashion. Digital fashion is computer-generated fashion that can be worn with your digital bodies - avatars - and with physical bodies by using AR technology. PVH, a global apparel company that manages lifestyle brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, has identified digital fashion as an opportunity for new digital products/services or digital ventures and is looking to use it in innovations that 'Win over Gen-Z' and 'Commit to Sustainability'.   The aim of this research is to provide Area52 with a recommendation for how to pursue digital fashion innovation within the coming ten years in the form of a future vision and a strategic roadmap. Extensive literature review and multiple generative research methodologies like focus groups, semi-structured interviews and co-creation sessions were used to empathize with all stakeholders. Subsequently, various elements of Vision in Product design (Hekkert &amp; Van Dijk, 2011) and Design Roadmapping (Simonse et al., 2015) were used to synthesize the insights into a set of recommendations that are structured in a why-how-what format.  Why? In our envisioned future, Gen Z are identity nomads that want to be unique and continuously develop and discover new sides of their identity through the fashion they wear. They would prefer to have an endless wardrobe with which they can try something new every day. However, the environmental impact and cost hold them back. In the on-demand and augmented society that the world is heading towards, this problem can be answered with the future vision: In 2030, augmented fashion will be the ethical means for Gen Z to express and stretch their identity through instant experimentation.  How? In the stated vision, digital fashion changes the interaction between consumers and brands from a one-way stream to an infinite interaction loop. Tommy Hilfiger facilitates the continuous discovery of the identities a person wants to identify with. Consumers can explore and experiment with digital styles in the physical domain using AR technology endlessly. In turn, Tommy Hilfiger perfects their consumer profile with the data they receive.   To arrive at the future vision, I propose a three-horizon approach for Tommy Hilfiger:  H1 Enhance physical fashion H2 Build blocks for phygital fashion H3 Instant experiments with augmented ethical fashion  What? Based on the roadmap, future vision and brand-user interaction, the desired product-user interaction is defined in the form of guiding principles. The principles state that Tommy Hilfiger's digital fashion solutions should foster experimentation in a way that: (1) Is Playful, (2) Is Dynamic and Iterative, (3) Offers Interesting Variety, (4) Is Accessible, and (5) Enables Feedback.  The way these principles can be put to practice in product or service designs is demonstrated in the final vision concept 'Anywear'. Anywear is a 2030 platform that connects style-influencers to people who want to experiment with new identities. Through a subscription model, users get access to an infinite digital wardrobe that they can use across the entire phygital environment. It gamifies fashion and guarantees newness by monetizing success for creators.    The concept provides Tommy Hilfiger with: Insight into how their products are styled, New inspiration for designs, Customer engagement, Data on consumer personality, preferences, community and possibly even activities, based on the fashion they choose to augment.      ","Fashion; Strategy; Digital; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

For such a forecasting task, if we know beforehand which system metrics are predictable then we can easily build good models. Quantifying the predictability of cloud metrics can help us rank the available system metrics and select a subset of cloud metrics with the lowest complexity. Moreover, storing informative metrics for a longer period can result in better forecasting. This thesis presents a novel entropy method for quantifying the complexity of time series: Reverse weighted Dispersion Entropy (RWDE). We also present an exploratory study to understand and quantify the complexity of cloud metrics. This exploratory case study has been carried out at ING, a large banking company with in-house cloud architecture. We perform simulation experiments on simulated signals to compare RWDE with other entropy methods. We apply RWDE on cloud metric data from ING to approximate the predictability of these cloud metrics. The experimental results show that RWDE has better performance than other entropy methods and can be used to select informative cloud metrics for a forecasting task. Further, we establish a relationship between RWDE and model-based predictability of cloud metrics. For each cloud metric, we compare RWDE with predictions from various forecasting models. Our results show that this relationship can be used as a heuristic by practitioners to identify unsuitable forecasting models for certain cloud metrics. We make RWDE and other entropy methods discussed in this study available as an open-source Python package.","Entropy; Cloud Metrics; Time Series; predictability; Complexity; System Metrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Asset managers of the dikes increase the inspection frequency in times of drought to be able to monitor these cracks. Significant development of the cracks contributes to the development of different failure mechanisms. In this study, the occurrence of the cracks is predicted at a large spatial scale. An inspection database in which the observations from the last three years are stored is used as the basis. The database contains hundreds of observed cracks including the location and time in which they were observed. The database was extended with attributes such as the precipitation deficit, the peat width at the surface, the orientation of the dike body, the subsidence of the dike body and the soil stiffness. Decision tree algorithms were then used to classify which circumstances will lead to cracks and which circumstances will not. From the resulting decision trees it was deduced that high precipitation deficits, low soil stiffness and the peat width can be used as the main predictors for the occurrence of cracks. Both subsidence of the foundation and the dike body being orientated to the sunny side are also contributors, although less prominent. Time-independent cracking criteria were then used to classify which regions are prone to cracking. Dikes which are rich in peat with a low stiffness were thus highlighted. The Mathews correlation coefficient was used as performance criteria resulting in a 0.3 value for the obtained tree. Application of a random forest increased the coefficient to 0.8. An important conclusion is that proper monitoring of the peat width, soil stiffness and precipitation deficit may result in better asset management. On behalf of more classification validity, it is advised to register negatives during inspections as well. Besides, making a clear distinction between drought-induced cracks and cracks due to macro-instability will reduce the likeliness of the model predicting cracks not related to drought.","Machine Learning; Flood Risk; Drought; Asset Management; Dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This project is executed with and for the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) of the TU Delft. Over the last half-century, IDE’s education for designers has diversified and evolved considerably, in part of art academies and technical education (Voûte et al., 2020). Societal changes, the maturing of design as an academic discipline between science and engineering and international developments of the educational system, have stimulated this growth. Now the faculty is innovating its education again. After innovating the Bachelor, the faculty is starting to look at opportunities to innovate the Master program. The initial assignment of this thesis originated from two observations: the broadening role of the designer and the changing learning behavior of students. The initial assignment includes the investigation of learning experiences that respond to the combination of the two, to investigate opportunities for IDE: design and education. However, innovating in the educational sector is something that is time consuming, with many people involved. And while investigating these new opportunities, the world outside the walls of the faculty is changing constantly by changing much quicker than we think.Based on the research of the context, it appeared that IDE, despite their high-quality education, can already see challenge in keeping its relevancy as well its position as a leader in the education for designers. This is influenced by their limited role in multidisciplinary projects, how to respond to the digital world and the broadening role of the design profession in the working field. Hence, the research question for this thesis is formulated following: What learning experiences are seen as most valuable when entering the world outside IDE and contribute to the preparation of the MSc. student? After the deconstruction of the current context, the future context of both fields of design and education is investigated with the aid of the ViP approach where “opportunities of the future” are investigated. This resulted into a two-dimensional framework, that guides as the future view of the education of the designer that was evaluated with the core competencies of design to investigate the value of possible directions that resulted into the design focus. That consisted of three different design visions resulting in three different design directions including a statement, interaction vision and experience qualities. Within the interaction visions, the relationship between an IDE student and its education were designed. Three learning experience concepts were developed and combined into a whole new Master experience of IDE that transforms the traditional structure. In short, the new Master experience includes learning experiences that focus on the individual in the whole (1), creating reciprocal learning relations (2) and aims to increase the value of designers in multidisciplinary teams (3). As this learning experience is designed from an envisioned future, supported by extensive stakeholder research and the student’s needs, it would contribute to Master innovation by offering these learning experiences that are perceived as valuable in the transformation from design student to a design professional. Also, a first validation round is held over the whole Master experience including the learning experience concepts, where the experiences were critically but positively validated. The developed final experience next to additional learnings in this thesis derived from exploring the future, made that focusing on preparing design students to work with other disciplines equally and going beyond the traditional design discipline of IDE, should be main concerns of the faculty. The design process of this thesis puts light on designing the initial interaction between students and IDE, that resulted in more recommendations. This included a focus on the wellbeing of the design student next to the future role of educators as things to take highly into account when innovating in the design education of IDE.","Design education; Experience design; ViP; Future visioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This challenge also provides the opportunity to develop new concepts. The promising concept described in this report involves the application of UHPC to redesign the decks of existing concrete bridges in combination with the reuse of existing foundations. The Twentekanaal was selected as the topic of the project, because it comprises many bridges of which various have similar characteristics and were built in the same period. Not all bridges could be considered in-depth simultaneously. Therefore, one representative bridge was selected, the Eefdesebrug, after which the results for this bridge would be generalised onto all other relevant bridges across the canal. To determine the full potential of the project, it was investigated up to what extent the results for the Eefdesebrug could be projected onto other bridges across the canal. An inventory was set up containing all bridges. These were characterised and compared based on bridge category, year of construction and dimensions. This resulted in a total of twelve bridges with similar characteristics, to which the results of the redesign of the Eefdesebrug could potentially be generalised to. After the potential of the project had been determined, the focus was placed on the redesign of the Eefdesebrug, which was carried out following a stepwise approach. After each design phase, the global goal of the project was reflected by means of a weight comparison with the existing bridge. To limit the scope of the project, the new deck should be constructed using prefabricated beams. The design would be based on the Eurocode, supplemented by the AFGC-SETRA 2013 guideline. The final design resulted in a 32% reduction of the self-weight compared to the existing bridge. This design comprises pretensioned box beams with a slenderness of 36. A global assessment of the existing foundation was subsequently carried out. A criterion for reuse of the existing foundation was formulated based on the vertical loads due to permanent and vertical variable actions in the new and existing situation. This criterion was satisfied, with which the possibility of reuse of the foundation of the Eefdesebrug had been demonstrated. It was subsequently investigated what may be expected if the solution for the Eefdesebrug would be applied onto the group of twelve aforementioned bridges. Using the results for the Eefdesebrug it was possible to estimate the dimensions for the other bridges and to consider the vertical forces acting upon the foundations. It was shown that a similar solution can be applied to all twelve bridges across the Twentekanaal with characteristics similar to those of the Eefdesebrug.","Ultra-High Performance Concrete; existing bridges; bridge design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

One of the necessary changes to combat this challenge is a shift from conventional power resources, such as coal and natural gas, to large scale deployment of renewable resources, such as wind and solar power. However, renewable energy resources are volatile because they depend on the weather, which poses a problem because supply and demand should always be exactly matched. Along with a shift in energy production, also appliances that use non renewable energy are becoming electric, e.g., electric heating and cooling in buildings and electric vehicles. This causes an increase in electricity demand and is a burden on the main grid. To reduce the demand on the grid, it is important that a part of the energy is produced locally by distributed renewable resources, such as residential solar panels. To maintain a stable operation of the grid, the smart grid paradigm has to be adopted. Advancements in information and communication technologies provide the means for an efficient management of the grid using various services, such as distributed generation and storage. Because of the conflicting nature of the agents in an electricity network, game theory is a widely used framework to tackle this problem. In a realistic model of a power grid coupling constraints must be taken into account, because the agents have shared resources. Therefore, the economic dispatch problem is modeled as a noncooperative game with coupling constraints, called a generalized game. Three distributed algorithms are derived to reach a generalized Nash equilibrium. It is shown through simulations that these algorithms have the potential to ensure a safe and efficient operation of the grid, while minimizing the cost of power usage. To reduce the cost even further, a method is presented to make more optimal use of the storage units.","Smart grid; Distributed generalized Nash equilibrium seeking; Distributed storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Besides the dependencies, the implications of the NEED on the environment, economy and society are explored. The implications are also shown in a case study looking into the Wadden Sea, which is Natural UNESCO World Heritage.<br/><br/>It is found that, with constant pumping, the water level variability stays within a range that is an order of magnitude smaller than the tidal amplitudes that prevail nowadays. The salinity of the top layer drops with an order of magnitude as well, from 35 PSU to 3.5 PSU in 50 years, while the deep, stratified part of the basin stays salt. The surface temperature only changes slightly with a drop of 0.3 $^{\circ}$C. <br/>The hydrodynamic processes in the enclosed North Sea basin together generate a weak anti-clockwise circulation that replaces the stronger anti-clockwise circulation imposed by the tides that prevailed before the enclosure of the basin. Due to a drop in average flow velocities, the sediment transport in the basin decreases and transforms from tide-dominated to a system where tides and wind are equally important. It is found that all of the above described changes have major implications on environment, economy and society and that much more research is needed to fully understand the changing processes and their effects.","NEED; North Sea; Northern European Enclosure Dam","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Breedveld, P. (mentor); Zhou, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","When inserting a flexible endoscope into a human colon during colonoscopy, limitations in the endoscope design can cause medical implications such as excessive colon stretching and buckling of the endoscope shaft. This thesis proposes a novel propulsion mechanism design for flexible endoscopes which changes the method of insertion as a way to prevent these implications. As inspiration for the design an analogy is drawn between plant roots growing through tortuous cracks in soil and flexible endoscopes moving through a tortuous human colon. The analogy was found to be relevant, resulting in eight biological features of which seven were suitable as a potential solution in the development of a flexible endoscope. Of these seven suitable solutions, apical extension and variable stiffness were implemented as functions in the proposed propulsion mechanism. The focus of the design process on these two functions ultimately culminated in a proof of concept flexible, extending endoscope design dubbed the Flextendoscope. The Flextendoscope consists of an inverted tube mechanism which can propel the endoscope through apical extension combined with a fiber jamming mechanism that can vary the bending stiffness. The concept design is found very promising as it theoretically allows insertion of a highly compliant shaft which is also able to provide the high tip rigidity required at the surgical location after insertion. Although evaluation of the Flextendoscope prototype validated the feasibility of the proposed proof of concept design, the performance of the apical extension function was of a more limited success. Due to internal frictional resistances the prototype shaft only extended under the lowest evaluated pressure (0.5 bar) and required a high manual force (up to 119 N) to do so. The behavior of the variable stiffness function on the other hand was found to be very desirable. The bending stiffness of the prototype increased with internal pressure level as well as radial deflection, showing initial elastic deformation followed by hysteresis. It showed considerable stiffening at a convenient threshold pressure of 0.7 bar, slightly above the pressure at which the shaft is extended. Future iterations of the Flextendoscope design should focus on overcoming the internal frictional resistances that limit the apical extension of the current design. They can do so by multiplying the number of inverted tubes inside the shaft. This multiplication would enclose the sliding shaft material of each inverted tube within their own central lumen thus avoiding contact between the sliding shaft material and other stationary components in the design, preventing frictional interactions. If the frictional resistance is overcome the Flextendoscope design could prevent colon stretching during insertion of an flexible endoscope and inherently prevent shaft buckling. The prevention of these implications by the Flextendoscope design could ultimately lead to colonoscopy becoming an easier, safer and less painful procedure with a higher success rate.","Flexible endoscope; Propulsion mechanism; Colonoscopy; Apical extension; Variable stiffness; Plant root growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Whole new blocks of buildings are built, huge infrastructural projects are constructed and so on. Hence, there is a need of a reliable and up-to-date inventory of the area and the objects of interest for mapping and monitoring assets and their changes. An answer of this upcoming need is an automated inventory of infrastructure using Remote Sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Rail sector shares the same need for fast and reliable inspection on its infrastructure. Monitoring frequently the condition of the railway infrastructure can improve the maintenance efficiency and the avoidance of hazards. The traditional monitoring techniques are costly, time consuming and in some cases dangerous, due to their reliance on the physical presence of the inspector. Hence, new state-of-the-art techniques that are able to frequently and without putting in risk human lives, inspect the condition of the railway and its infrastructure. This master thesis aims at developing an efficient workflow for combining 2D imagery and 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds for the automated detection and localization of the railroad infrastructural objects into 3D world coordinate system, for monitoring the railway infrastructure. Using deep learning (DL) methods in imagery we detected and mapped, approximately the 60% of the railroad equipment of our interest (i.e. light signals and equipment boxes). These detected equipment were analyzed with stereoscopic techniques to retrieve their position in 3D world coordinate system. That led to the automated creation of a geographical information system (GIS) map having the positional and class information of railway equipment. Once the detected objects were mapped, then the point cloud data were automatically cropped into voxels including the same objects. Hence, using various sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques, the points referring to the objects were classified. Furthermore, combining the positional information provided via 2D analysis with 3D point clouds, the vertical position was refined and the height of the mapped objects was estimated. Lastly, the positional information estimated from the 2D analysis enhanced the unsupervised ML classification in point clouds. The product of this classification, has the potential to be used as training data to train supervised point cloud classifiers.","2D; 3D; LiDAR; Imagery; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Stereoscopy; GIS; rail; Automation; Point Cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-16","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","52.41469393, 0.29598187"

(mentor); van Erp, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis investigates triggers, introduced in Relevance by Play, as promises of relevance leading to a museum visit. It follows two major goals. Based on these, it is divided in two parts. In the fist part, the Relevance by Play (Vermeeren and Calvi, 2019) framework and the model of museum visitor roles by Falk (2009) are combined, resulting in a structural overview that helps designing triggers for differently motivated visitors. In the second part, his overview is used to design a trigger to initiate the interest of teenagers in the topic of National Socialism, generating an explorer role for a potential visit of a museum/memorial site. Therefore, triggers and visitor roles were first looked at separately and afterwards their connections explored through case studies, a survey and interviews about planning and carrying out museum visits. It was concluded that triggers follow three different functions leading to a museum visit. They first initiate the interest of a potential visitor and generate a motivation to visit, which results in a visitor role, then elicit the potential visitors to consider a certain museum or exhibition through addressing what is perceived as relevant by a potential visitor of a certain role and last, enable the potential visitor to visit the museum. The research suggests that triggers are closely interlinked to the potential visitor’s context. Contextual changes can also function as triggers and triggers can be designed to match contextual circumstances of the potential visitor to be more efficient. The overview provided in the end of part 1 covers the different aspects that play a role in forming the decision of visiting a museum and explains how they are connected. Based on this, designers can guide their research and identify opportunities for designing. In part 2, literature was researched to get a general understanding of the challenges of teaching National Socialism and participants of the target group were interviewed to learn about their relation to the topic and get insights about what they perceive as relevant. The main research-findings show that teenagers have problems engaging in the topic of National Socialism as it feels too far away for them, perceiving it as too cruel to engage and being taught in a school setting, doesn’t allow teenagers to follow their own interests. Making it easier for teenagers to find an access to National Socialism, topics were searched that are easy to relate to and thus feel meaningful to them. The interaction of exploring the topic needed to be fun and of low effort to engage and make explorers curious. To dive deeper in the topic, the process was split up, giving users the possibility to do so at their own interest and agenda. The design concept uses fragments of historic situations in the form of street art. In looking through a tool, the context of the fragment is exposed. Users can scan a QR code leading them to an Instagram page related to the historic situation and webpages of related museums/memorial sites.","Museums; Museum Visitor research; Design for Interaction; Triggers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (graduation committee); Sánchez Gómez, S. (graduation committee); Roijakkers, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","During the last decades, the development of high-rise increased quickly. The Eurocode is frequently used to make wind calculations for high-rise structures. To make those calculations, the dynamic wind load is simplified to a conservative equivalent static load. An alternative to calculate wind loads is a physical wind tunnel test. Wind tunnel tests are expensive. An alternative for these methods is the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD). CFD makes it possible to simulate the wind. At this time, CFD is still very user-dependent and therefore it is stated in the Eurocode that CFD simulations cannot be used as a design tool. This research aims to examine the impact of different parameters in evaluating the dynamic loading on a high-rise structure by the use of CFD. The results of the CFD simulations are compared with a spectral approach. The Navier Stokes (NS) equations are the basics for CFD. Different models are used to solve the NS equations. The costs of CFD increase exponentially with demanding more accuracy. An extension of the RANS model is used in this research: the Unsteady-RANS(U-RANS) model. Where the RANS model only computes the steady-state solution in a simulation, the U-RANS captures the slow turbulences as well. For the objective of a dynamic wind load on a high-rise structure the slow turbulences are of more importance than the faster turbulences. Especially the frequencies close to the natural frequencies of the structure are important. The CFD simulations are performed using Star CCM+ by Engineering Company ABT BV. A reference structure is used to validate the CFD simulation procedure with existing available wind tunnel data of the Tokyo Polytechnic University. The wind tunnel data contains dimensionless pressure coefficients on several locations on the model. The results show a lot of noise, which is visible when the time domain's pressure coefficients are translated into the frequency domain. A dominant peak is observed at a frequency of 10 Hz, but other frequencies are triggered as well. The CFD simulation for the same reference block show less fluctuating results than the wind tunnel data: the results are only fluctuating on one frequency of 12 Hz. Afterwards, a case study is used to compare CFD results with a spectral approach. A high-rise structure of 40 x 40 x 200 meters is used for this study. The results of the spectral approach are compared with existing literature using the structural factor cscd. The results coincide. Several CFD simulations are performed on the same model. The absolute values of the peak velocity pressure are of the same order of magnitude, with a difference of 10 to 25 percent. However, the values of the standard deviation differ more substantially. The CFD simulation stores the average pressure over an area of 10 x 10 meters, which balances out some fluctuations. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the CFD simulations underpredict the absolute values of the pressure consistently compared to the spectral approach. It can be concluded that the CFD simulations require exact defined input values.","Wind loading; CFD; High-rise Buildings; Dynamic Wind Loading; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Spectral Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Anand, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Turbomachines are prevalent within the aerospace industry and vital for both power production and flight systems. To achieve better performance and higher efficiency, a numerical optimization technique is used to optimize designs. Previous work has primarily focused on performing steady-state optimization of turboma- chinery using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. In efforts for further performance increases, the next step of turbomachinery optimization is to incorporate time-accurate solvers. These time-accurate solvers are computationally more expensive than steady solvers, which hinders usage in optimization. The harmonic balance method was developed to reduce computational requirements compared to a time-accurate solver while maintaining unsteady flow characteristics in the simulation results. Optimization using the harmonic balance method has shown better performance in 2D cases, but there has not been work reporting on a 3D case. Fur- ther analysis of how optimization changes flow irreversibility in a design has not been shown between harmonic balance and mixing plane based optimization. This work’s novel contribution is to perform a comparative study of harmonic balance and mixing plane based optimization of a 3D multistage turbine and perform a loss quantification comparison of the optimized designs. In this work, the flow around a 3D 1.5 stage axial turbine in the subsonic to transonic flow regime was simulated and optimized using the mixing plane and harmonic balance methods. The turbine blade shapes are parameterized using a CAD-based NURBS parameterization and optimized using a gradient-based adjoint algorithm. Flow features, entropy trends, and computational costs between harmonic balance and mixing plane simulation and optimization were compared. This study shows that most entropy creation differences between harmonic balance and mixing plane methods occur in the rotating domain. A turbine design optimized using the harmonic balance method has better fluid-dynamic performance than a design optimized using the mixing plane method. Turbine designs combining blades from both harmonic balance and mixing plane based optimization show better performance than a design using a single flow simulation method for optimization. Results also indicate that a grid converged mesh may not be necessary for entropy generation minimization of turbomachinery designs for transonic flow.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The project was hosted by Wijzer in Geldzaken and Geldfit, who both concern themselves with supporting individuals in navigating the complex and fragmented landscape of personal finances in the Netherlands, in order to further national financial well-being. Following the Vision in Product design method, research was conducted towards the driving forces that make up the future context, by collecting factors, discovering clusters, and finally structuring a worldview that can be used to reveal future experiences and behaviors of adolescents in the context of financial well-being. The key characteristics of this future context have been identified as being overwhelming, with a high likelihood of experiencing personal vulnerability, as well as developing financial vulnerability. Through adherence to the Positive Design Manifesto, further research into economics, and clarification of the designer’s opinions about the future context, the designer takes a position on a desired future society. This position is presented as an ambition for a society that supports the well-being of adolescents, illustrated by a number of transformational values and principles that outline how a focus on human flourishing instead of economic flourishing can be realized. Moreover, four visions, that flow from the ambition, are presented on how to improve the individual and social financial well-being of adolescents in 2025. An illustration of how these visions can be used to create transformative products is presented, by outlining the development of a conceptual product. The product facilitates resilience to financial shame experienced in social situations, through the integration of principles from scientific theory, and the stimulation of maintaining small amounts of debt.

The Symbihand was developed by R. Bos and K. Nizamis in 2019. The active hand orthosis is especially designed to assist DMD patients in ADL. Control is intuitive, the self-aligning mechanism prevents inaccurate joint alignment during flexion and the hydraulic finger modules are forceful and can achieve proper ROM. One of the limitations of the device is that the thumb is restricted to an awkward position in order to facilitate grasping abilities. That while, the thumb is of substantial influence on the versatility of the hand and actuation of this digit could be of additional value for functionality by adding the possibility of the key pinch . This thesis describes the design and evaluation of a thumb module for the Symbihand with the aim to release the awkward static position of the splinted thumb. In order to add a thumb module to the system, preservation of the hydraulic actuation and the self-aligning mechanism is imperative.

The motion of the probe has been divided into a rotation and translation movement. Comparing the IMU sensor rotation tracking with the optical tracking, while rotating 40 degrees, resulted in an average Pearson’s correlation of 0.99 ± 0.0056. The average Pearson’s correlation between the translation tracking of the IMU sensor and the optical tracking system, in a translation of 15 centimetres, was 0.13 ± 0.78. The rotation and translation tracking is used to reconstruct the ultrasound volume of a phantom. In a rocking motion reconstructed volume the horizontal distance between phantom features had a mean error of 45%, a vertical distance was reconstructed with a mean error of 0.25%. In a translation motion reconstructed volume these errors were 29% and 1.4% for respectively horizontal feature distance and vertical feature distance. This study demonstrates that an IMU sensor can be used to track the motion of the probe. The rotation tracking of the IMU sensor is comparable with the rotation tracking of an optical tracking system. The translation tracking of the IMU sensor is on average not comparable with an optical tracking system, however some translations have been tracked with a high correlation. A reason to explain the low average correlation of the translation tracking of the IMU sensor is the method of gravity vector correction in the accelerometer data.

Currently, most land-use change models run a small number of predetermined scenarios. To better address the multidimensional nature of uncertainty about the future, previous studies have argued for covering a wider range of the uncertainty space than is possible with existing scenario approaches. One way to approach this, is by using exploratory modelling. Instead of running the model on a small number of pre-defined scenarios, one uses sampling techniques over a plausible range of the uncertainty space to generate large-scale simulation experiments. With respect to land-use change models, this results in a large number of future land-use maps. To better make sense of the resulting maps, the next step necessitates the identification of plausible distinctive land-use patterns through clustering algorithms. Previous studies regarding quantification of land-use maps (dis)similarity focus only on comparing maps on a one-to-one basis or in small numbers for validation and calibration purposes. In this study the use of different map of similarity metrics on the resulting clusters of land-use patterns is systematically investigated. Specifically, the implications of using various cell-by-cell similarity metrics and landscape structure similarity metrics to cluster the resulting land-use maps are tested. The Land Use Scanner model is used for this purpose. It was found that the choice of (dis)similarity metric plays a significant role in the formed clusters of maps. If exploratory modelling is to be applied to land-use change models, it is thus important that great care is taken in the selection of the proper clustering algorithm.","Land use change modelling; Scenario Discovery; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Similarity Metrics; Multiclass Scenario Discovery; Clustering analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this research, Dutch phoneme recognition (PR) is researched and improved. The last research on Dutch PR dates back to 1995. This research presents Dutch PR in modern daylight by researching state-of-the-art techniques found in research on other languages and implementing them on Dutch PR. The goal of this research is to find the current best architectures for Dutch phoneme recognition, analyse how those architectures perform on different speaking styles, and analyse the errors of the phonemes.<br/> To achieve these goals, four state-of-the-art Neural Network architectures (BLSTM, OPGRU, TDNN-BLSTM, and TDNN-OPGRU) are built and trained on a Dutch dataset containing 15 different speaking styles. Then, the trained architectures are used for three experiments. The first experiment tests the architectures on a 15-speaking style containing the same 15 speaking styles as the training set. The results of that training set are used to calculate the phoneme error rate (PER), analyse the errors, and identify error-prone phonemes. The second and third experiments follow the same methodology on the same-trained architectures, however, are tested on a clear speaking style test set and a spontaneous speaking style test set. The results are used to analyse and compare the performances of the models on different speaking styles. This research shows that the BLSTM and OPGRU are a poor choice for Dutch PR, as the results show relatively high PERs for these two architectures. The hybrid acoustic models TDNN-BLSTM and TDNN-OPGRU show to be good models for Dutch PR, as they gain low PERs. The results in this research set a new benchmark for Dutch PR, as the TDNN-BLSTM and TDNN-OPGRU show the lowest recognition accuracy found in existing Dutch PR literacy. Additionally, this research shows that recognising Dutch clear speech is less complex than recognising Dutch spontaneous speech, which is in line with existing word- and phoneme recognition research on other languages. Besides that, this research makes recommendations for which of the hybrid models is more effective to use when using the different speaking styles as input. Finally, this research finds the phonemes /I/, /a/, /k/, /s/, and the schwa as error-prone phonemes in Dutch PR, as they have high, above average individual PERs and contribute above-average to the overall PER on both the TDNN-BLSTM and TDNN-OPGRU. This research also makes recommendations on where future Dutch PR could focus on. Setting a benchmark for Dutch PR, analysing different speaking styles, and identifying error-prone phonemes hopefully triggers future researchers on further improving Dutch PR. <br","Phonemes and Visemes; Phoneme Recognition; Machine Learning; Speech recognition; Deep Learning; Phonology; ASR; BLSTM; OPGRU; TDNN-BLSTM; TDNN-OPGRU; Time-Delay Neural Networks; Recurrent Neural Networks; PER; Speaking style research; Phoneme Error Rate; Dutch; phoneme analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","Conducted in name of Cognizant Benelux","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the introduction of Hydrazine to the list of substances of very high concern, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), there has been an increase in the investigation of “green” propellant alternatives. At the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion, a mixture of Nitrous Oxide<br/>and Hydrocarbons (Ethylene or Ethane), called HyNOx, has been under development since 2014. These monopropellants offer bipropellant-like performance, the ability to be used in a self-pressurised propulsion system, and are non-toxic. HyNOx propellants have the drawback of high combustion temperatures (up to 3400 K). Therefore, it is necessary to study what cooling methods can be applied to rocket engines using HyNOx propellants.<br/>During this project, the test setup, HTMS (Heat Transfer Measurement Section), has been designed, built and tested in the M11.2 test bench at the DLR Lampoldshausen to study heat transfer in regeneratively cooled channels. The design was based on what was learned from studying past experimental<br/>setups. A test campaign was performed to study the use of Nitrous Oxide and Ethane as coolant in stainless steel, copper and aluminium alloy pipes of different diameters. The setup diagnostics system was improved by procuring new measurement instrumentation. Additionally the instruments were<br/>installed in different ways in order to understand which method would provide the most accurate and reliable results. The results of the thesis show that Ethane has better coolant properties than Nitrous Oxide due to its higher specific heat. However, the carbon present in Ethane leads to the formation of carbon deposits at high temperatures which can lead to clogging of the pipes and therefore Nitrous Oxide could be a the preferred coolant for situations where the temperatures are high enough for carbon deposition to occur. Additionally, it was determined that pure copper and the aluminium alloy AlMgSi 0.5 are not adequate materials for the construction of cooling channels. In the course of this project and to complement the experimental testing, a Matlab-based numerical simulation tool was developed that simulates the temperature profile in the HTMS setup using empirical Nusselt correlations to determine the heat transfer coefficient.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Recycling has the least amount of value according to the circular system diagram of the company which means that a lot of valuable material will be lost in this process. The main goal of this study is to propose a redesign that reduces the total amount of waste and generate more value for the current closed-loop system by 2025. Product X has been taken as a use case throughout this study. A literature study on the Materials Flow Analysis in combination with Sankey’s diagram has been performed to develop a visual representation of the life cycle of Product X. The goal is to provide insight into the End of Life practice of Product X and identify new circular opportunities for the company. The results led to a focus on refurbishment and part harvesting to increase the repurposing value of Product X. The identified obstructions have been rewritten into design challenges which were the guiding principles for the redesign Product X. The redesign of Product X has an optimized architecture that facilitates material reuse up to 82%. Three different business cases have been performed concerning the lifespan of Product X to estimate the potential circular revenue of Product X in time. The results indicated that the early and mid-stage of the redesign are feasible for the current refurbishment process and the late stage of the lifecycle should be dedicated to part harvesting process to capture as much material value as possible. The summarized business case indicates that the current revenue income of the redesign could be increased by 11% of circular revenue if it would be implemented. A final Material Flow Analysis is performed on the redesign of Product X to gain insight on the impact of switching to a strategy like refurbishment that increases the material value for the closed-loop system.","Circular Economy; Lifecycle Flow; Material Flow Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Faenza, Martina (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The supersonic split line (SSSL) nozzle has been considered for years in the use of solid rocket motors. The SSSL nozzle is an attractive alternative to the more conventional submerged movable (SM) nozzle. The SSSL nozzle can save up to 43% on nozzle mass and 25% on the thrust vector control (TVC) system mass. The SSSL nozzle also has the benefit of the amplification factor, which is a result of the SSSL nozzle turning the flow in the supersonic region. The shock waves formed deflect the flow more than the mechanical deflection. Only limited research is available on the SSSL nozzle. This thesis aims to expand on the knowledge of the SSSL nozzle in cooperation with Nammo Raufoss. The aspects that are researched in detail are as following: The effect on the amplification factor when moving the split and changing the expansion ratio of the nozzle. Furthermore, to determine how well the SSSL nozzle compares to a more traditional SM nozzle, a comparison between the SSSL and the SM nozzle is performed at equal performance. This comparison has a focus on the mass differences. The performances of the SM nozzle and the SSSL nozzle are determined by simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). From the CFD simulations, the amplification factor of the SSSL nozzle was determined. In order to compare the SSSL nozzle and the SM nozzle a mass model is developed. The model uses the calculated performance from the CFD simulations to calculate the mass difference between the two nozzle and TVC systems. The results show that the amplification factor increases when moving the split further down stream. Furthermore, when increasing the expansion ratio the amplification factor decreases. For the SSSL nozzle with a total expansion ratio of 12 and the split location at an expansion ratio of 1.75, the maximum amplification factor is 1.57. Additionally, a linear relationship between the amplification factor and the ratio of the expansion ratio at the split to the total expansion ratio of the nozzle is observed. The SSSL nozzle experiences increasing thrust and Isp losses while vectoring when the split is located further downstream, while receiving only a slight increase in the amplification factor. The results from the mass model show that the SSSL nozzle is on average 37% lighter than the SM nozzle for a vectoring duty cycle of 0.25. To conclude, for an increasing ratio between the expansion ratio at the split to the total expansion ratio of the nozzle, the amplification factor increases. Additionally, the SSSL nozzle is the lighter option when only the aerodynamic effects are considered. It was also seen that the temperature and heat flux around the split area was high, to overcome this the SSSL nozzle might need additional thermal protection which could potentially lead to a higher mass. It was observed that the largest mass difference between the SSSL and SM nozzle system was found when the split of the SSSL nozzle is located at an expansion ratio that gives the highest possible Isp.","Supersonic split line nozzle; Submerged movable nozzle; amplification factor; Thrust vector control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Loneliness is a large and growing problem among adolescents. Body image has a strong relationship with loneliness, especially among young people. Therefore, a promising way to increase social wellbeing among this group is by increasing body satisfaction. This report presents various aspects that should be taken into account when designing an intervention for this topic and demographic. Several designs are suggested, one of which is made into a prototype and validated.  <br/>Cognitive models theorise loneliness as a consequence of bad coping behaviours for body dissatisfaction, among other things. Body dissatisfaction often results from internalising dominant cultural beliefs about appearance. An example of a dominant belief is that having a fit body can be interpreted as an achievement of discipline and perseverance that an individual has worked hard for. The reverse then also rings true: unfit people are lazier, less disciplined and more likely to give up. Many of these beliefs are so common that they seem unchangeable. However, history shows us that appearance ideals have changed dramatically in the past and that they result from the intricate way society is organised and how it develops within a period.<br/>Changing these beliefs is difficult and slow, but a good place to start is by realising there is often more nuance and variety in beliefs about being healthy and fit than we assume. While one person values a low-fat sixpack for the hard work that goes into it, another values the freedom a healthy and able body provides. It seems these behaviours and beliefs are closely related to expressing identity and feeling connected with others. This leads us to the question: Are there no other, more socially healthy ways to create this connection?  <br/>The intervention this report proposes offers a fun and light-hearted reason for adolescents to discuss their aspirations and the influence of dominant cultural beliefs and discover that there are more differences between people’s personal motivations and aspirations than they may know.<br","social design; social wellbeing; wellbeing; adolescents; loneliness; body image; body dissatisfaction; serious game; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Operations by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or ‘drones’ pose third party risks to persons on the ground. The key question is: are these third party risks acceptably low? This thesis evaluates the level of risk posed by a concept UAS surveillance-based operation in the port of Rotterdam, by means of modeling and simulation. In a preceding MSc thesis, a modeling and simulation approach to estimate third party risk posed by drone-based parcel delivery service is researched. This modeling and simulation approach has been extended in quite a number of directions. Firstly, the details of the intended drone-based surveillance operation have been defined in collaboration with the Port of Rotterdam Authority. Secondly, the dynamic model of a quadcopter has been replaced by a dynamic model of a fixed-wing UAS. Thirdly, the influence of wind turbulence on the stochastic deviations of the drone flight have been modeled. Fourthly, for the seaport area a method has been developed for estimating local population densities, rather than using census-based data. These models have been integrated in a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the intended surveillance operation in the port of Rotterdam. The outcome of the MC simulations shows that the estimated third party risk level posed per drone flight hour to persons on the ground is about a factor 4 higher than a maximal allowable threshold proposed by the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS). The simulation results also show that the shallow glide angle of the fixed-wing UAS proposed for the surveillance operation causes a relatively large crash impact area on the ground, which leads to a relatively large expected number of persons to be hit by a ground crash. As expected, the main contributions to third party risk stem from parts of a surveillance flight that are near the city, not from parts towards the sea. Another interesting finding is that the estimated third party risk level remains the same if wind turbulence induced flight deviations are ignored. The modeling and simulation results developed in this thesis provide useful feedback to the further development of drone-based operations in the port of Rotterdam.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

More can be achieved by focusing on improving the understanding of key design areas of an offshore wind turbine (OWT). Since fatigue is one of the main design criteria for offshore structures and little is known about fatigue cumulative development in time under operating conditions, it formed the basis of this thesis. However, fatigue is a complex phenomenon that is dependent on numerous interlinked parameters, such as damping, loading type, and stiffness of support structure (SUS). For the purpose, data analysis was performed on measurements which were gathered over a period of four years from a monopile-supported OWT site. The measurement data included information about the environmental and operational conditions of the OWT; and strain, acceleration and inclinometer readings from its SUS. Use of different data acquisition systems during the measurement campaign inherently required significant efforts to synchronise and preprocess raw data to appropriate state for data analysis. Time-dependent lag was identified via computation of cross-correlation sequences between data segment pairings, and the lag was successfully corrected. With the use of a standardized rainflow cycle counting algorithm, strain-derived moment time series were converted to constant amplitude events, which could be used to derive damage equivalent bending moments, M-N curves and fatigue damage accumulation frequency spectra. Short-term damage equivalent bending moment (STEL) was revealed to have a linear dependency with turbulence intensity when the OWT was in the run-up operational state. Additionally, the fatigue damage was demonstrated to be higher for downstream turbines due to wake effects. Also, fatigue life consumption of OWT SUS increases above rated wind speed conditions despite decrease in load magnitude due to increase in SUS response frequency. The latter was confirmed with fatigue damage accumulation frequency spectra, which revealed that the importance of high frequency band (1 – 5 Hz) increases in conjunction with wind speed at above rated wind speed conditions. However, most of the overall fatigue damage is accumulated at the low frequency band, which associated with wind and wave loading, first SUS bending modes, 1P and 3P rotor harmonics.","Offshore Wind; Offshore Wind Turbine; Fatigue; Measurement data; Structure-environment interaction; Structural health monitoring; Turbulence Intensity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

The spent rocket parts, payload fairings and eventually non-functioning payloads of these launches remain in orbit. It is well-established that this accumulation of space debris over time is quickly making this the most severe threat to future spaceflight operations. To address and mitigate this problem a set of internationally agreed guidelines were established including a maximum of 25-year remaining orbital lifetime in this region after end-of-life. This study evaluates if Sun-synchronous satellite operators adhere to this guideline.<br/><br/>To determine this compliance, the operational status of the satellites with orbital control capabilities is established using a maneuver detection algorithm. For satellites without the capability to maneuver a model is created based on mass and design lifetime to determine the duration of the operational phase. Using a semi-analytic propagation method the remaining orbital lifetimes is determined.<br/><br/>The results show an overall compliance of 59% with an increasing trend starting around 2014, before which compliance was 20 to 40 %, to approximately 95% in 2017 and 2018. A large difference is observed for different mass categories, where satellites with a mass lower than 10 kg have a compliance of 86.4% compared to approximately 35% for heavier satellites. Analysis shows that this is mainly due to the lower orbits the former satellites were launched in. No large differences are observed between satellites with or without orbital control capabilities. These results reveal that compliance with the guidelines has been poor in the past but is increasing in recent years. This is mostly a result of operators choosing an orbit with a low altitude to have sufficient natural<br/>decay, and less of operators choosing to perform altitude lowering maneuvers at the end of operational phase to achieve compliance.","Space Debris; Sun-synchronous; Maneuver Detection; Semi-analytical Propagation; Compliance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

New energy sources consisting of human input vibrations are hopeful alternatives for powering wearable low power electronics. These sensors currently rely on the lifetime of the battery and come along with high maintenance costs in case of a replacement. Many designs found within literature are based on the working principles of linear resonant energy harvesters, consisting of high output generation when they are exited on their resonance frequency. However, if the vibration energy harvester is not accurately tuned to the input signal of the real world, poor output performance can be expected. Bistability, consisting of a unique double well potential energy curve is an interesting alternative. The oscillation between the two potential wells contribute to higher output performance in comparison with resonant configurations. However, these potential wells are segregated by an energy barrier and the motion between the two wells will not always occur during excitation. A solution is found to reduce the energy barrier by means of mechanical end-stops. A mechanical model based upon beam theory is created in ANSYS and their stiffness characteristics are used as an input parameter for the dynamical model. To confirm this model a prototype is constructed and investigated. A mechanical analysis is carried out using a quasistatic forcedeflection measurement and the dynamical analysis is performed on a linear air bearing stage, consisting of a maximum stroke of half a meter being able to reproduce low frequency input excitations. It could be observed that participation of the desired trajectory between the two potential wells is enhanced and occur at lower input accelerations, as the oscillators motion is confined by means of hard mechanical end-stops. Therefore, the integration of mechanical end-stops as a design parameter for bistable energy harvesters can be considered as a viable solution to capture the kinetic energy induced by human input motion with the use of bistable mechanisms.","Vibration energy harvesting; Human motion; Bistability; Impact; Mechanical end-stops; Coefficient of restitution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

This will inevitably lead to the installment of these systems on agricultural land, subsequently intensifying the land-use conflict and threatening food security. To alleviate this, the use of agrophotovoltaic (APV) systems is investigated, which enable the simultaneous production of food and renewable energy. More specifically, the aim of this thesis is to determine the optimal topology for a medium-scale and stationary bifacial APV array, which is simulated under the climate of Boston, USA (42.37˚N, 71.01˚W). Irradiance modelling is performed with Radiance’s raytracing algorithm in combination with the daylight coefficient approach of Daysim and the Perez All Weather sky model, which is then coupled to the crop and electrical yield models to determine the overall land productivity. The modelling approach used is robust, while offering flexible manipulation of the array’s deployment configuration, which is crucial for multivariable optimization. The integration of bifacial PV offers various synergistic effects mainly due to the amplified ground irradiance necessary for crop growth. Owing to the decreased PV density and high elevation from ground, rear irradiance homogeneity and bifacial gain are enhanced. Widening of the row spacing resulted in a logarithmic increase of the incident ground irradiation, while the overall energy yield portrayed a negative exponential trend, which is attributed to the use of bifacial modules. East-west (E-W) facing and vertically installed topologies are better suited for shade intolerant species, or permanent crops since they permit additional light penetration, especially during the winter months. In contrast, south-north (S-N) facing and latitude inclined arrays lead to intense and non-homogeneous shading that is unfavorable for growth during winter or for crops that cannot acclimate to shade; nonetheless, energy yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) are significantly enhanced. Unlike previous studies where only conventional modules were examined, here the potential of a customized one is inspected to assess whether blueberries can grow effectively under shade. By integrating such a module in an E-W hinged PV topology, which is associated with the most optimal shading patterns and schedule, the agrivoltaic performance is optimized. In comparison to the reference case, the land’s productivity is increased by 59% with a reduction in electrical yield by a third. Through this holistic approach that incorporates a multi-scale sensitivity analysis, it is possible to achieve a spherical understanding of the limitations and potential synergies associated with the dual use of land, ultimately encouraging the sustainability of the agricultural sector.","Agrivoltaics; Bifacial; Radiance; Land Equivalent Ratio; Dual-use","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-11","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","42.3601,71.0589"

They create value by experimenting with technologies and methodologies, delivering products into people’s hands, and transforming the way of working. My project was conducted as part of the Portfolio Management team within DS. The Portfolio Management team enables decision-making on priorities and guides delivery of value. On assignment for DS, my intent for the project was to design a concept that quickly generates and shapes initiatives, and creates insight into their potential value. The project started with framing the problem. During the literature study, I concluded that three studies were leading for this assignment. Elements of successful portfolio management are described by Cooper et al. (2001) as strategically aligned, maximum portfolio value and portfolio balance. This can be achieved by having a portfolio mindset, being agile, and focusing whilst generating and shaping initiatives (Kester et al., 2011). The elements of portfolio orientation and structuring proved to be essential for the assignment as well (Meskendahl, 2010). I conducted external interviews, during which elements from literature gained meaning within the assignment. I discovered how the elements of Cooper et al. (2001), Kester et al. (2011) and Meskendahl (2010) could be applied within the context of the problem. I concluded that all insights obtained could be divided between strategically aligned, maximum portfolio value, portfolio balance and portfolio mindset. The underlying drivers of these elements led me to define design criteria. Different combinations of ideas resulted in four concepts, including the frame toolbox concept. The frame toolbox aims to transform the Frame Creation method (Dorst, 2015) into a tangible product, where initiative owners feel supported in the rapid generation and shaping of initiatives with maximum value as output. I subsequently developed the frame toolbox concept within DS’ context by testing its assumptions, hypotheses and challenges. This testing resulted in finding a connection between the frame toolbox and DS’ resources. This iterative design process led to my final design of Blink. Blink is a digital toolbox that transforms all types of innovations into valuable focus points for product teams. It quickly exposes problems, themes, solutions, and opportunities to their core and maximizes their potential value. By implementing a simple step-by-step plan, new opportunities are shaped that align with DS’ strategy. Blink helps participants to reframe their mindset by discovering the drivers of initiatives to define where the “real” value lies. This value is assessed by the value check tool. Focus points are evaluated on desirability and viability; this clearly shows its potential value. A portfolio mindset among employees is ensured through Blink’s structure and transparency. Blink can be performed in small and large groups, both online and offline. It enables participants to act flexibly due to the short turnaround time. It prioritizes speed, as it focuses on rapid screening of the initiative’s potential value. This thesis describes the process I followed in developing Blink and concludes with an implementation plan, a final reflection, Blink’s limitations, and recommendations for future designs.","Digital; Innovation; Transformation; Onboarding; Reframing; Initiatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The articles reflected no differences in usage of frames, however, actor portrayal varied significantly between newspapers: environmental experts appeared more often in De Volkskrant, there seemed to be a negative relationship between the number of portrayed farmers and construction workers, and, popular newspaper De Telegraaf showed more signs of partisanship than other newspapers. Conclusively, I made some suggestions to environmental researchers for future environmental debates.","Nitrogen; Industrial Ecology; Science Communication; Content Analysis; Framing; Newspapers; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor); Setyowati, A.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Problem Statement<br/>Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelago nation, with 270 million people inhabiting 6,000 islands that span almost 2000 square kilometers (World Population Review, 2020). With 80% of its industries and 60% of its population located in coastal regions, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to rising sea- levels and extreme weather events (Fünfgeld, 2020). Despite the urgent need to transition towards low carbon energy production, the development of renewables in Indonesia is very slow. In 2019, 84% of electricity was generated from fossil fuels, 59% of which came from coal power plants (IEA, 2020b). Considering the prevailing poverty levels, which stood at 24% in 2018 ($ 3.20/day poverty line), Indonesia is faced with the dual challenge of human development and climate change. Biomass gasification is a particularly interesting option for Indonesia due to the enormous quantities of residues produced from the agriculture and forestry sectors. Activities commenced in the late 1970’s, however, despite over forty years of development the technology has not reached wide-scale diffusion and very few clear examples of commercially viable projects exist. Further investigation is needed to understand how biomass gasification can contribute to energy justice in Indonesia, and which factors have influenced its development over the past forty years.<br/><br/>Research Goals and Research Design<br/>Theory from sustainability transitions research and energy justice are used to develop a framework that facilitates the investigation of: (1) the factors that have influenced the development of the biomass gasification niche, and (2) how niche projects and the electricity sector have performed with respect to energy justice. An integrated Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and Strategic Niche Management (SNM) frame- work is combined with the energy justice framework of Sovacool, M. Burke, et al., 2017. Explanatory and descriptive research is complemented by exploratory research, that utilises semi-structured expert interviews to gain deeper insights into transition dynamics and energy justice.<br/><br/>Main Findings<br/>The biomass gasification niche has largely relied on international donors to support activities. In 1980 the main landscape pressure motivating donors was energy (in)security during the world oil crises. Many years later, international and domestic interest in biomass gasification increased largely in response to the intensifying landscape pressure to mitigate climate change. Projects have been implemented in rural locations where there is a need to: alleviate poverty, increase electricity access, and reduce diesel fuel consumption. The latter is due to the increasing burden of oil subsidies and rapidly declining domestic oil reserves.<br/><br/>Since 2012 a number of formal rules have been introduced in order to incentivise biomass gasification projects - these started with fixed Feed-in-Tariffs, and later linked the electricity price to the local generation cost of the electricity utility, PLN. Both regulations failed to incentivise commercial projects, while the latter was widely regarded as inhibitory to niche development as PLN’s generation cost is heavily influenced by fossil fuel subsidies (Interviewee 5 - International Project Facilitator, 2020; Interviewee 8 - Government, 2020). The increased use of biomass for cofiring with coal has led to the formation of a domestic market for waste biomass - these feedstocks have since been prohibitively expensive for niche projects.<br/><br/>As the niche network has expanded beyond technical research institutions, the learning processes progressed to learning about policy and regulation, biomass potential, societal and environmental impact, and business models. Knowledge of biomass potential has greatly improved - while the domestic mar- ket for biomass waste has made agribusiness waste prohibitively expensive, the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) has started to investigate the potential of different biomass species for cultivation on degraded land - creating a key opportunity for niche projects to align with the land-use dimension of climate change mitigation. Finally, in CPI’s recent projects, actors have been able to learn more about the societal and environmental impact of biomass gasification - a key source of competitive advantage over other renewable energy niches (discussed below).<br/><br/>However, the success of niche projects to date have been hampered by a variety of socio-technical challenges, several of which still remain - feedstock security, operator training, and business models to facilitate niche expansion. In terms of the actor network, there has been minimal interaction between the different actor groups over the last forty years - this lack of shared learning has meant that actors have not been able to effectively learn from the accumulating experiences of other niche projects, and so resulted in limited examples of reinforcing niche nurturing processes and second-order learning.<br/><br/>Since the earliest niche experiments in 1980, biomass gasification projects have attempted to alleviate some of the injustices caused by Indonesia’s electricity regime. By targeting rural communities that have been marginalised by poor access to energy services, projects have sought to alleviate the intra- generational inequity in the availability of electricity. Through careful project design, actors were able to contribute to improved transparency and accountability and alleviate some injustices that intersect with energy justice. Regarding the latter, the main contribution has been in the targeting of low-income rural communities with limited access to electricity (socio-economic justice), although CPI’s Mentawai project also contributed to improved gender justice.<br/><br/>Recommendations<br/>The key recommendations from this research are: (1) align projects with multiple landscape pressures - choose locations in which these pressures are more intense by comparing biomass potential (agro- industry locations or degraded land for crop cultivation), to the locations of diesel power plants (and regions in which the local generation cost is high), and locations of communities with poor electricity access and limited economic development; (2) accelerate niche development by improving cross-project communication; (3) implement long-term strategy to improve technical knowledge in rural areas so that communities are able to successfully operate and maintain biomass gasification plants, and (4) the Government should adopt an energy justice framework, such as that proposed by Sovacool, M. Burke, et al., 2017, that not only considers distributional justice, but also due process, recognition, restorative, and cosmopolitan justice - this will result in supportive policies that more accurately value the positive energy justice contribution of niche technologies like biomass gasification, and thereby facilitate the large-scale diffusion of these technologies.<br/><br/>Further work<br/>This historical case study can be used as the basis for a participatory future-oriented research project that investigates how the biomass gasification niche can be scaled-up in a just manner - designing a number of scenarios over the short-, medium-, and long-term. Considering the broad scope of Indonesia’s electricity sector, a more comprehensive energy justice analysis is necessary for niche innovations and traditional technologies in order to facilitate fair energy decision-making.<br/><br/>This research has combined an integrated MLP and SNM framework with an energy justice framework. Sovacool’s broad energy justice framework creates a number of opportunities for integrating this analysis into the MLP and SNM frameworks. Academically relevant further research should focus on the integration of energy justice and Sustainability Transitions Research frameworks.","multi-level perspective; strategic niche management; MLP; SNM; Energy Justice; Indonesia; Biomass gasification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In this study, a data-scarce Bayesian optimization model was developed to research the composition of bio-based composites. The proof-of-concept program adjusts the natural materials' weight ratios to optimize towards user-defined mechanical properties. Preliminary results show that the bio-composites proposed by the program had improved properties compared to existing bulk-moulding compounds. However, the algorithm choice is often arbitrary or based on anecdotal evidence. In parallel, this thesis proposed a data-driven framework for general data-scarce optimization problems to adapt the meta-heuristic during optimization. Guided by the 'No Free Lunch' theorem, we verified that the effectiveness over a selection of algorithms is dependent on problem-specific features and convergence. This effectiveness was captured in a unique identifier metric by optimizing a generated training set of optimization problems. The average solution quality was improved by combining several meta-heuristics in series, based on these problem-specifics. During the optimization of problems in the testing set, the same unique identifier was constructed at predefined stages in the optimization process. Subsequently, the problem was classified, and the meta-heuristic was adapted to the best-performing algorithm based on similar training samples. Experiments with various classifiers and a different number of predefined assessment stages were performed. Results show that the data-driven heuristic decision strategy outperformed the individual optimizers on the testing set. Despite the use of binarization techniques, the classification accuracy was heavily influenced by the imbalanced training set. In terms of computational resources, the various adaptions of the data-driven heuristic strategy are 2.5 times faster in runtime compared to the best-performing meta-heuristic Bayesian Optimization. Lastly, the framework was benchmarked against the 'learning to optimize' study and shows excellent performance on the logistic regression problem compared to the autonomous optimizer. In conclusion, it has been shown that even with the limited information of black-box optimization problems, data-driven optimization effectively improves the current standard of materials engineering processes.","meta-heuristic; data-driven; data-scarce; optimization; bio-based; composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","","","","","",""

This research builds upon the alginate based bio-ink from Balasubramanian et al (2021). Their material proposal lacked structural stability and print resolution, which made geometries of more than six layers impossible. Moreover, the bioprints were confined to a nutrient plate. These challenges formed the motivation for the research. The goal for the optimized bioprinting protocol was to make use of the advantages of additive manufacturing, by creating a macro-porous shape with increased surface ratio. The hypothesis was that the microalgae would have more access to light, air and nutrients which would increase oxygen release and carbon dioxide fixation. In a series of explorative studies, in close collaboration with nanobiologists, biomaterial designers and 3D printing experts, a direct ink writing approach was selected to construct the microalgae bioprints. Additional components were added to the alginate bio-ink formulation, which concluded in a material with improved print fidelity and resolution, so that more than 25 layers could be bioprinted. With the optimized protocol, the 3D printed construct could be crosslinked so that the print was stable enough to be handled. The microalgae immobilized in the ink formulation survived more than seven days in the 3D printed geometry. The photosynthetic performance of the material was observed, by building an incubator prototype with oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors. The sensors measured two different bioprints simultaneously, a macro-porous cube and a solid cube. The superiority of the photosynthetic ability of the porous geometry over the solid geometry could not be concluded, due to the limitations of the sensors and the prototype setup. Important insights were found for further research on the improvement of the test setup. The optimized microalgae bio-ink is a valuable material with sustainable benefits. The material can actively fight carbon dioxide pollution, is carbon neutral in production and is biodegradable. The technical optimization of the bio-ink in this study formed the first steps towards a functional living microalgae artefact.","bioprinting; microalgae; Living Materials; Sustainability; photosynthesis; Design optimization; 3D Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It is a way for marketers to raise brand equity and favourably increase customer engagement, brand differentiation and customer loyalty. However, the way customers interact with brands and how brands themselves Crete value is changing. Digital platforms have established themselves as digital mediator between customers and brands. Within a platform economy, value is not merely created by the product or services made by the brand, but the network of participants creates it on the platform. Incorporating this changing economy into brand strategy is vital as 75% of the time, only one platform prevails. The exploration within the field of brand relationships and platform business strategy holds great value to maintain a competitive brand positioning. The thesis aims to answer the following question; How can the use of new insights and knowledge contribute to creating meaningful customer brand relationships within a future platform economy in the Dutch market? The project is done in collaboration with PwC’s Experience Center. At their Experience Center, they help their clients create innovative product and service offerings with the focus on creating a great customer experience. The exploration of this topic will allow them to be better equipped for upcoming client needs regarding the development of new experiences that help their clients form meaningful relationships with their customer. Through a literature review, a basic understanding is created of the topics of brand-consumer relationships and platform business model, which aims to establish the domain for future exploration. Through desk research and expert interviews, 176 insights were gathered. Through clustering and a generative session with design students, 12 clusters were identified. These ultimately led to 4 future scenario’s. Through further analysis, one future scenario was chosen for further exploration with the following vision. The interaction between the platform, consumer, and brand should work like a robust ecosystem where all stakeholders live in a symbiotic relationship, each serving their purpose and bringing value to the ecosystem. This led to the creation of the following 6 design principles aimed to enhance the brand experience for brands operating in a platform economy. (1) Relationships are not built overnight. (2) Collaborate or die (3) No such thing as a virtual hug (4) Branding is 99% emotion. (5) Doing good for society is doing good for branding. (6) Actually, start to listen. These design principles serve to guide the Experience Consulting team and other strategic designers in the creation of new products and services while deepening the relationship with the customer.","ViP; platform economy; branding; design principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mishra, V. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a manufacturing technique with the ability to produce large metal parts with relatively complex geometrical shapes. One obstacle limiting full exploitation of WAAM in the industry is uncertainty on the mechanical properties of manufactured parts. Mechanical properties are strongly influenced by the microstructure of the material which is a product of the thermal history of the material. Thermal history of parts manufactured with WAAM is complex which leads to uncertainty on mechanical properties and microstructure. Therefore a methodology to predict thermal history, microstructure and hardness of metal-based additive manufactured parts is presented, validated and applied in this study. The methodology is applied to high strength low alloy s690 steel parts produced with WAAM. First a part level thermal process model is utilised to predict the thermal history. Subsequently, a model is developed to predict the microstructure by modelling microstructure phase transformations. Based on thermal history and microstructure phase fractions, Vickers hardness is predicted. Predictions are validated with experimental measurements and observations obtained from a collaborating master thesis. Part temperatures of the thermal model agreed well with measurements. Although the predicted microstructure phase fractions show a lower ferrite content than experimentally observed, the trend of the microstructure phase fractions along the part height is the same in the prediction and the experiment. The predicted hardness is 49 HV higher than the measured hardness. However, hardness predictions and measurements show the same trend along the part height. The methodology to predict the thermal history, microstructure and hardness was applied on a study in which the height of a wall was varied and on a study on a geometry in which two walls cross each other at the center. For both studies the martensite content decreases over the part height, whilst the bainite content increases over the part height. This is caused by the decrease of cooling rate over the part height. Hardness also decreases over the part height. For both the change in microstructure phases and the hardness over the part height, the largest change was observed at the bottom of the part. For the study with the crossing geometry, no significant difference was found for the microstructure and hardness between the center and side of the crossing.","Wire and arc Additive Manufacturing; Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Thermal history; Microstructure; Hardness; Thermal modelling; S690; Avrami; quiet element method; Goldak heat source model; Additive Manufacturing; Microstructure prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

As people age many become less mobile, leading to loneliness and a deteriorating health. Subsequently elderly often end up in nursing homes; an experience which is unpleasant as well as expensive. Assisting the elderly with robotic devices can help increase their mobility, therefore reducing healthcare costs and increasing elderly satisfaction. This thesis follows up on the master thesis of R. Berci-Hajnovics, where she sets out to design a novel concept for an assistive, motorized shopping trolley aimed at reducing the physical burden of carrying groceries over uneven terrain. In the current thesis, a control system for the proposed assistive shopping trolley is designed with the goal of attenuating disturbances like road inclination and added mass on the trolley’s dynamic behavior. Predictability of its behavior is considered as well in order to gain the confidence of the elderly user. An analysis of potentially suitable control types for implementation in the assistive shopping trolley has been performed, wherein their characteristics are compared on several different aspects relating to their predictability and disturbance attenuating behavior. Based on this analysis, a controller implementing a so called Disturbance Observer (DOB) is deemed best suited for the job. A DOB uses a dynamic model of the controlled plant to estimate the influence of present disturbances on the plant dynamics. This estimation can consequently be used to produce an opposing force, thereby canceling the effects of the disturbances. Furthermore, a DOB includes a filter which provides additional capabilities, such as robustness to uncertainty within the model and filtering of high-frequency noise in the data to further increase its performance. A DOB is most suitable for the current cause due to its overall adequate performance with respect to the imposed criteria, as well as its relatively high disturbance attenuation accuracy due to its ability to use the plant’s dynamics in making an estimation of the disturbances at play. Following the results of the analysis, this thesis proposes the implementation of a controller including a DOB for application in the assistive shopping trolley. In its design, a model of the trolley dynamics is being used, which provides a basis for the controller’s internal dynamic model. This model is furthermore used as a representation of the trolley plant in a stability analysis of the trolley-controller closed-loop behavior. The model is based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum on wheels, with an additional constraint on the position of the trolley handle to represent the interaction with the human user. By neglecting minor, nonlinear dynamic effects such as variations in the trolley’s orientation and air drag, the general model is simplified to a linear equation. The controller’s internal model is constructed to represent the trolley’s nominal (desired) behavior, determined to be that of an empty trolley on a flat road, by substituting corresponding nominal values in the parameters of the general model. Subsequently, criteria for robust stability of the trolley-controller’s closed loop behavior are determined using a H_∞-approach; In this approach the system’s behavior is analyzed given the ‘worst-case’ uncertainties. Furthermore, the system’s performance with respect to disturbance estimation and noise filtering is analyzed using its loop transfer function. The insights gained from these analyses are used in the design of the controller and to make recommendations for future work. The obtained controller is implemented in the Robotic Operating System (ROS) framework; an open-source robotics platform which makes use of a decentralized system of processes, simplifying the creation and sharing of complicated software structures across a wide variety of applications. For this purpose, the controller is subdivided into multiple elements, each performing a specific function. These elements, called ‘nodes’, are submitted to a variety of unit tests to verify their proper implementation. The controller’s performance is put to the test in simulation using ROS’s accompanying simulation engine, ‘Gazebo’. The controlled trolley’s acceleration error is compared to that of a regular trolley in several scenario’s, where different types of disturbances are applied. The results show that the controller indeed reduces the effects of disturbances on the trolley’s behavior; the controller is able to recognize the trolley’s changing behavior due to an encountered disturbance and it correctly attenuates its effect by ordering the required compensatory motor torque. More research is required with respect to the effect of uncertainty within the model dynamics to ensure stability and controllability of the trolley system. Moreover, the closed-loop system response should be tested in the presence of various types of noise to determine how well the current results apply when the controller is used in a real-life scenario.","Assist; Control; Disturbance Rejection; Elderly; Trolley","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://gitlab.com/v.heusdens/assistive-shopping-trolley-control Controller- and simulation code accompanying this thesis work.","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This thesis analyzes and models a DCFC where the electrochemical oxidation of carbon to carbon monoxide is taken into account, which is an endothermic reaction. The heat necessary for this reaction is converted directly into electricity, so the DCFC can achieve a theoretical reversible efficiency of &gt;100%. The heat is provided by a solar reactor, which converts methane into hydrogen and solid carbon by thermal decomposition. The formed solid carbon particles is fuel for the DCFC. The produced CO at the anode of the DCFC is used in a WGS reactor where it reacts with steam to form hydrogen. In this way we present a Multi-Source Multi-Product energy system. The MSMP energy system is modelled in Cycle Tempo and we use the modelling results to perform a feasibility study and exergy analysis. The exergy analysis showed that the solar reactor contributes the most to the total exergy losses in the system. Considering the fact that the WGS reactor is a mature technology, the solar reactor is based on existing technology (CSP), and solutions to challenges in heat handling and mass transfer are available in the process industry, the MSMP energy system has high potential to be technically feasible. We calculated that the unknown costs of the MSMP energy system need to be lower than 29.8 €/MWhp to be competitive with conventional hydrogen production methods and need to be lower than 34.8 €/MWhp to be competitive with a gas fired plant. Based on current market prices for methane, hydrogen and electricity in Algeria and based on the fact that we were able to determine the costs of the majority of components in the MSMP energy system, it is likely that the unknown costs will not exceed our determined maximum unknown costs. This shows the economic feasibility potential. We calculated that the MSMP energy system emits 37% less CO2 than hydrogen production by steam reforming which indicates the sustainable potential. We concluded that the concept favors a geographical location with high solar density, good gas infrastructure and stable politics. Algeria seemed to meet all those demands. Therefore we conclude that our MSMP energy system has high potential to be socially feasible. We concluded that our MSMP energy system has high potential to be technically, economically and socially feasible.","Fuel Cell; DCFC; MSMP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This is because CNNs have the ability to surpass human accuracy in classication of images. For improving the measurement setup of gravitational waves, low latency CNNs inference are researched. The CNN needs to process data from images to enable certain automatic controls for the control system. The data of these images need to be processed within 0.1 ms from the moment of taking the image to the control system obtaining the result of a deep neural network. Hardware acceleration is needed to reduce the execution latency of the network and reach the 0.1 ms requirement. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in particular have the ability to provide the needed acceleration. This is because FPGAs have the ability to create highly customised layers of the network and obtain the lowest possible latency. To reduce the design eort and complexity of the machine learning design, Xilinx introduced the FINN (Fast, Scalable Quantized Neural Network Inference on FPGAs) framework. FINN is an end-to-end deep learning framework that generates data ow-style architectures customised for each network. To establish if FINN can create the required ultra low latency CNN, some of FINN pretrained networks are used. The rst neural network investigated is the Tiny Fully Connected (TFC) network. The TFC network is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for MNIST classication with three fully connected layers. The other network investigated is the convolutional neural network named CNV. CNV is a derivative of the VGG16 topology. The VGG16 topology is used for deep learning image classication problems with multiple convolutional layers. By using the analysis tools included with FINN, it can be determined if FINN is able to create the required ultra low latency CNN. The TFC network can be parallelised to a total of 5 expected cycles, with 1 expected cycle per layer. One cycle for the input quantization to standalone thresholding, one for the output layer and nally three for the fully connected layers. For the CNV network on the other hand, the initial convolution layer is unable to go below 8196 expected cycles, because of certain bottlenecks with FINN. These bottlenecks occur because of how FINN implements certain layers, moreover because certain layers can simply no longer be parallelised to lower the latency of that layer. To see if the CNV could achieve the latency requirements, a software emulation of the execution of the network has been done. This emulation showcased that by continuously increasing the parallelisation parameters, together with increasing clock frequencies, it is possible to create an ultra low latency pipeline of a CNN.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In recent years, Shared Mobility-on-Demand systems have emerged as a great method for door-to-door transportation. Studies have shown that it is possible to route vehicles and assign requests to vehicles efficiently in large-scale systems. These studies commonly report one-dimensional performance metrics such as average vehicle occupancy, service rate, or average waiting time. We repeated a case study using a state-of-the-art Fleet Management Framework and focused on the distribution of the service level over the operation area. We observed that the chance of receiving service in a low demand area was much higher than in a high demand area. Going from this observation, this research’s objective was to research how the state-of-the-art framework can be adjusted such that the rejection rates are more evenly spread over the operation area. We developed different methods that adjust the decision of which mobility requests are serviced or which trips are selected. The methods work such that a request located in an above-average rejection rate area has an increased chance of being serviced. Similarly, a trip that goes through an area of above-average rejection rate also has priority. We set up a Discrete Event Simulation that simulates a Shared Mobility-on-Demand system to research the effects of our added method compared to the original framework. We simulated an artificial city and New York City. The Gini index was used to measure how evenly the rejection rates were spread over the operation area. In many cases, our methods were able to lower both the average rejection rate and the Gini index. With this work, we showed that the state-of-the-art framework’s objective can be extended to a broader goal. This opens up new possibilities to tune the system to match specific transportation needs in different areas of a city.","ride-sharing; gini index; mobility-on-demand; fleet management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The modeling approach is based on a RANS turbulence model and a flamelet combustion model using a flame surface density approach in combination with multiple turbulent flame speed correlations to close the chemical source term. The Zimont turbulent flame speed correlation is used to model flame flashback and gain insight in the relevant mechanisms driving the occurrence of the instability. However, this approach has not let to a method to predict in ad- vance that a flame is near flashback conditions. This implicates that the flashback process (when mod- eled with this specific modeling approach) seems to occur after a certain threshold has been passed. When this threshold has been passed the flashback process is self-amplifying. The ability of the mod- eling approach based on the Zimont correlation to predict flame flashback is compared to experimental data. Based on this comparison it is concluded that the numerical model performs fairly well. The most notable result is the flame regime map which shows that the numerical model is able to capture that an increase in the hydrogen concentration in the fuel leads to an increased flashback propensity, which was also seen in experimental results. Furthermore, high hydrogen concentration fuels are character- ized by high flame speeds and, if sufficiently lean, by a Lewis number lower than 1. In combination with differential diffusion this leads to the thermal diffusive instability. At an attempt to improve the nu- merical model, two turbulent flame speed correlations that account for these effects were selected and implemented in the numerical model. However, these correlations did not lead to an improved ability of the model to predict flame flashback and flame shape. This reinforces the initial findings that the numerical model with the Zimont turbulent flame speed correlation already performed fairly well.","Flame flashback; CFD modelling; RANS turbulence modelling; Combustion Instability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The costs of ICT have been rising for several years. Legislation is decentralized to municipalities and this makes ICT more complex for municipalities.

However, there is no political legitimacy because municipal councils have no or little affinity and knowledge of ICT. Moreover, small municipalities have less knowledge to tackle the increasingly complex ICT and lack the resources to recruited specialists. In order to tackle these problems, municipalities choose to collaborate, but collaborations seem not to have an unambiguous positive effect. This research creates insight in how a municipal ICT strategy is formed. It has been found that municipalities have to deal with many external influences and that through collaboration the most important factors of the ICT strategy process can be influenced. However, opting for collaboration results in trade-offs to be made. With the insights from this research, municipal councils can gain more in-depth knowledge about the ICT strategy process, which will result in a more legitimate strategy.

Adaptive Optics (AO) aims to correct for these aberrations by sensing them with a wavefront sensor and performing the correction with phase conjugate devices [18]. Various wavefront sensors have been designed and successfully implemented over the years, including the curvature sensor, interferometers, the Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensor and the pyramid sensor [7, 32, 40, 51]. In recent work the plenoptic sensor, an intermediate between the SH and pyramid sensor designs [10, 32, 37], has been proposed to improve on modern wavefront sensing. It has been reported to be beneficial in presence of strong or complex <br/>wavefronts, such as deep turbulence conditions [18, 47]. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the SH and plenoptic wavefront sensors, with the<br/>specific application on the correction of anisoplanatic aberrations that vary throughout the field of view. The contribution of this thesis to the field of AO is the development of a simulation toolbox in MATLAB. This toolbox is designed to simulate the SH and plenoptic sensors, providing a comparative study between the two. The comparative simulations reinforced results obtained from a corresponding Literature Survey. The SH sensor can outperform the plenoptic sensor on many occasions. If both sensors share the same microlens array (MLA) the plenoptic sensor scores worse in terms of performance metrics. By adjusting the MLA of the plenoptic sensor its dynamic range and sensitivity can be improved, such that it outperforms the SH sensor. Additionally, it was shown that the plenoptic sensor performs best for strong aberrations, simulated using<br/>randomly-generated Kolmogorov screens. On the other hand, it fails in the presence of weak aberrations where the SH performs best. The developed toolbox allows for iso- and anisoplanatic aberrations to be reconstructed in a single frame, by differentiating between aperture plane reconstruction and phase screen retrieval. Multiple approaches are implemented in the toolbox, such that different reconstruction methods can be selected depending on experimental conditions.","Adaptive Optics; Wavefront Sensing; Plenoptic Sensor; Shack-Hartmann Sensor; Anisoplanatic Aberrations; Simulation; Phase Reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Gielen, M.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Sustainable Rural Initiatives (SRI) is a non-profit organisation in Okana, a rural community in West Kenya. SRI provides the community members of Okana with opportunities to develop practical skills such as carpentry and tailoring. SRI also works with international partners with specific expertise to give local community members opportunities to develop skills they would otherwise not have had. In all these efforts, there is a strong focus on reflecting the culture, surroundings, and values of the community. Play is an important aspect of how children develop and make sense of their surroundings. Toys are tools through which play is facilitated, but making toys itself is a common form of play too. The literature on play suggests that by providing kids with joyful, engaging, iterative and socially interactive play experiences, adults can guide children’s play to help children develop skills directly involved with that play experience, but also more general learning-to-learn skills. My project had two goals; the first was to give children the opportunity to develop design skills in a fun and playful way. Design is an exciting medium for kids to develop several valuable design skills, that are broadly applicable. The second was to give SRI the tools and practical knowledge to provide children with design activities through which they can develop those skills, both now and in the future. To reach these goals I designed a toolkit, consisting of a manual and several videos, that allows SRI to organise playful design workshops for kids to help the children develop these design skills. In the workshops, the children design toys from materials such as clay and wood, that are available around SRI’s community centre. In the workshops the design process is structured in three phases. In the first phase, a topic is introduced through a video, that then poses several questions to help the kids discuss that topic. These discussions help them to make their goal concrete, as they practise working together. In the second phase they build and test their idea. The kids first gather materials, and then use those materials to prototype their toy. They practise making their ideas tangible and learn from making mistakes. Finally they present their designs to each other, allowing the others to ask questions and give feedback. In doing so, they practise their communication skills and their capacity to reflect. From the third workshop onward, the facilitator has to introduce the topic and questions to the children himself, replacing the video. The facilitator can find suggestions for topics and stories in the manual to help him come up with other challenges for the kids. This toolkit gives children in Okana a fun pastime through which they are introduced to the design process, and can develop valuable design skills. This toolkit has given SRI the knowledge and tools to host those workshops. It has also given SRI a model they can use to effectively transfer knowledge from external partners to the local community.","design education; learning through play; playful education; non-profit organisation; sustainable development; toy designs; children; Kenya; toolkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","-0.14595490998160826, 34.8732468153794"

To ensure safe integration into general aviation, it is paramount that MAVs are equipped with an autonomous detect and avoid system when flying beyond the visual line-of-sight of the operator. The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility of acoustic-based aircraft detection, which has generally been overlooked in favor of optical or radar-based technology. Effective sound-based aircraft detection on-board an MAV requires suppressing the dynamic ego-noise it generates during flight, which would otherwise pollute the recorded environmental sound. This paper proposes using a recurrent neural network to predict the generated noise, given a sequence of MAV flight data, so that it can be effectively removed from noisy recordings. For aircraft detection, a convolutional neural network in combination with Mel spectrogram features is designed to classify noise-free environmental sound as either aircraft or non-aircraft, achieving 97.5\% accuracy. To reconstruct the noisy environment of an MAV flight, these noise-free sounds are mixed with ego-noise at mix ratios up to 1.00. When evaluating in these mismatched conditions, accuracy decreases to 95.0\% and 47.5\% with- and without ego-noise suppression, respectively. Although ego-noise suppression can not prevent a drop in performance, the large difference between the mismatched conditions does demonstrate the benefits of the proposed denoising approach on aircraft detection.","Aircraft Detection; Sound Event Classification; Ego-Noise Suppression; Mel Spectrogram; Artificial Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-04","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One of these is the area of budget estimation which is currently fully dependent on a cost estimating professional. Due to the need for estimations that are effective and time-efficient, especially in the primary phase of a project, the potential of introducing a data-driven approach is explored through this thesis. The main objective of this research is the development of a data-driven model, in the form of a Virtual Assistant (VA), to increase the objectivity of the estimation of maintenance budgets of civil engineering structures. From a literature study it is apparent that a fitting data-driven approach for the development of this model is the machine learning technique Decision Tree Classification (DTC). The VA model is developed using historical data, in the form of past input and past output, to train the model and therefore make predictions. Data that is used as past output for this model is a budget range which is documented as a budget class and data that is used as past input is data that is ensured to be objective and gives a description of each bridge. In this case the past input data are the characteristics of the bridge which refer mostly to the dimension of the bridge, the NEN2767, which captures the decomposition and condition of the bridge and to a lesser extent the duration of the maintenance. Through exploring past cases the machine learns rules and predicts the outcome for a new case and therefore predicts the budget range. This shows in which range the budget guess of the estimator should fall. Generally in order to develop a VA model and make it applicable for industry use it is important that an organization that uses such model aligns their data storage with the DTC methodology. This means the introduction of standardizing data in classes and the introduction of standard procedures to document the data. Only when these elements are present within the organization, the data that is used for past input and output can be regarded as objective and the VA can fulfill its function which is to verify the budget estimators guess in an objective manner.","Machine Learning; Decision Trees; budget; Maintenance Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-12","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Tailings are the rock flour which result from the process of mineral extraction at a mine. This waste material is stored in tailings storage facilities, also known as tailings impoundments. These impound­ments gradually grow in size during operation as more tailings are produced and stored over time. These structures are however also prone to failure. Well known failures in the past years are that of the Feijão and Fundão dams in the Minais Gerais state in Brazil. Static liquefaction of the dams has caused mud­streams in which many people were killed and the environment became heavily polluted. This study researched the probability of rainfall­-induced static liquefaction, as meteorological causes have often been named the trigger of failure. The study was limited to upstream raised decommissioned dams in the Minas Gerais state in Brazil. An analysis methodology was established in which the needed rainfall intensity to failure was calculated for different durations of rainfall. In a geohydrological analysis, the Richards equation for unsaturated flow was solved, to model rainfall infiltration. A quasi­-2D procedure was implemented to allow for a computationally efficient solution. Following the results of the geohydrological analysis, a limit equi­librium method was employed to calculate the factor of safety against liquefaction of the dam. In this case, the undrained strength analysis was applied together with an effective stress analysis to model both liquefiable tailings and non­liquefiable tailings in the tailings storage facility. If the factor of safety was equal to a predefined factor of safety associated with failure, the failure intensity was found. The failure intensity was converted to a return period of failure by the application of the Gumbel distributions that are part of the intensity­-duration­-frequency curve of rainfall. These IDF­-curves describe for all possible combinations of intensity and duration the probability of occurrence. Integration of the IDF­-curve for the failure intensities yields the total return period of failure as a single perfor­mance indicator. The analysis was restricted to a period of 5 days of continuous rainfall (storm events) as evaporation effects were not considered and no longer rainfall events were observed in the precipi­tation data used. A series of sensitivity studies was performed to observe how rainfall influences the stability of a tailings dam. It was found that failure is attributed to a loss of suction in the unsaturated zone upon rainfall in­ filtration as well as a loss of strength due to mounding of the water table. Because of the low strengths that liquefiable tailings have, there was the tendency to develop deep slip surfaces below the phreatic surface, causing only marginally stable dams to be prone to failure because of rainfall infiltration. The factor of safety upon rainfall is reduced in the order of 2 to 5 % depending on the parameters used. The strength parameters were of the largest influence. Increasing the friction angle of the non­-liquefiable tailings by 10 % increases the return period of failure by approximately 400 years. The strength ratios used to model the liquefiable tailings are of even larger influence. Adjusting that by only 2 % leads to a jump in the return period of failure of around 1000 years. The chosen boundary conditions for the phreatic surface in the impoundment were also of great influence. A difference of 0.3 meters for the water table for a dam of 20 meters high brings the dam to marginal stability. Given the little sensitivity to storm events, it is recommended to shift focus towards the behaviour of the phreatic surface over longer simulation periods to model the effect of e.g. extremely wet seasons. In addition, construction defects should be considered in which perched water tables could arise, severely decreasing the stability of a tailings dam.","Tailings; Tailings dam; Static liquefaction; Rainfall; Return period; Extreme value analysis; Infiltration modelling; Stability; Brazil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This deliberate way of summarizing a business concept and the process that precedes it, add to why it is expected that the quality of business concepts will moreover increase.  In addition, this Explore approach should be implemented systematically and continuously and therefore an implementation strategy to realize the above mentioned is delivered. This strategy exists of four phases that all add up to the objective of ‘continuously generating business concepts that have the ability to disrupt’.  This project has been executed as a case study for Group Innovation of ABN AMRO. Nevertheless, the approach presented in this thesis can also be applied by other financial services firms since the approach does not involve any information that is specific and only usable for ABN AMRO.","disruptive innovation; Design Thinking; financial sector; Fuzzy front-end innovation; business concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Plugge, A.G. (mentor); Hakkert-Wichers, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">The e-commerce market is growing rapidly and PostNL continues to strive for delivery to the doorstep. The last mile of delivery is considered the most impactful part of the logistical chain. On top of environmental impact, the liveability of the city centre is challenged by bulky delivery vans rushing through narrow streets and blocking the way to deliver parcels in time. Municipalities have ambitions to expel unsustainable and big vehicles from their city centres, making it a pressing matter for PostNL to change its approach.    PostNL committed to deliver 100% emission-free and nuisance-poor in 25 Dutch city centres by 2025. Emission-free delivery is achieved through deploying an electric fleet, but nuisance-poor delivery asks for a strategy to reduce congestion and make traffic situations safer.  PostNL aims to deploy light electric vehicles (Licht Elektrisch VrachtVervoer in Dutch) in the last-mile but is unsure what type of LEVV vehicle must drive on what road type to optimally reduce nuisance. The vehicle options are a bike-type LEVV and a truck-type LEVV as PostNL is unsure which one to choose and by testing both a full coverage of street-types is possible.    This research showed what information must be gathered for PostNL to decide what vehicle would cause the least nuisance on a type of street. The information helps them create routes for a vehicle-type which would cause minimal nuisance, while still being efficient. The information is used to create a model of choice theory, which helps PostNL decide what LEVV should drive on what street to reduce nuisance. A roadmap shows how this model is digitised and automated to be future proof. Lastly, a communication strategy is made to make sure the system is communicated clearly along the process chain.   Desk research and interviews showed that by focusing on safety and congestion as nuisance, liveability is increased no matter the area within the city. The potential in reducing this nuisance while still being efficient was confirmed in a physical test with both LEVV-types compared to a traditional bus. Two vehicles were selected as models for the design (Fulpra Roll bike and CargoLEV truck).    A survey showed a higher satisfaction rate in customers who received their parcel through sustainable delivery, together with a high vehicle awareness this shows a potential benefit for PostNL in happy customers and reputation.    A first PDCA-cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act) was used to build the reasoning for choosing one vehicle over the other. City centre streets were categorised into six archetypes, on which every vehicle was judged on its potential to reduce nuisance while parking and driving.    The theory states that if a vehicle can drive and park nuisance poorly, it is the most efficient one as it can move fast through traffic and find a parking space in front of the door of the delivery, reducing walking time.    The second PDCA-cycle showed how this theory can be made into a model of choice which can be used to create routes in all cities.    Weighing factors drop density, street direction, stratona weight and traffic intensity are needed for a weighted calculation to benefit important streets in the calculation and advice. The shape of this advice and how it must be communicated along the process chain concludes this cycle.  In the last design cycle a tactical roadmap is created that shows how the system evolves into an adaptive and pro-active route planning tool supported and improved by future road work data and driver feedback.    PostNL ended up with a substantiated theory on vehicle choice and a roll-out plan for using it. Another benefit of this research for PostNL, besides supporting LEVV implementation, is that it supports the argument within PostNL for the value of nuisance reduction as a main KPI besides efficiency.   ","Last mile delivery; Model design; City logistics; Nuisance reduction; Sustainable delivery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Similarly, the shipping industry has to drastically decrease it's emissions. Rules and regulation on emissions are becoming more stringent. Moreover, the public and clients are demanding less pollution from ship operators. While many shipping operators are looking at a suited fuel alternative, no consensus has been reached on the best alternative to entirely dispose of harmful emissions from shipping in the long-term. Fugro is one of the ship operators interested in entirely bringing down the emissions of their vessels that are built from 2030 onwards and therefore this research is conducted. This thesis will research how and if Fugro can achieve the IMO target of 70 percent CO2 reduction in 2050, by deploying net zero-emission fuels in Fugro vessels as of 2030. An evaluation will be done to assess which alternative fuels are feasible and most suitable, based on current technologies and considering future scenarios around technology. The research will approach this problem by firstly conducting an extensive literature research into alternative fuels and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis methods. Thereafter the Fugro fleet, potential future vessel developments, future scenarios and alternative fuels are researched to set up a technical framework for this case problem specifically. With this technical framework in place, the method itself is conducted. This is done in two ways. First, by conducting a qualitative approach using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, also involving stakeholders from Fugro and the industry. Second, by carrying out a case application of the four best alternatives on a representative Fugro vessel. This approach, including a qualitative approach extended with a quantitative one results in a substantiated advise. Both methods complement each other on points where the other falls short. The AHP includes stakeholders and takes into account criteria that are difficult to quantify. The application approach tests the feasibility of the proposed alternatives and tests the potentially subjective or intuitive outcome of the AHP method. With methanol scoring well in both approaches, the conclusion of this research is that methanol is the advised alternative fuel for future Fugro vessels. Liquid hydrogen is the highest rated fuel alternative from the AHP. The application example shows that this fuel isn't able to comply with the required Fugro operability however. Contrary to that, ammonia is a highly rated alternative in literature and is also scoring well in the application part of this thesis, but is not rated as a suitable alternative by stakeholders in the AHP. The last considered alternative in both parts of the method is synthetic diesel, which is comparable to MDO. This fuel scores well in both methods but is considered to remain too expensive to become a viable alternative in the coming ten years. In this thesis, estimates of different fuel options are presented and some design concepts and considerations on the different alternative fuel applications are given. The next step for Fugro would be to work out a methanol concept, by going through the design spiral more than once and work out the design choices and challenges this fuel brings. With alternative fuels being more expensive than MDO, this thesis pointed out that the economic speed will change when using alternative fuels, which is another point that requires more research. While the AHP proved to be a suitable way to score fuel alternatives while including stakeholders and assessing criteria qualitatively, it also pointed out that it is difficult to solely base an alternative fuel advise on this method. Potentially, the AHP results would improve when the questionnaire is simplified by reducing the amount of considered criteria.","Alternative fuels; Shipping; Offshore; Zero-emission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Kwakkel, J.H. (graduation committee); Kolk, W.P.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The world is currently a rushed environment; things change faster than ever. Technological innovations impress us again every year. Many innovations that enhance society are the result of innovating organisations. These organisations invest in innovative solutions, for their own good, but eventually also for the greater good. Allocating resources to these investments is therefor an important aspect of innovation. This thesis has been conducted to gain more insights in the resource allocation process, the process which determines the investments executed in organisations. The resource allocation process model as defined by Bower and Gilbert helps managers and executives to create awareness about allocating their valuable, finite resources. Bower and Gilbert tried to create a simple model without a lot of predefined mechanisms, but their model lacks detail and therefore the inner mechanisms of each sub-process of the resource allocation process is a gap in the literature, there are some scholars who describe specific cases in detail, but there is no generic interpretation. This research gap has been the foundation of this research and has led to the development of an agent-based model of the resource allocation process. Within the development of the simulation model all core processes had to be defined in detail. And since the objective is to develop a generic simulation model, the core of the sub-processes and inner mechanisms had to be defined. One of the most important mechanisms is the way an organisation can influence their own resource allocation process. This happens through structural and strategic context determination. With these two types of context determination, organisations can influence their allocation process in order to either execute more induced strategic action (action which corresponds with the defined corporate strategy) or more autonomous strategic action (action which lies outside the defined corporate strategy). Which type of strategic action is necessary depends on the specific situation of an organisation. With the knowledge of these two kinds of determination the sub-processes and their mechanisms had to be defined. Definition of these sub-processes happened through literature research. There are two topics within these processes: Definition and Selection. The basic principles of these two topics had to be known in order to be able to formulate a possible generic detailed definition of the sub-processes. This resulted in a conceptual model which, through formalisation could be implemented. Before implementing an agent-based model the detailed definition had to be complete in order for the model to function. The implemented model has been tested on known phenomena derived from literature. The model is able to reproduce the expected strategic action under specific organisational context settings. Within a dynamic environment the model reproduces expectations for the contextual settings. And the mechanism of an increasing opportunity space can be reproduced. The model is unable to fully capture the effect of communication and divergence on the autonomous strategic actions. These results support concluding that the developed agent-based model is able to simulate the resource allocation process of a hypothetical organisation. With the model, the boundaries of the resource allocation process can be explored on proportion of control versus organisational learning. The model is also be able to analyse the effect of organisational changes on the strategic actions. Currently the model as implemented is unable to simulate a real-world case, but the potential for use within organisations and further research is certainly there.","Agent-Based Modeling; Resource Allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Baggage handling systems in airports are generally over-designed and only need to work at full capacity for a couple of months during their lifetime. To cope with varying demand, flexible baggage handling systems are being developed which use Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) to handle a required capacity. These AGVs transport bags throughout the baggage hall by optimally getting assigned bags to pick up and finding optimal, conflict-free paths to their destinations. Generally, in such systems or other warehousing applications, these two processes, task assignment and path finding, are optimized separately. This research therefore proposes a hybrid online Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) algorithm that jointly optimizes both. To achieve this, two existing algorithms have been combined. First, the Improved Distributed Market-Based algorithm (IDMB) is used to provide optimal task assignment by letting AGVs<br/>communicate with each other. Second, to provide coordination, we implemented Enhanced Conflict-Based Search with Task Assignment (ECBS-TA). ECBS-TA, however, only lets AGVs attend to one task whereafter the algorithm stops. We therefore modified it into a lifelong version, letting the AGVs continuously move between pickup and drop-off points, to function as an MAPD algorithm. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) has been created and implemented in a conceptual baggage hall using highways to guide the AGVs. To analyse the hybrid MAPD algorithm, it has been compared to two other algorithms in which task assignment and path<br/>finding are performed separately. The analysis indicated that the hybrid MAPD solution was able to deliver better operational capacity at the expense of scalability. Its runtimes were found to be higher, but overall still ensured real-time applicability.","Multi-Agent System; Multi-Agent Path Finding; multi-agent pickup and delivery; Task Allocation; Combined task assignment and path finding; Warehousing; Baggage Handling System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vermaas, P.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Anno 2021, designers engage with questions of increasing complexity and impact. Designers are involved in creating services and systems that reach beyond an individual user, ultimately reshaping society. This realisation motivates the question of how designers should deal with the accompanying responsibility. The domain of Design for Values (van den Hoven et al., 2015) encourages conscious innovation with the call for a deliberate design for values and advocates a thoughtful stance towards the creation of artefacts. As social design is concerned with societal well-being and commitment to design for the common good (Tromp, Hekkert, 2017), it is regarded as a specificity of Design for Values. This thesis opens up the conversation of impact in social design practices by researching how designing for values is validated within social design projects. Although the mission for conscious design is vital, frameworks to assess the adequate operationalisation of values are lacking, and impact methodology in the field of social design is fairly under developed. Hence, measures to guarantee value manifestation and safeguard engagement with claims made are missing. For this reason, both domains of Design for Values and social design will be enhanced by a framework that supports assessing the design for value, as a result enabling validation of value realisation within design projects. The Value Validation Framework introduced in this thesis presents the structure of reasoning towards a valid value claim. It is argued that to make a valid claim, designers must specify their value claim in terms of effects on behaviour, substantiate a claim with proper evidence and provide justification for these specifications. This ensures construct validity for the claim being made and above all, that designers discern what they are factually achieving. As a result, the framework administers a critical stance towards the impact that can be ascribed to projects. First, the Value Validation Framework was constructed out of theoretical models enriched with qualitative data from an explorative study among professionals. This framework enabled to assess social design projects and was used in the second part of this thesis, the case study research. In this study, five social design projects are assessed concerning the validity of their claim to realise a particular value with their design. The study provided an increased understanding of how designers structure their design projects and this information was used in the third part of this thesis. In which the analysis was used to reflect on ways to make valid value claims. Social designers involved in the case study research endorse the unique perspective that the Value Validation Framework provides and emphasise that the conducted analysis has provided a meaningful assessment of their social design projects. A commitment to value claim validation provides an opportunity for social designers to enhance their considerations of effect and focus on the substantial impact they accomplish. As a result, contributing to a renewed perspective on how they can enhance their design project and fundamentally commit to a better world.","Social design; Design for values; Validation; Validation method; Framework; case study; Impact; Impact Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The latter features drag crisis behaviour, resulting in significant drag reduction at the critical Reynolds number. However, whether the aforementioned assumption is valid and whether a drag crisis along the different body parts occurs, so far remains unknown.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to investigate Reynolds number effects along the leg of a skater mannequin. To do so, potential drag crisis behaviour is studied via robotic Particle Image Velocimetry and Infrared Thermography for speeds ranging between 5 m/s and 25 m/s. The boundary layer state and the critical velocity distribution along the leg, based on the wake width variation, are evaluated for the bare mannequin and the mannequin wearing a skating suit optimized for ∼ 15 m/s.<br/><br/>Results reveal drag crisis behaviour along the knee, lower and upper leg. Furthermore, the flow topology is not only governed by the leg geometry, but also by streamwise vortices. These streamwise vortices cause an increase of the wake width below the calf and a reduced velocity deficit behind the upper leg. Most significant differences in wake width between the bare and the dressed leg are observed at 17.5 m/s. The latter observation is also supported by the Infrared Thermography results.<br/><br/>It can be concluded that the flow across the leg partly differs from cylinder flow, mainly because of streamwise vortices that locally affect the drag crisis behaviour. <br","Skating aerodynamics; Reynolds number effects; Drag crisis; Wind tunnel testing; Infrared Thermography; Particle Image Velocimetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vagus nerve has the widest distribution in the parasympathetic system and it oversees several important bodily functions such as the control of mood, immune response, digestion, and heart rate. The potential of vagus nerve neuromodulation in the medical area is huge with these functions and has been studied for decades. The traditional way of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is electrical stimulation which requires surgery to implant the stimulator under the skin. It has been proven that electrical VNS has therapeutic effects on many diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, refractory epilepsy and depression. However, there are still several limitations to electrical VNS. Inside the vagus nerve, there are several fibers and some unwanted fibers will be stimulated because the spatial resolution of electrical VNS is relatively low. Side-effects including cough, throat pain, voice alteration, and dyspnea are caused due to inadequate spatial resolution. Compared with the electrical approach, focused ultrasound wave could provide a high spatial resolution and does not require any surgery. It has been proven that the ultrasound stimulation could modulate the neuron activity and applications have been conducted in the stimulation for the central and peripheral nervous system, including the vagus nerve. Using a 2-D phased array, the ultrasound VNS system could also tune its focal spot in a 3D space without any mechanical controlling stage, which enables the VNS device to be portable while remaining its precision. The detailed modulation mechanism of the VNS is still under discovery and the ultrasound VNS devices are of great potential with the advantages mentioned above. In an ultrasound VNS system, the transmitter is an essential section which determines the accuracy of spatial resolution and the amplitude of focal pressure. In this work, an ultrasound transmitter channel circuit is designed to be implemented in a 2-D phased array ultrasound VNS system.","vagus nerve neuromodulation; ultrasound; transmitter; 2D array","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M.

However, international endeavors that initiate or install such technologies in developing nations often fade over time or even fail. This thesis evaluates what the common barriers and drivers of entrepreneurs of such edeavors are. In addition, various sustainable and circular business model frameworks and business model frameworks specific to developing nations are assessed based on their advantages and disadvantages. The results of these two research topics are translated into a list of criteria for a business model framework that addresses the barriers that are commonly faced by entrepreneurs of such endeavors and allows integrating goals of sustainability and circularity. Based on these criteria, a new business model framework is developed: the Modular Business Model Framework (MBMF) based on the Business Model Canvas by A. Osterwalder and Y.Pigneur with modules frugality, sustainability, circularity and socio-cultural aspects. The MBMF has six steps that help guide the entrepreneur through the process of setting up a business. Each module represents a larger target or goal that the entrepreneur wishes to achieve and the order in which they are applied represents their priority. The applicability and user-friendliness of the MBMF is tested by completing the case study: introducing biogas at the Nicolas Robinson School in Mek'ele, Ethiopia. Due to the civil war in Ethiopia, this case study is not implemented in the field; however, it allows to determine points of improvement for the MBMF. In addition, a review panel of experts is asked to give an indication on the tool's potential and user-friendliness. The review panel sees the MBMF as a well-argued tool with a broader potential than presented in the thesis due to the exchangeability of the modules. Several main points of improvement include limiting the amount of steps to three and adding emphasis on business resilience. The framework is also quite time consuming, but the entrepreneur is in control of the level of detail that is applied and the time spent on the framework is constructive towards setting up a new business. Future research should improve the framework based on the determined points of improvement. In addition, the tool should be tested in several real-life business endeavors and any feedback should be taken into consideration to improve the tool. Finally, the option to establish a 'library' of modules should be explored to make the MBMF applicable to almost any business.","Biogas; Entrepreneurship; Business Model Framework; Drivers and Barriers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

As a result, they take less care of themselves, by eliminate their needs. Therefore, the aim was to design a serious game for parents with children with special needs and should be playable during retraite weekends within the constraints of the COVID-19 measurements. However, due to COVID-19, there was no opportunity to create a physical serious game that can be played during the retraite weekends, thus an online version was created that could easily be converted to a physical design. For the analysis phase, to understand the issue of self-care, five CSN parents and an orthopedagogue were interviewed along with literature research. Also, serious gaming was studied by literature research, reviewing examples of serious games, trying out serious games, talking with experts and being a facilitator of an online serious game I signed up for. With the insights of the analysis phase the design goal was translated in the following transfer effects: 1) Create awareness about the importance of avoiding an unbalance in energy to increase self-care, 2) Create awareness about having the option to increase self-care, and 3) Alter to or reinforce the attitudinal change towards a creative problem-solving attitude for providing self-care. During the project, the game environment changed from real-life to the online platform Miro. A brainstorm session and co-creation followed, aside from individual brainstorming and with other creative minds. Three concepts were developed and tested and in collaboration with Ontzorghuis one was selected. The Bekommerkom game was created after four iteration cycles with different prototypes and four tests. The last two tests were with CSN parents. Based on the reactions of the players and observations I can conclude that the Bekommerkom game is evaluated as successful in achieving the transfer effects. To achieve this, both a well-prepared facilitator and a video call service (e.g. Zoom) are required. Playing the game made the players think and reflect on their life. Many shared to do things differently concerning self-care and thought about possible solutions to improve their situation (like asking for help). Also, Ontzorghuis is content with the result and wants to further develop the Bekommerkom game and a physical version of it in the future.","CSN parents; Serious game; Mental health; Online serious game","en","master thesis","","","","","","In collaboration with Ontzorghuis.","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Bos-de Vos, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","We live in a world in which chronic diseases are on the rise. Yet, improving personal health behaviours is a long-term goal, that is often undermined by alluring offers that provide instant gratification and other more pressing day-to-day matters. Often it is not the intention that is missing to change personal health behaviours, but there is much evidence that highlights a gap between what individuals intend to do vs. what they actually do (Sheeran, 2002). There are many existing behaviour change tools that provide the “solution” to a problem, yet no one solution will be effective for everyone (Hekler, Burleson, &amp; Lee, 2013). Especially when considering health behaviours, that need to be sustained over time to have significant impact, it is prudent that interventions fit our goal, our ever changing lifestyle and are enjoyable (Phatak, 2019a). An alternative approach is to give individuals the tools to self-experiment with interventions, and through this, find interventions that work for them to establish a lasting effective behaviour change. This project explores self-experimentation (SE) as a method for helping individuals change their personal health behaviours. A research through design approach was used to answer the questions: (1) What is self-experimentation and why is it needed? (2) What does self-experimentation result in and how can it contribute to individuals achieving sustainable health behaviour change? And (3) how can design facilitate individuals to self-experiment? In alignment with these questions, this project yields three significant outcomes: First, a new take on self-experimentation was discovered; one that addresses the limitation of existing approaches and caters to the needs of people trying to change their health behaviours. User research into how people go about navigating their health behaviour, and the kind of evidence they need to make decisions revealed that: (1) People generally navigate their health behaviour through intuition. (2) People who practice self-experimentation, are not seeking to answer a hypothesis, but simply want to find an intervention that works for them, explore different options and learn about themselves in the process. (3) People can determine whether or not an intervention works for them simply by trying it out. This reveals if the intervention helps them achieve their goal (i.e. is effective), whether it fits into their lives and with their personality (compatibility) and whether they enjoy it. These insights created a premise for a new approach which was labelled “Explorative Self-experimentation”. It differs fundamentally from the existing “quantitative” method in that it omits the key ingredient of a data-driven scientifically rigorous objective evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, and instead harnesses the intuitive evaluation formed by a user’s lived experience. By observing 14 participants undergo four weeks of self-experimentation, a set of 13 phenomena were uncovered that engaging with Explorative Self-experimentation results in. These can be summarised in five statements: Explorative Self-experimentation helps people (1) take incremental steps towards a long term goal, through (2) trial and error to success. It (3) leads people to get to the heart of the issue, (4) discover new perspectives and attitudes towards their own health behaviours and (5) find support along the way. These phenomena were linked to prominent behaviour change theories in the context of health in order to establish how explorative self-experimentation can contribute to individuals changing and maintaining their health behaviours. Finally, the research through design process involved creating three sets of prototypes that explore how to facilitate individuals to self-experiment with health interventions. The design process and the testing of these prototypes revealed three lenses from which to tackle facilitating self-experimentation: (1) designing for the process, (2) designing for different scenarios or stages of change and (3) designing for the underlying needs and values of people trying to change their health behaviours. As part of this third lens, I presented seven concrete starting points for designers to facilitate self-experimentation, linking the underlying values and needs to key ingredients design can provide. The compilation of these outcomes aspire to answer the research question of how design can facilitate SE: Designers can provide guidance through the process, designers can help initiate SE, help people maintain their efforts over time to find something that fits, or help turn fitting solutions into habits. Designers can cater to needs and values by providing guidance, incentives and inspiration over time, by making room for personal growth and flexibility, fostering personal attachment and by forming a resilient mindset. In conclusion, this thesis uncovers the potential of Explorative Self-experimentation and how to facilitate it. It presents a meta-strategy for helping individuals change and maintain personal health behaviours, and through this hopes to contribute to improving health both at an individual and societal level.","Design; Behaviour change; self-experimentation; Research through design; health; health behaviours; explorative; method; facilitating; human-centred; sustainable behaviour change; personal health; design research; Chronic Disease; Intention action gap; persuasive design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","Pride and Predjudice",""

The downside of this process is that conversion rates are low, meaning the resulting product stream is a complex gas mixture consisting primarily of reactants and by-products and a relatively small amount of product. This study focuses on the development of a new downstream separation process to capture ethylene from a mock-up reaction mixture (mole fractions C2H4/CO2/CO/H2/H2O : 20/55/15/15/5), based on low driving forces and suitable for application in a 100kW test case within the e-Refinery. An extensive literature study of numerous separation techniques for gases was conducted and adsorption was chosen as the most suitable option. After screening of various adsorbents, active carbon was selected as the most potential sorbent. Based on a selectivity analysis, the primary focus was on the behaviour of C2H4/CO2 on active carbon. Using a simple, custom-build set-up, transient breakthrough experiments were performed for this gas mixture and the resulting selectivity for an equivolume feed, yielded a lower separation performance than expected based on the ideal adsorption solution theory, respectively a selectivity of 1.5–1.7 versus 3.2–3.5. Additionally a theoretical model was developed using MATLAB, which described the velocity profile inside the adsorber column and could qualitatively predict breakthrough behaviour. Further analysis led to the conclusion that for a more accurate quantitative match between experimental and numerical results, isotherm parameters should be obtained from the same type of active carbon. Ultimately this technique could be used to increase the ethylene content in a CO2-bearing stream and pave the way for a new, energy-efficient method to obtain hydrocarbons, ethylene in this case, from an electrolyzer cell.","Adsorption; Ethylene capture; Breakthrough times; Activated carbon; Separation technology; e-Refinery; Numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-02","","","","","",""

This tool creates a parametric model and optimizes this model to its costs. The connections in the tool are limited to beam-column connections. <br/>The optimization starts with the input variables of the model, the most important input variable is the type of the beam-column connection. This can vary between a hinged, semi-rigid or fully rigid connection. Other inputs are the list of profiles that need to be considered, the loads acting on the hall and the main dimensions and topology. <br/>With all of these inputs the parametric model can be created. This model is then put into the finite element software RFEM, which calculates all the internal forces and deformations in the structure. Then with python code created for this thesis the strength and deformations for the structure are checked according to NEN-EN 1993. In case the structure is not sufficient the profile sizes are increased. This keeps increasing until the structure is sufficient. For the connection design used in this study a database is created with all possible bolted end-plate connections of the four different connection designs used in this research. Of all these possible connections the stiffness and bending moment resistance were calculated with the component method. These values are added in the database. <br/>With the selected connection input a list is created from this database with all the connections that have a stiffness within the range of § 10% of the wanted stiffness. Then for each connection in this list the cost is calculated. This list is then sorted on the costs from lowest to highest cost. After the complete connection list is created, the first connection of this list is checked in the component based finite element software IDEA StatiCa for the deformations and strength. In case the connection is sufficiently strong according to the Eurocode, the stiffness of the connection with the actual forces is checked with the component method. This is a python script created for this tool. In case the stiffness is not within the wanted range it checks the second connection from the list. After the connection loop all the results of the optimized structure are saved. When all the results are saved, the loop is repeated for different topologies and different connection types. With these results the most cost-efficient structure design can be found including the connection design.","Automation; KBE; Steel structures; End-plate connections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This project was part of the master’s thesis for the TU delft and has been performed in collaboration with Norbert Alblas and the Fieldlab UPPS. Due to the increasing intensity of the game, injuries are becoming more common among goalkeepers. These include finger, hand and wrist injuries, which have a five times higher occurrence in goalkeepers than in any other player on the field. The goal of this project was therefor to design a strong, comfortable and reliable form of wrist protection for the professional goalkeeper, that they can wear with their goalkeeping gloves. The wrist protector should limit the critical movements while still allowing enough range of motion for the goalkeeper to perform their tasks. On top of this, the wrist protector should be easily donned and doffed and should last the goalkeeper for at least two years. Literature research, interviews with experts and tests were performed to learn more about the context, stakeholders and injuries. Through a survey (n=18) it was found that the majority of the goalkeepers had sustained a wrist injury before and tried to protect their wrists from further injuries. A range of motion test showed that goalkeepers need movement in the flexion direction to perform their tasks. Through literature research and interviews with a hand therapist it was found that the extension direction has to be obstructed to avoid hyper extension of the wrist as this the most common cause of wrist injuries. After creating a current and envisioned use scenario as well as a program of requirements, many ideas were created through brainstorming, sketching and prototyping. Six concept directions were evaluated with a hand therapist, a professional goalkeeper and a list of wishes derived from the program of requirements. The final concept is a personalized wrist protector that uses collision between protection pieces, positioned on the back of the hand, to limit movements in the extension direction. The concept consists of four layers with the top layer being the protection pieces. The protection pieces are designed to create a smooth arc into the limited extension position. Using a parametric model and a 3D scan of the goalkeeper’s wrist, a fully personalized wrist protector was made. The protection pieces are connected to a non stretch fabric layer to allow for flexion of the wrist. Underneath the fabric layer is a thin rubber layer that dampens the movements. The last layer is an under-glove that ensures correct placement and easy donning and doffing of the wrist protector. The design has been evaluated based on the use scenario and program of requirements as well as through testing with a professional goalkeeper and an interview with a hand therapist. The final concept was perceived as a wrist protector with great potential in its functionality. Especially the freedom of movement in the flexion and deviation directions was described as beneficial compared to other preventative techniques and wrist braces.","Wrist injuries; Goalkeeping; Wrist Protector; Design; Parametric Design; Fieldlab UPPS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This was examined through a survey that assessed the acceptance and use of online food delivery platforms, a prime example of multi-sided platforms. <br/>The cultures do have significant differences, but their impact on the acceptance and use of online food delivery platforms was non-significant. The acceptance of online food delivery platforms still followed a 10-year different diffusion, but the significant differences on macro-level cultural dimensions did not relate to this acceptance.<br/>An interesting conclusion to this project is that the countries, expecting to have similar cultures, are significantly different and the data gathered proves to be more substantial than this project could investigate. The UTAUT2-model did<br/>show a significant acceptance and use of online food delivery platforms, which shows that the online food delivery platform has successfully expanded cross-culturally in the case of the Netherlands and Germany.","Multi-sided platforms; Culture; Online food delivery platforms; UTAUT2; TAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In this research, the NSR is defined as consisting of the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The NSR is characterized by the increasing use of their considerable offshore wind potential, its current decommissioning developments of coal and nuclear energy, and its history in supplying, transporting and consuming natural gas.<br/>Within the NSR, there are different visions on how to integrate and leverage the full potential of<br/>offshore wind. This research focuses on how these coexisting visions can be made more compatible; by being able to exist or occur together without problems or conflict. Of particular interest to us due to its large economic benefit is the repurposing of gas infrastructure.<br/>Electricity and gas infrastructure are interrelated by electrolysers producing hydrogen gas using<br/>electricity and gas-­fueled power plants producing electricity. Focusing on the integration of offshore<br/>wind in the energy system and the envisioned role of gas infrastructure, this research initially identified several important themes in different energy visions, such as the locations envisioned for placing<br/>electrolysers. In short, these themes entail both technologies, infrastructure choices, socio­economic<br/>drivers, policies and regulations.<br/>Subsequently, this research concluded that some themes are envisioned differently by various actors. These differences lead to multiple types of (in)compatibility of the different envisioned future<br/>energy systems in the NSR. In order to answer our main research question, the current state of compatibility in the NSR is characterized. This is done by subdividing the different identified themes into<br/>four different groups with varying (in)compatibility levels termed ‘Group A. Celebrated themes’, ‘Group<br/>B. Themes where actors envision the same approach’, ‘Group C. Themes with competition between<br/>different types of approaches’ and ‘Group D. Themes where there is no co­existence possible’.<br/>This research concludes that there are differing visions of themes in the NSR, that for a large part<br/>are based on fixed underlying societal and geographical themes. It is therefore impossible for actors to collaboratively pursue one uniform compatible energy integration vision, with the exact same<br/>details envisioned by every actor in the NSR. Therefore, this research recommends collaborative futuring, defined as maintaining one’s vision whilst considering other existing visions within the relating<br/>geographical and dimensional (gas, electricity, hydrogen, offshore wind, etc.) scope. Considering<br/>the four previously mentioned groups, when one is ‘collaborative futuring’, one accepts that not every<br/>theme can develop into a group ‘A. Celebrated themes’, but that one must prevent themes developing into or being a group 'D. No co-existence' theme. In order to gain insight into how different<br/>themes can be collaborated upon, this research has designed a ‘collaboration framework’ to structure<br/>the (in)compatibility levels of different themes.<br","North Sea; offshore wind energy; Hydrogen; system integration; gas infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis develops a test framework for Commercial Of The Shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)receivers on Nano satellites of the Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) to be used for scientific applications. This thesis aims to provided answer to the suitability of this data for scientific application. We have analyzed that the current generation Skytraq single frequency receiver, mounted in previous INS-1A to INS-1C missions, has with an accuracy in the meters range insufficient position accuracy to be used for scientific applications. Nevertheless, based on historical mission experiences and design constraints, a receiver-antenna system selection has been executed. Using this system as an example configuration, a test framework has been setup to analyze influential design and system configuration parameters influence on the GNSS receivers for future missions. The test setup consist of a series of static tests that enable to research the hardware configuration, such as the influence of a ground plane, and the data processing options, such as filters for the data and the choice of atmospheric models. It is complemented with a dynamic analysis of the receiver simulated performance in orbit using a GNSS simulator. Multiple data series were obtained for each individual test of the framework. These data series were analyzed with a developed data handling protocol in which multiple data processing software packages were used. In order to obtain comparable results in all test series, average deviations of the position fixes in the test periods were calculated and analyzed. This leads to a number of conclusions: The current antenna mounting on INS-1C is less than optimal and a ground plane would enhance the antenna performance with 20%. The raw data are essential for scientific experiments. However, they can most likely be limited to those obtained from GPS satellites excluding GLONASS and other GNSS constellations. It does pay off to include low viewing angle measurements for optimal results. The ionospheric models are indispensable to achieve sub meter accuracy with single frequency receivers.","GNSS receiver; Dual frequency receiver; CubeSats; NanoSat; GPS; Glonass; Orbit determination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Three failure mechanisms could occur due to overflow: full erosion of the soil of the dike, macro instability of the levee if too much soil is eroded away, leading to insufficient counterweight on the inside of the levee, and surface slip failure due to reduction of strength of the dike by flow of water in the dike core. Prevention of failure can be achieved by either keeping the water away from the berm surface or holding the soil particles in place while the water flows alongside it. The desired repair is an emergency repair that can placed quickly during a storm, or between two storms to prevent a damaged levee from failing. This is a temporary repair that will later be removed for full reconstruction of the levee. This provides constraints to the installation and repair procedure.<br/>To decide which solution is best, 10 concept solutions are compared based on their score in the Multi Criteria Analysis with 8 weighted criteria. The solution with the highest score is the best solution according to the Multi Criteria Analysis. The selected repair option is to locally cover the damaged area with flexible overlapping sheets of Tyvek®. This is a light and thin material that can easily be transported and cut to size at the location of the repair. These sheets can be easily secured against flow loads using Gripple anchors, while pins are used to keep the Tyvek® in place during windy conditions. An installation plan and cost breakdown was made. Using 3 m wide Tyvek® rolls, the costs would be around 19.19 euros per meter height.<br/>The damaged areas of the levee are covered with Tyvek® which is a waterproof, damp open material. This prevents the penetration of water into the core through the damaged areas. The Tyvek® also prevents the exposed soil from being eroded. Moreover, Tyvek® is a very strong material that won’t be torn off. As there is no strength reduction due to water penetration or further loss of surface material the chance for macro instability is minimized.<br/>First, a design was created, with components dimensioned for a dike stretch in the Hedwigepolder. Subsequently, the design was validated with tests. Including two types of damage. The first was removal of a 2 by 2 m grass layer (0.1 m thick) at the top of the dike and the second was a dug-out step-section across the entire width of the dike with a height difference of 0.5 meters at the toe of the dike. Only the second damage went through the clay layer and into the sand core of dike.<br/>During and after the tests some important observations were made. During all test volumes the plastic sheets were kept in place due to the anchors and pins. Some pins however, came loose due to vibration of the sheets (we presumed the cause of vibration is flow of water between two sheets or turbulence of water). The trench of the lower damage was partly washed away by the water. The erosion of soil in the trench did not result in changing the stability of the top sheet. At the lower damage the plastic sheet was torn off after a tear of 1 m was made with a knife.<br/>Our solution is designed to protect any dike from macro-instability by keeping the water flow away from the berm. This is done by layering multiple sheets of plastic foil over the inner berm, fastened with ground anchors and pins. The solution is a durable and reliable design due to proven waterproof, damp open and UV resistant properties, together with Gripple's demonstrated anchoring capabilities. Another major advantage of our solution is that the repair of the damage is selective, i.e. the solution is applied only to the parts of the levee where damage has occurred. In case of only localized and small damage to the levee, the costs and workload are very minimal compared to other solutions that are applied to the entire surface area of the levee.","Flood defences; Dike reinforcement; Overflow","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Polder2C",""

Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are the number one attack target on the internet. The situation will become worse as there will be an expected 40 billion IoT devices in 2025. IoT bot activity represented 78% malware network activity or detection events in carrier networks in 2018. The vulnerability and large volume of IoT devices make them a likely target for cybercriminals in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The rise of IoT is increasing the volume of DDoS attacks. A lot of (critical) infrastructure are therefore susceptible being shut down by DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks are commoditized with booter services, which perform attacks on targets in return for money. This allows a wider audience to utilize DDoS attacks as the only necessary prerequisite is money. These services have increased attack frequencies and attack power of the attacks. The DDoS-as-a-Service landscape has mainly used amplification attacks to take down their victims, however, it is yet unclear if they are also utilizing the growth of IoT for their purposes. This research will look at the impact of IoT-based DDoS attacks on the victims, with the main research question being: What patterns of commoditization and victimization can we observe with IoT­-based DDoS attacks compared to amplification attacks? Conclusively, vulnerable IoT devices are already a serious threat. They are commoditized and they bring significant differences to DDoS attack characteristics and victimization patterns. As DDoS remains an arms race where adaptation is important, this research showcases a concrete example of how emerging technology can change the existing marketplaces and attack patterns. It also showed its value by looking at IoT from a holistic view to gain understanding of the technical as well as the social impacts. However, more research is needed in this field as the quickly changing field needs to be monitored. Questions still remain which factors can explain the country-level effects in more detail.
