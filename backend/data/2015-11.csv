(mentor); Tiso, P. (mentor); Goosen, J.F.L. (mentor)","2015","Micro air vehicles (MAVs) are small aircraft that are promising for search and rescue missions or remote observations of hazardous or inaccessible areas. Currently one of the problems MAVs face is the limited action radius. To increase the action radius, a more energy efficient MAV is needed. This can be achieved by exploiting the resonance of the structure that couples the actuator and the wings. A MAV that brought this concept to practice was designed and manufactured by C.T. Bolsman [1]. The developed prototype uses a flapping wing actuation mechanism producing enough lift to overcome the mass of the resonant structure, but not enough to also lift the actuator. A way to increase lift is to create a more effective flapping wing motion. Investigations carried out within the Department of Precision and Microsystems Engineering (PME) at Delft University of Technology show that a constant velocity of the sweeping (flutter) motion between stroke reversals increases the effectiveness. The function that ideally matches this velocity profile is a triangular-shaped displacement function in time. This work focuses on obtaining a triangular-shaped function for the angular displacement at the end of a resonating beam. This is not a priori granted, because the beam is subject to a harmonic forcing in order to be excited and kept in resonance. Provided that the system operates in its linear regime, the response of the beam, over time, will be a harmonic motion. Yet, by exploiting the geometric non-linearities, it is possible to retrieve a triangular motion as displacement profile, while the input remains a harmonic torque. In this work, the answers are given to the following questions: What causes the geometric non-linearities? Which beam cross-section maximizes the geometric non-linearities? Past work showed that geometric non-linearities arise from the longitudinal stresses induced by the axial non-uniform shortening of the structure over the cross-section. In this work the formulation of the non-linear stiffness is provided, together with the formulation of the uniform torsion stiffness and the stiffness caused by warping. Collectively, they yield the total torsional stiffness of the beam. With this knowledge, the author proposes an analytical model of a beam under torsion and an asymptotic approximation to its solution with the help of a perturbation method, the so-called method of multiple scales. This analytical model is derived for optimization purposes due to the low computational costs associated with the delivered dynamic responses. However, the derived solution of the analytical model is an approximation, so the results are verified with a more reliable, but computational expensive method: the finite element method. Consequently, a finite element code is developed and a beam element that can handle warping and geometric non-linearities is implemented. Next, both models are verified with the finite element program ANSYS. In the last part of the work, the analytical model is used as a basis for the optimization. Some approximations are made to enable the computation of a fine grid of the various crosssectional features and their corresponding degree of triangularity of the response over time. Finally, the optimal cross-sectional features are found. The corresponding dynamic response is, as expected, a triangular-shaped function. Next, the approximations are verified and some recommendations are provided regarding an already manufactured MAV based on torsion. Lastly, recommendations for future investigations, although outside the scope of this project are provided and a point of attention is noted regarding buckling of thin-walled structures.","non-linear; thin-walled; resonance; torsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

These vehicles can be used to perform dangerous and costly inspection procedures in structures with difficult access instead of human operators, but they still need a close monitoring. This thesis addresses the problem of using exclusively sensors on board UAVs to derive attitude determination tools and trajectory tracking strategies. Firstly, this work discusses the perception of the outside world by the vehicle and the formulation of a mathematical description containing information regarding its position and attitude relative to the structure. For this purpose, a geometry is set and the best fit to the data provided by a LiDAR sensor is selected, after a robust outlier filtering process. With this information, several methods for obtaining the attitude are proposed. These include a fast and comprehensive yaw estimator, based on continuity, and a closed-form solution for the Wahba's problem and a nonlinear filter for a full attitude estimation, both on the group of rotation matrices. A significant effort was devoted to the analysis of the entire procedure through simulation, from the creation of the LiDAR data to the application of the methods, for validation purposes. Both simulated and experimental results are provided for the performance evaluation of the perception algorithms. Building on these results, a nonlinear control strategy is designed with the objective of providing an accurate trajectory tracking control relative to the structure, with guaranteed asymptotic stability.","UAVs; LiDAR sensor; geometry fitting; attitude determination; Lyapunov stability; trajectory tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2015","In recent years the use of co-processors to accelerate specific tasks is becoming more common. To simplify the use of these accelerators in software, the OpenCL framework has been developed. This framework provides programs a cross-platform interface for using accelerators. The ?-VEX processor is a run-time reconfigurable VLIW processor. It allows run-time switching of configurations, executing a large amount of contexts with low issue-width or a low amount of contexts with high issue-width. This thesis investigates if the ?-VEX processor can be competitively used as an accelerator using OpenCL. To answer this question, a design and implementation is made of such an accelerator. By measuring the speed of various components of this implementation, a model is created for the run-time of a kernel. Using this model, a projection is made of the execution time on an accelerator produced as an ASIC. For the implementation of the accelerator, the ?-VEX processor is instantiated on an FPGA and connected to the host using the PCI Express bus. A Linux kernel driver has been developed to provide interfaces for user space applications to communicate with the accelerator. These interfaces are used to implement a new device-layer for the pocl OpenCL framework. By modeling the execution time, three major contributing factors to the execution time were found: the data transfer throughput, the kernel compile time, and the kernel execution time. It is projected that an accelerator based on the ?-VEX processor, using similar production technologies and without architectural changes, can achieve 1.2 to 0.11 times the performance of a modern GPU.","?-VEX; rVEX; OpenCL; pocl; accelerator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor)","2015","Although FMCG brands today regularly launch limited edition products, there are currently not many theoretical discussions on this type of product introduction. To better advise its clients, CARTILS, the client of this project, is interested in gaining more knowledge about limited edition packaging from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Closing this knowledge gap will be useful for developing a packaging strategic plan and for enhancing CARTILS’ current design tool, which is solely based upon practical experience. Contributing to CARTILS’ expertise in limited editions, this project aims to uncover patterns and key attributes from existing limited editions and consecutively verify if it is consonant with consumer appreciation. The result from this project provides a comprehensive knowledge and a guideline for marketing and design teams in designing and making a decision when launching limited editions. Launching limited edition is a one of many strategies for achieving marketing objectives regarding branding or sales. It can be used as an offensive strategy as well as a defensive strategy. Different brands should use different design strategies in creating their limited editions. This is because each brand has different memorable assets. In order to have the most communication impact while still be recognisable, limited edition design should respect brand’s most recognisable key elements. The results from consumer evaluation indicate that different brands, with different product recognition and different key elements of recognitions, cannot design their limited edition packaging to the same extent and not every design direction works for every brand. Before designing a limited edition pack, a brand should evaluate how recognisable its product is and what are the key elements of recognition the product has.","packaging; limited edition; vodka","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

This resulted in a conservative thick walled structure which is heavy and expensive. The first objective of this study was to redesign the reference structure for an optimized weight by not limiting the design to D/t criteria. The second objective was to adopt longitudinally stiffened tubular member design for the main tubular parts of tripod structure. From the study it is concluded that a significant weight reduction is achieved by not limiting the tubular design for D/t ratio.

(mentor); Creusen, M.E.H. (mentor)","2015","This project focused on an analysis of the unmet needs of 3D printing shop owners, as well as the needs and concerns of the end customers in a 3DP e-commerce context. The goal of the product is to create a design solution for fostering a 3D printing marketplace business for project client - Triple 3D. The report explains the research analysis, conceptualization and the final solution developed as a graduation project of the Master in Strategic Product Design of the Industrial Design Engineering Faculty at TU Delft. This report elaborates on the current situation of B2C 3D printing market. The result indicates that the current B2C 3D printing designs and services are mainly used by early adopters, which is mainly ‘makers’ only. The future business potential of B2C market is still remain unclear since the early majority have relatively low acceptance rates on 3D printing products at the moment. Little insights from both designer and end customer’s side have been captured which increases risks for marketplace players such as Triple 3D. To create a successful business, the project seeks for a solution for helping the designers (shop owners) to offer better 3D printing designs that fulfil the unmet needs of customers. Therefore, the objective was set on creating a strategic solution that can foster the marketplace business by assisting designers to create market-driven product. During the exploratory phase of the study, the thesis project intended to first, conducting both internal and external research to understand the current situation of the B2C marketplace market. New opportunities and challenges that Triple is facing are concluded in the SWOT analysis. Afterwards, a more concrete market direction of Triple’s marketplace was defined by screening and evaluating all the potential product categories. A decision was made that Triple’s marketplace will go for the feminine market direction, targeting on three main product categories - phone accessory, household product, home decor. Then, two customer researches were conducted in order to discover the user insights that can drive innovation. Both designers (shop owner) and the end customers were invited to the research. Based on research, the market position was defined to focus on ‘creative market’. The core of the business is to bring more creative and exclusive designs at a more approachable price overtime to eliminate the gap between current offerings and the needs of our target customers (female who aged between 20-35). A set of design challenges were created for guiding the ideation phase. The final design is a holistic service system that can assist shop owners making better design decisions was created. Designer not only will get real time market insights from the Triple 3D’s system, but also can get direct feedbacks from (potential) customers. In addition, a unique mass-customization service powered by Triple 3D will be introduced on the marketplace to fulfil the unmet needs of the end customer. It allows end customer to create their own personalized gift at a approachable price. This is achieved by combining a selected mass-produced item with a 3D printing design from the design pool. This mass-customization service becomes another unique selling point to attract more end customer to experience 3D printing designs. Finally, an implementation map to give guidance for getting all the stakeholders on board was created, including marketing strategies that aim at reaching to more potential shop owners and create awareness among end customers.","3D printing; marketplace; customer needs; user research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","SPD","",""

While traditional companies focus on measuring the well-being of an employee by factors like one's salary and social standing, research has shown that factors like the office environment, work delegation and office ethics have more effect on an employee's well-being. Thus, this thesis focuses on the concept of facet well-being which deals with the comfort of an employee due to the change in physical environment. A literature study was done where it was found that thermal comfort has the most impact on the well-being of a person in the context of facet well-being. Also, various factors affecting thermal comfort was researched and narrowed down to age, gender, food, clothing and exercise. The aim of this thesis is to answer the main research question i.e., ""How can a self-reporting mobile phone application be used to get a measure of perceived temperature?"". To answer this research question, a self-reporting hybrid mobile phone application was developed using Apache Cordova and Bluemix, where the business logic of this mobile phone application involved asking questions based on the aforementioned influencing factors. An experiment was then conducted at IBM to get a measure of perceived temperature of their employees using this mobile phone application and verify it's relationship with the influencing factors. In addition, temperature sensors fitted on Arduino boards were used to measure indoor temperature. A novelty in this thesis is the development of a self-reporting mobile phone application which may be the first of it's kind solution to get a measure of thermal comfort of a person in a computer science domain. Also, the requirement of this thesis was that the experiment should be conducted in an uncontrolled environment which would give its results more credibility as it explores thermal comfort in a practical scenario. From the results obtained after the experiment, it was seen that a self-reporting mobile phone application can be used to get the information about the factors that influence perceived temperature of an employee and in the future it can be used to improve his/her well-being.","Thermal Comfort; Self-Reporting Mobile Phone Application; Office Space; Experiment; Statistical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Master of Science Computer Science","",""

In addition some important insight is also given regarding the setting up of appropriate values for various gust defining parameters.<br/>The gust detection techniques are developed into computational codes and applied over different data sets. A comparison between these techniques highlights the pros and cons of each one of them. The peak to peak method and the velocity increment method provides accurate information about the maximum wind speed acceleration within a small time interval. Other methods like peak over threshold and the acceleration over threshold methods are useful to detect specific type of wind gusts above a certain threshold.<br/>Wind data sets sampled at high frequency resolution and from different geographical locations were obtained and analyzed through these gust detections algorithms. Among these locations are the offshore wind farm at Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ), IJmuiden and the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR) which are a representative of a near offshore, far offshore and an onshore location respectively. By using a uniform gust threshold criteria for peak over threshold and acceleration over threshold methods, a comparison between different locations reveal that the maximum gusts were detected for IJmuiden which generally has higher wind speeds throughout the year.<br/>For each location, the total number of gusts detected have been combined to obtain a mean gust shape. Furthermore, the maximum wind gusts are selected from each month and compared with the standard IEC gust shapes.<br/>The available high resolution wind data is for a duration of 1 year only which is not sufficient for the prediction of a maximum 50 year gust. However two different approaches are discussed to demonstrate the procedure. A statistical approach involving the extrapolation of data to predict the amplitude of maximum 50 year gust highlights the need for the availability of long term wind data. The analytical approach involving the calculation of the return period of different gusts is also explained and the results presented within this report are promising to continue further research within this domain.<br/>The techniques, findings and conclusions obtained through this research work can be further tested and eventually utilized to compliment or improve upon the existing extreme load cases of the wind turbine design standards.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Also, the fold geometry has been reconstructed in 3D using outcrop and seismic data. The project is mainly focused on the prediction of the fracture distribution in different domains of a fold based on the stress distribution in the layers of the fold during folding and in the present day structure. But rather than modelling fractures explicitly, stress distributions were analyzed which are indicative of fractures. We model the stress distribution throughout a reservoir-scale outcropping fold to identify heterogeneous stress domains as a proxy for fracture trends. It will ultimately help in identifying the areas where fractures could contribute to flow. 3D forward modelling of the fold geometry indicates that displacement along the fold is not sufficient to capture the fold geometry, suggesting that underlying salt movement contributes significantly to deformation. Geomechanical modeling in JewelSuite confirmed the presence of different fracture orientations in the layers based on analysis of Principal stress orientations at different depths of model. Dependency of fracture orientation on applied stress ratios was shown through an MS Excel study (1-D model) in the thesis. The results of the excel study were matched with the 3D models prepared in JewelSuite which proved its validity.

(mentor)","2015","One of the daily operations that a civil airplane goes through is the turnaround of ground handling process or what commonly known as the turnaround process. By improving the performance of the turnaround process, there would be multiple benefits for the airlines and the airports, costs can be saved and more profit can be created due to higher useability of the aircraft. Also the punctuality of the airlines and the airports can be enhanced by decreasing the amount of delays caused by the turnaround process. According to Kenya Airways (KQ), in 2010-2011 the turnaround process is the second largest contributer to delays after network connectivity which accounts for about 28% of their total delays. This proves how significant the performance of the turnaround process might be to the airlines as well as to the airports. Most available literatures on the turnaround process focused on reducing the turnaround time, or improving its punctuality. The novelty of this MSc research is to determine a strategy that improves the performance of the turnaround process based on all its value drivers from the perspective of stakeholders. This has led to the formulation of the research question which is stated as follows: “How can a change in value be measured for relevant stakeholders within turnaround process when evaluating new ideas in improving its performance?” The methodology implemented in approaching this research and ultimately, answering the research question, is to develop a value model of the turnaround process based on value-focused thinking, specifically, value operations methodlogy (VOM). With this value model, the alternative strategies aiming at improving the performance of the turnaround process can be evaluated with respect to the current strategy. Eventually, the strategy that adds as much value for the relevant stakeholders can be determined. The turnarounds performed by KQ at Jomo Kenyatta International airport (JKIA) of Boeing 737-300 from January till June 2012, are used as practical case study in this research. From the results obtained from the calculations, It is recommended to implement lean production system within passengers boarding and disembark and to implement theory of constraints within catering and aircraft cabin cleaning.","turnaround process; value operations methodology; improvement techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","ATO","","Air Transport and Aerospace Operations","",""

Over the recent years, damping of mechanical vibrations is becoming increasing important to improve the reliability and performance of the aircraft systems and also increase the safety of passengers. As a response to these issues, much effort has been expended in the development and exploitation of damping materials. Among the various damping materials, piezoelectric particulate polymer composite have shown great potential towards damping due to the specialised damping mechanism based on the unique energy transferring effect between the viscoelastic polymer matrix and piezoelectric ceramic filler. As a results, the main objective of the master thesis is to develop a highly flexible and highly voltage sensitive vibration damper with piezoelectric particular composite. Lead free system with sodium potassium niobate (KNN) ceramics doped with lithium is identified has the suitable ceramic filler system applicable for this purpose. Hence, the effect of lithium dopant on dielectric and piezoelectric properties on the structured and random KNN/Epoxy composites is explored in order to identify the optimal ceramic filler composition with the highest dielectric and piezoelectric properties. To increase the passive damping potential of the composite, a flexible PDMS polymer matrix with excellent damping capabilities is selected and mixed with the optimal ceramic filler composition to investigate further on the piezoelectric voltage sensing properties in combination with the passive damping capabilities of the composite to be usable as vibration damper is presented. Finally, moving towards real-time application, feasibility study on processing relatively large area flexible piezoelectric sensor with high voltage sensitivity and capability of dampening vibrations is investigated.","lead free; piezoelectric composite; flexible","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Novel Aerospace Materials","",""

(mentor); Palardy, G. (mentor)","2015","The interest of the aerospace industry in thermoplastic composites has increased over the last years. One of the advantages of using thermoplastics over thermosets is the possibility to use thermoplastic welding as a joining technique. Ultrasonic welding is considered one of the most promising variants: it is very fast, results in high-quality welds, can be applied to any fibre and resin type, is easy to automate and makes use of compact tooling. Therefore, it is a suitable technique for assembly and spot welding. This thesis research aims to improve the current processes for ultrasonic welding at TU Delft, while keeping a close eye on the industrial application. The first part of the research was focussed on the energy directors (EDs): resin protrusions between the substrates that heat up before the bulk material in the laminates. Previous research at TU Delft has mostly used loose EDs, but for industrial purposes it is preferable to integrate the EDs into the laminates. In this research, two production methods were developed that are suitable for moulding slender ED strips onto laminates: the first with aluminium strips with holes, the second with an Invar mould in which slender grooves have been machined. Both were used in combination with neat PEKK foil. An issue that was encountered with both methods is the variability in the thickness of the strips, leading to uneven melting. A comparison was made between the welding process of integrated and loose EDs. Moreover, it was found that the loose energy directors outperformed the integrated energy directors in terms of joint strength. Next, the displacement ceiling was investigated: a maximum in sonotrode travel that occurs before the optimum weld stage has been reached. When this happens, it is more difficult to use displacement as a welding driver to create welds of high strength. It was found that there are two types of displacement ceiling. The first occurs when a single ED strip is used, or the strips are placed far apart and the flow fronts do not merge. The origin possibly lies in changes in impedance and friction of the energy director flow. The second type of ceiling occurs when multiple ED strips flow and merge, which only happens if the spacing between them is small enough. The flow of the EDs pushes into each other, increasing the impedance of the flow and preventing further displacement of the sonotrode. To overcome the displacement ceiling, new displacement-controlled welding strategies have been investigated. First, the vibration phase was stopped before the ceiling had been reached. This resulted in welds of poor quality and strength. By reducing the pressure, the welds could be improved, but not to a satisfactory level. In the second strategy, the welding pressure was increased during the vibration phase. It was found that it is possible to push through the displacement ceiling and use a higher displacement value as the welding driver, which improves the strength of the welds greatly. These results showed significant scatter in the strength, which could be reduced by preventing secondary welding.","ultrasonic welding; thermoplastic composites; carbon fibre pekk; energy directors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Structural Integrity and Composites","",""

(mentor)","2015","Professional cyclists show a big difference in descending abilities. Eventhough recently research has been conducted on the control of a bicycle [13,19], little is known about the techniques of descending in cycling [[3,6,22]. The aim of this study was to develop measurement equipment which can measure skill and perfor- mance in cycling during descents. The final goal was to measure differences between slow and fast descenders. On the basis of a literatur study [8], the important variables for descending were identified. The measure- ments equipment must be able to measure these important variables; roll angle, steer angle, rear and front brake force, location and forward speed of the bicycle. The roll angle was measured with infrared distance sensors, the steer angle using a string potentiometer and the brake forces with a aluminium tube instrumented with strain gauges. A high performance GPS was used to determine the location and speed of the bicycle and a mathematical model was used to translate the location of the bicycle into path coordinates of the track. Furthermore, a third-person video camera was mounted behind and above the participant to get a overall impression of the ride. An observation study with 6 professional cyclists has been performed. The professional cyclists rode each time the same descent track located at La Plagne, France. The track had a length of 1.0 km and a descent height of 67 m. Both the cyclists and their individual bicycles were instrumented with the measurement equipment. Each cyclist completed a minimum of 4 trials. The cyclists were instructed to go as fast as possible down the track, but they were confined to their own lane and not allowed to pedal. The mean time was 77.68 s and the fastest and slowest time were respectively 75.97 s and 80.32 s. The results show that the best indicator for the fastest descent time is the braking technique. A fast time seems to be highly correlated with a late braking point and a high braking force. Differences in the positions on the road were expected to influence the descent time, but unfortunately these differences fell within the measurement inaccuracy. Future research should be mainly focussed on improving the measurement equipment.","cycling; technique; descending; measurement equipment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Sports Engineering","",""

This pre-requested service offers an escort to children between the ages of five to fourteen, who travel alone. Children who recieve this service are called Unaccompanied Minors (UM). The current UMS is a complex process, which involves different actors (i.e. UMs, their families, KLM, other partneer airlines, Schiphol services, etc.) and interactions between them through many steps in the journey. The connections and procedures between these different components lack harmony and synchronization, which in turn adversely affects the performance of the service. In addition, UMS’s innovation needs have been overlooked as the service has not been included in KLM’s management priority list until today. Due to recent delicate incidents compromising the security of KLM UMS’ minors and the pressure of a revelling audit report on the service performances, the company decided to bring the service up to priority focus. This graduation project from the Master Design for Interaction from TU Delft complements KLM’s efforts to improve the UMS service. It does so through an analysis of the current state of the service, by researching opportunities for improvement, and by proposing a design solution to be implemented by KLM within one to three years. The final design solution consists on a new Product Service System based on an Application for KLM employees which could be integrated in the new employees platform “Appy2help” (starting piloting November 2015). This application will gather different functionalities that will facilitate the service performance on several levels. The application will be complemented with an “UM wristband” which will be delivered to the UM at the beginning of their journey and which will substitute most of the current paper work as well as optimize different steps of their journey. A new direct communication channel between families and the company was also created in order to keep them updated on the minor’s status among other extra services. The access to this new channel will be via KLM’s core application. The minors travelling alone will also have access to a travelling and entertainment application which would make their solo journeys much more enjoyable.","Unaccompanied Minors; product service system; wristband; children; service platform; staff workload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","","",""

(mentor); Staufer, U. (mentor)","2015","During the last ten years, open heart surgery has increasingly been replaced by minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which has three main advantages. There is reduced blood loss, small scars to reduce infections, and a shorter recovery time. However, MIS still lacks full surgical capabilities such as tool dexterity, tool-tissue contact force determination and tissue characterization. Tissue characterization in open heart surgery is performed by palpation, but during MIS artificial tactile sensing in a catheter tip needs to be used to determine tissue abnormalities and the effectiveness of thermal ablation. Thermal ablation in the heart is used to treat atrial fibrillation (heart rhythm disease) by destroying tissue and therefore blocking an electrical pathway. The treatment effectiveness is determined by measuring the resulting increase in stiffness of the lesion, which directly relates to the size of tissue that has been burned. There are currently no solutions available for this artificial sensing. Therefore the main goal of this research is to develop a catheter tip capable of force and soft tissue stiffness measurement in the human heart. During this research, such a catheter tip has been designed. Stiffness sensing is performed based on load-displacement determination, where the catheter is actuated ex vivo by a concentric tube mechanism in a displacement-controlled mode. Contact force measurement, between the catheter tip and tissue, is performed with a 3D magnetic Hall sensor and a permanent magnet, each attached to one end of a spring (resilient structure). The design has been prototyped and tested, and is able to discriminate between different stiffness values with high repeatability.","catheter; magnetic; stiffness sensing; force sensing; Hall sensor; indentation; minimally invasive surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micro and Nano Technology","",""

Meanwhile, the way people maintain their contacts is mostly through social media. This results in a gap of translating a handshake into a digital connection. Shake-On is a start-up that has come up with an answer by means of a smart bracelet. Their aim is to wirelessly exchange contact details between users wearing the bracelet. This exchange is triggered by the most common human gesture people use when introducing themselves: the handshake. This thesis will overcome two major challenges for Shake-On. First, no general pattern recognition method can be applied to detect handshakes. This is caused by the fact that handshakes gestures show large variations among individual persons. Second, the system should be robust to multiple handshakes happening concurrently. This applies to the scenario of more than two people shaking hands while standing close to each other. Contact details should only be exchanged between people that are handshaking, which requires handshake matching. Again, large variations in `handshaking style' make it a cumbersome task to identify matching handshakes. This thesis proposes a two-fold solution to address the above-mentioned challenges. The first part includes handshake detection, using new features for pattern recognition that are tailored to handshaking recognizing. The second part proposes a new method to perform handshake matching that overcomes the shortcomings of existing solutions. The work done in this thesis has led to the following results: 1. The developed detection method takes into account limited resources and is therefore suitable for implementation on a smart bracelet. Moreover, it shows similar performance as the state-of-the-art solutions, namely an accuracy of 95%. In contrast to existing solutions using 6 stochastic features, our solution uses 4 computationally lightweight features. 2.Being the first of its kind, the matching method proposes a novel technique that maps handshakes to an abstract binary format. This format is called peakmaps. Because it eliminates personal handshaking style, peakmaps result in a pairing accuracy of 80% compared to 24% using basic cross correlation.","accelerometer; electronic wearables; gesture recognition; wireless data exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor); Simonetto, A. (mentor)","2015","For energy management in wireless sensor networks, only the sensors with most informative measurements are activated to operate. How to select sensors that make good tradeoff between performance and energy consumption is what many researchers are focusing on. Existing solutions assume analog data model, i.e., the data from sensors collected by a center node, called fusion center, are analog measurements. In practical application, due to limitations of energy of sensors and bandwidth of wireless channel, original measurements are usually compressed before being transmitted to the fusion center. In addition, transmitted signals are usually distorted by wireless channel effects, therefore it is possible that the received data are corrupted with errors. In this thesis, we consider two compressive techniques: one-bit quantization and multi-bit quantization. In one-bit quantization, an indicator message is generated in a sensor according to whether the original measurement is larger than a threshold or not. In multi-bit quantization, the original measurements are quantized to multiple bits and only the most significant bits are reserved. The indicators or the most significant bits are then transmitted through realistic wireless channel to the fusion center for it to process. By these ways, the transmitted signals are digital, and they may flip into opposite values by the effects of wireless channels. For one-bit quantization case, we develop a sensor selection approach, based on convex programming. For multi-bit quantization, we extend the sensor selection to bit allocation and propose a novel algorithm to determine the number of bits to transmit for each sensors, which is also based on convex programming. In both cases we consider the effects of wireless channels, which are characterized as bit error rate. Particularly, for the multi-bit quantization, numerical results show that the bit allocation can further reduce the cost that we defined compared with existing solutions where transmitted data are assumed to be analog.","sensor selection; wireless sensor networks; bit allocation; bit error rate; quantization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Telecommunication","",""

Currently the wingbox structures, as other components, are manufactured out of composite materials to replace the metallic airplanes. Composites have the ability to be designed by defining the orientation and thickness of a laminate. This property can be used in a process to minimize the wingbox weight under aeroelastic loads which is called aeroelastic tailoring or optimisation. The main advantage of a lighter wing(box) design is the lower fuel consumption of the aircraft during its lifetime. Werter and Breuker (2015) have developed the Proteus tool to perform aeroelastic tailoring on a wingbox structure. An interface is created to export the wingbox model to Nastran using ModGen (Software developed by DLR). The Nastran model is further enhanced by using the internal gradient based optimizer to tailor the wingbox structure. Goal of this thesis is twofold. First the 1D Proteus model is verified using the extension to Nastran. Secondly the influence of engine position and sweep on the optimized wingbox weight of the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is investigated. The designed Nastran interface performs the optimisation. In the Nastran model the skin and spars are optimized for. Ribs should be present such that the cross-section does not deform too much. The ribs themselves are not optimized. No topology optimisation is performed, the dimension and locations of spars and ribs are inputs to the model. A linear analysis is performed in Nastran. Four different analysis types are defined: aeroelastic deflection, flutter, divergence and static point deflection. The tailoring will be performed under different optimisation constraints for each type of analysis. For the first type the strains should be below the allowable and the tip rotation may not exceed 12 $deg$. The second and third condition refer to flutter and divergence which may not occur for the given flight condition. The last case limits for example the engine displacement during landing. The strains are also limited for this load case. To verify the correct implementation of the model a verification procedure has been performed. For a simple rectangular beam the deformation is compared to elementary mechanics. In the next verification step a wingbox structure is considered and the results are compared to Proteus (Werter and Breuker, 2015). For similar flight conditions under a given Mach number similar results are obtained. The divergence pressure between the two models is comparable. To investigate the influence of engine location and sweep the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is taken as a reference. The Proteus model predicts analogous aeroelastic behaviour compared to the Nastran model. The Proteus model therefore is verified. For the optimisation six load cases are defined. These are derived from the flight envelope as set by airworthiness authorities. The load cases consist out of four aeroelastic flight conditions: cruise, symmetric push down and two different symmetric pull up conditions. Next a stability load case is added as no divergence and flutter may occur. The various engine locations on the OERM are optimized with and without landing load case to see the influence of landing on the engine location. The lightest wingbox design was found for an engine located around 70\% of the span. This design violates the landing load case. Considering the landing load case the lightest wingbox design is found at 50\% of the span. Compared to the baseline model a wingbox weight reduction of 18\% is achieved. If the engine is placed further towards the tip a lot of additional material is required for the engine to not hit the runway. An engine location further down the span is preferred as the engine has a relief effect on the wing lowering the (upward) deflection and thereby lowering the critical strains. The thickness and stiffness distribution creates a tip down deformation of the wing. Next the quarter chord sweep of the OERM is varied. For a swept forward wing the wingbox weight is higher compared to the swept backward wingbox design. Additional stiffness is required to prevent wing divergence. The optimum wingbox weight is found for a sweptback wing of 50 $deg$. Comparing the design to the baseline model a weight reduction of only 4.3\% is achieved. However sweeping the wing comes at the cost of a higher angle of attack during cruise as the produced lift reduces for higher sweep angles. As with the optimized engine location wingbox the stiffness and thickness distribution is as such that a tip down deformation of the wing results during the aeroelastic load cases. Performing an aeroelastic gradient based optimisation using Nastran is possible. Great caution is advised with the Nastran optimizer as the end result is dependent on the type of optimisation performed. The model can be further extended to take ribs and buckling into account. An external optimizer could be considered to have larger control over the optimisation process.","aeroelastic tailoring; Nastran; aeroelasticity; optimisation; wingbox; sweep; engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Stefanidis, G.D. (mentor)","2015","In the context of CO2 utilization, the electricity surplus from renewable energies can be used in a non-thermal microwave plasma reactor to reduce CO2 and produce chemical fuels. The chemical processes in non-thermal plasma are extremely complex due to the large number of excited species, radicals and ions that are present. Energy stored inside these energetic species can initiate reactions that in thermal chemistry are difficult to achieve. In the case of non-thermal CO2 microwave plasma, the energy stored in the vibrational modes can effectively stimulate dissociation reactions. Numeric models are being developed to get insights into this process and predict the performance of reactors under different conditions. However, the most recent kinetic model for CO2 dissociation in this type of plasma is highly complex and not suitable for multidimensional simulations. It considers +100 species and +10000 reactions. A reduced kinetic model is developed by only including dominant reactions and by grouping the asymmetric vibrationally excited states of CO2 into a fictitious species. The kinetic model is then reduced to 44 reactions and 13 species. Its validation is done in a 2D reactor model with computation times lower than 25 minutes. The results are in good agreement with those reported in the detailed kinetic model. Furthermore, it is shown that the reduced kinetic model can be adjusted to experimental results. Prospectives are given regarding the next steps in the development of self-consistent multidimensional models. The proposed kinetic model is intended for multidimensional simulations of non-thermal plasma reactors and facilitate the design and operation of these in industrial applications.","microwave plasma; CO2 dissociation; non-thermal plasma; non-equilibrium plasma; cold plasma; low-temperature plasma; microwave discharge; CO2 utilization; plasma reactor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Intensified Reaction and Separation Systems","",""

(mentor); Keijdener, C. (mentor); Metrikine, A.V. (mentor)","2015","In the past Jumbo Maritime has focused mostly on port-to-port transport of heavy loads. During the last decade their focus shifted slightly towards the offshore market: two of the J-type vessels have been outfitted with DP2 systems and deep water winches. The motion behaviour of these monohull vessels in offshore lifting operations, during which only small roll angles are allowed, is not considered to be optimal as the rolling motion often limits the workability. A survey of existing roll reduction systems (RRS) was conducted. Taking into account the given preconditions, two active anti-roll tank systems were selected for further investigation: U-tanks and N-tanks. Both systems create a stabilizing moment by shifting the centre of gravity of the tank by displacing water inside the hull. The displacement is controlled by adapting the air pressure at the top of the tank. The U-tank is a closed system where a horizontal duct connects water tanks located on each side of the vessel while the N-tank system uses two separated tanks with an open port to the ocean for the inlet of water. To model these RRS a 3 DOF (sway, heave, roll) time domain model in Matlab/Simulink was created. The hydrodynamic coefficients and force response amplitude operators (RAO) were extracted from output files of the radiation/diffraction panel program WAMIT. In order to calculate the motions of the vessel in the time domain, the Cummins equation was solved. The time consuming convolution integral was replaced by a 30th order state space system; a fairly new technique in ship motion modelling. Wave forces were modelled using the RAO’s. Validation of the ship model was done using Orcaflex. The U-tank and the N-tank systems were modelled using Bernoulli’s principle. The missing viscosity is captured using a discharge coefficient and empirical pipe friction. An initial design for both tanks based on literature and the infrastructure present in the vessel is created, with equal dimensions for both systems for best comparison. The two systems have been compared in multiple sea states, both regular and irregular, with various different wave periods, significant wave heights and headings. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for the main system parameters. In addition, workability analyses were done using scatter data from a West-Australian area. The two main conclusions drawn from these results are: 1. The U-tank is a more efficient system. 2. The initial design is not optimal. The U-tank is more efficient because the effective pressure (the pressure forcing the water in or out a tank) is calculated as the pressure difference over the port and starboard tank, while for the N-tanks it is relative to the atmospheric pressure. Because of this, the effective pressure is higher for U-tank resulting in an inflow velocity that is about 40% higher than for the N-tank. An improved design for the U-tank has been made based on the knowledge obtained in the sensitivity analysis. A final size of the system cannot be given as this is based on economic consideration which fall outside the scope of this report. Workability in beam waves for the selected area was improved from 43% for the base case to 94% with the proposed RRS. Lastly, the system was excited with an extreme load to analyse the effects of the RRS on the stability during an incident wave, but no unexpected behaviour was found.","anti-roll tanks; u-tank; n-tank","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Schweckendiek, T. (mentor)","2015","Some dike sections in the Netherlands failed to comply with the safety standards and one of the most promising countermeasures is the construction of retaining walls inside the dike. The Dutch design codes for dikes with retaining walls rely on Finite Element Analysis (FEM) in combination with partial safety factors. However, this can lead to conservative designs. For this reason, in this research, a reliability analysis is carried out with FEM calculations aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of reliability analysis for such a soil-structure interaction problem. The case study concerns a (river) dike with an anchored sheet pile wall modeled in PLAXIS. The sensitivity and reliability analyses were enabled by coupling the uncertainty software package OpenTURNS and PLAXIS through a Python interface. The most relevant (ultimate) limit states concern the anchor, the sheet pile wall and global instability (soil body failure). The case was used to investigate the applicability of the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and Directional Sampling (DS) to analyzing these limit states. Finally, also the system reliability was evaluated using sampling-based methods (DS). Due to the considerable number of random variables, before starting the reliability analysis, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each limit state. This indicated the most important soil layers to be accounted for and the variables to be considered as stochastic. The sensitivity analysis and later on the reliability analysis, were based on analytical formulations of the limit state functions. The anchor and the sheet pile limit states were formulated in terms of their yield stress; for global instability, loss of equilibrium in the FEM analysis was used to define failure. Moreover, the system’s reliability was evaluated by taking into account all the three limit states that were mentioned previously. The goal is to implement the coupling between FEM and reliability methods in order to analyze the components of such a system (i.e. anchor, sheet pile wall and dike’s soil body), estimate the probability of failure and identify the most important soil properties that affect the behavior of each component and the system as a whole. The results of this research can be used to assess and optimize the current design procedure for dikes with retaining walls.","finite element method; reliability; dike; sheet pile wall; system failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures & Flood Risk","",""

(mentor)","2015","In several electrical insulation components, such as cable connectors, joints and penetrators, various solid insulating materials are usually brought in contact, forming interfaces. The dielectric strength of these solid$|$solid interfaces is critical for the strength of the overall system. Especially in cases that the applied field has a tangential to the interface component, the solid$|$solid interface is regarded as a point of major weakness. Furthermore, these components are usually used in subsea applications and therefore the presence of water at the interface should be considered. The primary objective of this work is to examine how the elasticity of the solid material, the applied pressure and the interface condition is influencing the 50Hz/AC breakdown strength of the interface with a tangentially applied field. First, an prediction of the effect of varying elasticity modulus on the breakdown strength is attempted through theoretical modelling, adding to existing work. Following, the assumptions are verified by experimental testing in the High Voltage Laboratory of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In order to facilitate the execution of the tests, a customised setup is built in the laboratory and identical test-samples are produced and prepared. Different pressure levels are applied for each material combination (XLPE$|$XLPE, SIR$|$SIR or XLPE$|$SIR) and for each interface condition (dry, wet or lubricated). The test data are treated using the Weibull distribution and are compared based on the minimum, mean and $63^{rd}$ percentile value. It is seen that, generally, the minimum or the mean value is adequate to qualitatively compare the strength of different interfaces. Through the tests, it is also seen that the softer the materials that form the interface are, the lower is the elasticity modulus and thus the higher the breakdown strength. The influence of water and insulating oil at the interface is also explored through experimental testing in the lab. Therefore, the breakdown strength of wet and lubricated (oily) interfaces is examined and compared. Through analysing and accordingly presenting the test results, it becomes evident the the wet interface behaves poorly while the lubricated facilitates higher breakdown strength values. Further, the behaviour of an interface comprised by two materials with different elasticity is investigated (hybrid interface). The hybrid interface appeared to be the least affected by water, despite the low applied pressure.","solid interface; XLPE; silicon rubber; SIR; breakdown strength; elasticity modulus; pressure; subsea connectors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","MSc Electrical Engineering - EWEM","",""

Amongst others a bank shear stress parameterization need to be incorperated. This master thesis focusses on the outer-bank shear stress in order to obtain a parameterization for the outer-bank shear stress for naturally curved flows. The outer-bank shear stress is obtained from three-dimensional numerical computations. The numerical modeling is based on the Large Eddy Simulator, available at the Fluid Mechanics Department of the Technical University of Delft. Despite the considerable progress achieved, the software is still under development and a thorough review of its code is therefore necessary. The aim of this master thesis is to assess the effect of the outer-bank roughness, the outer-bank angle and the transverse bed slope on the outer-bank shear stress and to test and improve the performance of the boundary method of the computational algorithm. The magnitude of the outer-bank shear stress and the outer-bank cell increase for increasing roughness of the outer-bank, leading to a less uniform distribution of the outer-bank shear stress. The magnitude of the outer-bank shear stress decreases for increasing inclination of the outer-bank. For a more inclined outer-bank, the magnitude of the outer-bank shear stress is more dependent on the outer-bank roughness. No significant dependency of the distribution of the outer-bank shear stress on the outer-bank inclination can be found from the results. Inclusion of the point bar related transverse bed slope does not lead to a significant change of the magnitude and distribution of the outer-bank shear stress. Clearly, the helical motion outscores the effect of topographic steering. The boundary method adds the frictional effects of solid boundaries to the computational algorithm. The implemented boundary method, the Immersed Boundary Method, allows for the implementation of complex boundaries on a structured grid. Although in some cases the boundary method has a good performance, it is not very robust and prone to errors. It is recognized that the near wall velocity profile using the Immersed Boundary Method does not often coincide with the actual momentum `loss' at the wall. This problem, not recognized in earlier studies, can be attributed to inaccuracy in the description of the turbulent viscosity. The latter is understood and partly solved. The accuracy can be further improved by coarsening the grid or reconsidering the implemented turbulence closure model, the Smagorinsky Model. Different improved Smagorinsky Models are available.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

Electric power steering is hereby an exciting improvement to steering systems since the introduction of hydraulic power steering systems, which was first introduced as early as 1970s. Drivers desire hydraulic power steering behaviour because of its natural feel while providing assistance, but it has many disadvantages such as component lifecycle, oil leaks and power consumption. The use of electronic power steering provides the opportunity to remove such problems associated to hydraulic power steering and introduce benefits in terms of adaptability, comfort and safety. Since today's vehicles are making use of the by-wire technology for most components in the car, the additional electronic power steering will make it possible to have a full range of automated driving aids. Even though electric power steering comes with many advantages, there are still some disadvantages which are mentioned in numerous articles. These problems are mostly described as a lack in steering feel. More precisely it's described as if the front wheels are disconnected from the ground wheels. Many studies show different algorithms to minimise this, however it can be seen that even in the most successful products there is some complaint about this. An important tool to analyse this problem is the use of driving simulators. The implementation of a steering model that maintains high fidelity dynamics will bring many advantages. At the moment steering systems are developed by vehicle testing which is considered expensive and time consuming. The study of steering models will give more insight for the development in steering systems and the implementation in a HIL-simulator will ease the process of steering system development. This thesis will show the implementation of a steering model in a high fidelity steering simulator and it will propose a different method for solving the problem of steering feel loss. Finally it will conclude with driver in the loop experiments to show and evaluate the proposed method.","EPS; electric power steering; steering feel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

However, current flexible interposers, usually composed of metal and polyimide, have material physical limits, and heat resistance caused by pattern shrinkage etc. Vertically aligned CNT is an one dimensional conductive material with higher current density and longer electron free path than common used interconnection material, which could be used for interconnection. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as one of the most widely used elastomeric polymers in MEMS applications, has the advantages of low cost and easy fabrication. A flexible interposer combined the merits of CNT and PDMS was investigated in this work.","CNT; PDMS; flexible; interposer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EWI-ECTM","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Hicks, M.A. (mentor); Roy, A. (mentor); Schreppers, G.M.A. (mentor)","2015","With more advanced methods and increasing computational power, the simulation of reinforced concrete in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has become more and more realistic. In a non-linear analysis of reinforced concrete, cracking behaviour and the maximum load-capacity can be determined. Such analyses sometimes suffer from unstable behaviour, especially when large parts of the structure crack at the same time. It is expected that spatially varying concrete material properties will affect crack initialization, crack patterns and the stability of the analysis. In this report, the use of spatial variability in the material properties of concrete in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was investigated. To incorporate spatial variation in the Finite Element method (FEM), discretized random fields are used which are assigned to elements or integration points in the Finite Element (FE) model. In this research the following methods are implemented and have been assessed on their performance: Covariance Matrix Decomposition method (CMD), Fast Fourier Transform method (FFT), Local Avarage Subdivision method (LAS) and Expansion Optimal Linear Estimation method (EOLE). To be appropriate for the implementation in a general purpose FEM program the method has to be efficient with respect to computation time, accurate in representing the statistical characteristics of concrete and easy to implement in the program. In a literature review, a large variation was found in the used values for the statistical characteristics which are involved in the modelling of the spatial variation of concrete properties. In the assessment of the random field generators this range of values was used as input. From literature and the assessment it was found that the CMD method is easy to implement and is the most accurate in representing the statistical characteristics of concrete. With respect to efficiency, the method performs poorly when the number of nodes increases. This is the case for random fields in multiple dimensions and/or for random fields with a small correlation length. The FFT method is slightly less accurate but performs very well with respect to efficiency when the number of nodes increase. The derivation of the one sided Spectral Density Function (SDF), which is needed in the FFT method, is however quite difficult. The threshold value in the correlation function and the distribution type have the largest influence on the accuracy of the random field. If the threshold value increases, and a log-normal distribution type with a high coefficient of variation (COV) is selected, the accuracy of the different methods decreases. The FFT method is slightly more accurate in representing the statistical characteristics in that case. With a large correlation length and a threshold value, the values in the random field are strongly correlated. It was found that in such a case the assumption of ergodicity does not hold any more. In the general purpose FEM program DIANA, a random field application has been developed. The guidelines in the JCSS Probabilistic Model Code are followed and implemented as a material model in the program. This material model is used in an example to assess the model code and the influence of spatially varying material properties on a non-linear FEA. A concrete floor submitted to a shrinkage load was analysed using the JCSS material model and some variations on this material model. Unfortunately, none of the analyses reached the convergence norm in all the load steps where cracking occurs. The results are therefore not reliable since the true equilibrium path may not be followed. However, they do give insight in the influences of spatially varying material properties on a non-linear FEA. The analysis resulted in non-symmetric cracking patterns, more gradual grow in the total number of cracks and crack initialization on the weakest point in the structure. In future studies the observations from this research can be used in a probabilistic analysis where the uncertainty in the material properties, which vary in space, can be taken into account which will yield a more accurate estimate of the reliability of a structure.","Random Fields; Reinforced Concrete; JCSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Ravenshorst, G.J.P. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Gard, W.F. (mentor)","2015","Green roofs, also known as vegetation roofs, are becoming very popular for residents of houses or apartments and for good reasons. Vegetation on rooftops have many benefits on global and local level. Expectations show that the climate change will lead to heavier storms and causes the sewers in Rotterdam to overflow. Hence, the municipality of Rotterdam wishes to apply this special type of roof on a large scale to buffer rainwater which can gradually be discharged. Although the concept of a green roof is nothing new, applying them on this large scale to solve an urban problem makes it an interesting topic. Two types can be distinguished: intensive and extensive green roofs. Both types are able to retain rainwater but can be distinguished in their function. Intensive green roofs allow for recreation and gardening while extensive green roofs have an aesthetical function. The municipality of Rotterdam and its citizens both want green roofs instead of bitumen roofs, however they neither have the time nor the knowledge to determine whether their timber roof structure is suitable for this extra ballast. A first simplified calculation indicated that there was not enough strength to resists this load. If no research is done then Rotterdam will only be able to have vegetation on structures of steel or concrete while timber roofs are commonly present. In an ideal future every roof in Rotterdam is a green roof. This thesis researches the residual capacity of flat timber roofs by reducing the uncertainties associated with the strength. The main goal is therefore to be able to predict, and if necessary increase, the true strength capacity without demolishing the roof structure. The past The first step is to identify the size of the problem. A multi-criteria analysis was already performed by the municipality and translated into a potential map. However the criterion “year of construction” has a high level of uncertainty because there is a lack of knowledge about older timber roof structures. The map distinguished five groups with different ranges of construction years which was based on experience. A logical step is an archival research to the history and typologies of houses in Rotterdam. This investigation revealed that most houses were built before 1940 (pre-war) but a large amount of roof structures are renovated or renewed in the 80’s. Timber was the main building material for roof structures but after World War II the focus was on speed and efficiency which resulted into more concrete roofs. Another consequence of World War II was the destruction of the city archive. This resulted into the loss of information about the present timber properties and dimensions. The structural geometry of flat roofs did not change over the years. During archival and literature research it was found that a beam supported by two masonry walls is standard practice. The main consequence of a green roof is than an increase of the bending moment of the existing timber elements. This increase may lead to collapse of the roof structure. Before extensive research towards the true strength of timber elements was performed, a more general investigation to gaining strength and possible weak spots was done. The idea was that some design norms throughout the years might have used too conservative values and thus strength could be gained by recalculating the structure with the current regulations. It was found that the values for roof structures stayed practically the same in the building codes. However most structures also satisfy the deflection requirement but this is not legally established. Beams that are designed on this requirement have extra strength. The visual grading norms, which determines the strength of a timber element based on visual characteristic, have become more flexible over the years. Also the strength classes changed, before 1933 no strength value was used but dimensions were based on experience. Afterwards two main strength classes were defined as standard building wood and construction wood which are more or less equal to C18 and C24 in modern times. Wood is an organic material which is sensitive to time dependent processes that reduce the strength. Age is not necessarily a strength-reducing factor but is associated with strength-reducing processes. Four degradation mechanisms can be distinguished for timber: mechanical, physical, chemical and biological. The latter is the largest problem for roofs because insulation or treating the wood was not always done (correctly). Table 2-5 gives an overview of positive and negative aspects for roof structures. The present Current approaches are based on identifying the state of the structure and calculating the extra load according to the active regulations for new buildings. The building code refers to the NEN8700 for coping with existing structures. This norm gives five solutions when the strength is not sufficient: reduce the reference period, values are based on actual use, adjust the use, adjust the safety margin or adjust the strength. This thesis focused on the first and last option. Reducing the reference period is discussed and not recommended unless the engineer can determine and control the load with high precision. It is not legally determined if the change of the safety level is allowed. This will lead to discussions with “construction and housing inspection” in the future because roofs are less safe. The extra capacity must thus be found in adjusting the strength. The idea is as follows, freshly sawn structural timber is graded into a strength class. This means that a small amount of the graded timber does not have to meet a certain limit strength. Nowadays the 5% lower probability value is chosen as the limit value. This way of strength grading allows for beams to be stronger than the characteristic value. The experiments were aiming to predict the actual strength without demolishing the roof. During the research, thirteen beams were obtained from an ongoing demolishment. Ten of these members are of a renovated roof structure from 1983 while the original structure was from 1923. The other three members are from another building where the original structure of 1923 was still present. A strength prediction model was used that required the density and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE). The density can be measured with aid of a resistograph. Here it is important to drill in radial direction. Next a vibration meter was used to measure the wave speed which can be combined with the density to gain the dynamic MOE. Five sub-experiments were conducted to determine the difference between in-situ situations and free vibrations. As it turns out, a screw is the best way to introduce the wave and the surrounding increase the wave speed. This needs to be corrected with a certain coefficient on the frequency. A 6 to 10 percent increase of the frequency was found during testing. At last the true bending strength was checked with a four point bending test. The true strength was 20 to 140 percent higher than the characteristic value of the initial grade. Four strategies for future assessments are proposed: calculate as new structure according the current regulations, reduce the reference period (not recommended), visual upgrading and non-destructive tests. Each step requires more work but will, most likely, lead to extra strength. Two case studies were worked out following the different strategies. As expected, non-destructive tests is the most beneficial strategy because information about the actual strength is attained. With this information the strength class could be upgraded. In this case study it becomes clear that low weight green roofs (1 kN/m²) can be applied while a heavy green roof (3,4 kN/m²) needs more attention. A solution between these two extreme is also possible. Furthermore in one case the characteristic bending strength was increased with a factor of 1,5. Time dependent factors seem to be the main problem in all strategies. The duration of load may cause excessive deflections or even creep rupture. Limits to the deflections are not legally established and can be concealed with a lowered ceiling. The future The choice for a method of reinforcing an existing structure depends on a number of criteria. An engineer and user should discuss the possibilities that satisfies both. The most optimal solution will depend on the existing timber structure because every situation is unique. For the case studies the best solution is to increase the cross section of specific individual beams with timber elements. This method is easy, fast and cheap. At last an action plan was made for future assessments. Following the different steps in this protocol can make reinforcement and extra costs unnecessary and is thus the first step towards a Rotterdam with only green roofs.","green roof; vegetation roof; existing roof; existing structure; timber; wood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Large parts of the Netherlands are exposed to the threats of flooding due to the influence of high water coming from the North Sea region, due to high discharge of rivers like the Meuse and Rhine or due to a combination of North Sea water levels and river discharges. In order to cope these threats, strategies are developed in the Delta Program in which measures with respect to flood risk reduction are elaborated. The current preferred strategy by the Dutch government, 'DP2015', accounts for flood safety of the Rhine-Meuse estuary by means of functioning of the Europoort barrier in combination with an extensive dike reinforcement program and room for the river measures. In 2017 new safety standards for flood risk become effective and it is expected that many dike trajectories within the Rhine-Meuse estuary need to be reinforced as a consequence of climate change and the new standards. Opposed to strategy `DP2015', an alternative strategy in order to meet the required level of flood safety is developed by a group of six engineers under guidance of ir. F. Spaargaren. An alternative strategy, `Sluices', is developed in which the Eastern Scheldt will function as a retention basin and the Maeslant barrier is replaced by a closed dam with navigation locks, sluices and pumping stations, reducing the hydraulic loads within the system significantly. It is investigated how the reduction in hydraulic load levels relate to dike reinforcement tasks for dike ring 16 ‘Alblasserwaard & Vijfheerenlanden'. This dike ring is located in the so-called `transition zone' where hydraulic loads acting on the dikes are determined by both influence of high water levels from the North Sea (being tide and storm surge amongst others) as determined by discharge of the rivers Rhine and Meuse. The failure probabilities for these trajectories are largely determined by failure due to piping and failure due to overtopping/overflow. The failure probabilities for these mechanisms are calculated for the situation in 2015 and in 2100 where influence of climate change is taken into account. The largest risk reduction of strategy `Sluices' compared to strategy `DP2015' is found in trajectory 16-2, where the failure probabilities due to overtopping/overflow and piping were reduced significantly. Based on the results of risk reduction, the shortage on dike height and width is determined and costs are determined. With the calculated shortage on dike height and berm width, a cost calculation is made in nominal and net present terms for the trajectories. It is found that in nominal terms a slight cost reduction can be realized and that most dikes need to reinforced within the time horizon of 2100. However, reinforcements for trajectory 16-2 may be postponed 37 years, leading to a significant cost reduction in terms of net present values.","flood risk; dike reinforcements; deltaprogramma; plan sluizen; dijkring 16; piping; overtopping/Overflow; costs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","51.864796, 4.698770"

Does turning health care into a market lower the cost (and increase the quality) of health care?","Koshy, M.A.","Van Beers, C.P. (mentor); Naastepad, C.W.M. (mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor)","2015","Rising cost of health care is a major crisis faced by different countries around the world especially the U.S. In an attempt to reduce the rising costs of health care, many governments are considering embarking on a path of turning health care into a ‘market’ which is expected to lower costs while improving the quality of health care. Considering the rising cost of health care in the U.S. there are basically two arguments – a. The rising cost is due to too much market. b. the rising cost is due to too little market or in other words due to government regulations. The aim of this thesis is to understand whether and how turning health care into a market would help bring down cost and raise quality. As a first step in answering this question first the concept of ‘market’ is defined. For this purpose a neoclassical model of health care ‘market’ is developed as a theoretical framework and explained how it is applied to health care and how this is expected to reduce cost. Neoclassical economics is an economic theory or model originally developed for the analysis and design of trade in goods, that is, for the production, exchange and consumption of goods. A first question that arises is whether neoclassical assumptions are compatible with the nature of health care. For example, is profit maximisation by producers reconcilable with the Hippocratic Oath taken by doctors, and is utility (or consumption) maximisation by consumers reconcilable with ‘satisficing behaviour’ by patients? To further investigate whether market can bring down cost, the main components leading to high cost in health care have been identified as pharmaceutical industry, medical technology industry, physicians, and hospitals and cost developments in each area are analysed. Although the focus of this thesis is on the U.S. health care system, the Canadian and Dutch health care systems are also briefly studied for comparison. As a next step the claims made by critics of a market-based health care system – that the rising costs of health care in the U.S. are due to the opening up of health care to the (neoclassical) market is investigated. Regarding the cost of medicine and medical technology, three ‘neoclassical market’ factors contributing to rising costs are identified: the patent system, ‘direct-to-consumer advertising’, and lobbying (although whether the third is acceptable from a neoclassical point of view is debatable). Regarding the health care provided by doctors and physicians, three ‘neoclassical market’ factors have contributed to rising costs: the introduction of competition between health care providers which has resulted in a ‘technology arms race’ and an increase in expensive high-tech based treatments; ‘direct-to-consumer advertising’ which has increased the demand for medicines and treatments; excessive treatments resulting from lack of divisibility and substitutability; the establishment of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) directed at bringing about competition between physicians but leading, in practice, to monopsonistic rents on the part of insurance companies rather than to lower costs of the care provided. Regarding the quality of health care, two major factors of concern are (1) the exclusion from medicine and treatment of individuals who do not have the ability to pay (in neoclassical term, meritocracy) and (2) the introduction of (Taylorist) ‘scientific management’ which has led to standardisation and protocol¬isation of treatment (in neoclassical terms, a homogenisation of the product of health care) and an increase in (expensive) robotic surgery; the quality effects of both are still debated. As a next step the claim made by proponents of a ‘free market’-based health care system – that the U.S. health care system is not (yet) a free market and that the rising costs of health care are the result of government intervention and over-regulation is investigated. Five factors contributing to rising costs are identified: (1) a restriction on free entry of new doctors due to licensing of doctors; (2) an insurance system that (a) supports medicine use and medical treatments by introducing a ‘soft budget constraint’ and, moreover, (b) places a heavy burden on physicians and hospitals in terms of time- and cost-intensive administration and negotiation; (3) the costs of research procedures for testing the safety of drugs (ensured by the Food and Drugs Administration); (4) ‘managed care’ by Health Maintenance Organisations leading to monopsonistic rents with insurance companies; and (5) standardisation or protocollisation leading to over-use of technology in health care. Regarding the first factor i.e. High cost is due to restriction on free entry of new doctors due to licensing of doctors, my thesis has found out that in reality, however, in the U.S., the number of doctors (per 1000 inhabitants) is found to be larger than in other countries (where costs of health care are lower), and other factors appear to be more important in determining costs, such as the high price of patented medicine (in comparison to generic medicine) and the increased over use of the newest technologies. These cost factors, however, are unlikely to disappear with the introduction of a neoclassical market; rather, they appear to be a result of the introduction of the neoclassical market. Significantly, however, although the rising costs of health care are related in part to the introduction of the neoclassical market model in health care, it should be noted that the system as implemented in practice in the U.S. (and elsewhere) is in many ways quite far removed from the pure neoclassical model. Neoclassical elements such as competition, homogenisation of products, and the commercial development and patenting of knowledge have been introduced within a larger system of ‘managed care’ regulated by a mix of public and private parties including government and insurance companies and behind these, (medical) industry. For example, competition between doctors and hospitals does not take place in a ‘free market’ context, but within an organisational framework managed by Health Maintenance Organisations run by insurance companies supported by regulation and legal adjustments. Therefore, it is not possible to draw simple conclusions such as that the rising costs of health care are due to either the introduction of a neoclassical market or government regulation. What has emerged in practice is a particular market-state mix which in the literature has been named ‘neo-liberalism’. Policy Implications & Recommendations Though my analysis about the way in which the pharmaceutical and medical technology industry as well as the health care provided by physicians and hospitals are organised in the U.S., I arrive at several questions which needs deep analysis and consideration by the policy makers while designing a health care system. The questions can be summarised as follows: If the aim of health care is to provide people in need of health care with the required medicine, medical technology and physician care, and if the commercial development of knowledge leads to (a) prices that are too high for many to afford, (b) a neglect of diseases experienced by people who do not have the ability to pay, what would be a better way or organising the development of knowledge? Should knowledge development remain within the boundary of economy or should it be considered as a separate sphere by itself? Most important question is whether in reality patent system which is allowing monopoly for the industries actually leading to knowledge development as claimed by neoclassical economics (in theory) since evidence suggest that most of the research and investments in developing knowledge is done by the government and the companies are just claiming the right to it (right which they acquired through lobbying). It is very important to note that, when ‘market’ is proposed as a solution, a careful analysis of what is claimed in theory (theoretical explanation of market) and what is happening in reality (when market is implemented) need to be done before any policy decision is taken. My thesis while investigating the reasons for the rising cost in health care, whether it is due to market or due to government regulations, came to the conclusion that what has emerged in practice is a particular market-state mix which in the literature has been named ‘neo-liberalism’. I feel that the impact of this new market-state relationship on justice (e.g. the impact of legal changes on access to health care) and freedom (e.g. freedom of choice in medicine and treatment) is an under-researched area and it is here that further research appears to be most urgently needed and considered by the policy analysts. Analysis of the health care services has led me to three questions I would like to raise, which needs careful analysis by the policy analysts. When it comes to health care services, it has been found out that it poses certain features that makes it a lesser candidate to fit into a neoclassical market which as already mentioned has been developed for the buying and selling of material goods. This leads to the question whether health care should be treated like any other good? Can health care service (interaction between doctors and patients) which is not uniform or homogeneous in nature be standardized without the loss of quality of it? Is it right to consider health care as a good and try to fit it into the neoclassical model? As we can see, health care is a growing domain (e.g. as a share of GDP) involving increasingly large sums of money. My thesis raises a very important question that need to be analysed by the policy makers. For what purpose are these resources being used? Apart from health, do other motives also play a role in the allocation of health care resources? For example are rules and regulations regarding health care (including medical industry and health care services) are implemented in such a way that they are used as instruments of industrial policy ? Since we do know only about just two options as solutions – either open up to market or government controlled system, it is time we think about a third alternative method which would ensure health care to all irrespective of their capacity to pay for it. As a first step I started with U.S. philosopher Michael Walzer who said that health care is a right of every human being and it should have its own sphere and autonomy unlike other regular goods that can be sold in a market. Although Walzer has a valuable point, I like to differ with him with respect to his treatment of the economy. When Walzer accepts the ‘justice of the market’ as a separate sphere of justice, it appears by ‘market’ he means ‘neoclassical market’, a market organised according to neoclassical principles such as competition and profit-maximisation. However, if competition, profit maximisation and utility maximisation (‘unlimited wants’) are accepted as the basis of the economic order, how can ‘economic imperialism’ – the domination of all spheres by demands coming from the economy – be avoided? How to protect the values belonging to each sphere if one sphere is allowed to expand without limits? Answering this question, in my view, requires rethinking the relationships between three spheres: health care (including the development of knowledge concerning health and health care), government (law-giving and regulation), and economy. What relationships between these three would protect the values belonging to health care, including access to health care for all, and freedom of choice regarding the kind of health care received? These questions require careful attention and analysis.","healthcare; neoclassical economics; pharmaceuticals; medical technology; Preferred Provider Organizations; standardisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","Economics of Technology and Innovation","",""

(mentor)","2015","Increased technology scaling not only resulted in a performance increase of the microprocessor, but also led to increasing device vulnerability to external disturbances. Scaling accelerates ageing induced failures of CMOS devices and the average lifetime of electronic devices diminishes. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a fault-tolerant method to the p-VEX processor capabilities in order to counter these effects. The p-VEX processor is a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) softcore processor with the capabilities to reconfigure the issue width dynamic during run-time. Furthermore, this thesis discusses the implementation of not traditional Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) with the existing issue width of the core by reconfiguring to a four times 2-issue width. In this method. an important section in the code can be marked and executed in three lock-stepped 2-issue width pipelines. Majority voters are implemented between these three pipelines to vote the results from the executions. At the cost of a 6% increase in resources and without great structural changes, a new capability is added which allows the p-VEX processor to continue running even when it suffers from single-event upsets (SEUs). With the implemented design the amount of errors is monitored using majority voters. Moreover, it is possible to initiate a switch from 2-issue width to the unused issue-width without introducing delay. The design is compared with the original p-VEX processor and tested by injecting errors in several units during executing. During these fault injections the TMR was able to correct these errors and complete the program without adding extra cycles.","VLIW; ?-VEX; fault tolerant; tmr","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

The algorithm requires accurate localization, path planning among obstacles and feedback control of the nonholonomic system. The main goal is to autonomously position the platform in front of a taskboard within 15 cm in position and 6º in heading. Such a navigational algorithm has not been developed before for a four wheel steering platform capable of crab motion and rotation in place. Furthermore, it is a challenge to achieve the necessary localization accuracy with the available sensors. The navigation algorithm is implemented on the actual INTERACT platform and its performance is experimentally validated. The algorithm is limited to 2D planning and control. The path is planned using the Rapid-exploration Random Tree algorithm and tracking control is performed using approximate linearization around the reference trajectory and PID control laws. Feedback is provided by localization based on dead-reckoning and odometry.

(mentor)","2015","The steady increase in volume of goods to be transported over land and water has necessitated the development of efficient and alternative methods of transportation. In current practices considerable amount of transportation delay is caused due to switching between different modes of transportation resulting in economic losses. Another difficulty in the transportation sector arises when handling extremely large objects, such as wind turbines and cargo containers. In order to overcome these difficulties, an alternative method of transportation has been proposed recently. The proposed alternative method consists of the development of a formation control framework using hovercrafts. Formation control is a widely researched topic due its potential benefits in reducing the system cost, structure flexibility and improving the efficiency of the overall system. State-of-the-art methods for formation control are focused towards developing a controller to track a predefined trajectory, and the trajectory generation is an additional problem which is addressed off-line. A path tracking formation control framework is an area which has received less attention in the literature and can have possible improvements. Hence, this thesis work answers the research question of generating a feasible path for a set of initial and final conditions, and tracking the generated path. Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is a promising framework, because of its constraint handling capabilities. Hence, it accounts for the major component of this thesis. A new framework for formation control is proposed which uses spatial-domain parametrization instead of the conventional time-domain parametrization. MPC being a computationally expensive task, the proposed framework reduces the number of decision variables and constraint evaluations which can help to achieve the desired Real Time performance. The specific research question addressed in this thesis work is to develop a path tracking formation control framework while minimising the absolute and relative position error for each vehicle in the formation. A nonlinear dynamic model for the hovercraft is obtained using first principles and its structure is used to design an optimization based controller. An Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is formulated which is solved using direct collocation method. In this method a continuous problem is discretized into a number of collocation points, and the resulting problem is solved using state-of-the-art Nonlinear Program solvers such as, SNOPT and NPSOL. The performance of the proposed framework is illustrated using numerical simulations.","Model Predictive Controller; Formation Control; Hovercraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","","51.992735, 4.358018"

(mentor)","2015","On the south-west coast of Namibia, diamonds were trapped during the Quaternary on bedrock platforms and in bedrock gullies. These were formed by differential erosion due to wave action. The diamonds originated from Kimberlite diamond pipes within the catchment area of the Orange River in South-Africa and Botswana. This river eroded the diamonds from the pipes and transported them over a distance up to 1000 km to the sea. Subsequent deposition resulted in the formation of placer deposits on the south-west coast of Namibia. These diamond deposits form the mineral reserve for the Southern Coastal Mine, operated by NAMDEB, which is the area of interest for this study. The currently used extraction strategy in the mine is based on the philosophy that the mining method must be selective and land-based. Conventional loading and hauling of overburden and bulk material is applied after which a final cleaning of the bedrock is done with vacuum cleaners. A seawall made out of sand protects the mine along the entire coastline against flooding. Overburden sand and tailings are constantly transported and dumped onto the beach to achieve land reclamation. This is referred to as the Sand-2-Sea program, developed to expand mining activity in a seaward direction. When enough land is accrued the sandy seawall, protecting the mining operation against flooding, is shifted seawards and new mining area is claimed. The coastal area is characterized by a highly energetic wave climate. This causes a high erosion rate of the sand nourishment along the coast. The strategic business plan of NAMDEB states that diamond extraction, using the current mining- and land reclamation method, must continue until 2031 reaching a maximum seaward distance of 545 m from the average high water line (Mean Sea Level (MSL) +2m) of 2014. It was hypothesized in this thesis that the feasibility limit of the current mining method is reached before this maximum distance is obtained. In addition, severe seawall erosion can occur during storm events. A storm in May 2015 was an example of this, causing seawall failure and flooding of an area with ongoing mining activity. This event is used as a case study in this thesis. The aim of this thesis was to indicate how far seawards the land reclamation strategy for diamond mining can be applied. In addition, research was conducted to define standards for a seawall to effectively protect a mining area against flooding.","XBeach; Placer deposit; Coastal modelling; Dune erosion; Sediment transport; SWAN; Namibia; Sperrgebiet; Diamond mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering and Resource Engineering","","Mining Engineering and Coastal Engineering","","-28.553691, 16.321566"

(mentor)","2015","Characterization of fluid properties is significant in the petroleum engineering practice, especially in solvent-based enhanced oil recovery (SEOR) where the use of injected chemicals should ideally be reduced to the bare minimum in order to minimize the costs and environmental impact of SEOR. However, current techniques for measurement inside cores, pipes and other enclosed spaces are inconvenient as the measurement devices must be connected from the inside to the outside, causing leakage problems. A possible solution to this problem is the usage of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) communication system. RFID is the use of wireless electromagnetic fields to transfer data. This research examines the feasibility of using UHF RFID technology for wireless laboratory measurement of the dielectric coefficients of diethyl ether-oil-brine mixtures in enhanced imbibition experiments. A typical enhanced imbibition experimental setup consists of an oil saturated core placed in brine containing a solvent (Amott-cell). By means of measurements with the RFID system we aim to determine the concentration of diethyl ether in the oleic and aqueous phase of the mixture according to the corresponding dielectric coefficients. As a precursor to the RFID measurements, we first determine the concentration dependent partition coefficient, i.e. the ratio of the diethyl ether concentrations in the oleic and aqueous phase, using the Anton Paar density meter DMA-4100M. The density-meter measurements are followed by experiments to determine the real part of the dielectric coefficients of the pure components as a function of frequency, at 23 degrees Celsius. With the dielectric coefficients of the pure components identified, we use the Böttcher equation to calculate the effective dielectric coefficient of mixtures with a known composition. Subsequently, the relation between RFID response and diethyl ether fractions in the oleic and aqueous phase is investigated, starting with simulations of three RFID models using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The aim of these simulations is to examine the relation between the dielectric coefficient in relation to frequency and scattering parameter (S-parameter) response, and create an understanding of the influence of the tag’s encasement and the thickness of media blocks covering the tag. With the state-of-the-art physical setup (CISC RFID Xplorer-2000) we then measure the dependence of the Xplorer-2000 response as a function of the dielectric coefficient. In terms of response we focus on the following parameters: the S-parameter (S21), the minimum power at tag position (Pmin), the scalar difference between the radar cross-sections of the tag (RCS) and the backscattered power. From the graphs where we plotted RFID response versus the dielectric coefficient we observe that some frequencies show a larger dependence in the domain of interest than others. However, when applying this most optimal frequency in a graph where we plot the RFID response as a function of diethyl ether volume fractions in the oleic or aqueous phase, in some cases the relation results in a curve containing one or several maxima. In this situation more frequencies must be used to attain unique and accurate response values. From the RFID response parameters, the power at tag position (Pmin) is the advisable response parameter when determining ether fractions in a diethyl ether-oil-water system. In order to investigate the full potential of the RFID CISC Xplorer-2000 system for the determination of dielectric coefficients in an imbibition experiment, more measurements are required of media with dielectric coefficients ranging from 4.43 to 79.08 for the aqueous phase mixtures and dielectric coefficients ranging from 2.05 to 4.43 for the oleic phase mixtures. Nevertheless, based on this research we can conclude that it is possible to use RFID technology to determine the diethyl ether concentration in the oleic and the aqueous phase with a few percent (0.02).","backscattering; Böttcher equation; COMSOL; dielectric coefficient; effective dielectric coefficient; imbibition; impedance; partition coefficient; phase behavior; permittivity; radar cross section (RCS); RFID; RFID CISC Xplorer-2000; signal modulation; Solvent Enhanced Oil Recovery (SEOR); S-parameter; turn on power (Pmin); UHF; Amott-cell; diethyl ether; oil; brine; density meter; partial molar volume; calibratiom curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van der Meer, J.W. (mentor); McCall, R. (mentor); Vuik, V. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2015","In this thesis, a method was developed, with which the infragravity waves and morphological changes of a sandy foreshore are included in the calculation of the probability of dike failure due to wave overtopping. Constructing a natural foreshore in front of the dike can be an attractive and innovative method to decrease the failure probability. However, the uncertainty in the morphological development of these foreshores leads to uncertainty with respect to their contribution in protection against flooding. The morphological stability of a foreshore during extreme conditions is not well known. The current Dutch safety assessment tools do not yet include the infragravity waves and morphological changes of a foreshore during a storm. Hence, it is not yet possible to guarantee the robustness and safety of dike-foreshore system. This thesis considered hybrid defences (dike-foreshore systems), where the dike is still of importance in the protection of the hinterland. The considered hybrid defence was a schematized version of the Westkapelle sea defence, located at the coast of Walcheren in the Netherlands. The morphological changes of the foreshore calculated in this thesis, were the changes during (severe) storms. Because a single model that includes all the different relevant processes does not exist, a model framework or ‘model train’ was developed, in which different models were combined. The modelling framework best fit to solve the research questions was determined as a combination of XBeach hydrostatic, the EurOtop formulae and the probabilistic method Adaptive Directional Importance Sampling (ADIS). Including infragravity waves (and wave set-up) lead to much larger failure probabilities for the hybrid defence considered in this thesis. This difference is mainly caused by the difference in wave period at the toe of the dike. Including the morphological changes lead to a somewhat larger failure probability. The fact that this difference was not that large, was mainly caused by less wave dissipation due to erosion of the foreshore, but at the same time less transfer of energy to the low frequencies, thus a smaller wave period. The combination of a (very) shallow foreshore and dike slope of 1:8 make that the case considered here is (largely) outside the previously studied wave overtopping area. It is possible, that when the wave period becomes very large, the wave overtopping is not dependent anymore on the dike slope, but on the wave parameters only. It is therefore questionable if the EurOtop formulae calculate the right amount of wave overtopping for these types of situations, because in the formulae, the wave overtopping is dependent on the dike slope. Furthermore, the EurOtop formulae use the Tm-1,0 wave period. This wave period is very sensitive to the low frequencies. Clear guidelines should be determined on which frequency resolution and, if necessary, cut-off frequencies should be used when determining wave spectra. This thesis presented a method with which infragravity waves and morphological changes of a sandy foreshore can be included in the calculation of the probability of dike failure due to wave overtopping. Before this thesis, this was not yet possible. As shown in this thesis, it is important that the infragravity waves are included in the calculation of the dike failure probability due to wave overtopping at this dike-foreshore system, because they had a large influence on the probability of failure. The method developed in this thesis can be used at other locations without many problems, however the influence of the infragravity waves and morphological change as determined in this thesis, could be different at another location.","dikes; flood defences; wave overtopping; infragravity waves; morphology; probabilistic; foreshores; overtopping; morphological changes; soft solutions; Building with Nature; levees; dike-foreshore system; safety assessment; stochastic; XBeach; EurOtop; Adaptive Directional Importance Sampling; ADIS; hybrid defences; flood risk; BE-SAFE; hydrodynamics; probability of failure; reliability function; shallow foreshore; Westkapelle; sea defence; wave period; wave spectra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures & Flood Risk","","51.547492, 3.452201"

This experimental quantitative study investigates three potential ways to influence the consumer acceptance, being the existence of wear and tear on the product, providing additional information about the previous use or providing additional information about the refurbishment process. The consumer acceptance was measured by the purchase intention and attitude towards the product. The litearture suggested that the perceived risk and perception of contagion attatched to a product could be used as predicting factors for the acceptance. Therefore, these two factors were included as well. The results show that wear and tear has a negative influence on the purchase intention. Providing information about the refurbishment process has a positive influence on the purchase intention. Providing information about the previous use has a positive influence on the attitude towards the product with wear and tear but a negative influence on the product without wear and tear. This is due to the uncertainty caused by the information.","circular economy; refurbishment; consumer acceptance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Arat, M.A. (mentor)","2015","Evolution of new technologies, market preferences and vehicle safety standards and regulations motivate the automotive industry to contribute to higher quality mobility and safer transportation for the society. With the compelling development of electronics over the past few decades, passenger cars are equipped with an increasing number of active safety systems, and even the fitment of some of those has become mandatory in regulations, such as ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) and ESC (Electronic Stability Control). As a result, the integration becomes necessary to meet the fast introduction of new functionality and to supervise and manage different variety of controllable vehicle subsystems, attracting the interests from both the industry and the academia. Numerous studies have proven integrated chassis controls to have incomparable advantages in multiple-objective performance improvement, hardware complexity and system costs reduction, interference prevention, system reliability and fault-tolerant capability. Among the previously explored integrated control architectures, hierarchical strategy is considered the most proper one, as it allows the cooperated development between OEMs and suppliers and make good use of existing subsystems. Within this context, this study proposes a novel adaptive wheel force feedback control allocation algorithm utilizing SKF load sensing bearing technology, to coordinate ABS, ESC and AFS (Active Front Steering). It aims to investigate a real-time implementable framework which is open to the extensions and integration of other load-sensing based control subsystems. The proposed approach is validated and evaluated by open-loop and driver-in-the-loop tests performed on multi-body vehicle model in Simulink-CarSim co-simulation.","Integrated Chassis Control; Load-sensing Bearing; Control Allocation; Hierarchical Control Strategy; L1 Adaptive Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Castro, M.B.G. (mentor)","2015","Seaweed has been part of human consumption ever since humanity met with the oceans. As technology developed more applications for these macroscopic algae were discovered. Global population increased, technology advanced and people started to understand the lifecycle of seaweed allowing them to cultivate seaweed. Seaweed is currently cultivated in countries like China, Korea and Japan and is predominantly harvested manually. The seaweed industry has seen tremendous growth in the past two decades, increasing the call to scale up production by mechanization. Coastal sites are running sparse, and concentration of this industry has already caused major environmental problems. The solution would be to move further offshore, at a larger scale, with mechanized cultivation systems being able to cope with adverse conditions. As maritime industry market leader, Royal IHC has been at the forefront of technological advancement in a multitude of maritime operating fields. With a continuous need to develop, Royal IHC, through MTI Holland, is investigating the possibility to add value to the development of technology and equipment to service the seaweed industry. This thesis will present a market overview and research in various topics in order to evaluate the overall problem space. Based on the Integrative and Rational method, as proposed by Cross (2008), multiple design support tools are used to identify opportunities, clarify objectives and establish functions and requirements. The scope of the assignment has been closely adapted to current market needs: To develop aquacultural machinery able to service a demonstration farm (50 ha), able to demonstrate the economic feasibility of offshore cultivation. At the moment multiple pilot projects are run to demonstrate different cultivation techniques and offshore structures. A process chain has been developed to determine the mission profile, task-related functions, and compile a list of objectives. Using a function modelling method these are further decomposed into sub functions. The functions are used to generate a set of requirements for the initial concepts. Using state-of-art information on technology currently used in relevant industries, a global patent search and brainstorm sessions, a multitude of solutions were generated. These solutions are captured and organized in multiple morphological overviews. Selection criteria allowed a first filtering stage for most sub solutions and the remaining solutions provided enough information to develop four different concept designs. Using the weighted objectives method the designs where compared based on ten differently weighted objectives. The highest scoring concept was used to develop the final concept design. Using Autodesk Inventor the model was developed and partially engineered. The machine is able to harvest line based substrates with different species of seaweed attached to a set of floaters. The design can be used on a number of different carrier vessels and is containerized to be transported and deployed worldwide. The design is able to harvest farm sizes of up to 100 ha, depending on patch configuration and vessel manoeuvrability. It is scalable since it uses basic design principles and parts that can be produced in most marine production facilities. To aid in further design development and feasibility assessment of different cultivation scenarios, an exploitation model has been developed. Through optimizations on a multitude of scenarios the model proved to be an effective method to assist with design decisions, operations planning and concept feasibility. With this thesis and the exploitation model, Royal IHC is prepared to lead development of products and services in this innovative market. Future industries and researchers will benefit from this basis for development in the North European Seaweed market.","maritime; seaweed; farming; harvesting; sustainable; offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(mentor); De Lille, C.S.H. (mentor); Van Dijk, G. (mentor); De Vos, M. (mentor)","2015","The current state STBY specialises in design research for service innovation. They work on complex projects in collaboration with clients who want to innovate their service offering. Clients are often large organisations, in which multidisciplinary teams work on different projects that are interlinked at some level within the organisation. STBY collaborates closely with these teams, collecting stories about users’ experiences and elaborating them into rich insights that are implementable in the teams’ innovation processes. The results of each project are delivered through engaging materials, which support the teams to communicate the results to the rest of their organisation. STBY endeavours to nurture relationships with clients into long-term collaborations, through which mutual understanding and fit are progressively built, improving the value co-creation. The challenge STBY excels in managing the intrinsic complexity within projects, delivering meaningful results to their clients; however, they are aware of the opportunity to also create value across projects run with clients, exceeding their current value delivery. This thesis focuses on the design of a tool to support STBY in managing the complexity arising across projects with large client organisations by leveraging the mutual relationships and knowledge built across projects for and with their clients. To achieve this, a design research approach was adopted, consisting of iterations of research, design and testing phases: early prototypes were designed to test assumptions and gather information for the following cycle. Throughout the iterations, methods as desk research, generative interviews, shadowing and co-creative workshops were used. The desired state The complexity arising across projects with clients can be managed by recognising what is known and unknown about the different elements it consists of. For this, STBY can exploit the comprehensive expertise and knowledge offered by the whole team to reflect on the collaborations with clients from different perspectives. By taking a few moments in which to step back from the ongoing projects, the team can reflect on the value created across a series of projects for a specific client and think proactively about improving the collaboration and value creation even further. Clients can be involved in this as well, providing their expertise and knowledge built during the relationship. The solution envisioned consists of a tool enabling the STBY team to use their joint expertise to think ahead for and with their clients. The tool triggers a reflection that urges the team to plan actions to exceed the mutual value already created through the relationship. The solution Behind the scenes (Figure 1) is a tool for internal use of STBY. It consists of four steps, each organised into a process of mapping, reflecting and planning. The tool focuses on the collaboration across projects with a client organisation both at individual and organisational levels. The first step maps the project history with the client, triggers a reflection on how it relates to their overall vision and a plan of actions to create further value based on it. The second step maps the existing relationships with various stakeholders, triggers a reflection on how contact distance and contrast in thinking influence the collaboration and a plan of action to improve it. Step 3 maps the value propositions offered to the key stakeholders, triggers a reflection on how these relate to their individual goals and a plan of actions to engage more with them. Step 4 summarises the main insights and the action plans emerged from the previous steps, inviting to select the most appropriate actions and to undertake them. Limitations & recommendations The solution, consisting of the tool as described, guidelines and video tutorial, is ready to be implemented into the STBY’s practices. Direct involvement of the STBY team in Amsterdam in the development of the tool ensured the fulfilment of the requirements. However, due to the time constraints intrinsic to this project, only the immediate value of using the tool have been assessed, evaluating its long-term value primarily based on the perception of the STBY representatives. Moreover, engagement of the STBY team in London throughout the development of the tool was limited. Recommendations for the future consist in evaluating the consequences of the actions planned and taken in the long-term, introducing the tool to the London team and improving it further through its use. As for the adoption of the tool in the company’s practices, proactive attitude of each representative, especially the seniors, is required to recognise situations in which to use it and facilitate its use.","consultancy; tool; large organisations; co-creation; value; design research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Wong, K.J. (mentor)","2015","The local governments in the Netherlands experience a problem. The distribution of freight in the cities is an important driver of the economy, but it has negative impacts on the liveability of their cities, which affects the attractiveness of a municipality. However, changing the city logistics is not straightforward. Shippers, carriers, city hubs, retailers, consumers and residents all have different objectives and other concerns. Shippers for example, want to meet the expectations of the consumers. The consumers want same-day delivery, deliveries on Sundays, just-in-time, sustainable and affordable services. The challenge of the logistic sector is to increase the logistic operations with less vehicle movements and a decrease of emissions. In order to achieve this challenge, governments, logistic operators and research institutes signed a covenant, named the Green Deal Zero Emission Stadslogistiek. In this covenant the parties agree to realize zero emission in city logistics in 2025. But in the Green Deal only the ambitions are recorded and not a strategic plan to achieve the ambitions. It results that, despite the Green Deal ZES, people from different parts of the business fail to take appropriate action. Due to a lack of targets in the covenant stakeholders cannot be judged on their behaviour and progress. Since a strategic planning is missing, stakeholders experience little responsibility to take action. The objective of this research is to deliver a dynamic roadmap for the coming decade that strategic planners can use. This map of pathways should help the strategic planners of city logistics to make a plan, taken future uncertainties into account. To meet this objective, insight is needed in how the good intentions of the stakeholders of city logistics in the Netherlands can be converted to a robust roadmap for the next decade, aiming for an improvement of urban logistics. The research tries to improve the success of the Green Deal Zero Emission Stadslogistiek. Especially the robustness of the roadmap is relevant, since it should be capable of dealing with setbacks and delays of actions. In order to deliver a strategic planning for realizing the ambitions in the Green Deal the stakeholders are involved in developing strategies. A literature review and interviews with experts provide insight in the opportunities and vulnerabilities of city logistics. The research deals also with four scenarios in order to help professionals anticipate on potential risk and uncertainty in the future. Including the risk and uncertainty in the pathway roadmap helps to make the pathways robust and also applicable in changing environments. Through an interactive roadmapping workshop with professionals of city logistics the foundations of the strategic plan are developed. The graphical representation of the strategies from the roadmapping workshop results in a map with multiple action strategies. In this map the strategies of market parties and governments are separated, since governments can latter interfere in the process of change. Strategic planners can use the pathway roadmap to select their preferred pathway and use it as a tool in communication. Besides, an important advantage of roadmapping can be derived from the roadmapping process itself instead of the pathway map. Alongside studies on ontologies and stakeholder analysis, a pathway roadmap can help to frame the problem field. Almost in all the policy top sectors in the Netherlands can benefit from pathway roadmapping. The logistics operators and the municipality should start with the quick wins and begin to cooperate. In order to achieve zero emission zones in 2025 the strategic planners have to be ambitious. High targets will stimulate disruptive innovations, which can be adjusted if necessary. The top sector transport policy should be responsible for the pathway roadmap so that the pathway roadmap is respected and complied with. The pathway roadmap can also be used to assign research budgets. Further research can be done to apply pathway roadmaps on a larger scale, such as at the European or worldwide level.","City Logistics; Dynamic Roadmap; Scenario Analysis; Strategic Planning; Urban Freight Transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2015","Magnetic levitation actuation has proven to be a viable solution in many applications where high performance actuators are needed that can achieve fine manipulation and position control. Advantages of magnetic levitation include elimination of friction, backlash, vibrations and wear of components due to contact. Many such systems have been developed so far for applications in photolithography, magnetic bearings, haptic interaction and manipulation of micro-robots. Owl Tech has developed a prototype device of a 3D printer with a novel platform printer head, equipped with permanent magnets that is suspended under an array of electromagnets using magnetic levitation. The device aims to deliver higher accuracies while reducing power consumption and maintenance costs with respect to the mechanical counterparts. Using finite elements analysis a magnetic force/torque model is developed. The model is verified by a force measurement setup. The dynamics of the levitating platform are expressed by combining the magnetostatic model with the equations of motion of a rigid body. For the localization of the levitated platform a sensing methodology is proposed based on an array of hall-effect sensors. The sensing system is designed to be able to detect both the translational motion of the platform and the rotational motion for small deviations around the planar configuration. For the absolute static estimation problem an algorithm based on Non Linear Least Squares was developed and subsequently extended to the dynamic case using the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter. In order to model the dynamics of the electromagnets, verify their linearity and the superposition of magnetic fields, a procedure was developed based on system identification experiments. This allowed also for the development of a very accurate open-loop estimator that can predict the generated magnetic field and remove its effects on the hall-effect sensors used for localization. While only two degree-of-freedom planar xy motion is desired, the system must be controlled in six degrees-of-freedom. For the control of the platform in six degrees-of-freedom a feedback linearization and decoupling algorithm is developed. The simplified system is subsequently controlled separately in each axis with state feedback along with a reduced order observer to compensate the joined effect of disturbance, modeling error, and cross coupling.","magnetic levitation; 3D printing; hall-effect sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

This graduation work focused on finding how one could standardize one part of the navigation locks, namely the lock gate. Besides, finding an innovative idea for the lock gate was also part of the agenda. This resulted in the design of a concrete modular rolling arc gate. The modular part as a means of standardizing the gate, by making it possible to install the gate at many different sites; the concrete and arc gate parts are the parts where innovation is applied. The most difficult part was to support the gate in the gate recesses in such a way that bending stresses were reduced to a minimum (creating an arch-like structure) without any extra mechanisms, to keep the gate light and thin. This was done by clamping the gate in the recess, which resulted in some contradicting demands. On the one hand, the gate needed to be flexible, so that it would bend enough to clamp in the recess, hence, a thin gate was required. On the other hand, the gate needed to be strong enough to bear the loads, hence, the gate needed to be thicker. The lock gate could not be as thin as required to reach the supports through bending and this concept was concluded technically unfeasible. It is however recommended to investigate the costs and benefits of a concrete modular gate design because this resulted in a relatively easy to build and maintain design (given that the supports had not been a problem).","lock; standardization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Monitoring the health status of a system is even more relevant for safety critical applications, such as chemical and nuclear plants, medicine, transportation, and security systems. The occurrence of abnormal events on these processes may lead to malfunctions and disasters in ultimate fault conditions, as witnessed in the past. The paramount importance of the topic and the increasing interest in multiple-model approaches under the scope of on-line fault detection and isolation motivates this thesis. Initially, focus is given to classical multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) in which an in-depth study is undertaken for the design of a scheme capable of determining the working regime of a system. This is done by identifying the region where the fault parameters lie under the associated uncertainty domain. The design procedure is built on a performance-based strategy, which ensures a well-defined level of state estimation performance despite the fault location. Due to the high computational complexity of the classical MMAE approach, in what follows we propose a novel bank design based on the combination of Kalman and robust H2 filters. This strategy leads to a substantial reduction on the number of estimators in the bank, while preserving the desired state estimation performance. In both approaches a prominent study on convergence properties is performed, so that robustness of the methods is guaranteed. Computational simulations based on a generic helicopter model are also executed to prove the potential of the strategies developed and provide a verification basis for the theoretical results achieved.","multiple-model adaptive estimation; model-based fault diagnosis; robust H2 filters; state estimation in uncertain systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2015","The aim of this thesis study is to increase the geological knowledge on the presence of Heavy Mineral Sands (HMS) in the concession areas owned by Guinea Alluvial Mining (GAM) in Guinea. In order to achieve this aim the following main research question has been formulated: Does exploration of the concession areas show sufficient Heavy Mineral Sand prospectivity for further exploration? To answer this main research question, the following secondary research questions have been formulated: 1) What are the industry standards for HMS deposits? 2) Does literature research indicate that HMS could be discovered in the concession areas? 3) Do the exploration results show sufficient HMS exploration potential when compared to the industry standards for HMS deposits? In order to answer these research questions a literature study has been conducted and exploration has been conducted in Guinea. In the literature study the key parameters which form HMS and the main characteristics of HMS reserves have been researched. The literature research shows that the concession areas, owned by GAM, could contain HMS deposits. The exploration results show that two locations contain HMS and VHM (ilmenite, rutile and zircon) anomalies. These locations are situated in the sandy coast. The other geological domains in the concession areas (paleo strandlines, hydromorphic terraces and ancient terraces) did not show HMS and VHM anomalies. To estimate an exploration target for future exploration the block model method has been used. An estimation of the exploration target size has been estimated for a worst and a best case scenario. In the best case scenario, the Total Heavy Mineral (THM) content in the first two meters of sandy coast is assumed to be continuous. In the worst case scenario, the Total Heavy Mineral (THM) content in the first two meters of sandy coast are discontinuous. In this worst case scenario, the only locations which contain HMS mineralization are the locations which have been sampled. It is concluded that the estimated exploration target size, based on the explored areas, shows insufficient HMS and VHM mineralization to have resaonable prospects to eventually be mined. However, the estimation of the exploration target is only based on the sampled geological domains. The area west of Taboriyah contains a sandy coastline which has not been explored yet and has therefore not been taken into account when estimating the exploration target size. In addition, the exploration target is based on the first 2 meters of sediment in the sandy coast. If a drilling survey is conducted HMS could be found deeper than 2 meters. Therefore, sufficient HMS exploration potential remains for the concession areas to be prospective.","Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering / Earth Sciences","","9.828786, -13.7677"

(mentor)","2015","Climbing indoors is growing in popularity and is even considered to be included in the Olympic games of 2020 in Japan. Despite the fact that numerous new climbing gyms are being built, there has been little innovation in the gyms themselves. For decades, climbing gyms have wooden walls with plastic holds screwed onto them, and the question arises how the training of indoor climbers can be modernized and improved. Currently, when climbers train, they climb a route of a certain level. A number indicates the level of difficulty, which is determined by type of holds, the length of the route and the angle of the wall. The route is marked with coloured holds, and the climber is only allowed to use holds of that colour. This way, a climber only practises the separate moves to climb, but does not exercise explorative route finding. Thus, as a climber you are expected to execute the series of steps the route setter has made. When climbing outside on rocks explorative route finding is apparent. Outside, the bumpy rocks present numerous options of holds, compelling the climbers to decide on their body position, the placement of hands, feet and centre of gravity, and which holds to use. The climber explores what his best body position should be in order to proceed, thus constantly solving a puzzle during the climb. Indoor climbing routes deprive climbers that puzzle because the route setter has solved that puzzle for them. One of the solutions to introduce that puzzling feeling is to enlarge the holds. Big holds offer more opportunities the grab the hold, therefore increasing explorative behaviour to find the right body position. The holds have long straight edges and flat planes without any bumps or dents so that the climber isn’t guided. The climber is forced to feel himself where it’s best to hold the edge. These big holds have a block-like shape that can be seen in Image 1. When a route consists of only blocks, the number of options to climb that route increases hugely, making it harder to determine its level of difficulty. Therefore, a new points system is introduced by the designer, to quantify the route and to motivate the climber. Some edges are tougher to hold due to the angle between the planes. Also, some edges of blocks are harder to reach due to their placement within the route. In the design, the edges get points. The most difficult edge is given 1 point, and the easiest edge receives 5 points, as shown in Image 2. The difficulty of the route depends on which edges of blocks the climber uses to get to the top. The climber is supposed to finish the route with the least amount of points. This way, the climber is exploring his maximal abilities to find the route resulting in the lowest score. In the user test, 10 medium skilled climbers were asked to clime the newly designed blocks and score their opinions on a questionnaire. In the first round, the score numbers on the blocks were covered, so that the climbers were free to choose how they wanted to use the blocks. In the second round, the climbers were given the task to climb using the lowest total score to reach the top. The blocks were judged to be more fun and challenging; climbers were more engaged to help each other with suggestions and stimulated each other to achieve the best scores. The new blocks were judged as thrilling and more challenging, but not as imitation of climbing on outdoor rocks","climbing; training; exploration; challenge; indoor climbing; outdoor climbing; gamification; motor skill learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Breugem, W.P. (mentor); Hendrix, M.H.W. (mentor)","2015","In the oil and gas industry, pipeline networks are used to transport the production fluids from wells to production plants. During normal operation, the pipelines need regular cleaning and inspection. Typically, the pipeline maintenance is performed by pigging, which refers to using devices known as “pigs ”(Pipeline Inspection Gauges) to perform various maintenance operations of the pipeline. In order to describe the motion of the pig in the pipeline, detailed understanding of the flow around the pig is required. In this research, a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) approach was applied to model fully turbulent flow (Re ¼ 107) around various types of bypass pigs. We especially focused on the relation between the overall pressure drop, which was represented by a dimensionless pressure loss coefficient, and various dimensionless parameters describing the flow and the configuration. The pressure loss coefficient is caused by the fluid that passes through the bypass area. If the pressure loss coefficient is known, together with the friction between the moving pig and the pipe wall, the motion of the pig can be described. Moreover, often the flow in the pipeline is in multiphase (stratified flow) condition. Therefore, in this research the effect of multiphase flow around a bypass pig was also investigated. For the single phase study, two types of bypass pigs were investigated: the disk pig and the complex bypass pig. The disk pig has a fixed and relatively simple geometry, and it is based on the conventional bypass pig, with a deflector plate in front of the pig body. The complex bypass pig geometry is based on the disk pig, though now the bypass area is created by holes which can be adjusted. In reality, for these complex bypass pigs, the bypass pig velocity is controlled by adjusting the bypass area. For the conventional bypass pig, previous studies have shown that the Idelchik’s correlation for thick orifices can predict the pressure loss coefficient accurately. Thus a similar approach was applied in the disk pig study in order to obtain a theoretical correlation to predict the pressure loss coefficient for the disk pig. Indeed such a correlation was found which gives an accurate prediction for a certain parameter regime. In the complex bypass pig study, we mainly focused on the influence of the bypass area fraction on the pressure loss coefficient. Two correlations based on two approaches were suggested. It was found that these correlations can predict the overall pressure drop across the complex bypass pig accurately, especially when the opening fraction of the bypass adjusting holes was relatively large. Furthermore, for the multiphase study, the simpler pig models were investigated. First of all, the flow in front of a pig without bypass region was investigated. One of the practical purposes of this study is that we want to investigate under which condition the full pipeline perimeter gets wetted with liquid. This is important for the distribution of corrosion inhibitors. Moreover, the multiphase flow around a (conventional) bypass pig was investigated, to obtain a better understanding of the multiphase flow behaviour for bypass pigs.","CFD; Bypass pig","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Blom, E.M. (mentor)","2015","Although researchers have acknowledged the issue of commercial viability previously, it is only recently that they have laid emphasis on addressing the relative importance of commercial viability to catalyze the dissemination of decentralized sustainable energy systems to rural consumers in developing countries. A business enterprise is said to be commercially viable if its revenues are > costs. Here in this thesis these business enterprises or promoters of efforts are called as renewable energy companies (REC’s). Moreover researchers have failed to acknowledge or address the role of revenues even after acknowledging the merits of a market driven approach as opposed to donor driven approach. Given such a high relevance of revenues in a market approach to operate successfully and a lack of focus on the same by researchers, in this thesis we will analyze the practical issue of commercial viability of Indian REC’s through the lens of revenue model, while also addressing the literature gap on revenue drivers or revenue model components by exploring various relevant revenue drivers of commercially viable REC’s. This study takes an exploratory case study approach to enlist all the relevant revenue driver or revenue model components that are relevant for REC’s to attain commercial viability. This thesis primarily consists of three subsequent phases: first phase: theoretical gap identification. Second phase: identification of types and components of a revenue model and third phase: building a revenue driver – commercial viability framework. The aim of the first phase was to narrow in on the literate gap and also present relevant background literature. The first phase yielded the literature gap on revenue model components in addressing the practical issue of commercial viability. The aim of the second phase was to identify revenue model types and components. The result of which was that two types of revenue models namely: ownership and service revenue models was discovered. Most importantly six potential revenue drivers were also discovered. They are: consumer trust, pricing strategy, willingness to pay, flexibility of payments, number of users and revenue sharing. These six revenue drivers were derived on the premise that they would increase revenues such that REC’s attain commercial viability. This made up our initial conceptual model. Next, the aim of the third phase was to build a framework on revenue drivers or revenue model components – commercial viability of Indian REC’s. In order to do so firstly we analyzed cases where the initial conceptual model is leveraged into a more relevant context of Indian REC’s. The case studies were based on SIMPA Networks, Onergy, Rural Spark and MeraGao Power (MGP). All of these cases primarily are Indian companies exclusively catering to the Indian rural market otherwise also known as REC’s or Indian REC’s. The results of this section yielded us a relevant set of 12 revenue drivers i.e. six more in comparison to the initial set of 6 revenue drivers. They are consumer trust, supplier trust, pricing strategies, willingness to pay, flexibility of payments, number of users, revenue sharing, consumer financing, size of payments, service customization, after sales service/maintenance and discounts. Secondly, a cross case analysis was performed wherein findings from each case are pitched against each other to find the similarities and differences. The result of this section was firstly that, any sort of generalizations based on the type of revenue models was hard to come by and most importantly the type of revenue model only signified its affect on the source of financing and could play no role in explaining how and why commercial viability was being achieved. Moreover it also led to an inference that service revenue model poses more risk than ownership revenue model but however commercial viability was achieved by adopting both types of revenue model, which was quite the contrary to the outcome of literature survey. Secondly, list of revenue drivers was further narrowed to 10 from the previous list of 12. Basically willingness to pay was eliminated because it was already being considered in pricing strategies and number of users was also removed because it affected the commercial viability of REC’s in terms of both costs and revenues whereas the others only impacted only revenues. The final set of relevant revenue drivers are: consumer trust, supplier trust, pricing strategies, flexibility of payments, size of payments, revenue sharing, consumer financing, service customization, after sales service/maintenance and discounts. Lastly, a set of three factors was identified that actually contributed to the increase in revenues such that revenues were > costs. Or in other words served as a link between revenue drivers and commercial viability. They are namely: rate of adoption, recoupment of costs (regular payments) and retention. It is these afore mentioned revenue drivers that impact the three factors, which subsequently drive or increase revenues such that commercial viability can be attained. The ownership revenue model primarily derives its revenues from only the adoption factor, which subsequently brings in revenues to attain commercial viability. That said the adoption of DSE’s by the rural consumers is contingent or dependent on revenue drivers like consumer financing and size of payments among others. The revenues of REC’s employing service revenue model primarily depended on all the three factors like rate of adoption, recoupment of costs and retention. More specifically the revenue drivers should be conducive to rural customers such that they firstly adopt the product and/or service and most importantly make regular payments, which translates to revenues while retaining the existing customers. Moreover the retention factor only applies to REC’s that adopt a service revenue model with only a service platform like MGP unlike other REC’s, which adopt a only a product platform like Onergy or both product and service platform like in the case of SIMPA and Rural spark. In the backdrop of afore mentioned scientific implications several managerial implications can also be derived. Among many the key take away for incumbent managers and future potential entrants will be to look at each of the revenue drivers and adopt them carefully such that commercial viability can be attained contingent on the his/her appetite for risk and most of all focus less on the type of revenue model because that is not going to help achieve commercial viability. Future research should be aimed at firstly developing a more elaborate revenue driver- commercial viability framework. After which each of the revenue driver’s true affects on each of the factors should be quantitatively determined. This further helps to gain greater generalizability. That said the key limitation of this thesis is that it focuses only on one country i.e. India among other developing countries.","revenue models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-16","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","E & I","","21.0000, 78.0000"

(mentor)","2015","The overall behaviour of the tide-dominated Western Scheldt is in general well known. Its multichannel-system consists of ebb and flood channels, separated by intertidal areas; the tidal flats. The estuary shows a dynamic behaviour of erosion and sedimentation of the tidal flats. A large flow slide occurred at the tidal flat of Walsoorden in July 2014. A flow slide occurs when the slope is sufficient steep and a trigger starts the process of liquefaction or breaching. In a few hours a huge amount of sediment slides away, causing loss of surface and endangering safety. During this flow slide approximately 800,000 m3 of sediment flowed to the navigation channel, leaving a large gap in the tidal flat. This flow slide is one of the largest known in this part of the Western Scheldt. A measurement campaign was initiated to measure the bathymetry around the tidal flat, starting a few months before the flow slide. After the event monthly measurements were taken to monitor the development of the area. Dunes were formed on top of the accumulation of sediment, which travelled in flood (eastern) direction. A large part of the sediment accumulation was transported as bed load in flood direction, which is unexpected since the Zuidergat channel is known as an ebb channel. The sediment volume in the channel is decreasing, suggesting suspended load transport. The channel dominance is determined based on three characteristics: the water level, velocities and sediment transport. Based on water level data flood dominant behaviour is expected, while velocity and sediment transport data result in ebb dominance. Based on the bathymetry measurements, the volume changes in the channel and in the gap were determined. Those showed an exponential change in time. The erosion rate in the channel was faster than the sedimentation rate in the gap. The recovery time of the system is estimated through extrapolation of this data. The recovery time for the channel is thus shorter than the recovery time for the gap, 9 months and 1.5 to 2 years respectively. An existing Delft3D model schematisation of the Western Scheldt was used to calculate the morphological development. The model was setup around the tidal flat of Walsoorden. The boundary conditions were generated by a model schematization which describes the full Scheldt estuary; the validation was performed with observations of water level and velocity along the tidal flat. The morphological changes determined by the model are different from the bathymetric changes found in the measurements. In the model the sediment accretion smoothens out; the sediment is deposited on the sides of the accumulation. Most of the sediment from the channel is transported in ebb direction. The model shows almost no sedimentation in the gap, which is contradictive with the measurements. The sensitivity of the model was tested to investigate the differences between the observations and the model. A varying sediment diameter in the model had effect on the amount of transported sediment only, not on the residual direction. The used model is a 2DH model, neglecting the secondary circulations. The sensitivity of these processes was tested using a 3D model. From this model it was found that the secondary circulations were not of significant importance concerning the areal development after the flow slide. Finally, a non-cohesive sediment fraction was implemented in the model. This showed sedimentation in the gap. Therefore, it is suggested that the sediment settling in the gap is a combination of cohesive and non-cohesive sediment, which is supported by the observations.","Walsoorden; Western Scheldt; flow slide; morphology; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Producing an oil well is a transient process, and although we like to assume there is a steady state phase in the production life, it is a fragile situation. Due to the many unknowns in the reservoir, changes in well production performance cannot easily be predicted. Changes in the subsurface will influence the production and lifetime of the well and need to be identified as soon as possible. Consequently, monitoring well performance is of great importance. Identifying deviations from production forecasts is difficult, because mismatches between predicted and measured flow rates can have two causes: either the production prediction model is not valid, or the production test data is wrong. This research aims to quantify the uncertainty inherent to performance models caused by the uncertainty in input parameters and by the method used to establish the model. This is done by introducing the performance envelope, a range instead of a line in which the well is expected to produce for the given input parameters and the used method to establish it. Two workflows are proposed to establish such a performance envelope, one for fitted models and one for simulated models. Additionally, a rate selection method is proposed, optimizing the test program by selecting the three rates which result in the narrowest confidence interval. The results show that a Performance Envelope can be computed for both fitted and simulated performance models, but that further research is needed to use them as an objective criterion. Furthermore, they show that rate selection has influence on the quality of the resulting model and that it can be used to optimize a test program.","production monitoring; performance models; well test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The problem here is then approached from a time difference of arrival (TDOA) perspective, which inherently cancels the onset times by subtracting the time of arrival (TOA) of a source at every receiver. An alternative approach is also proposed, which uses speech signals as calibration signals in order to estimate the onset times. Such an approach is based on an algorithm which uses artificial calibration signals to calculate the onsets. Those signals are known a-priori, which implies that an additional device which produces those signals is needed. Once both internal delays and onset times are known, the locations of both sources and receivers can be estimated using a current algorithm which is also described here","audio processing; TDOA; TOA; Onset time; Internal delay; Localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Signals and Systems","",""

A smart design can minimize the amount of maintenance dredging and thus improve the profitability of a port but also the long-term sustainability. As the preliminary design stages are often decisive for the final port layout, it is essential to quickly gain insight into the sedimentation quantities and governing processes, such that these can be accounted for in the port design. This leads to the main objectives for this research: - Develop a rapid integral modelling tool which accounts for the morphological aspects in and around a port, such as coastline evolution, sediment bypassing and port and channel sedimentation - Study the relation between port layout, coastline evolution and port and channel sedimentation The main process causing port sedimentation is the exchange of water between the port and the open sea. Water from outside the port brings in sediment which settles in the port basin. Three exchange mechanisms bring in sediment laden water: horizontal exchange due to eddy formation in the port entrance, vertical exchange due to density differences and tidal filling of the port basin. Channel sedimentation on the other hand is mainly caused by the reduction in velocity over the channel due to the increased depth. Not all sediment ends up in a port or channel. This part, the bypassing,moves beyond both breakwaters to either settle there or once again be part of the longshore transport. These processes can be represented by two empirical relations: SEDHAR (port sedimentation) & SEDPIT (channel sedimentation). These processes however need input in the form of (among others) flow velocities. A hydrodynamic model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) is combined with these empirical relations to calculate this input for these relations. The hydrodynamic model is however not fast enough to take a longterm process such as coastline evolution into account. A hybrid model is developed by incorporating a 1D coastline model which is able to calculate long term coastline change as well as short term hydrodynamic processes. The hybrid model can be applied to calculate sedimentation for the port and channel in a matter of ‘minutes - hours’ for a period of many years. The change in (longshore transport) bypassing due to coastline evolution, is expected to relate to sedimentation. To verify the hybrid model it is applied to the port of IJmuiden in the Netherlands. The model results show its capability of predicting sedimentation for several decades relatively quickly (less than an hour). The model is however not capable of predicting increased sedimentationwhich is expected due to coastline change. Further analysis has on the other hand shown the impact of change in sediment concentration or change in port and channel geometry on sedimentation. The recommendation is to study sediment concentrations in and around the port more in detail and relate this to coastline change and sedimentation.","port; channel; sedimentation; hybrid; model; coastline; sedpit; silthar; hydrodynamic; rapid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kortmann, L.J. (mentor); van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor)","2015","Nowadays, the capacity of the lock becomes more important, since ports become busier and waterways more crowded. Still, the management of locks has not changed very much. Especially since locks are one of the most important factors that determine the capacity of a waterway. A lock limits the capacity of a waterway in two ways. First of all, the lock restricts the dimensions that can pass through the locks. Secondly, the lock limits the flow of vessels that can pass through the waterway. Since the dimensions of a lock are not likely to change, the focus of this study will be on the flow of the vessels. The question that will be answered during this study is the following: Which lock operation policies should be applied under which circumstances in order to contribute to an increase of the efficiency of the locks? A lock operation policy is a way in which the lock can be managed. This concerns both the order of vessels as well as placing vessels in a chamber. The circumstances can be divided in two types; the factors that determine whether a new policy would contribute to better performances and the general characteristics of a lock which need to be present in order to apply such a policy. The following policies are taken into account: 1. First come, first served (FCFS). This category is commonly used in practice and focus merely on the arrival time of the vessels and does not take into account the use of resources for determining the order of vessels 2. Shortest Processing time First (SPT). By using this policy, the vessel which has the shortest processing time is chosen to pass through the locks first. 3. Resource-based selection (RBS). This policy ensures an efficient use of the resources, since vessels who need resources are planned before the vessels who do not need resources. These three alternatives are compared with each other by means of a case study at the port of Amsterdam. The FCFS policy is used as the initial situation, while the other two policies are compared with this policy. By just comparing these policies based on the current arrivals at the port of Amsterdam, the results are almost equal. The reason that the capacity of the lock is not a problem yet and therefor other policies will not be more effective than the current one. By increasing the number of arrivals some interesting insights could be gained. First of all, both alternatives gave better results than the FCFS policy. The SPT reduced the waiting time for the locks and decreased the number of lockages. As a result more vessels could be handled. The RBS policy reduced the waiting time for resources and therefore increased the number of vessels that could be handled slightly. It can be said that the choice between those policies is dependent on the factor that limits the capacity. The table below shows a small part of the results of the study. It can be concluded that the FCFS policy is most efficient considering the number of lockages. The total waiting time is more or less equal. If the number of arrivals increases, the waiting time of the FCFS policy starts increasing faster than the other policies. The number of lockages remain lower than the other policies. This trend remains if the number of arriving vessels keeps increasing. The next step that has been taken is the generalization of these results. This concerns the circumstances that determine the success of specific lock operation policies and lock operation policies in general. It should be noted that the factors which are present in a lock system, but do not influence the effectiveness of a lock operation are equally important, since these factors can be neglected during the choice of the lock operation policy. These factors are the size of the chambers as long as there are multiple chambers, the pattern of arrivals and to a certain extent, the fleet mix. The factors that influence the effectiveness of the tested lock operation policies mainly concern the physical characteristics of the locks. If there are obstacles such as other locks near the lock, the effects of the tested lock operation policies are almost diminished. A second factor is planning horizon. If the arrival time of the vessels is known just before the arrival itself, it is nearly impossible to optimize the order of vessels. A last factor is the place of the lock in comparison with the sea and port. If the lock is located far from sea, the influence of the tide is larger. This results in less possibilities for changing the order of vessels, since the timeframe for most vessels is smaller. The effectiveness of the lock operation policies might also be influenced by some external factors. The first one are the weather conditions. If the weather conditions are bad, the choices might be limited. It might for example not be possible to handle large vessels or use a certain chamber. A second factor is the hydrological conditions, such as tide and current. Those factors can limit the flow of vessels regardless of the policy. So it can be concluded that it is possible to apply the results of this study in more situations than just the port of Amsterdam as long as the factors above are either met or taken into account. Since it is clear that the results of this study can to a certain extent be applied in various locks, the main research question can be answered. Which lock operation policies should be applied under which circumstances in order to contribute to an increase of the efficiency of the locks? The first conclusion that can be drawn is that the availability of resources can influence the choice between those policies. If the resources are scarce, it is better to focus on the resources and select the RBS alternative. However, if the focus is of the managers is on the environment and reducing costs, it might be considered to use FCFS, since this limits the number of lockages, without complicated rules or algorithms for planning which can increase the costs of the policy. The second conclusion that can be drawn is that the RBS principle is only beneficial if the number of arrivals is high and the resources are scarce. Even then, the average waiting time is not likely to decrease. This is due to the fact that the benefits of the RBS policy are diminished by the increase in waiting time for the lock itself. The number of vessels that can be handled will increase nevertheless. The third conclusion that can be drawn is that the same conclusion can be drawn about the SPT policy. If the number of vessels that arrives at the lock is limited, the possibilities to change this order are limited as well. Therefore, the SPT policy will only be effective if the number of arrivals is larger. The choice between the RBS and SPT is mainly dependent.","lock operation policies; discrete simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy analysis","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","The main driver of developments in the wind energy sector is not the absolute maximization of energy capture, but the reduction of the Cost of Energy (CoE). More and more research is carried out to investigate control of the air flow to reduce fatigue loads, structural requirements, and apply novel control strategies to ultimately reduce this important CoE. Plasma actuators have been the subject of an increasing amount of research in recent years in the field of Active Flow Control (AFC). Of particular interest to the present study is the alternating current Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator, which is widely used due to the low mass, low power consumption, fast response time, absence of moving parts and large actuation bandwidth. Successful applications of the technique include postponement and control of flow separation, transition delay by Tollmien-Schlichting wave cancellation, stream-wise vortex generation and the control of dynamic stall on oscillating airfoils. To fully take advantage of the potential performance increase DBD actuators can offer, its effect should be accounted for as early as possible in the aerodynamic design phase. Previous work at TU Delft incorporated the DBD plasma body force in the integral boundary layer formulations. In the light of discrepancies between the existing model and experimental observations, attention is focused on the skin friction. An experimental campaign was designed and conducted at the open jet facility to acquire high resolution PIV of the turbulent boundary layer during various states of boundary layer development, for both actuated and non-actuated cases. The velocity fields were post-processed to obtain the variation in skin friction induced by the DBD plasma. Major conclusion from the observations is the fact that the increase in skin friction due to actuation occurs downstream of the actual plasma body force region, and extents for approximately 2.6 body force lengths. A semi-elliptical fit is employed to model the variation in skin friction due to DBD plasma actuation dCf . The steps to be taken to implement the dCf in a numerical boundary layer solver are investigated. The work includes a first approach in Matlab, to pave the way for future work to include the skin friction correction in rapid-analysis, viscous-inviscid panel codes based on integral boundary layer formulation such as Rfoil.","Windenergy; skin friction; active flow control; DBD plasma actuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

(mentor)","2015","Analog interfacing is the only way to communicate with a quantum processor, whether it is applying qubit operations or reading their quantum states. There exist other applications where analog interfacing is abundant, e.g. sensor networks, automotive, industrial control, etc. In those applications the use of FPGAs is continuously growing, however a direct link between the analog world and the digital FPGA is still missing (except for the newest generation of FPGAs, where analog-to-digital conversion is present, but limited in performance). External analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are combined together with the FPGA to form a complete, application specific, system. This system is thus limited in compactness, exibility and reconfigurability. To address those issues we propose an ADC architecture, implemented entirely in a conventional FPGA, that is fully reconfifigurable and easy to calibrate. This allows one to alter the design, according to the system requirements. Therefore it can be used in a wide range of operating conditions, such as a harsh cryogenic environment, where we demonstrated that the FPGA is able to operate. This architecture employs time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and phase interpolation techniques to reach a sampling rate, higher than the clock frequency, up to 1.2 GSa/s. The resulting FPGA ADC can achieve a 8 bit resolution over a 0.6 to 1.9 V input range. The system non-linearities are less than 0.45 LSB. The main advantages of this architecture are its scalability and reconfigurability, enabling applications with changing demands on one single platform.","ADC; FPGA; deep cryogenic; quantum computing; TDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded systems","",""

(mentor)","2015","A ducted propeller configuration consists of a fixed annular nozzle surrounding the propeller. The nozzle has an airfoil shape which depends on the required performance of the system as well as the operating conditions. The flow-accelerating ducts provide a positive contribution to the thrust of the propulsor and they are used to increase the performance in heavy loading conditions, such as in the cases of tug boats or often for azimuthal thrusters. The performance of the propeller can be assessed with model tests or numerical simulations. As concerns the numerical simulations, boundary element methods (BEM) are used daily in the design stage for open propeller configurations, but the use for ducted propellers is still under development: viscous flow effects become important at the duct surface and the accuracy of the BEM method decreases. Alternatively, Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are possible but they require large CPU time so they cannot be used at the design stage routinely. In addition, a hybrid RANS-BEM method was developed at the Maritime Research Institute of the Netherlands (MARIN). The hybrid approach couples the viscous flow solution with the boundary element method: the propeller is not physically present in the RANS simulations, where it is substituted with a body force distribution whose strength is given by the BEM. This research has the objective to determine the accuracy and limitations of the BEM and the hybrid RANS-BEM approaches to predict the performance of ducted propellers in open water condition. Two test cases are considered. The propeller is the same for both cases (Ka4-70 propeller) whereas the duct is different (namely duct 19A and duct 37). The BEM method requires a modification of the duct trailing edge geometry to enforce the modelling of the wake sheet attached to the duct. An new iterative scheme that automatically computes the change in geometry based on a pressure-equality condition is developed; as a result, the boundary element method computations provide 2% to 7% accuracy in the prediction of the open water efficiency for the design condition and the high loading conditions. However, for the light loading conditions the BEM method is limited by the occurrence of flow separation at the duct outer surface. The RANS-BEM method improves the prediction at the large advance ratios for the first test case. However, for the second test case there is a constant over-prediction of the propeller thrust and torque. The reason for this over-prediction is likely related to the extent of flow separation occurring at the duct inner surface for all operating conditions, even though the lack of validation data for the second geometry tested does not allow to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, another objective of this study is to provide insight on the flow behaviour at the gap between the propeller and the nozzle. The ultimate goal is to give guidelines on the modelling of the flow in that region in a potential flow context. Former CFD calculations are analyzed in detail with focus on the gap flow. It is observed that the gap flow is dominated by the detachment of a vortex at small chord-wise positions from the blade pressure side to the blade suction side. This is the so-called tip leakage vortex. The vortex is seen to obstruct the gap at the mid-chord positions and it strongly interacts with the tip trailing edge vortex.","RANS-BEM; Ducted Propellers; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics","",""

To achieve this, intuitive information such as haptic data and force feedback is proposed. Because of the characteristics of the remote environments and to prevent damage to the robot and the environment itself, collision avoidance algorithms are implemented. These need to work with unknown and dynamic environments, such as an oil extraction platform. An added limitation for the remote deployment of robots is the communication channel. Information such as video, audio and control directives share the same communication channel and hence, the same bandwidth. It is important to have an intelligent data management system for the haptic information to prevent the saturation of such communication channels.","telepresence; haptic; vector field histogram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor)","2015","ASML is always searching for improvements in reducing the servo error of both the Wafer Stage and the Reticle Stage of their lithography machines. Due to the repetitive motion and corresponding repetitive servo error of the Reticle Stage Short Stroke (RSSS), Iterative Learning Control (ILC) can be a powerful method to further reduce the servo error. ILC is an iterative optimization procedure, where the servo error data from the previous trial is used to create an additional feedforward input vector to further reduce the servo error. The main goal of this MSc thesis project is the implementation of ILC on the RSSS of the ASML Twinscan NXT wafer scanner, with the purpose of improving the Moving Average (MA) and Moving Standard Deviation (MSD) of the servo error during the scanning window. Successful application of common ILC methods requires exact repetitiveness of the setpoint trajectory as well as the need to iterate. However, the amount of iterations needed for the ILC must be kept at a minimum to maintain a profitable throughput of wafers. Furthermore, the setpoint trajectories of the machine can be significantly different for different jobs. Frequency-based ILC, which is the most straightforward method of designing the ILC algorithm, is able to improve the MA and MSD of the servo error in the y-direction (i.e., scanning direction) of the RSSS with 81% and 21%, respectively. In the x-direction, improvements in the MA and MSD of respectively 50% and 14% are made. In both directions the performance rise is achieved after just one iteration. Furthermore, an improvement by ILC in one direction does not cause any significant performance decrease in another direction which will drive them out of specifications. Frequency-based ILC is, however, not able to cope with changes of the setpoint during scanning, yielding significant performance loss. Norm-Optimal ILC with the use of basis functions is an ILC method where the generated feedforward signal is parameterized in terms of the setpoint. If the changes in the setpoint are known the ILC algorithm can adapt to this change and thus keep its performance. Norm-Optimal ILC with basis functions outperforms standard ILC algorithms by roughly tenfold when a large setpoint change is performed during operation of the RSSS. For an improvement in the MSD of the servo error, extra sinusoidal functions with specific frequencies are added to the basis which will prevent amplification of the servo error around those frequencies in the MSD domain. Norm-Optimal ILC with basis functions has proven its robustness against ?setpoint changes when applied on the RSSS, but the trade-off against general performance is still too big. If the general performance can be improved further, especially in the MA region of the servo error, Norm-Optimal ILC with basis functions can be a valuable addition to the RSSS control structure when dealing with changing setpoint profiles. Iterative Learning Control proves to give significant and valuable improvement of the performance of the RSSS in terms of overlay (MA) and fading (MSD) and can be implemented on top of the current control architecture at ASML.","Iterative Learning Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Hoftijzer, J.W. (mentor)","2015","With the booming of air-travel, the demand for quality in travel is rising. This master thesis aims to elevate the inflight experience for the upcoming aircraft model 777X. The goal is to reshape the aircraft interior in the door 2 entry area by providing a better space comfort, ergonomics and user experience to the target group – the passenger and the cabin crew in the business class. Several studies have shown that associating flight journey with comfort helps an airline to gain passenger’s loyalty. However, while services outside of the plane are catching up to the sudden rise of the mobile technology, the cabin interior design reacts slowly and falls into a competition of maximizing the number of seats. The door 2 area plays an important role especially on a twin aisle aircraft. It is the boarding entry and disembarking exit of the aircraft where more than half of the passengers will pass. Yet, the design language of the door 2 facilities is not consistent to the seating area and many still look stale and strictly functional on most of the aircrafts. The first step was to gain insights of the aviation industry and the 777X. In the internal and external study sector, many literature and company reports have been studied. It discusses the competitiveness of 777X and the transition around the cabin interior. Also the holistic environment of aviation has been viewed, in which the “Golden Age” flying experience and the current air travel status quo have been compared. Finally it finishes with an overview of relevant trends. Two explorative user research were conducted. A questionnaire with 127 passenger feedbacks has summarized their inflight activities and revealed their comfort experiences that are associated with the service touch points. An in-depth look into the cabin crew routine and working environment was executed by several interviews and a fly along documentation. This part of the user research has brought a better understanding of the cabin crew’s working process and the problems that need to be tackled. The collected insights from the previous research have been analyzed and put into a SWOT model. After a selection process, it has led to the design direction: an adaptive space with integrated smart system. The design vision has shifted the perspective into delivering comfort and convenience to the cabin crew that also generates added value for the passengers. Many students and company designers have participated in the brainstorming session. During the creative facilitation, the attendees were asked to create an ideal scenery of a dreamlike travel experience and to give the possible combination of the features that correspond to those imaginations. The above guidelines have resulted in FiO. FiO is a concept that represents the whole interior and the system design of the future cabin. It involves a combination of an adaptive interior space that is able to transform into different functions for different type of users, such as self catering bar stand, fold-out stool and a media projection wall. The design does not only regain the space of comfort, align its appearance with the business class area, the innovative cabin crew control system also provides digital assistance to help the cabin crew to deliver a better service. A virtual reality prototype was used to evaluate the design outcome. Eight target users have reviewed FiO and gave an overall positive reaction. These participants have shown their engagement when immersed in the new design and have all agreed on the potential that VR prototypes bring. Finally, the design was reviewed internally with the company designers and engineers, and got an approval of its value. At the end of this project, several design ideas within FiO have been patented by B/E Aerospace.","aircraft; interior; 777X; cabin crew; passenger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","The main objective of this Master’s thesis is to develop an optimization routine to improve ice-class propeller design methodology using the design space within the ice-class rules. Ice impacts on a ship propeller give additional design demands to ensure reliability and safety. Consequently, ice class propellers feature thicker blades, therewith compromising fuel efficiency. However, ships trading the Baltic states and Scandinavia only sail two to five percent of their time in ice-infested waters. Propulsive efficiency should hence be optimized for ice-free conditions only, while still having sufficient ice performance and strength. The Finnish Swedish Ice Class Rules prescribe loads on the propeller blade as five load cases of uniform pressure that should be applied on the propeller blade. The Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) is coupled to MARIN’s in-house propeller geometry generator, hydrodynamic boundary element analysis method PROCAL and a finite element analysis to evaluate the propeller blade strength. Both the radial and chordwise propeller distributions are parameterized by means of Bézier curves into optimization design variables. With these expansions, the computational framework is capable to automatically satisfy the ice-class stress constraints while converging to the best possible objective values. Each propeller within the optimization is iterated on mean pitch towards a design thrust. The four optimization objectives that are considered in this Master’s thesis are propeller efficiency, thrust variation throughout the ship’s wake field, propeller mass and ice-induced loading. Efficiency is considered as main objective while thrust variation is intended to provide interaction with the wake field. Besides the practical importance of the mass objective, it also guides the optimization towards high efficiency and maximum allowable material stresses. Based on a steady simulation of ice milling by means of an idealized ice-load pressure distribution, the ice-induced loading can be estimated as quantification of ice-performance. Best practice guidelines on the usage of PROCAL within the optimization are developed based on grid refinement and numerical uncertainty studies. Four different implementations of the finite element method are compared to the solution from a dense tetrahedral solid element mesh. Linear shell elements appear to perform best, both in terms of computational time and accuracy. A case study shows that ice-induced loading can be reduced as function of particularly the pitch distribution and blade profile geometry. It is also observed that the optimization searches for the weaknesses within the computational methods. For instance, it appears that the current ice-class rules allow highly skewed propellers, despite damage cases in practise. The optimization results are encouraging for future work concerning the optimization of blade profiles, although further work is required. It appears that the thrust variation objective steers towards flat chordwise pressure distributions. Cavitation computations are not yet included in the optimization, nonetheless, the optimized propellers show only little cavitation in the tip region. In conclusion, the optimization seems to provide a well-balanced starting point towards the design of high efficiency ice-class propellers.","ice; propeller; optimization; genetic; class","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics / Resistance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Cervone, A. (mentor)","2015","Robust turbulence modelling of cavitating flows is essential for physically accurate predictions of the performance characteristics of cryogenic rocket turbo-pump inducers. Numerical modelling of such flows complement experiments and are comparatively inexpensive, but they lack accurate predictive capabilities. This work focuses on the characterisation of the choice of turbulence models on cavitation predictions for the modelling of cryogenic turbo-pump inducer. To isolate the influence of the turbulence modelling effects on the concurrent physical phenomena arising in the inducer, four canonical problems are abstracted and studied individually to separately consider rotation, adverse pressure gradients, blade passage and bluff body cavitation. Additionally, cavitation bubble dynamics in a bubbly flow in a 3D inducer are numerically simulated and studied so as to understand the effects of such on flow turbulence. It has been found that the type of cavitation model and the choice of turbulence model play a major role in the prediction of phase-distribution in the flow and concomitantly, on the cavitation induced instabilities predicted from computational fluid dynamics. The influence of the turbulence model is strongly dependent on the type of flow and a universal model which can be used to accurately predict cavitation in all flow domains seems to be unavailable among the existing classical turbulence closure models (both for two-equation and second-order closures). Stark differences in the predictions of cavitation are observed among non-bounded, bounded, and rotating flows based uniquely on the selection of turbulence models. The influence of other parameters such as the thermo-physical fluid characteristics, Reynolds number, or turbulence intensity have a minor effect for non-bounded flows. On the other hand, cavitation arising within the blade passage (bounded flows), the selection of the thermo-physical characteristics has a great effect on the cavitation prediction. Simulations of bubble dynamics using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in cryogenic bubbly flows, with and without thermal effects, clearly depict the cavitating regions in a 3D inducer and yield corresponding bubble oscillation frequencies and time scales. The thermal effects attenuate bubble oscillations and distinct dominant frequencies of oscillations are observed for changing initial bubble radii. The information obtained from the turbulence model influence on cavitation and bubble oscillation influence on flow turbulence is used in the analysis of turbulence-cavitation interaction. A set of considerations are provided to turbo-pump designers as they need to carefully consider the choice of turbulence model and cavitation physics in order to use CFD tools to predictively model cryogenic inducers. These considerations will in turn help to improve dependability of the CFD tools, which will lead to reduced computational and monetary costs.","Turbopump; Cavitation; Turbulence Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","The main objective of this thesis project is to establish an optimization framework that can carry out robust aerodynamic design tasks. The work is based on the single-point optimization module of the SU2 code, which contains the partial differential equation solver for flow evaluation and gradient calculation based on the adjoint method. The research work can be divided into two parts: the first one is the establishment of the optimization structure and the corresponding implementation. And the second part is the aerodynamic design examples. During creating the framework of the robust optimization process, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm is used to establish the main structure (outer loop). With the conjugate search directions provided by the CG method, line searches are implemented with the application of the strong Wolfe condition (inner loop). In order to carry out robust optimizations within the uncertain operating conditions, the format of the objective function should be defined properly. The Taguchi’s robust design theory is used to create the objective function that takes both the performance expectation and the variance into account simultaneously. As the CG algorithm cannot directly deal with constraints, they should be converted to the penalty terms in the objective function. To check the validity of the established robust optimization process, two examples are tested concerning the wave drag reduction of the NACA0012 airfoil under subsonic condition, with lift and thickness constraints. The first problem is to reduce the drag under the uncertain Mach number and angle of attack which obey certain kind of normal distributions separately. The continuous probabilities of the two uncertainties are firstly discretized into 9 operating conditions and the joint probability is calculated. After that optimizations are carried out under these sampled conditions. The results show that the process can indeed provide robust drag reduction. Compared to the results of the two single-point optimizations under different conditions, the drag value is effectively reduced especially under higher Mach numbers and larger angles of attack. The change of the weight factor distribution for the drag expectation and the variance has noticeable influence on the drag value under the most critical condition. The second problem is to reduce the drag within a certain range of the Mach number while keep a constant lift. The Mach number is the only uncertainty source and it is discretized at 3 sampled points. The results show that the shock wave can be eliminated under all 3 conditions. As a result, both the drag expectation and the variance are significantly reduced. The robust optimizations with different weight factor distribution have similar results except for the one that only focuses on the drag variance reduction. The latter optimization provides a result with nearly no drag variance at the cost of higher drag values throughout the whole tested domain. And the drag increases more quickly than other robust optimization results with the increment of Mach number. Actually, for this problem, a single-point optimization under the highest Mach number could also provide robust drag reduction performance. The test examples preliminarily proved the validity of the established robust optimization process. However, it is recommended that the effectiveness should be further tested with more complicated problems in the future.","robust; conjugate gradient; Taguchi's theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

The TU Delft has set itself a number of sizeable energy saving goals for the near future, but with current initiatives focusing mostly on efficiency and responsible sourcing, not much is being done about altering the demand for energy. In this thesis I set out to design a solution that targets the energy problem from a behavior change perspective. The project brief of this graduation thesis comes forth from a design challenge formulated by Gert Jan de Werk for students participating in the D-exto summer programme. The assignment was to create an iconic, TU Delft relevant installation that could show occupants of a building the current state of energy use in a supply and demand form. The goal of this installation is to create an awareness of the amount of energy that is being used and the portion that is used efficiently. The ICON, as it was called was meant to communicate the goals of the TU Delft with respect to sustainability and energy use while simultaneously showcasing the state of the art in technology. The project was picked up as a part of Jantien Doolaard’s (former IDE student) work on improving energy behavior at IDE. In collaboration with a group of students from the “Sustainable Innovation in Practice” course at TPM (faculty of Technology, Policy and Management), first steps were made towards realizing this “energy icon”. After completion, a demand remained for the further development of the installation. In my research I explore how tangible and non tangible interactions with an installation can be used to alter people’s energy saving behavior. Contextual research provided by Doolaard provides a solid base for a complete redesign of the ICON using social and persuasive design methods.","energy; behavior; TRNKT; interactive; sustainability; persuasive design; social design; iterative; prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of the current design is to be used in a friction brake. A specific magnet configuration is used to achieve a relatively linear force-distance relationship. The configuration consist of three block-magnets, from which one magnet translates and two magnets are placed in a stationary steel U-shape. This force-distance relationship is balanced by a piecewise linear characteristic achieved by using multiple compression springs with different action-initiation points. The proof-of-concept build consists of a lever mechanism with a lever arm of 100 mm, one set of magnets and three compression springs. By varying the position of the lever from to 5.04, the force in the springs is varied between 0N and 872 N.

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2015","In the last couple of years there has been a massive increase in the development of wearable self-monitoring products and services. Within this project the initial goal was to explore the possibilities how parents of young children could be supported with a wearable device which is able to monitor vital signs or detect specific symptoms when dealing with an acute sick child. The project was specified by setting out to develop a product with wearable capabilities which could transform or adapt to provide the needed health information of a child and support parents who are in doubt of their child’s health. The analysis phase revealed temperature is seen by both parents and GP´s as a valuable indicator to determine/track the severity of sick child and was therefore selected as the main vital sign to monitor. Other vital signs and symptoms which would provide extra support but were also technically feasible to monitor were explored. Monitoring respiration and detecting febrile convulsions were identified as sources of health information which in combination with temperature could create a greater level of support for parents. The design goal which formed the scope of the development phase was to develop a product which is already used in the existing life context of parents but has an additional unobtrusive, comfortable, wearable core temperature monitoring functionality. Existing thermometers offer two functionalities, either a spot-check measurement or continuous core temperature measurement in the form of a wearable. These wearables proofed to be neither reliable nor comfortable. A combination of these functionalities in one product was identified as an opportunity as it could create a device which could adapt to the information needed by the parents. A product which is able to give quick and accurate access to information on the child’s temperature and the possibility to track the temperature over longer periods of time when necessary. Based on additional research, brainstorm sessions with expert, guidelines and co-creations sessions with parents a product idea was selected which is able to transform for spot-check to wearable thermometer positioned on the edge of a diaper. In the embodiment phase a working prototype of a sensor was build to test two different methods to unobtrusively measure core temperature. Two product designs were 3D printed to test what method to connect the probe and the wearable and attach the wearable to the diaper would be convenient and reliable. The product proposal in which this resulted is called Snappy, a thermometer which is able to transform from a spot check-thermometer to a wearable which can continuously monitor core temperature, respiration and possibly detect febrile convulsions. A novel feature is that the Snappy combines wearable and spot-check temperature measurements in one device, using the spot-check measurement to calibrate the wearable.","wearable; thermometer; transformable; children","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The goal of this research is to study the subspace identification of 2D Roesser models to model the spatial dynamics of a deformable mirror. Two subspace identification algorithms for 2D Roesser models are presented. Both rely on the decomposition of the Roesser model into two 1D state-space models. The difference is how the models are connected. In the first case the 1D models are connected in a feed-back loop. In the second case the 1D models are connected in series. The subspace identification using the feed-back decomposition provides good estimates of the system matrices, but can only be applied to a subclass of Roesser models. Is is also shown that using the estimates from the subspace method as an initial guess for a parametric identification allows to identify more general Roesser models. A subspace identification algorithm for the decomposition in series has been studied and handles a subset of Roesser models as well.","subspace identification; 2D state-space models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","","",""

Especially seniors find it very hard to make the necessary switch to online banking. The literature study and user research of this thesis identified 5 main issues that seniors face related to online banking: Society is digitalizing at a fast pace and seniors feel neglected and left out. Seniors are frustrated with their bank because the services they use are disappearing while the board of directors receives extra bonuses. The foremost hurdle of seniors towards online banking is a lack of trust in the security of the internet. Seniors prefer to stick to offline banking because it gives them a feeling of control over their finances. Seniors feel digitally helpless online and stress out when they have to use a digital device. The final design presented in this thesis consists out of a workshop in combination with a new website. The service is called: Cursus Eenvoudig Internet Bankieren (CEIB) and the new website: Eenvoudig Internet Bankieren (EIB). The combination tries to address the trust and usability concerns that seniors have when banking online. Senior customers are invited by mail and if necessary by phone to participate in a CEIB workshop. During the first part of the workshop seniors are introduced to EIB and are informed how to safely bank online. In the second part of the workshop, they can practice EIB supported by an ABN AMRO employee. The workshop should be a fun experience and give seniors the trust and confidence to use EIB at home. EIB is a website especially designed for senior users. Through this website they can to transfer money and check their bank statements. The design of the website is optimized to fit their needs and mental model. This way the design makes sure seniors can and will use the website autonomously at home. Designing a website for seniors is more than just creating a simple design. The key is not to create the quick interaction younger people desire but a understandable design that provides control and overview. To guide designers in the further development of this website 10 design principles have been defined that will help create the best usability experience for seniors.","seniors; ABN AMRO; DFI; design for interaction; digital; website","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-11-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Calabrese, L.M. (mentor)","2015","There is a difference between the physical environment one can experience on a daily base and the environment generalised in words and images. How we interpret our environment depends on the recognition of patterns. The perception and conception of space and time is highly related to the practice of urbanism and urban design. Through the years tools and techniques have been developed to deal with the complexity of the physical shape and form of the urban fabric. The temporal experience however still seems to be hard to represent in images. This has to do with the consumption of both time and space when the observer is in motion. The perception of time and space is something personal which is also influenced by speed. This makes interpretations about ‘identity’ and ‘meaning’ of the urban fabric hard. Therefore it is important to understand what exactly can be observed and how motion influences the perception. Techniques and tools that can capture and give insight on these matters are crucial for understanding this complexity. In this research different techniques are tested and developed for interpretation of different spatial entities of the specific physical context of the area in between Rotterdam and The Hague. This area has a potential in approaching regional spatial developments in a more qualitative way, by using visual-spatial instruments to give insight about the regional and local identities and the temporal experiences. Classic studies show that there is an opportunity for roads to become important in creating coherence and order at regional scales. During this research different combination of techniques are used to develop visual-spatial instruments (Visueel-Ruimtelijke Instrument). These instruments are bases on the same understanding, which is every observed context should first be captured (vastleggen), reduced (reduceren) in terms of visual information before finally the interpretation (interpreteren) of the visual matter can happen. This method will influence the cognitive process of perception and conception in a positive way. The instruments streamline the decision-making because spatial effects can be made explicit in an instant. These instruments however do need more research to refine them. The application of the instruments will either show their value or prove the fact that it is really hard to represent the temporal experience in two dimensional images.","visualisatietechnieken; stedelijk weefsel; beleving; het tussengebied; visueel-ruimtelijke instrumenten; tekentechnieken; landschap; verstedelijking; ruimtelijke kwaliteit; ruimtelijke dynamiek","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","","52.0055939, 4.4173575"

(mentor); Warnier, M.E. (mentor); Aldewereld, H.M. (mentor); Vander Heijden, B. (mentor)","2015","Many of the activities carried out by organizations are performed by project teams. Product launches, new systems and processes, as well as their maintenance, are often implemented through project-based activities. Making these activities successful requires a long list of criteria, which heavily depend on effective use of a company's knowledge assets. An example of such assets is the lessons learned from previous projects, which entail knowledge and experiences gained during the project lifetime. Sharing lessons learned can contribute to project success by safeguarding best practices, preventing repeating past mistakes, and anticipating risks. Managing the lessons learned process can be rather challenging. Determining the future value of knowledge and providing the right knowledge at the right time to the right knowledge-customer, are some of the aspects contributing to this difficulty. Lean thinking is a methodology that can offer process improvement through determination of value to end-customer and identification and elimination of waste and its root-causes. Even though this method originated in the manufacturing industry, its principles are believed to be applicable to other sectors. The nature of knowledge management is different from that of the manufacturing sector. In this work we analyse to which extent lean thinking principles can be of benefit to a non-manufacturing process such as the lessons learned. When applying lean thinking principles to knowledge management (also known as lean knowledge management) and lessons learned processes, one needs to take the characteristics of knowledge into consideration. Knowledge processes differ from manufacturing activities in that they include the need for context for sharing tacit knowledge and knowledge value being time, individual, and purpose dependent. This study examines such applicability from a theoretical and a practical point of view. Through literature research an overview of the state-of-the-art on lean knowledge management is provided. In order to examine the applicability of these theoretical findings in practice, the case study of the Engineering department of Janssen Biologics is selected. The focus of this study is mainly on the lean thinking principles define value, create flow, and establish pull as they are seen as most challenging with regard to knowledge management. Through interviews and workshops, the current lessons learned process and the needs and wishes of the knowledge-customers at Engineering are identified. Improvement proposals are formulated based on these findings and tested in a pilot to determine their workability in practice. This study is constrained by time, budget, and resource limitation which influence the formulated improvement proposals. Project lessons learned are often collected and documented with the aim of application in future projects. Predicting the future value of lessons learned is challenging as knowledge is not discrete and can be subjective. To overcome this difficulty, setting up facilitated intervision sessions where peers share knowledge and give feedback is advised. Such feedback can also be offered by IT tools that offer selection, filtering, and ranking possibilities. Unsuccessful knowledge management initiatives in the past can hinder successful implementation of present ones. Overcoming this burden of the past can be realized through dedicated Management involvement. Management needs to highlight the importance of lessons learned and their impact on present projects. Leading by example can facilitate creation of positive memories. One size fits all is not applicable to knowledge management efforts. Managing knowledge assets needs to be customized to the needs and wishes of knowledge-customers. This requires long term investment of time and resources. The lessons learned process needs a process owner who keeps its importance on the agenda. This individual should also monitor its functionality and identify factors that hamper its success. Such evaluation should take place on a regular basis upon which improvements can be made. For most project-based organizations knowledge management is not a core business activity. In cases where other more urgent issues occur during a project lifetime (which is often the case), attention of the project team can shift away from collecting and retrieving lessons learned. Management can provide incentives and rewarding to encourage desired behaviour. The lessons learned process should be included in the project management trainings. The importance of lessons learned to project success needs to be emphasized, the process should be explained, and roles and responsibilities need to be defined. The goals is making lessons learned collection and retrieval a standard project step. Through this work, initial steps in improving the lessons learned process at Engineering have been realised. We recommend examining their long term successful enforcement next. Such examination should consider the potential role Management and the project sponsor play in achieving success. Also the human aspect regarding knowledge exchange norms, habits, and culture at Engineering should be considered.","Lean Knowledge Management; Lean Thinking; Knowledge Management; Lessons Learned","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi-Actor Systems","","Section Systems Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Major airports in Europe experience a number of arrivals close to the maximum of their capacity throughout the day. Multiple aircraft arrive at the airport in a short time window and often have to be delayed in the airspace surrounding the airport before they are cleared to land. A higher fuel burn and costs for the airlines is the result, but it also has a negative effect on the environment in terms of additional pollution and noise. The Cross-border Arrival Management (XMAN) project, which is part of the Single European Sky program, tries to reduce the negative effects of delay in the proximity of airports. The main idea is to shift the necessary delay in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) or holding towards the cruise flight phase by reducing the speed of aircraft. If an aircraft is inbound for an airport and the expected arrival time is too close to the arrival time of a leading aircraft, the trailing aircraft can be asked to slow down such that it arrives at the airport when the runway is available. The speed reduction or gaining additional flight time is referred to as ‘delay absorption’. Although the shift of delay absorption from the TMA to the en-route phase shows promising results for fuel consumption and reduced emissions, the question rises whether this En-Route Delay Absorption (ERDA) can also have a negative impact on the runway efficiency. If aircraft are delayed too much in an earlier flight phase due to e.g. inaccuracy of the expected arrival times, so called gaps appear in the landing sequence. As a result, the total number of aircraft that actually landed per time period decreases. The idea is that in order to maintain an optimal runway throughput, some expected delay should be left in the TMA for the approach controller to absorb. In that case, the approach controller can fine-tune a tight landing sequence without any gaps that would result in an underused runway when the demand for landings is high. This phenomenon is defined as Runway Pressure. The main goal of this research project is to investigate the effect on the runway throughput when the expected delay is absorbed in the en-route phase. To achieve this goal, different fast time simulations are performed with a model of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The amount of expected delay that needs to be absorbed in an earlier flight phase is calculated in analogy with the working principles of the inbound planning system of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The expected arrival time at the runway is given for an aircraft and compared with the expected arrival time and minimum required separation time of the previous aircraft in the inbound planning. If the trailing aircraft is expected to arrive too soon at the runway, it has to be delayed prior to passing the Initial Approach Fix (IAF). How the aircraft is delayed, is not researched in this project. However, a maximum of five minutes delay absorption in an earlier flight phase is set, based on previous research on this topic. One simulation scenario consists of a period of two hours where the amount of demand for arrivals changes throughout the inbound peak. The demand exceeds the maximum runway capacity for a certain period of time in each arrival peak. The landing sequence order does not change. A comparison is made between scenarios with the same amount of demand throughout the inbound peak, but with all aircraft either experience En-Route Delay Absorption or not. The outcome of the simulations is the average amount of delay in the ? per 20 minutes and the amount of landings per rolling hour. A rolling hour consists of three consecutive time periods of 20 minutes. Based on the simulation outcomes, it can be concluded that ERDA can result in a small decrease of runway throughput, with a maximum of one aircraft per rolling hour. However, a decrease does not always occur. By the end of the inbound peak, the actual landing time of an aircraft with ERDA is between 30 and 90 seconds later than the same aircraft with no ERDA. So the inbound peak is extended in time and shifted backwards with approximately one extra landing when ERDA is applied. The benefit is that aircraft have to spend up to four minutes less in the TMA. An important parameter that determines the runway throughput, is the inter-arrival separation. This separation between different aircraft wake vortex categories is translated from distance to a time based separation. The same time interval at the threshold is used for the interval times between aircraft passing the IAF. The required passing time at the IAF can be calculated by one average flight time for each aircraft category, where a distinction has to be made between the flight time of jet and turboprop engine aircraft. If the total flight time in the TMA between aircraft categories deviates more than one minute, it can be necessary to use different approach paths to the final approach fix for each aircraft category, in order to maintain safety and a sufficient runway throughput. It is important that the calculations of the inter-arrival times at the threshold and IAF are as accurate as possible. If the inter-arrival time for each aircraft is wrongly increased by five to ten seconds, the throughput decreases with two landings per hour. It is meaningful to take this into account when a dynamic time based separation for the threshold is calculated and compensated for strong headwinds. The definition of runway pressure suggests that there is a minimum amount of delay that should be left for the approach controller to absorb, in order to guarantee sufficient runway throughput. From the results of this research, it can be concluded that there will always be a minimum amount of delay that needs to be absorbed in the TMA to optimize the landing sequence. However, the minimum amount of delay in the TMA is a consequence of the difference in flight time between aircraft types and the accuracy of the actual time passing the IAF. If the inter-arrival times at the IAF are set correctly, a minimum amount of delay is not required to maintain sufficient runway throughput. Although a minimum amount of delay in the TMA is not required to maintain runway throughput, not all delay can always be absorbed in earlier flight phases. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate the effect on the workload of air traffic controllers and the delay absorption capacity of the different airspace sectors along the route. If the expected delay is divided and absorbed in the different flight phases along the trajectory towards the airport, the arrival process is easier to manage for all controllers involved.","arrival management; cross-border arrival management; fast time simulation; time based separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Profile II: ATM, Airports and Safety","",""

While demand growth for OECD markets has slowed down in recent years, there is still a potential for markets where air services are currently not provided. It is the goal of the airline network development process to locate these potentially profitable markets. One of the main tools to support this process is passenger demand forecasting. However, experience has taught us that forecasting is inherently uncertain. The primary goal of this thesis is to present how interval forecasts of passenger demand can be created by using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that, by combining a causal econometric prediction model with interval forecasts of time-dependent parameters, it reliable interval forecasts for demand can be produced. The secondary goal is to demonstrate the effects of using these intervals in a simplified airline network development model. By using actual airline data, it was concluded that the robustness of this process increases. This is particularly relevant for airlines, as they require confidence when making decisions about the development of their network.","Passenger Demand Forecasting; Forecasting Uncertainty; Gravity Model; Airline Network Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Meijers, B.M. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor)","2015","All human life is dependent on fresh water and activities related to monitoring its availability have become crucial for financial and survival reasons. Most rivers are being constantly investigated today by both the private and public sector using various means. In advanced countries, the researches cover extensively the riverbed in order to fully assess its topography. However, there are quite often cases where the data collected are disorderly scarce, resulting in questionable assumptions and interpolated predictions. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a new method for reconstructing the riverbed topography when data are scarce, so as to achieve better results than the ones conventional methods currently give. The chosen course of action involves a combination of the datasets outputted by a simplified physics-based model and spatial interpolation of the available scarce topography data. The surrounding research involves numerous aspects of mathematics, physics and spatial analysis, which together are called in to provide a complete solution to an existing problem. The focus lies on meandering alluvial rivers, whose planform style is the most common in human-populated river basin areas. Three rivers of different extent and interest are explored, namely the Danube (Romanian area), IJssel (Netherlands) and Kootenai (United States). The study cases comprise river areas extracted from each of them, in order to focus on bends and mildly widening or narrowing parts of the rivers. The final outcome of this Master Graduation Thesis project was achieved through literature research, exploration and implementation of ideas and scientific methods, made possible through cooperation with the Deltares independent institute for applied research. The proposed method combines scarce riverbed topography data with the basics of river morphology and spatial interpolation techniques to come to a new method that achieves a result of higher value in the complex field of river and geomatics engineering. The method is further assessed and evaluated and will ideally be incorporated in the Rapid Assessment Tool for Inland Navigation (RAT-IN) which is currently under development at Deltares.","scarce data; riverbed topography; river meandering; river channel; spatial interpolation; physics-based bathymetry model; anisotropy; python; deltares; rat-in","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB Research","","Geomatics","",""

One of the two points is the crossing between Ruse (Bulgaria) and Giurgiu (Romania). In these surroundings several places were visited along the Danube. Most of these observations turned out to be different from the expectations: the places were neglected at the backside of the countries. This seems to be caused by a lack of money from authorities and possibly a lack of awareness from the local population. The next part of the report is a search to a solution for this problem: how to create a connection between the existing ecological and recreational network and the river border area of the Danube? By the use of different methodologies the search is deployed. On the one hand several observations took place, strengthened by desk research. Not only in the studied stretch, but -parallel to this- as well studies of nature parks in Holland were undertaken. On the other hand a more theoretical approach took place, by the use of the patch-corridor-matrix-theory (Forman, 1995) and studies about animal-visitor interactions. Eventually a solution is found in the concept of connectivity and elaborating on this a green infrastructure: at every scale an interweavement between the recreational and ecological network and the river border area takes place. Neglected places are found and activated to create an interconnected network of protected nature areas. The otter and beaver form in this network the symbol of a healthy nature. On the L(arge)-scale, the stretch between Ruse and Silistra, a regional plan is elaborated with linked recreative routes that show the new green infrastructure. On the M(iddle)-scale of Ruse and Giurgiu a masterplan is drawn up with again linked recreative routes and an interconnected network of green areas that provide habitat for wild animals. On the S(mall)-scale one of the newly actived places is elaborated: the missing link between several valuable Natura 2000 areas at the island Luliaka.

The combination of ageing societies and increasing temperature, due to climate change, poses serious challenges for the health and wellbeing of the increasing urban population. Assessments of the urban heat island effect, so far use predominantly remote sensing methods, which don’t allow us to understand the crucial indoor temperatures. Therefore, this Master Thesis is focussing on the optimization of a technique for creating a three-dimensional (3D) model showing the indoor temperatures of an urban area, Rotterdam. The method created in this research is a reusable method that can be applied on other urban heat island region if necessary data is available. The output of this research, a 3D model, functions as a tool for urban planners and designers to help them understanding local differences in the urban temperature allowing them to develop strategies for the reconfiguration of a building, block or neighbourhood. Data from a variety of data sources is acquired and used to create this model of which the most important data is coming from approximately 1300 temperature sensors that have been distributed over the city Rotterdam during the summer of 2014. Data coming from these sensors, the sampled data, is linked to a developed 3D model representing all addresses within the urban area of Rotterdam. Linking the sensor data to the 3D model does the transformation form aspatial sensor data into spatial sensor data. Data modelling is done for estimating indoor temperatures for all addresses of Rotterdam by analysing the sensed data and the spatial environment of each address of which sensor data is available. The original sensor data is used to validate and to determine the accuracy of the modelled temperatures. The modelled temperatures are visualised per adders by assigning colour gradient to the addresses according to their temperature.","Urban heat island; three-dimensional model; indoor temperatures; independent variables; data modelling; geovisualisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

In the first stage of the work, new ?+(?+?) heat treatment schemes were designed on the basis of Thermo-Calc® simulations and previous research work and carried out to such an extent that the ? phase stability is tuned to the right level and a sufficient amount of retained ? phase is obtained at room temperature available for further transformation. At the second stage, the effectiveness of the thermal driving force in triggering a martensitic transformation in the retained ? phase was investigated. Both in-situ and ex-situ transformations were studied via DSC and further quenching in self-made cooling baths, respectively. The starting temperatures of low-temperature martensitic transformations were determined for each alloy. It was found that the low-temperature martensitic transformation for the three alloys was of an isothermal character. Through XRD testing, the phases of Ti-1013 before and after low-temperature martensitic transformation were determined; as in the commercial Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al (Ti-1023) alloy, the type of martensite formed in response to quenching from the two-phase region is ?’’ instead of ?’ martensite, due to oversaturation of the martensite. EPMA testing proved the formation of Martensite-Free Zone (MFZ) observed in the case of Ti-102Cr3 when quenched to a temperature just below the starting temperature of the low-temperature martensitic transformation does not relate to the diffusion behavior of alloying elements. Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) was found to be detrimental in this research as the machining process changed the designed microstructure of the three metastable ? titanium alloys. Finally, a proposal is made to produce tailored ?+? titanium metallic composite via SPS.","Metastable Beta Titanium Alloys; Beta Phase Stability; Martensite-Free Zone; Low-Temperature Martensitic Transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Wire rope is used in numerous applications such as elevators, power lines, suspension bridges, ships and the mooring of offshore structures. In many of these applications wire rope needs to be bent. Currently the Norwegian certification instance Det Norske Veritas (DNV) prescribes a capacity reduction factor for bending wire rope. It is unclear how this formula is derived or what it is based on. Therefore the main question of this thesis is: How does the forced bending of a steel wire rope around a shackle affect the break load of the wire rope? A secondary research question is: How does the forced bending of a steel wire rope relate to the reduction factor for bending enforced by DNV? These questions are answered by constructing an analytical model. In addition experiments are performed at the laboratory of the civil engineering faculty to verify this model. The analytical model is based on the assumption that every single wire behaves as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The reduction in capacity is dominated by the effect of individual wires being bent, similar to a bundle of loose beams being bent. Plastic deformation needs to be considered to accurately describe smaller D/d ratios. Due to the helix structure, axial tension causes friction forces to develop between the strands and the wires. This increases the stiffness of the wire rope and leads to higher stresses and strains when the wire rope is bent. As soon as the wires start slipping the stiffness lowers drastically and any further deformation causes a much lower increase in stress and strain. All experiments are performed on both a 14mm and a 20mm wire rope. First an experiment is carried out to verify the test set-up and obtain the break load of a straight steel wire rope. Then a second experiment is performed to find the break load of a bent wire rope under various D/d ratios. These two tests lead to a reduction factor for bending. The analytical model shows a good fit with the experimental results. From this it can be concluded that the model developed in this thesis is a promising way to model wire rope and leads to a fairly accurate answer for the capacity reduction due to bending. The model developed and the DNV formula show similar reduction factors. For very small D/d ratios the model predicts a 5% lower reduction, while at bigger D/d ratios a higher reduction factor is predicted. The experiments show a better match with the analytical model, but due to the small differences and large standard deviation a larger sample size would be necessary to confirm this. In addition to the main question a limited investigation was done on the bending stiffness of wire rope. With some additions to the model developed for capacity reduction it was possible to model the bending stiffness. The result is a stick slip model that defines the bending stiffness as a parameter of the axial tension and the curvature, this bending stiffness rapidly declines as the wire rope is bent and wires start slipping. Although this model is not experimentally validated, the fact that the original model it is based on is fairly accurate means it is worth investigating further.","steel wire rope; bending","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

During hot summers and long resting periods, asphalt mixtures can partially recover their mechanical properties such as strength and stiffness. This inherent property of asphalt mixtures is termed self-healing and has important impact on the service life of asphalt pavements. If the healing process could be sped up, pavements with longer lifespan could be built. The last few years, a lot of effort has been spent to develop innovative techniques in order to trigger the healing capability of asphalt mixtures. Induction heating is a technique via which asphalt pavements can be heated locally and mechanical properties can be recovered. The approach of using the induction heating technique to speed up the healing process is named induction healing. Induction healing approach requires the development of asphalt mixtures with electrically conductive additives and an electromagnetic source in order to increase the temperature of material. This thesis is aimed at developing insight into the induction heating technique and how the asphalt mixes at different levels are influenced from the additives. Control of the rheological, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of asphalt mastic and mortar are among the key research objectives. For this, experimental and numerical methods have been used.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Road and Railroad Engineering","",""

Specifically, we consider three categories of task attributes: Metadata, Content and Visual. In order to measure these attributes, we constructed a real-time human computation market crawler that we used to gather HIT data and reinstantiate HITs from the largest human computation market, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and a task attribute analysis pipeline to obtain task attribute measurements from the market data. We present an analysis of the various task attributes, and perform an experiment predicting HIT throughput based on task attribute and market data. Our analysis shows that market statistics, task batch size and semantic content features can be used to predict throughput. We also conduct an initial exploration into measuring subjective HIT complexity as perceived by workers. Based on our analysis and experimental results, we identify three key points of advice for human computation task designers.","human computation; crowdsourcing; mechanical turk; task complexity; task throughput","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

The research explores the possibilities within the domestic domains for sharing spaces and activities with multiple users. Is it possible to contribute to a more social environment by sharing spaces? In seeking the answer to that question it is of interest to know where the possibilities (and limitations) for sharing spaces lie. The central research question for this thesis is: ‘Where are the possibilities (and limitations) within the domestic domains for sharing spaces and activities with multiple users.’ The answer to the question was found by exploring the changes in the domestic environment, the user of the residential area, the activities performed in the domestic environment and the domestic domains existing. Through articles in journals, literature research, an experiment and case studies valuable and relevant information was collected. The design is situated at Noordplein in Rotterdam. Noordplein is a big square in the upcoming neighbourhood ‘het Oude Noorden’. The square is now used as an event area. Because Noordplein is at the corner of the neighbourhood, close to the city centre with good accessibility by public transport it is a square with a lot of potential for a social place. Also more and more young people are moving to Noord, which makes it an appealing place for the target group. With the outcome of the research translated in a diagram of possibilities the design goal is determined as: ‘Creating (collective) living spaces for groups of multiple users in combination with a (social) public space at Noordplein in Rotterdam. The spaces are designed from the performed activity, in and around the domestic sphere.’","shared; collective living; domestic activities; rotterdam; social","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

Instead of measuring the position of one light beam, as the conventional use of this sensor implies, three light beams are sequentially projected on the PSD. A sensing algorithm has been developed for sampling and converting these three sensor signals into planar position data: x, y and theta. The stage is intended for use in the field of digital microscopy where it will enable the user to view the sample from all sides without manually relocating the specimen.

(mentor); Olsder, G.J. (mentor)","2015","In this thesis a problem of determining the optimal pacing strategy to minimize travel time is considered. The problem is restricted to a straight race track with constant slope and rolling resistance, and no headwind. It is expressed as an optimal control problem that can be solved using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The control variable is the cyclist's power, which is modelled according to a hyperbolic power-time relationship, where a maximum power level is assumed. The Hamiltonian is linear with respect to this control variable. The minimum time problem is redefined as a maximum excursion problem, which is related to Goddard’s problem of a rocket's ascent through the atmosphere. It turns out that the optimal pacing problem is a singular control problem. Such problems are difficult to solve, both numerically and analytically, and they only occur sporadically in control theory. It is proven that the singular control only accurs during a single interval; optimal pacing starts with maximum power and decays through a singular control to minimum power. The singular arc may be degenerate; a bang-bang control might be optimal, depending on the length of the race track and the amount of available energy. The solution of the pacing problem has been obtained partly numerical and partly analytical. It applies to a straight course without bends, but it can be extended to an arbitrary course by dividing it into straight segments between bends and optimize over all distributions of energy over the segments.","Pontryagin's maximum principle; Optimal Control Theory; Minimum time problem; pacing strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Space debris has become a major issue for the space industry over the last couple of years. The increasing number of uncontrolled objects in space increases the chance of collision with a spacecraft. The unexpected loss of contact with ENVISAT, the European Space Agency’s largest environmental spacecraft, added one more piece of debris to the list. It also sparked ESA’s interest in the active removal of space debris. Numerous removal methods are being investigated, one of which uses a chaser spacecraft that will attach itself to the debris by means of a robot arm and tentacles and will then perform a series of braking manoeuvres to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere. The proximity operations require an accurate attitude control system. In this thesis, these operations have been divided into three phases: an unconnected phase in which the chaser spacecraft synchronises its motion with that of the (spinning) target debris; a semi-connected phase, where the robot arm and tentacles form a flexible connection between the chaser and target; a connected phase, where the two spacecraft are assumed to be rigidly attached to each other (and form a stack). The objective of this thesis is to investigate the stability and controllability of the system in these three phases. Because the system changes in configuration during its mission, it can be classified as an Evolving System; a system with actively controlled components that ""mate"" to form a single connected system. The connection between components becomes stronger during the evolution and can be represented by connection forces and moments. In this thesis, the connection is modelled as a rotational spring and damper acting between the chaser spacecraft and ENVISAT. By developing a representative simulator environment the stability and controllability of the system is assessed. Two major parts of the simulator comprise the attitude control algorithms and control actuators. The latter consists of a Reaction Control System, reaction wheels, and a control allocation algorithm. The attitude control algorithms that are investigated are a Linear Quadratic Regulator and a model reference adaptive controller. A linear stability analysis of the system showed that the system remains stable during its evolution when the chaser is actively controlled. This is partly because the motion of the chaser has little effect on the motion of ENVISAT due to the large size difference between the two spacecraft. However, for a system with equally sized spacecraft, the linear stability analysis showed that instability can occur. Furthermore, in stack configuration, a gravity-gradient stable attitude was found when the minor axis of the system is parallel to the Earth radial. Moreover, for a suitable deorbit attitude and an unobstructed view to the Earth, the only stable attitude is one which has a roll angle of -90 deg. Next, results of the nonlinear simulations revealed that the combination of reaction wheels and attitude thrusters gives worse performance than when only thrusters are used. This is because the reaction wheels are too small to cope with the constantly changing motion of ENVISAT. Second, for the unconnected phase, both the LQR and adaptive controller are able to synchronise the motion of the chaser with ENVISAT. However, the adaptive controller is not able to do this for all possible initial target rotations, whereas the LQR is. Third, the effect of the connection between ENVISAT and the chaser on the stability of the system is very small and both controllers are able to control the system. Fourth, the adaptive controller shows unacceptable performance during the control of the stack, because of the large difference between the reference model for which the adaptive controller was tuned and the actual system. Using a second reference model for the connected phase could improve the performance of the adaptive controller.","attitude control; space debris; adaptive control; evolving systems; ENVISAT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-06","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

Optimizing the acoustic environment of an open plan office is a complex task due to the large number of design parameters that must be considered. In current practice, acoustic analysis – even in a simplified form – is not naturally integrated into the design process of office spaces. The transition between geometric modelling programs and analysis software is a time consuming affair preventing seamless and hands?on iteration of design proposals. Hence, it is difficult for design team members to evaluate the specific influences of design changes with respect to acoustic characteristics of a room. During this study, a ray tracing definition was developed within Rhino / Grasshopper and coupled to Octopus to optimize the acoustics of an open office environment.

(mentor); De Jong, P. (mentor); Van de Pas, R. (mentor)","2015","De Nederlandse binnenstad wordt veelal geassocieerd met een grote concentratie aan mensen, een hoge bebouwingsdichtheid en een sterke vraag naar ruimte. De afgelopen dertig jaar is er dan ook een aanzienlijke bevolkingsgroei waarneembaar in de grootste steden (Fig 1-1). De aantrekkings- kracht van de stad lijkt steeds sterker te worden, op zowel mensen uit het binnenland als het buitenland, waardoor de bevolkings- dichtheid toeneemt.1 De toestroom aan mensen naar de stad creëert gelijktijdig een grotere vraag naar ruimte. Dit wordt versterkt door het toegenomen ruimtegebruik in de stad per inwoner. Ter illustratie; van 1880 tot 2000 is in Amsterdam de bevolkingsdichtheid met een factor 9 afgenomen terwijl het stedelijk gebied in dezelfde periode met een factor 20 is toegenomen. De ruimtelijke groei van steden kan grotendeels verklaard worden vanuit toegenomen ruimtelijke eisen per persoon en maar beperkt door de bevolkingsgroei.2 De bevolkingsdichtheid neemt echter sinds de afgelopen dertig jaar in de binnenstad langzamerhand toe. Sinds de jaren tachtig is er weer een groei van het aantal inwoners en wooneenheden in de grote steden. Er schijnt een kentering plaats te vinden dat de bevolkingsdichtheid in de stad weer aan het toenemen is. Als deze kentering doorzet heeft dat grote gevolgen voor hoe Nederland en de steden worden vormgegeven. Het aantal inwoners is recent versneld toegenomen omdat het aantal gezinnen in de stad is toegenomen. Dit komt mede omdat jongeren minder vaak de stad verlaten. Ook het aantal wooneenheden neemt toe omdat er meer huishoudens samen op een enkel adres wonen. Daarnaast is de woningvoorraad geleidelijk groter geworden door het herbestemmen van vastgoed met een andere functie en is de woningleegstand afgenomen. Op sommige plekken is ook hetbouwvolume toegenomen door de uitbreiding van gebouwen door op- en aanbouw.3 Dit zorgt er dan ook voor dat de binnenstad verdicht (Fig 1-2,1-3). De grote vraag naar ruimte in binnensteden beperkt zich niet alleen tot wonen maar geld ook voor andere functies als winkelen, werken en vrije tijd.4 Dat er ongeveer 40.000 verdiepingen leeg staan in de Nederlandse binnensteden lijkt dan ook een onwaarschijnlijke tegenstelling.5 Deze leegstaande verdiepingen concentreren zich voornamelijk rond binnenstedelijke winkelgebieden met een hoge grondwaarde (Fig 1-4). Winkels en horeca veroorzaken niet alleen die hoge grondwaarde, maar zijn ook een van de weinige functies die deze hoge waarde kunnen bekostigen waardoor binnensteden langzamerhand veranderen in mono-functionele winkelgebieden. Winkels en horeca focussen zich voornamelijk op de begane grond waardoor de bovenliggende verdiepingen leeg staan of als opslag dienen. Het woon- en leefmilieu van de binnenstad is hierdoor vooral gefocust op retail en commercie. Ondanks de grote vraag naar ruimte blijft er hierdoor een aanzienlijk aandeel van de binnenstedelijke ruimte ongebruikt. Deze leegstand heeft niet alleen negatieve gevolgen voor de leefbaarheid en de ruimtelijke kwaliteit, maar biedt ook geen oplossing voor het gebrek aan woonruimte en andere sociaal maatschappelijke problemen. Er zal dan ook een oplossing moeten worden geboden om deze leegstand tegen te gaan ten gunste van de leefbaarheid van de stad. Door leegstaande verdiepingen te herontwikkelen word er effectief met de ruimte wordt omgegaan. Er moet worden gezocht naar een gezonde balans tussen functies als wonen, werken, winkels, horeca en cultuur die een levendige binnenstad kenmerken. Het woon- en leef- milieu van de Nederlandse binnenstad moet zich richten op een diversiteit aan functies van een kwalitatief hoogwaardig niveau dat ten goede komt aan de leefbaarheid van de stad.5, 6, 7","herontwikkeling; leegstand; winkels; wonen; binnenstad; Amsterdam","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-10","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Van Dooren, E.J.G.C. (mentor)","2015","The research comprised in this graduation report aims to establish a framework and design approach to the re-purposing of the Hagia Irene church in Istanbul. It seeks to answer the following research question: “How can we preserve the specific characteristics of the Byzantine church Hagia Irene in Istanbul when introducing a new function?” This question is approached by first analyzing the church’s historical and present-day characteristics, as well as those of its surroundings. Historical characteristics include the basilica plan, the dome, the contrast between the exterior brick and interior mosaics, and the connection with the Hagia Sophia. During the Ottoman empire, the connection with the Hagia Sophia was severed by the construction of the courtyard wall of the Topkapi Palace. As well, the Byzantine urban fabric was covered with 6-8m of sand, and a new Ottoman layer built over it. The ruins of these historical layers are a defining characteristic of the Hagia Irene, and have been preserved in what is now an archaeological park around the church. Today, some of the Hagia Irene’s characteristics have been lost, in part because the mosaics have been worn away, and because most of the doors and some of the windows have been filled in. The second section of the report outlines different approaches to re-purposing historical buildings, with a focus on Istanbul’s Orthodox spiritual leaders and architects. The spiritual leaders are against the re-purposing of churches, because a place built and consecrated for worship should not be used for anything else. However, they allow combining the church’s original function with other appropriate uses such as a concert hall or museum. They also suggest to focus on the church’s surroundings for the addition of new functions. Istanbul’s architects also stress the importance of maintaining a continuity with the history of the church, especially with its original architectural and urban characteristics. In this way, the integrity of the space can be preserved. The third section explores two case studies of interventions that re-purpose historical buildings while preserving their original characteristics. The first is the Szathmáry Palace in Hungary, which re-purposes a bishop’s summer residence from the 16th century into a theatre by adding an enclosed staircase and sitting elements. The new elements contrast with the ruins while, at the same time, emphasizing the original structure. A similar approach is adopted for the re-purposing of Astley Castle in the United Kingdom. The new layer that is added to the medieval castle both strengthens the ruins structurally, and frames them visually. The report concludes that, in order to preserve Hagia Irene’s specific characteristics when introducing a new function, new additions should maintain the integrity of the architectural space, restoring and bringing attention to its character-defining structural and decorative elements, at the same time making reference to the building’s history. While multifunctionality should be provided for, the church’s original function should be respected. Based on the research conclusions, design principles are formulated. They address the church’s interior, the adjacent ruins, and the overall surroundings, and express the design’s aim to give importance to the experience of the Hagia Irene’s history by framing its “layers of time”.","Hagia Irene; Byzantine church","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Verbree, E. (mentor)","2015","Indoor positioning is becoming a hot topic in public areas that are used by large numbers of people. Finding people and assets in buildings has become more difficult because of the complexity and scale of today’s public space. On the subject of locating assets in the hospital the following use case is defined for this project. Positioning and localization of assets in a hospital is useful to do for several reasons. Loss and theft of equipment takes a large expense of the hospital’s budget. When it is possible to have the position of a device in real time, a system could be developed that locates the assets through the hospital building. The main goal of this project is to develop a model for an indoor positioning system for localization of assets in a hospital. The indoor positioning technology developed by Quuppa forms the basis for this. Their indoor positioning solution consists of Bluetooth powered tags measured by monitors on the ceiling (locators). The hospital that is going to be involved in this project is the Rijnstate hospital, located in Arnhem. They provided the input necessary to define the requirements for the use case. Based on the requirements from the use case and the specifications of the positioning system six test cases were defined for analysis of the test data and development of the localization model. This MSc thesis describes a scientific approach to investigate the subject of indoor localization by performing data acquisition, processing and analysis of indoor position data. In order to localize the assets indoors, a map matching method is developed that takes into account several factors such as geometrical influences, characteristics of the positioning system and obstructions in the indoor environment. For matching the position data to a real world location, several location types are developed by subdividing the floor plan into location clusters. The research has shown that a sub-meter accuracy level can be achieved for locations that are within the high-resolution range of the locator. The performance for positioning at the smallest cluster levels can only be achieved when having a dense distribution of locators. Test cases that were defined for specific situations related to the hospital case show successful localization for the majority of the test data. A correction model for making coordinate adjustments of the position estimates is described based on the reliability of the data from the test cases.","indoor positioning technology; asset tracking; Bluetooth Low Energy; Angle of Arrival; indoor localisation; map matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2015","It is expected that in the coming decade, cars with an automated driving mode will become available. Most likely, this automated mode will only be used in specific situations and/or on specific roads, which means that the driver/automation needs to switch between the automated mode and manual control. Such switches are termed ‘transitions of control’ (ToCs). How much time humans need to assess a traffic situation (i.e., to gain situation awareness, SA) while preparing for ToCs is still largely unknown. This study has been designed to assess whether the method used by Gugerty (1997), where particpants were asked to reproduce a traffic scenario in a top-down view, is suited for finding this preparation time by assessing its capabilities for finding effects of preparation time, and traffic density on reproduction performance. Participants were asked to reproduce the positions (i.e., distance & lane) and relative speeds of surrounding traffic in a top-down view after viewing each of 24 videos of simulated traffic scenarios on a three-lane highway, shown on a computer monitor. These scenarios had six different durations (1, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 20 seconds), which were participants’ preparation times, as well as two different levels of traffic density (4 vs. 6 surrounding cars). The scenarios were shown to participants in a randomized order. Results of the experiment showed that video length had a positive, and traffic density a negative effect on reproduction performance. The effects of video length on reproduction performance, when comparing scores of videos of 20 s to those of 1 s for combined traffic density, was strongest in the Average absolute error distance of hits and misses. Participants agreed more with having enough time to prepare for the task, and rated the reproduction task as ‘less difficult’ with longer videos, and with lower traffic density. The effect of traffic density on reproduction performance, averaged over all video lengths, was strongest in the hit percentage score. Although both video length and traffic density had clear effects on both self-reported ratings, the effect of video length was stronger in the self-reported time rating, and the effect of traffic density was stronger in the difficulty rating. The effect of increasing video length seemed to diminish for the reproduction of positions and number of surrounding cars. The diminishing of the effect could indicate that there is a saturation level of SA. With a lower traffic density the diminishing effect was stronger, which could indicate that a saturation level of SA is reached earlier when less traffic needs to be assessed. The diminishing effect was absent in the reproduction scores for speeds, which indicates that accurately reproducing the (relative) speeds of these amounts of surrounding traffic might take more time than the maximum of 20 s of this experiment. Although the used desktop-based method may lack the realism needed for direct application of the results, it seems suited for studying the preparation time if implemented in more immersive experimental designs.","Situation Awareness; SA; Automated Driving; Transition of Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","For a robot manipulator, an accurate reference tracking capability is one of the most important performance factor. This is especially the case for a robot which is deployed for an industrial use such as welding and laser cutting. Recently, an emerging application of 3D printing also attracts researchers to use robotic manipulators in hope of gaining a higher dimension in the printing process as well as a larger workspace. The conventional method for controlling robot manipulator involves a model based feed-forward controller to eliminate the nonlinearities such as gravity and the coriolis term, combined with a feedback controller to compensate the residual error. This method, however, has a drawback in obtaining a good model of the robot. Furthermore, a robot's physical properties are subject to change over time due to, for instance, degraded gearboxes, etc. Such a problem will require the robot to re-perform a system identification which is often unacceptable due to the time it takes and the possibly dangerous movement the robot must execute. Therefore, this class of controller may not be the best option for such condition. This thesis addresses the aforementioned problem from the point of view of model-free, learning controller which improves the tracking performance safely in an online fashion. The thesis exploits the reinforcement learning (RL) technique which uses the nature of trial and errors to correct the tracking error. Improvement to the control performance is done by feeding an additive compensation signal given by a learned policy function to the robot's nominal controller. Two different compensation methods are proposed in the thesis. Both methods are realized by the so called actor-critic (AC) algorithm in order to cope with the continuous state of a robot arm. The first method compensates the control input of the nominal controller while the second method modifies the reference trajectory. The methods are implemented on a real 6 DoFs 3D printing robotic setup. For the test, three different reference tracking tasks are designed and executed. Furthermore, to provide a comparative study, two conventional control methods namely model predictive control (MPC) and iterative learning control (ILC) are implemented as well. Their results are then analysed and compared to that of the proposed RL-based controllers. The experimental result shows that the RL-based controllers improve the performance of the nominal control significantly. It is also shown that the performance of the learning controller is close to that of the model-based control method. For a circular, smooth trajectory, the experiment even shows that the RL-based controller is able to outmatch both MPC and ILC performance.","reinforcement learning; actor-critic; reference tracking; robot manipulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

To get insight into the problems first an analysis of the location is made. This analysis involves the geographical characteristics of the city, historical development, land use, infrastructure etc. Based on this analysis a problem description is made. The major problem is the congestion of Ruta 160. This problem has different causes: the inter-communal traffic flows, trucks, public transport deficiency, connectivity of the secondary roads and organisational problems. To solve the congestion on Ruta 160 several solutions have been proposed by different parties. These proposed solutions are elaborated upon with figures of the road profiles and tables containing the road characteristics. To improve the congestion on Ruta 160 these solutions are combined into variants by the research team. The most promising variants are filtered using a set of constraints and demands. Finally in Part 1 the criteria that are used in the Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) of Part 4 are introduced and explained. These criteria are: time, costs, environmental impact, social impact, safety, comfort and co-benefits. Part II considers the Biobío River and the Los Batros wetlands north of the Ruta 160 Bridge. The influence of the infrastructure variants Costanera Sur, Puente Industrial and Ruta Humedal on this inland water system is analysed. For this analysis two existing 1D HEC-RAS models of the Biobío River and Los Batros are modified to meet the current and proposed situations. The design conditions that are used for both models are discharges with a return period of 100 years. Also other discharges are used in order to evaluate the effects of the infrastructure for different situations. The results show that the water level in the Biobío River increases with a maximum of 10 centimetres due to the presence of Puente Industrial and Costanera Sur. The water level in (Estero) Los Batros experiences a negligible increase due to the presence of Ruta Humedal. The resulting water levels and LiDAR topography data are also used to create an inundation map for San Pedro de la Paz and the Biobío River. It can be concluded that in the present situation no mentionable floods occur along the southern bank of the Biobío River. This is also the case for the Costanera Sur situation since the riverbanks are heightened. For the design condition flooding occurs for parts of Los Batros. Ruta Humedal does not increase the flooded area in Los Batros but protects a part of the farmland located in that area from flooding. Several roads are also analysed on the tsunami impact with the NEOWAVE model. These roads consist of Ruta Costa (elevated coastal highway), Costanera Sur (elevated road along the riverbank) and Ruta Humedal (through the wetlands). They are combined into three different combinations: (I) Costanera Sur and Ruta Humedal, (II) Costanera Sur and Ruta Costa and (III) Costanera Sur, Ruta Humedal and Ruta Costa.To assess these combinations properly, first the generation of a tsunami by an earthquake is explained. Then an earthquake scenario has to be devised in order to come up with a worst case tsunami scenario. This scenario is derived from multiple major earthquakes that generated tsunamis that affected the coastal area around San Pedro de la Paz over the last centuries.This has led to a scenario MW 8.9 and MW 9.0, which both show inundation of the coastal area of San Pedro de la Paz but in different amounts. Since the amount of inundation of MW 8.9 is not significant enough for a detailed analysis, only the results of MW 9.0 are used. This scenario overtops the dunes and inundates the coastal neighbourhoods. In the case combination (II) and (III) this coastal inundation is completely prevented, only Los Batros has a small amount of inundation. Combination (I) does not prevent coastal inundation and seems to increase the amount of inundation in Los Batros. However, this increase of inundation in Los Batros could be due to deviations in the model itself and needs more research. Part IV starts with the analysis of the different solutions based on the criteria as defined in Part 1. The analysis is followed by the MCA. The MCA consists of three different steps. The first step is the weighting of the criteria. In this step the relative importance of the criteria is determined. This is done using pairwise combination of criteria. The pairwise combination of the criteria is presented in a survey to the research team and students of the UCSC. The weights of the different criteria as determined by both the students and the research team are used in the MCA. The results show major difference in what the students think are important criteria and what the research team thinks are in important criteria. The students view safety, time and costs as most important criteria. But the members of the research prioritize safety, environmental impact and social impact. Step 2 concerns the scoring of the different proposed solutions and the variants. The solutions are given a score for every criterion as defined in Part 1. This scoring is done by the research team and based on the analysis as done in Part 4. The absolutes scores from Part 2 show significant difference on solution level. The two proposed solutions with the highest scores are Ruta Costa and Ruta 160. The improvement of Pedro Aguirre Cerda scores relatively low. On variant level the differences are much smaller. The variants that have the highest scores are variant 1A and 1B. Step 3 of the MCA takes into account the info from the previous both steps by multiplying the absolute scores of step 2 with the weight of the criteria as determined in step 1. This multiplication results in the so-called relative weighted score. By taking into account the relative weights of the criteria the ranking of the variants changes significantly. When using the weights as defined by the students, variant 1A scores the highest. When taking into account the weights of the criteria as defined by the research variant 1B comes out on top.","Chile; Concepción; Biobio; Flood risk; HEC-RAS; Tsunami; NEoWave; MCA; Traffic; Road network","en","student report","TU Delft, section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-36.84, -73.12"

(mentor)","2015","Durban is located on the east coast of South Africa in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. It is one of South Africa’s biggest cities and has one of the busiest ports in Africa. To maintain Durban’s current economic position the Durban Port has to expand, which is problematic due to a lack of space. A solution is to develop a completely new port: the Durban DigOut Port. The past has taught us that significant erosion/accretion patterns are likely to occur around the breakwaters of the new port, as has happened at the Durban Port. In the long run climate change could also lead to alterations in shoreline behavior of the South Durban coast. The problem definition reads: “Currently, it is not fully known how the coastal system of South Durban functions and what the future state of the system will be under influence of climate change and after construction of the Durban DigOut Port.“ The goal of this research is to understand the sediment transports and budgets along the South Durban coast both now and in the future. To do this it is necessary to predict and assess future shoreline behavior, in response to anthropogenic interventions, like the Durban DigOut Port, and to climatic changes such as sea level rise and changing wave conditions. The time scope is confined to the coming 40years. For this research use has been made of two numerical models. The equilibrium based Unibest-CL+ model is used to create a 1D shoreline model to model long-term shoreline behavior. The process-based SWAN (or Delft3d-Wave) model is used to model wave propagation on the continental shelf and in the nearshore of the South Durban coast. Waves approach the coast from a predominantly south-eastern direction. The annual wave climate consists of south-southeastern swell waves and wind-waves approaching from all directions. It provides a net northward longshore sediment transport for the South Durban coast, which is modeled to be 700,000m3/year at the Durban Bluff. A gradient in longshore sediment transports is found over the area from Amanzimtoti to the Durban Bluff. This results in coastal erosion, because sediment input from rivers is lacking. Research into the longshore sediment transports for the South Durban coast shows that the coastline lies close to its equilibrium position and that maximum potential sediment transports are high (order of 1.5 to 3million m3/year). This leads to significant erosion/accretion patterns around the Durban DigOut Port. The maximum shoreline retreat on the lee side of the port is modeled to be 500meters, 30years after construction of the breakwaters. A bypass system of 550,000m3/year reduces shoreline retreat to a maximum of 30meters. In addition a local groyne system is proposed to prevent coastal retreat at the Sapref Refinery area. The calculated coastal retreat can be viewed as an extreme prediction, because a uniform sandy coast is assumed for the modeling, which is not realistic given the rocky formations along the South Durban coast. Changes in the average wave climate are found from literature; the average wave direction is likely to rotate clockwise and wave periods are expected to increase during winter. When these changes are included in the shoreline model, gradients in longshore sediment transports along the coast are enhanced, leading to additional coastal erosion. Sand supply from rivers is reduced due to sand mining, which leads to structural coastal erosion over the total system as well.","longshore sediment transports; erosion/accretion; DigOut Port; climate change; Unibest-CL+; SWAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","-29.971868, 30.954483"

(mentor)","2015","Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs) have a clear conceptual relation to the classical linear normal modes (LNMs), yet they offer a solid theoretical framework for interpreting a wide class of non-linear dynamical phenomena with no linear counterpart. The main difficulty associating with NNMs is that the computation for real-size models is expensive, particularly for models with distributed nonlinearities e.g. those of geometric nature. The NNM computation involves repeated direct nonlinear time integration combined with a sensitivity analysis to determine the frequency-energy dependency for the modes of interest. In this thesis, NNMs are computed from reduced order models (ROMs) comprising LNMs and Modal Derivatives (MDs). The MDs have a direct relationship with the vibration modes (VMs), and can therefore be used as natural extension to LNMs to accurately represent the NNMs of interest. Two projection based reduction methods are used, one being the classical Galerkin projection reduction technique, the other is obtained from a quadratic coordinate transformation based on the Taylor series expansion. The NNMs computed from the ROMs are directly compared to those obtained from the full system analysis, which will highlight the importance of MDs in capturing essential nonlinear phenomena. The methodology is demonstrated on a doubly clamped beam, a shallow arch and a Roorda-frame.","Nonlinear Normal Modes; Modal Derivatives; Model-order reduction; Quadratic manifold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

The computed nonlinear normal modes will be used to create a reduced order model that describes the single mode dynamical behaviour of a nonlinear vibrational dynamical system. The Galerkin projection method uses non-uniform rational B-splines to build up a finite dimensional solution space in which a solution is sought for the nonlinear partial differential equations describing the geometry of the manifolds. The manifolds pass through a stable equilibrium point of the dynamical system and are tangent to a plane representing the eigenspace of the system linearised around that equilibrium, which graphically emphasises the relation between the well known linear normal modes and nonlinear normal modes. By applying the isoparametric concept, the NURBS functions are used to represent the geometry of the invariant manifolds, which completely parametrises the manifolds by two parameters. The method will be tested on a two degree of freedom mass-spring system with two cubic nonlinear springs. The NURBS based Galerkin projection method accurately predicts the shapes of the invariant manifolds compared to an asymptotic approach, which only gives a local approximate solution for the geometry of the invariant manifolds. The solution of the Galerkin based method is valid over the whole predefined physical domain, and the accuracy of the solution can be increased by increasing the amount of basis functions that are used to describe the two dimensional surfaces.","nonlinear normal modes; invariant manifolds; model order reduction; non-uniform rational B-splines; Galerkin projection method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Dynamics","","52.00100, 4.37188"

It was found that this is a feasible method for improving soil moisture estimates. Even if a quasi steady state model is used. However, for practical application more research is necessary and it is very important to use a correctly validated and calibrated model. The systematic errors of the model should be as small as possible. A fully dynamic model could improve the results. Furthermore it was found that due to the difference in scale between the model (1 x 1 km) and the SMAP data (3 x 3 km) the effect of the Kalman filter is not as large on the finer grid as on the coarser observation grid. This effect might increase when a even finer grid is used. Due to the generic nature of the method it can be applied to more locations in the Netherlands, where it can potentially help improving soil moisture estimates in real time forecasting systems.","data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman filter; SMAP; soil moisture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

This solution works well for web visualization, but not for performing analyses in 3D. The main objective of this graduation project is to create a 3D spatial DBMS with solid CAD geometries as input. The difficulty of this graduation project is the conversion of CAD geometries to 3D GIS geometries. By linking parametric combination models (CAD) with solid polyhedral modelling (GIS) it is possible to reconstruct CAD geometries with help of its parameters as a polyhedron. This graduation thesis has compared the functionality performance of a 3D parametric DBMS with a 3D non-parametric database. For making an optimal comparison the 3D parametric DBMS had to be optimized as much as possible in terms of query execution time. However a 3D non-parametric DBMS has a better performance, it requires a lot of storage space. The 3D parametric DBMS requires less storage space, but needs some effort for optimizing the performance, such as defining functions for each geometry type, enabling index creation on PostgreSQL’s Box3D and making a function that converts this Box3D to a 3D geometry instead of a 2D polygon for querying.","CAD; GIS; CAD versus GIS; DBMS; Spatial DBMS; 3D Parametric; 3D Non-Parametric; geometry reconstruction; polyhedron; polyhedra; CSG; Parametric Combination Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (mentor); Scholten, D. (mentor); Bakker, W. (mentor)","2015","The aviation industry is vital for economic growth, world trade, and is a major employer. Nearly $2.4 trillion in global GDP, 35% of world trade by value and 58.1 million jobs are supported by the industry. However, with these benefits comes an impact on the environment. In 2013, aviation produced 705 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, approximately 2% of anthropogenic CO2-emissions. With air traffic projected to grow by 4-5% per annum in the coming decades, this raises the question of how sustainable growth can be achieved in the aviation sector and the need for regulatory measures. In 2013 the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted a Resolution in which it was decided to develop a global market-based measure (MBM). From 2020 onwards this measure - a global levy, global emissions trading, or global mandatory offsetting - would regulate carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation. However whether the measure will in fact be implemented depends for a large share on ICAO’s next General Assembly in 2016, where the 191 Member States will vote on adopting the measure. Their decision will greatly depend upon whether the global market-based measure matches their interests and agenda. Therefore the design of the global MBM is crucial in ensuring adoption and implementation. In order to reach political consensus by 2016, this thesis has focused on how a robust global market-based measure can be designed by showing the design process to arrive at the robust global market-based measure, and applying this design process. The following four principles of robust design were defined: (i) legal feasibility, (ii) political viability, (iii) purposefulness, and (iv) sturdiness.","aviation; offsetting; carbon dioxide; market-based measure; robust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Section E&I","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Konijnenberg, M. (mentor); Denkova, A. (mentor)","2015","Objective: Prostate cancer remains one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in men aged over 65 years, with yearly around 11,200 new cases and 2,600 deaths in the Netherlands. Diagnosis of prostate cancer still relies on biopsies, which are unpleasant and invasive procedures for the patient. The new PET tracer, [68Ga]Sarabesin 3, aims to offer an accurate and minimally invasive way to locate and diagnose PC by taking benefit of the overexpression of the gastrin releasing peptide receptor on prostate cancer cells. In this research, the pharmacokinetics of the tracer in cancerous and healthy tissues from dynamic PET imaging was studied to identify receptor-specific uptake in prostate cancer tissue. Methods: An image derived input function was obtained from a volume of interest drawn over the femoral artery. The image derived input function correction methods proposed by Chen[1], Mourik[2] and Hackett[3] were evaulated using Monte Carlo simulation of the fermoral artery. The simulation was done in GATE using a model of the Siemens Biograph mCT. Iteratively reweighted least squares and step-wise model fitting were used to increase the accuracy in the small spots suspicious of cancerous tissue. In order to validate the applied arterial input function correction methods, a model of the Siemens Biograph mCT was built in the GATE Monte Carlo software. The absorbed dose was calculated using the MIRD male dosimetry model, OLINDA/EXM and the time activity curves in the various organs. A simple one-way perfusion model of the kidney was applied to estimate the bladder filling over time. Results: The sensitivity and spatial resolution of the GATE model at the field-of-view center were respectively 11,1 ± 0,027 kcps/MBq and 4,00 ± 0,56 mm full width half maximum in the radial direction, both closely matching the values of reported by Jakoby[4]. Applying the arterial input function correction methods to the simulated arterial and venous concentration curves showed that Hackett’s method[3] most accurately estimates the true arterial concentration with less than 1% error after the first pass peak. Step-wise fitting of the 1-, FDG- and 2-compartment models showed to be less vulnerable to local minima. An increase up to 280% receptor density was observed in the spots suspicious of cancerous tissue compared to the surrounding tissue healthy prostate tissue, thereby providing proof for the specific uptake of [68Ga]Sarabesin 3 by gastrin releasing peptide receptor in prostate cancer tissue. The pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Sarabesin 3 were best described by a FDG model or a 2 compartment model with a small retention coefficient. It was not possible to determine the retention coefficient of the latter due the relatively large noise and small number of measurement points 50 minutes post-injection. Conclusion: Hackett’s method estimated the arterial concentration well in Monte Carlo simulations. [68Ga]Sarabesin 3 showed a good uptake in spots suspicious of cancerous tissue and had a high retention despite being an antagonist. The absorbed dose per administered activity to the prostate, red bone marrow and pancreas were estimated at 16,5, 13,5 and 196 ?Gy/MBq and the effective dose was 22,40 ?Sv/MBq, which is similar to the average [18F]DG effective dose.","prostate cancer; sarabesin; pharmacokinetics; monte carlo; PET; tracer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-23","Applied Sciences","RID / Erasmus MC","","RIH / Nuclear Medicine","",""
