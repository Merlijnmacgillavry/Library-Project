(mentor); Mulder, I.J. (mentor)","2010","In our digital age the news world is in turmoil. With the Internet news media became interactive and collaborative which has widespread implications on traditional business models. Today everyone can contribute by posting content online, ranging from pictures to videos and from comments to complete stories. Journalists are no longer the gate keepers of the news, the public can now decide for itself what news is relevant for them and what is not. Traditional media are struggling to survive the decreasing advertisement revenues and print circulation. In their search for new business models they have a difficult task of finding new ways of making money on the Internet, where almost anything is, or seems to be, free. Moreover, simply putting old news formats online is no longer sufficient. Adolescents and young adults in particular have radically different ways of communicating and interacting with information. They even have different ideas about what news is and the role it serves. The mere notion of what news is needs to be redefined. This thesis describes how a new generation consumes news in a new manner. It shows why traditional media are not sufficient anymore and how Internet and mobile phones are becoming the most important media for them. Since the media landscape is changing in a rapid pace only recent work is used, ranging from reports from American and Dutch journalism organizations to scientific research reports. Several explorative interviews with potential users were conducted in order to place the findings into context. The conclusions from the interviews as well as the literature study were used to define the research questions, supporting the project goal: Conduct a context mapping study in order to understand the ‘news’ needs of young adults in the broadest sense of the word (i.e. world news, news on topics of interest and news from the social graph). Use these findings to design an innovative product concept which improves the total news experience of today’s youngsters. The research questions were used as a basis for this context mapping study, in which eight young adults participated in a qualitative study. The outcomes of the study led to a design model in which three design requirements emerged: ‘Anywhere, anytime, anyhow’ ‘Personalize’ and ‘Low effort.’ These are supported with design directions as ‘depth’ ‘cross media’ ‘social network’ and ‘suggestions.’ The final concept is envisioned within two scenarios, showing how two fictive users stay updated and gain depth on their personal news sources on their mobile as well as on their computer. As an outcome of this project, these scenarios were used to evaluate the developed design model and chosen directions. In general, the scenarios were welcomed positively and they would improve the current news experience of the participants. Improvements can be made on managing sources to stay updated on, navigation within the news experience and gaining depth by acquiring automated overviews on specific topics. It is recommended for Vodafone to continue with research and development on this subject. There is a lot to gain within the young adults’ news experience. This thesis shows that young adults do not search for new solutions themselves, but would like to have them. There lies the opportunity for Vodafone: to offer an improved news experience. Vodafone could offer a news agent as proposed within this theses, which could intensify the change in the world of news for consumer as well as for the content providers.","news; vodafone; young adults; context mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2010","This report is the result of the final graduation assignment within the scope of the Master of Science (MSc) programme Strategic Product Design (SPD) at Delft University of Technology (DUT). The graduation assignment was executed in the academic year of 2009-2010. 'We believe that Innovation and Brand Development are in fact very strongly related: “Be” leads to “Do”. Innovation leads to brand strength - and strong brands inspire development.' This is the vision of Fronteer Strategy, an Amsterdam-based strategic consultancy firm with two main Practices: an Innovation Practice and a Brand Development Practice. In advising their clients, mostly R&D (Research and Development)/Marketing managers from multinational companies in wide range of industries, they aim for a more integrated approach of these Practices. The goal of this graduation project is to integrate the Practices of Fronteer in such a way, that their offer suits their clients’ needs. This is done by means of analyzing what the processes and outcomes of the two Practices of Fronteer are, what the Literature has to say about them and by a series of company interviews to understand different organizational perspectives on integrating the two Practices. This results in a conceptual model illustrating the connections between Innovation and Brand Development, and a Tool that provides a step-by-step action plan to let the conceptual model serve as both a discussion instrument, as well as an assessment instrument of a company’s current strategic situation. It is concluded that the two Practices of Fronteer can be operationalized in Touchpoints: moments of interaction between a brand and it’s (external) stakeholder. The conceptual model is called the BOWTIE model and is based on connecting the different Touchpoints in the following three areas: 1. Touchpoints on the Transaction generate revenues for the company and respond to a stakeholders‘ expectation by means of creating and selling products. Touchpoints on the Relation do not generate revenues but build a long-term relationship between the company and it’s stakeholders. It represents stakeholder expectations on a company’s product/service by means of marketing/communications. 2. Touchpoints can be initiated by the company (Internal) and by stakeholders (External). 3. Touchpoints can happen before the Purchase, around the Purchase and after the Purchase The BOWTIE model illustrates that connecting the Transaction and Relation Touchpoints connects expectation and response and connecting the Internal and External Touchpoints connects user needs and company capabilities. The Tool is a Touchpoint Strategy Workshop divided into four steps of 30 minutes. Step I and II provide an understanding of the BOWTIE model by means of a BOWTIE Booklet and Example Cards for the different Touchpoints possible. Step III and IV provide an assessment of a company’s current Touchpoints by means of identifying their location in the BOWTIE model and determining whether they have valuable connections with other Touchpoints or not. The outcome of the Tool is a summary of learnings for each of the BOWTIE areas and a summary of opportunities. The Tool was tested with two companies and the main conclusions were that the BOWTIE model provides insight into how product innovation and brand development are connected and the Touchpoint Strategy Workshop is a structured, inspiring way to assess a company’s current Touchpoints based on the BOWTIE model.","product/service innovation; brand development; marketing/communication strategy; customer value; brand driven innovation; innovation driven branding; customer involvement; brand relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kim, C.J. (mentor)","2010","Hello, I’m Pelie. I’m your peer and could use some help in gardening. Each season seeds have to be sowed, water will have to be given to plants and fruit will have to be harvested. Would you like to help me? This question is being asked to children of group 1 and 2 of primary school when playing the Pelies Garden game on TagTiles. TagTiles is an invention of Serious Toys, a company that develops products that combine fun and personal development in tangible human-computer interaction solutions. For the product to gain market in future, more games will have to be developed. TagTiles uses tangible interfaces which holds enormous promise for children, as exploring and manipulating physical objects is a key component of young children’s learning. All game objects have unique tags on them. Because of localization technologies, each object and location will be recognized by the TagTiles console. Each game exists of physical objects, a foil and game software being programmed in a dedicated specification language; ESPranto SDK. From the reflection on six selected concepts the Pelies Garden game was created out of two of those concepts. Contracting those concepts created a combination of a story context and spatial tasks. A peer figure was developed, named Pelie. Children can ask Pelie for help during the game. Twelve geometrical objects were developed; four cylinders representing fruit, flowers and grass, four filled triangles representing seeds and four transparent cubes representing water. All objects were given the colours red, yellow, blue and green. A foil was developed and software was programmed. The game was tested several times and improved with the help of analysed results. In the Pelies Garden game children will have to set objects on the board according to the story Pelie tells. There are twelve levels divided into three years. In spring, summer and autumn objects will have to be placed at the right positions and in winter the child’s performance will be reviewed. In the first three season levels objects will have to be placed in relation to images on the foil, in relation to other objects and in relation to coloured LED crosses; offering children different spatial tasks. Educational values of the game are listening in a comprehensive way, understanding a story, reproducing, spatial awareness, localising, logical thinking and reasoning, perception of colour, comparing objects, recognizing and naming forms. Results from user tests indicate children become better gardeners each year for each value. The game suffices to all determined requirements and wishes for TagTiles game packages. Recommendations have been made on future development for the game design, physical product design and expansion of the game with future levels. This report describes the product development process of the design of a TagTiles game. The graduation project is the last step in finalizing the Integrated Product Design master at the Delft University of Technology.","Serious Toys; tangible; interaction; game; children; primary school","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Karana, E. (mentor)","2010","SmarTEC is the abbreviated trademark for TenCate’s smart advanced textiles and smart advanced composites. In this master thesis, advanced textiles are defined as textiles with high-end performing functions for a broad range of industrial applications, and advanced composites are defined as engineering polymers reinforced with high-performance fibres. The strength of SmarTEC will derive from its properties, and are classified into a flexible, functional, protective, technological, emotional, and communicating value. The weakness of the material is its woven appearance, high production costs, and protective image. The automotive industry will drastically develop in the forthcoming years. With respect to the worldwide market, the mature European automotive will be leading in technology, whereas the Chinese automotive market will achieve a foremost market size and growth in general. Furthermore the market will become liable to new entrants, high degree of rivalry, and a shift of mutual power in between suppliers. The future macro developments and trends that will surround the automotive industry are classified into the terms global usership, ecology, and connectivity. With respect to the automotive customers, people will predominantly require improved functionality, efficiency and emotional interaction during their driving experience. The application areas of SmarTEC into a future automobile are a result of abovementioned material values and the developments and trends within and around the automotive industry. The showcase that will embody these application areas is the KG-1 Projecta for 2030 – in the long-term – and 2020 – in the short-term. A projecta is a general term for demonstration projects that will be used for product-technical and communicative purposes. The design of the KG-1 projecta 2030 mimics the vertical and horizontal movement of a human body, whereas the design of its intermediate equivalent of 2020 derives from the ergonomics of the human body – with the focus on the individual positioning of the driver and passenger. The commercialization process of SmarTEC is a combination of new material and new technology commercialization. Significant aspects in here are the semi-manufactured article, price per unit, exposure, market research, and partnerships. Furthermore, the commercialization of SmarTEC is an example of diversification, which is a growth strategy of introducing a new product into a new market. The strategy plan of commercializing SmarTEC is called SmarTEC Commercialization Spiral. The recommended tactics form a spiral around the original business model of TenCate, divided into three milestones, according to time. The purpose of the first milestone – representing the year 2010 – will be finding acceptance for SmarTEC at possible automotive launch customers. Recommended tactics will be: (1) open a market group Mobility SmarTEC, (2) start open innovation projects, and (3) expose SmarTEC on trade shows with the help of the KG-1 projectas. The second milestone – representing 2020 – will strive for the specific entrance within automotive niche markets with SmarTEC. These are the sports/leisure, luxurious, and versatile/urban market. Recommended tactics will be: (4) Focus on the European and Chinese automotive market, (5) approach one OEM, and (6) cut out competitors by pulling governmental norms. The aim of the third and last milestone – representing 2030 – is to gain worldwide automotive market leadership with SmarTEC. Recommended tactics will be: (7) Approach wide-ranged tier 1 suppliers and OEMs, (8) reduce high material and production costs of SmarTEC, and (9) adjust SmarTEC to end-user’s preferences.","SmarTEC; commercialization; automotive industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design/Master specialisation Automotive","",""

(mentor); Peck, D. (mentor); Hassi, L. (mentor)","2010","By covering the literature related to innovation processes, new value creation and sustainable innovation, the literature review conducted for this thesis highlights that the integration of sustainability issues in the Fuzzy Front End of Innovation (FFE) is an ill-addressed area in scientific literature. To tackle the problem, the research builds on the framework proposed by Hassi et al (2009). This framework is articulated in the following way:  At the origin of a sustainable innovation process, there are the strategic reasons that drive a business to innovate sustainably, i.e. Why sustainable innovation is pursued  In the later stages, there are a number of design and business tools that enable the embodiment and the optimization of products and services, i.e. How to enable sustainable innovation  Between these two steps, there is a crucial question addressed, namely what is the best translation of strategy into products and services, i.e. the goal-finding phase or What to do. Within each organization there are players responsible for articulating these choices, i.e. Who is enabling sustainable innovation. The ‘What’ phase is precisely when sustainability issues are integrated in the FFE of Innovation. As highlighted by the theoretical background, this is an under addressed area of innovation and sustainable innovation literature. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is to begin providing answers to the questions regarding what to do when pursuing sustainable innovation and more specifically how to optimize the integration of sustainability in early phases of innovation processes. The work is inserted within a wider research effort looking at how these issues are being perceived by a number of stakeholders in business, namely Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs), Design Agencies, Entrepreneurs, Consultancies and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This thesis looks specifically at the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), an important area of focus. According to the EU, they represent 99 % of all enterprises in the EU, directly contributing to entrepreneurship and innovation. It is therefore crucial that sustainable innovation practices within SMEs are mapped and understood. Additionally, available research has focused mainly on sustainable innovation in large companies. Since this area is still under addressed, initial research has to objectively understand how these issues are currently being managed and understood by management and businesses within SMEs. More specifically, it looks to address the following research questions: 1. How (when and by whom) is sustainability integrated in the FFE of Innovation? 2. In what way and how does the company’s view and strategy on sustainability influence their innovation process? Due to the theory-building characteristic of the research combined with its exploratory nature, the chosen research strategy was to conduct a multiple case study among innovative SMEs. Selected companies were divided into two groups of three SMEs and paired across industries/sectors:  Group A: SMEs that communicate their commitment to sustainability  Group B: SMEs that do not communicate any commitment to sustainability To be eligible, SMEs needed to have a product portfolio containing more than 1 product and have introduced a product to the market within the last 24 months. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and the review of companies’ documents and press articles. The main case analysis findings indicate a number of interesting issues:  The persona of the owner/general manager yields great influence on the outcome of FFE phases.  The innovation process and the FFE are very informal and are consistent only within each SME.  Time invested in FFE phases is very small.  FFE seem activities seem only to start at idea selection rather than at idea generation  When integrated in FFE phases, sustainability issues are tackled either under one specific product requirement or as more general guiding principle to the innovation process. The main implications of these findings are as follow:  SMEs seem to need to have stronger FFE activities. However, for this to happen, the personas of owners/general managers need to be included and addressed. Therefore, prior to the development of any tool to integrate sustainability in FFE activities, the FFE needs to be strengthened with relevant and appropriate approaches within the context of SMEs. These activities are to be directed to these key players in these organizations if any progress in better integrating sustainability in their early phases of the innovation process is to be done.  Within the context of SMEs, the ‘What’ and ‘Who’ aspects are closely linked and seemingly inseparable. The proposed framework by Hassi et al. (2009) would therefore need to be adapted when used in the present context.","Sustainability; Innovation; Fuzzy Front End; SMEs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

To improve the tyre characterization and avoid appointing its behaviour each time using trial-and-error, Centro Ricerche Fiat requests the development of an application that can identify the tyre parameters consistently and automatically. This thesis describes the process of developing the TyreEstimator, the application written for the identification of the tyre parameters. The application is built to minimize the difference between the vehicle model data and the experimental data using an optimization algorithm. Two vehicle models are implemented to identify the tyre parameters. The tyre behaviour is described using the Magic Formula tyre model. Due to the sensitivity of the optimization problem, the application is constructed to cope with different options for finding the tyre parameters. Afterwards an empirical analysis, using the TyreEstimator, is performed. This results in an option set for each vehicle model, which approaches the tyre behaviour best.","parameter; vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Without using any previous knowledge on the entire graph, can these two sub-graphs be used to construct an extended view on the entire graph. To test this assumption a collection of algorithms will be designed and implemented which can fuse two sub-graphs (topological maps) together to achieve this extended view on the unknown environment. The main goal for this project will consist of the distributed construction of topological maps within a simulated environment, with the main focus on the used algorithm(s) for the fusion of multiple maps. This will be realized with the help of a “graph” data structure, a multi agent system and match and merge algorithms. In general the simulated environment will function as a test environment for the algorithms. A real life situation for the simulation environment could be, that it represents a building in which an emergent situation has occurred and in which individuals are exploring the unknown layout of the building in search for their personal goal(s). This system can be used by first responders who are exploring the building and are in search of casualties in case of a fire or a terrorist attack. This will all result in a simulation in which it is assumed that each explorer in the field is equipped with a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or a different handheld device and can communicate with the other explorers within its communication range, without the help of a centralized communication system. The explorer’s traveled path is stored into their personal PDA and the software running on the PDA’s shows the explorers their traveled path and if possible combines their map with the received map from the explorers they encounter. If a combination is possible the software on the explores PDA executes the algorithms to construct the most complete view on the environment as possible. The completed or partially completed map can also provide guidance to the explorers if this is needed.","Multi Agent system; distributed; anonymous graphs; sub-graphs; map construction; wireless communication; exploration; Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor); Corbijn, M. (mentor)","2010","Since the early 1990’s parents are advised to let babies sleep on their backs, as part of the ‘Back to sleep’ program in prevention of SIDS (cot death). The program has been successful in decreasing the number of cot deaths, but has lead to an increase of deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly (DP). DP is a flattened skull at (one side of) the back of the head, that can develop when babies spend too much time in the same position. It can be treated with helmet therapy. Starting at an age of about 6 months, the baby will wear a redressement helmet 23 hours a day for about six months. The helmet protects the flat spot and leaves free space for the head to grow in the right direction. Some helmets also apply slight pressure to the parts of the skull that have bulged outwards. There are several foam layers inside the helmet that can be removed or made thinner. This allows the helmet to ‘grow’ with the child. Dutch orthopaedic company LIVIT started offering this helmet therapy around 15 years ago and now makes approximately 2000 of these helmets a year. This makes them market leader in the Netherlands. Currently LIVIT offers three slightly different types of helmets, which they want to reduce to one uniform helmet type. The aim is not to choose between the three types, but to design a new helmet that combines the strong points of each model. During the first phase of this project, the current redressement helmets were assessed and the demands and wishes of paediatricians, orthopaedic advisers and parents were explored. Current problems with the helmet are excessive sweating and skin problems, due to pressure or friction spots. The size and weight of the helmet can also be uncomfortable for the children. Parents would benefit from improved looks and ease of use. A problem for LIVIT is the fact that the exact working principle is unclear. The three current helmets all fit differently, but it is difficult to choose how tight the helmet should fit. All these aspects were taken into account during idea generation. Many different solutions were explored, eventually leading to a final concept. The new helmet design has opened up the way for a uniform LIVIT redressement helmet. The following improvements were realized in the new design:  Smaller, lighter and cooler  Looks better  Improved comfort and safety of the chin strap  Improved effectivity of the side-cuts The following recommendations can be made for the future:  Keep track of therapy results in a 3D database. This is necessary to choose a standard fit and to truely switch to one uniform helmet. The selection process for the extra features should also be standardized.  Invest in the acceptance of the new concept within LIVIT. The subject of improvements on the redressement helmet is very much alive within the company. However there is much diversity of opinion. Therefore it is important to build up support from orthopaedic advisers from all LIVIT locations.  Look into the possibilities of different production methods. This could result in better quality, faster or cheaper production. It will require additional investments for which a cost-benefit analysis should be made.","redesign; helmet; plagiocephaly; babies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-04-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Nes, A. (mentor); Harteveld, M.G.A.D. (mentor)","2010","In 26 December 2006, a magnitude 8.9R earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean at South of Sumatra island of Indonesia. The intense earthquake lasted for several minutes, triggering a tsunami that swept most of the coastline of the Aceh province in Indonesia, as well as other countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It’s believed to be one of the most devastating natural disasters in mankind history ever recorded within this century. According to Ghobarah (2006), more than a quarter million people died and nearly 1.5 million people were pushed away from home and livelihood. No other natural disaster has been more devastating than tsunami 2004. It stunned world communities and an immediate response was launched to assist the affected region. At the aftermath of the tsunami 2004, Aceh province suffered the worst hit of the disaster and civil war that afflicted the province aggravated the impact. Banda Aceh as the capital city lost nearly two thirds of it built area due to heavy inundation. JICA (2005) reported that more than 70.000 people died in this city alone while thousands of others were displaced from their homes. The Local government with the help of international aid organization reacted quickly to response the disaster. The city soon recovered from the disaster and many of the inhabitants returned to their homes to start their livelihood activity. The city has grown once again and this time it gained a lot of support from international donors. A large amount of capital has been granted to rebuild the city with the expectation that the city will be much better than before. Such opportunity creates a rapid growth of the city and more people are coming to the city for a better life. Central Statistic Bureau (BPS, 2008) reported that from the population of 177.881 in 2005, the number of inhabitants has grown to 219.659 in 2007. However, for such a huge disaster like the tsunami 2004, the city might well again hit by future tsunami as it lies on high seabed’s earthquake prone area, while the current state of the city showed that a proper step towards tsunami prevention effort has not been fully implemented in sectors of city development. This fact leads to the increase of city’s vulnerability rate against tsunami. With the rapid growth of the city, the impact of future tsunami can be highly devastated. Such threat to the city required serious attention from the local government. Although tsunami countermeasures effort can be very expensive, especially for small city of Banda Aceh, the city still has to take tsunami precaution as one of the baseline of the future development. Smart combination between tsunami countermeasures efforts and urban regeneration projects might lead to more affordable approach while at the same time also improve the living quality of the city inhabitants. Therefore it’s very challenging for the urbanist to plan a better city that has strong resilience toward tsunami and at the same time upgrade the living quality of the city in the affordable manner.","community resilience; tsunami hazard; resilient urban structure; disaster mitigation; coastal development; community participation; earthquake resistant building; disaster in third world countries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Climate Studio","",""

(mentor); Neerincx, M.A. (mentor)","2010","This thesis discusses a new and unexplored concept which uses computer assisted technology to support trauma-focused psychotherapy, focusing on restructuring and relearning of past events. The proposed application allows patients and therapist to visualize the patient’s past experience using maps, personal photos, stories and self created 3D virtual worlds. The tool aims to allow patients to restructure, reappraise and relearn about their past experience involving the problematic stressors. The design of the system followed a situated cognitive engineering approach. The first step of this approach was to do a domain analysis. This was done in close cooperation with a psychiatrist experienced in treating veterans suffering from a combat-related PTSD, which eventually lead to the establishment of an inventory of human factor knowledge, operational demands and envisioned technology. The knowledge was used to create several scenarios and prototypes. Experts with a psychology background were asked to review these scenarios and discuss various possibilities and limitations, while prototypes were evaluated and tested by experts with a background in Human-Computer Interaction. The acquired feedback made it possible to constantly refine the requirements baseline. The experiment which followed suggested that all three main interface components were easy to use. Also, differences were found in a way a story was told with the application compared to a story told without the use of the system.

Royal Dutch Gazelle had the desire for a modular chain guard in order to simplify logistics, but still maintain the required variation to fit the range of bicycles and parts used on those bicycles. The development of the modular chain guard specifically had to cope with the balance between using only few parts and creating enough variation in styling, while making it compatible with other bicycle parts, like the frames, gear hubs, etc. Finally resulting in a cost reduction in the logistics of the chain guards. After conducting a research on the Gazelle bicycles, the parts used, customer needs, production, etc. a design proposal was developed. The proposed modular system shows a significant reduction in costs of logistics and improved flexibility of the applicability of the chain guards onto different bicycles.","chain guard; modular; Gazelle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-04-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

It offers globally available, license-free, very large bandwidth for high data rate communication. At 60 GHz frequency band, severe attenuation of the signals can significantly degrade communication performance. To cope with the attenuation problem, relays or directional antennas with high directive gains can be utilized. Both methods have additional challenges among their benefits. It is analytically and through simulations shown that having a relay node in the middle of a 60 GHz network decreases the average free-space path loss 33% in the worst case scenario. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to address effect of relay on path loss analytically in a generic form. When network nodes use directional antennas, the neighbor discovery process becomes more complicated and time consuming. There are not many studies assuming pure directional transmission and reception at all steps of communication. Random selection among sectors is generally used for pure directional communication. To reduce the neighbor discovery time, we propose a smart neighbor scanning algorithm in this work. It is observed that the proposed strategy discovers 70% of the links 81% faster and 90% of the links 15% faster than random scanning strategy for a typical home network scenario. A condition to have a path between any two nodes and a stochastic model to observe isolation trend in home networks are also presented. The results of this thesis motivate the multi-hop communication, use of directional antennas for 60 GHz indoor networks.","Connectivity; Home Networks; Neighbor discovery; neighbor scanning; Relay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

Beyond the basic function of pure illumination via intensity control of xed color light, LED technology additionally allows control over the light color and illumination pattern. In order to realize these functions of intelligent lighting control, we need to estimate the light intensity of each LED in the sensor location. To this end, a synchronous code-time division multiple access - pulse width modulation (CTDMA-PWM) system has been proposed for LED identification and simultaneous measurement of illumination strength. However, this system strictly requires perfect synchronization, which in practice is not easy to be guaranteed. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose an asynchronous CTDMA-PWM scheme and corresponding multiuser detection algorithm to combat the multiple access interference (MAI) caused by asynchronous multiple access. We explore the algorithm of conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear estimation and implement it iteratively in a blind way without the knowledge of channel input from interfering LEDs.","multiuser detection; code time division multiple access (CDMA); asynchronous multiple access; mean square error estimation (MMSE); blind MMSE; imaging diversity.","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

To successfully manage these projects a combination of project management and process management is required. Main research question is: How can managers of spatial development projects, given the context and management issues in these developments, properly apply project-oriented and process-oriented interventions and by that increase the success of their management? Project managers can influence the success of their project by applying interventions that match the current project situation. It is possible to distinguish elements of a project situation that require project management and elements that require process management. However, a project situation is almost never purely suited for project management or purely suited for process management. Therefore in many interventions aspects of project and process management have to be combined. There are several mechanisms to combine project and process management by interventions. Based on this research, three recommendations are formulated: 1. It is recommended to actively search for “windows of opportunity”, which offer the perfect opportunity to successfully apply a specific intervention. 2. To intervene successfully in ambiguous project situations, interventions should contain a combination of project and process management. It is recommended to weave project and process management together in an individual intervention or in a series of linked interventions. 3. Three intervention mechanisms are identified to combine project and process management. First, it is recommended to let project and process management contribute to each others objectives with the appliance of mutually reinforcing interventions. Second, it is recommended that potential negative effects of interventions are compensated by adding project-oriented conditions to process-oriented interventions and by adding process-oriented conditions to project-oriented interventions. Third it is recommended to apply project and process management interventions based on each other's results.","process management; project management; interventions; project complexity; spatial development projects; management strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-04-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisation, Law & Gaming","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

(mentor)","2010","Under current regulations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are prohibited from operating in non- segregated airspace. The absence of a pilot is considered to be a potential hazard because the pilot is responsible for the separation with other aircraft. In unmanned aviation the pilot, or operator, can never detect possible separation conflicts without the help of Detect, Sense and Avoid (DSA) systems. To make operation in civil airspace possible, there is a need for certified DSA systems. As of yet there are no certified systems available because the requirements for the certification are not yet developed. To help develop these requirements for these systems, research efforts experiment with these systems in both flight-tests and simulations. One such a research effort is made by the Delft University of Technology (DUT) together with the Netherlands Defence Academy (NLDA). They use a UAV ground station simulator to investigate the ‘Operator-in-the-Loop’ concept: the DSA system does not autonomously take action, but the operator is alerted when a possible threat is detected and asked to verify the threat and to decide what action to take. The research presented in this thesis is performed in order to increase the fidelity of the DSA models used in this simulator. DSA systems use sensors to detect potential threats. This project focused on the simulation of the sensors used for detecting non-cooperative traffic. On the basis of a study of the literature the three most commonly used sensors were selected: radar, electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR). After the subsystems and interfaces were defined the subsystems were designed in a two step iterative approach. The final radar simulation is a link-budget model and uses the Swerling algorithm for the detection calculation. The EO and the IR simulation system use a simplified geometric aircraft model to calculate the static and dynamic signature on the sensor image. The detection calculation is performed by weighing and combining the signatures and comparing them to a threshold value. All designed systems are verified with data obtained from other research projects.","radar; electro-optical; infrared; uav","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-05-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Tijani, M.E.H. (mentor)","2010","In industrial processes about 80% of the energy demand is in the form of heat. One of the problems of the industrial waste heat is the low temperature of this heat. The department of energy efficiency and infrastructure, 'E&I' of the Energy research Center of the Netherlands 'ECN' runs projects in order to use industrial waste heat with a thermoacoustic heat pump. Thermoacoustic engines can deliver the power to drive a thermoacoustic heat pump and can be driven by waste heat. The desired hot temperatures exceed the temperatures of the waste heat. It is believed that more than one thermoacoustic engine is necessary in order to gain sufficient temperature lift. In this study a parallel configuration of thermoacoustic engines is compared to a serial configuration of thermoacoustic engines. Additionally the losses in a coaxial thermoacoustic engine are analyzed. In two sets of experiments two regenerator units were placed in parallel and serial configuration inside a symmetric resonator. The regenerators were heated with an electrical heater and cooled with cooling water. Power was subtracted with a load. The power that can be subtracted by the load is the same as the power that could be used in a heat pump. The main objective is to gain maximum load power with a hot regenerator temperature as low as possible. The experiments show that the serial configuration produced more acoustic power in the load than the parallel configuration. In contrast the efficiency of the power produced in the resonator is found to be about the same for both configurations. This is because of the assumption that the power dissipated in the resonator is equal to twice the power dissipated in an empty half of the resonator, while in reality the power dissipated in the resonator depends also on the internal geometries in the resonator, and the internal velocity. In the present experimental setup the pressure and velocity profile are not the same for serial and parallel configurations. The acoustic power measured in the load is used to compute the external efficiency. The internal efficiency is calculated from the resonator losses and the power measured in the load. The resonator losses were originally determined from two microphone measurements of an empty resonator half, without the consideration of internal geometries. Hence internal efficiencies of the two configurations can not be compared, whereas the external efficiencies can be compared to draw conclusions. In the parallel configuration at a pressure of 19.9 bar, a drive ratio of 3.03 and a heater input of 324 W, 5.96 W of acoustic power can be subtracted while the hot regenerator temperature rises till 274 oC. In the serial configuration at a pressure of 19.5 bar, a drive ratio of 2.95 and a heater input of 367 W, 11.63 W of acoustic power can be subtracted while the hot regenerator temperature rises till 290 oC. This means the 2nd law external efficiency of the serial configuration is 47% better than for the parallel configuration. A calculation predicts that the serial configuration could perform as much as 80% better if the load was placed at the engine side.

The reason lies in the direct connection of material use with investment costs, which are becoming more important with larger turbines. For this optimization, proper fatigue analysis and assessment of the extreme loads is highly important. For the assessment of extreme loads wind gusts are important. Until now, gusts of a deterministic shape have been used, which is in contrast with the common practise for fatigue analysis. Therefore, Wim Bierbooms developed the NewGust method for simulating wind speed gusts of any desired length and amplitude at DUWIND. The validity of the resulting gust shape has already been proved by several articles, but until now nobody looked into the validity of the load response of a wind turbine resulting from wind gusts simulated according to the NewGust method.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); De Haan, G. (mentor)","2010","An increasing number of cameras is being used to monitor a growing range of environments. Consequently, surveillance systems consist of an increasing number of screens to display all incoming video streams, making it difficult for observers to maintain a mental model of spatial relations between videos. A number of systems is developed aiming at improving the observer’s spatial awareness by integrating videos with their spatial context, a 3D model of the monitored environment. In these systems, video content can be viewed from virtual cameras that correspond with the cameras in the real world. To switch between views on certain videos, the observer has to make a transition between the corresponding virtual cameras by some means of navigation. While studying state-of-the-art 3D surveillance systems, we have observed that not much attention has been paid on exploring more sophisticated viewpoint transitions. In this thesis, different classes of camera relations are identified. For each class, a viewpoint transition mechanism is developed with the focus on reducing distortion of the video information during transitions. In order to navigate through the virtual environment, viewpoint transitions have to be initiated to switch between videos. As part of this thesis, a number of concepts have been developed that provide controls to the viewpoint transitions in the form of 3D elements that are added to the virtual environment. We have implemented our navigation concepts in a prototype, which was used for a user study. This thesis concludes with the results from this user study and our vision on future work in the field of context-aware surveillance.","video; surveillance; camera; navigation; 3D environments; computer graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Wauben, L.S.G.L. (mentor); Coupe, S. (mentor)","2010","Suturing has been done the same way for decades now, but it still involves a number of challenges. SutureAid took the challenge to solve these problems while suturing. This resulted in an invention: a forceps with a soft tip, a needle receptor, placed on one arm of the forceps. The aim of this soft tip is that it can both support tissue and provide a location where the suture needle is fixated during suturing. There are many patented inventions to either pick up the needle or to support the tissue. Combining both into one product is not available on the market yet. The differences between the current way of suturing and the SutureAid way of suturing are shown in the movie: Suturing.avi. This idea, of picking up the suture needle with a soft tip, is improved in order to be suitable for cardiac surgery. This project focuses on the coronary artery bypass graft surgery, as this is the most common cardiac surgery in the world. In this surgery an alternative route is created to direct the blood flow around a blocked artery. The transplanted piece of vessel used, is called a graft. This graft is connected to the blocked artery. Suturing two hollow organs, such as vessels, is called anastomosis. To perform an anastomosis, the needle is perforated through the tissue with your dominant hand. You use your recessive hand to grab the suture needle at the other side of the tissue with a forceps. During studies several needs and usability problems are explored and discussed by the users during interviews. Not only the surgeons’ opinions are taken into account, also the role of the nurse practitioners is considered, as they have to prepare all instruments. Three main problems: Picking up the suture needle without damaging the needle or tissue Visible feedback of where the needle exits the tissue Feedback of the connection of two instrument-parts These three so-called design directions serve as a foundation for the idea generation. Next to this, forces exerted (by the surgeon) while suturing using the current technique are compared to the SutureAid technique. This results in a significant lowering of the force using the SutureAid technique. Lowering the force, surgeons can be more precise while suturing, which results in improved quality of the anastomosis. Three ideas are developed into concepts and finally one concept is chosen, founded on the input of users. The three developed concepts differ primarily on the type of connection to the forceps. The chosen concept is based on the connection used in the current SutureAid products. The soft tip, where the needle is inserted, consists of an elastomer. Elastomers with different degrees of hardness are tested. Resulting in the harder the elastomer material, the lower the force used to insert the suture needle. Different surgeons prefer a hardness of Shore 20, but Shore 30 will increase the fixation on the suture needle significantly. Finally a 3mm3 ball of Shore 30 is chosen. The final usability test outlined the benefits and disadvantages of the design. The connection provides a clear feedback that can be confirmed by the surgeons. Nurse practitioners (who prepare the instruments before surgery and make the connection) perceive this as valuable. When using the design the angles of inserting the needle in the elastomer are increased, in this way picking up the suture needle is simplified. The time performing an anastomosis is reduced as repositioning the suture needle from the forceps into the needle holder (to start a new perforation) is improved. As a conclusion can be stated that the design meets the main requirements and wishes of different users. And there is definitely interest towards reduction of needle damage and tissue damage, ease of picking up the suture needle and the saving of time while repositioning the suture needle into the needle holder. The final materials are not defined yet. For the insertion material an elastomer with Shore 30 is preferred. For the more rigid part a plastic such as PolyEther Ether Ketone is possible, as this causes less deflection while suturing. The forceps consists of lightweight titanium. It is recommended to investigate the different possible materials. It is recommended to consider changes of the design in order to be more suitable for injection moulding, such as wall-thicknesses and tolerances. Clinical trials provide insights into the use of the design in the actual environment. This could give rise to some last changes to make the product user-friendlier.","Suturing; forceps; innovative; tissue trauma","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Oorzaak hiervan is dat individuele gemeenten, uit een oogpunt van werkgelegenheid, zich genoodzaakt voelen voldoende locaties te bieden voor industrie en bedrijven. Daarbij wordt de suggestie gewekt dat er behoefte is aan nieuwe bedrijventerreinen: sterke bedrijven willen verhuizen omdat het oude bedrijventerrein niet meer aan hun ruimtelijke en functionele behoeften voldoet. Zwakkere bedrijven, die niet zullen investeren in het terrein, blijven achter waardoor het bedrijventerrein verslechtert.

(mentor); Van Dooren, E.J.G.C. (mentor)","2010","The aim of this research is to study the possibilities of adaptation in a façade in order to be able to design an adaptive façade for the future faculty of Architecture at TU Delft. In general, an adaptive façade has the ability to change, responding to changing internal and/or external climatic conditions influencing room comfort. It was evident from the beginning of the research that an adaptive façade can have a positive effect on a building’s energy consumption and comfort. The idea that an adaptive façade can contribute to a flexible building and usage of space as well, is quite new; it assumes that this type of façade is necessary to fulfill the different requirements per room type placed on the internal climate. To verify this, three room typologies – a design studio, an office and a meeting room – have been researched on their user and climate requirements. An understanding of the difference in use of both the room and its façade (for instance practicability of the façade), and the related comfort requirements per room typology is necessary to comprehend the effects on the façade. The study on comfort shows that light and ventilation need to be adaptive because every room type has different comfort requirements. The usable floor area per person is different per room type and the reverberation time varies as well, but this difference is solved cleverly by using materials with different absorption qualities in the room itself. A difference in temperature, light, ventilation and sound all have influence on the design of the façade and the internal climate. The relevant internal factors influencing room comfort are people, electrical devices and lighting. Their effect on the internal climate differs per room typology since the amount of people and the surface area vary. The external conditions – solar radiation, outside air temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind – are dependent on location and orientation and cannot be influenced by design; however, an adaptable façade must make best use of these conditions. The amount of adaptation needed in a façade is analyzed in the adaptivity analysis. The analysis takes into account the different functions, day and night differences, the seasons and the façade’s orientation. Different profiles have been defined to study the effects of the different adaptive functions in relation to each other. Furthermore, different levels of adaptivity have been quantified to research what function needs what amount of adaptation, the levels being: minute-to-minute, day and night, season and years. These levels are necessary to limit down the choice for certain components even more. To be able to actually design a façade with adaptive components, one needs to know what is there and what is not. An overview has been made for façade components that can adapt manually, mechanically and on a material level – so-called ‘smart’ materials. Of course, this overview is not complete and probably never will be, but within the timeframe of this research, it does tell what the potential of the component is and its advantages and disadvantages. The components have been organized per function into a diagram. In combination with the defined profiles for designers it’s a useful tool to create new façade concepts. Three different concepts have been worked out with the help of the profiles and the diagram with adaptive components. These adaptive concepts show the possibilities, effects and restraints for the future façade with adaptive components. The last chapter shows the result for an adaptive façade design as a result of the graduation assignment in both architecture and building technology. In conclusion, adaptivity in a façade is dependent on a lot of different factors: the user profile and practicability of the façade; its effectiveness in time, meaning the different levels of adaptivity; its climate profile; its costs and architectural choices. It is also a direct outcome of what components are available at the time of making the concept and design. The future façade will potentially take in more and more functionality, with a better integration of building services and integration with a building’s structure.","facade; adaptable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-16","Architecture","Building Technology","","Design of Constructions","",""

(mentor)","2010","Against the background of enhanced hydraulic loads due to climate change there will be a need for improvement of the flood defence system in the Netherlands in the future. These days there is a growing interest in grass as a dike cover because it is a cheap and a sustainable dike protection. Yet at the moment there is a hiatus in the knowledge on the erosion resistance of grass covers on especially the outer slope. For this reason large scale tests have been performed in the Große WellenKanal (Large Wave Flume) in Hannover in 2008 for both EroGRASS and FLOODsite. With the help of the EroGRASS data the MSc-study presented here aimed to develop a model that describes the initiation of erosion of a grass cover layer on the outer slope by wave attack. The erosion process was investigated first to gain some insight in the failure mechanisms on the outer slope. For wave-induced erosion of grass cover layers on the outer slope two failure mechanisms can be distinguished which can occur independently of each other. Aggregate erosion occurs when the soil is cracked and saturated with water. Uplift pressures can then develop underneath the aggregates shortly after a wave impact and on the surface small aggregates may be lifted and washed away. This eventually results in an erosion hole. Block erosion may occur when impact pressures can penetrate into the soil due to the presence of a large crack or irregularity. The balloon mechanism may then be triggered; at the location of minimum fracture strength a horizontal crack is formed. This crack gradually extends until it reaches a critical size. From this point a large block can instantly erode from the grass cover. For these erosion mechanisms the Wave Impact Pressure Erosion model has been developed, which describes the initiation of erosion of grass covers on the outer slope by wave impact pressures. The basic equation of the WIPE model can be adapted to obtain limit states for aggregate erosion block erosion. The WIPE model was calibrated and verified with the data of the EroGRASS experiments. For aggregate erosion the model behavior resembled the observed progression of aggregate erosion during the experiments after calibration. The WIPE model is considered suitable for the prediction of aggregate erosion of a good quality grass cover. Yet because the grass cover strength is dominated by the grass reinforcement, which decays with depth, the model will require adaptations to make it suitable for grass covers of lower quality. For block erosion the model was calibrated using a parameter that determines the moment of block erosion and a crack growth parameter, which determines the size of the eroded block. As the model was calibrated on merely two characteristic block erosion events, universal calibration factors for block erosion could unfortunately not be found. To obtain more reliable and uniform results for block erosion more data is required.","erosion; outer slope; grass cover; breaking wave impact; impact pressure; dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","In November 2003 the Voyager 1 spacecraft pierced through the Solar system’s termination shock, followed by Voyager 2 in August 2007. These events marked the beginning of interstellar exploration by spacecraft, which caused a wave of renewed interest in the outer heliosphere throughout the scienti?c community. This thesis research investigated the feasibility of a mission to the Solar bow shock (the true interstellar boundary) at ?200 AU from the Sun; twice as far as the Voyager spacecraft. The techniques used in designing its trajectory were standard gravitational-assist manoeuvres and/or a single close-proximity flyby with the Sun, and both low-thrust and high-thrust propulsion systems were investigated. Minimum time of ?ight and maximum spacecraft dry mass were primary objectives, whereas the number and quality of minor planet ?ybys were secondary objectives. A maximum on the time of ?ight of 15 years was upheld, extendible to a maximum of 25 years in case the ?rst constraint could not be met or proved overly bene?cial to the other objectives. This constraint necessitated upholding a maximum of 3 gravitational-assist manoeuvres, which gave rise to a search space of 146 unique ?yby sequences. A novel optimization algorithm developed in this thesis (GODLIKE) identi?ed 3 feasible sequences, which were only feasible in combination with a high-thrust propulsion system. The most promising sequence (Earth/Jupiter/Uranus/bow shock) proved capable of reaching the bow shock with minimal risk and impact on the spacecraft’s dry mass. The best result found requires a ?V of 5.86 km/s and approaches approximately 14 minor planets to within 0.03 AU. The total time of ?ight could unfortunately not be kept below 15 years; technically feasible trajectories could only be generated for times of ?ight between 23 and 25 years. Despite the long time of ?ight, the results developed in this research do show that it is possible to traverse the entire heliosphere using time-proven and conventional means.","Trajectory optimization; Minor Planet; Interstellar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-05-01","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

Furthermore, the operational (direction of) solutions are linked with the tactical aims, thus giving insight and overview to all parties involved. Sustainability can be defined as a personal judgement, which reveals itself in variety of different approaches, on how to, as well as to the extend to which properties and features of the built environment minimize the negative impact and maximise the positive impact on existing environmental problems (deterioration of the human health, deterioration of ecosystems, depletion of resources); the considered level of scale, time and the scope of measured properties are determined by that personal judgement. The framework should contribute to the ability to discuss sustainability and its aims, and to help solve several problems, such as confusions on the topic (due to its personal character) and the loss of focus.","Sustainability; duurzaamheid; besluitvormingsniveaus; STODUR; decision levels; framework; raamwerk","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and construction management","",""

Het kabinet heeft in 2007 de Deltacommissie ingesteld en advies gevraagd hoe Nederland beschermd kan woren tegen de gevolgen van de klimaatverandering. Hiertoe heeft de Deltacommissie zich wetenschappelijk laten adviseren door (inter-)nationale deskundigen uit onder andere het IPCC-circuit en door Nederlandse experts op het gebied van waterveiligheid en –beheer. Eén van de aanbevelingen van de Deltacommissie is om de Nederlandse kust met één kilometer zeewaarts uit te breiden. Het doel van dit afstudeerproject is om inzicht te krijgen in hoe de kust zich met het advies van de Deltacommissie en met de klimaatscenario’s van het KNMI kan ontwikkelen. Daarbij gaat het om de vraag hoe de nieuwe kust met haar badplaatsen ingericht kan worden zodat deze ook op de zeer lange termijn (in het jaar 2100) klimaatbestendig is, veilig is tegen overstromingen en ruimte biedt aan andere functies naast kustbescherming. De kust moet kunnen anticiperen op de klimaatveranderingen. Daarnaast is de vraag hoe deze kust weer kan concurreren met buitenlandse kustgebieden, zoals de kust van België en Duitsland.","kustontwikkeling; Zandvoort; pier; Delta Commissie; kustuitbreiding; badplaatsontwikkeling","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-09","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon area has a lot of sandbars but they are eroding. Since the building of the Glen Canyon Dam and the Hoover Dam in the 1960s, sediment is trapped in the upstream lake. The inflow of water is clear, cold and nearly sediment free. The only noticeable remaining inflow of sediment in the Colorado River is by two tributaries which merge with the Colorado River. This sediment is mostly transported as bed load in downstream direction during normal flow conditions, and does not contribute to sandbar building. The erosion of sandbars has been researched by the United States Geological Survey for decades. Large field experiments are part of this research. The fourth experiment was the high-flow experiment of 2008. During the high-flow experiment of 2008 a dam release of 42000 cfs (1134 m3/s) was bypassed through the dam for 60 hours. The high velocities would bring sediment from the riverbed in suspension. The sediment is then deposited in low-velocity areas. The main question in this research is whether it is possible with a specified dam release, to create sandbars and how they can remain stable on the long term. To answer this question the software program Delft3D is used for the simulation of the sandbar creation. For the long term stability of the bars an image transformation was executed, and for the short term stability the geotechnical program PLAXIS was used. For the situation in the Willie Taylor and Eminence pools a dam release can be determined so sandbars will be created and remain stable for the long term. Sandbars can be created during a high discharge under sediment enriched conditions. The erosion of the sandbars can be set to a minimum when the drawdown of the water level takes 5 days, so the sandbars are almost fully drained. However, implications of erosion at other parts of the sandbar (other than the banks) should be considered using the Delft3D model. The daily fluctuations should be set to a minimum especially in the first period after the flood.","Delft3D; PLAXIS; sandbars","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The past five decades an unparalleled growth in societal demand for raw materials occurred which led to sometimes-irreversible negative impacts on the earth’s ecological system. Consequently sustainable issues are of growing importance in the world and this awareness is present among customers of IHC Merwede B.V. (IHC), their customers start to demand sustainability to be incorporated in products and services. IHC intends to anticipate to this growing future demand and to invest in building up knowledge and implementing sustainability in their products and services. An Alluvial Mining Operation (AMO) has an inevitable impact on the complex ecological (environment, landscape) and social (local communities) systems. To understand such systems and implement sustainability into practice, more knowledge is required. An extensive review of literature on sustainability currently in use by the mining industry, specific characteristics in the alluvial mining industry, and improvement opportunities for a more sustainable approach have led to a sustainable guideline for AMOs. The following main conclusions concerning the sustainable guideline were identified: Sustainable issues in the mining industry can be applied very well in AMOs. During the operation phase material handling and water management are key parameters for a sustainable AMO. The International Finance Corporation stakeholder engagement process and performance standards are very functional tools during the exploration and feasibility study phases. The framework of the International Council on Mining & Metals is globally most utilized and can be applied during all mining phases. Improvement opportunities are: A better understanding of the ecological and social system is required. Notice that relevant data collection about the system is time consuming. Initiatives such as Building With Nature will help to gain more knowledge and insight in the (eco)system; A corporate mind of sustainability for all related stakeholders, on and off-site, is essential during the whole mine life; Backcasting is a useful method to road-map community projects to maximize societal value; Land-based AMOs alternative, self-generating energy sources are very interesting opportunities; For dredge mining equipment opportunities as essential sustainable parameters are reduction and minimization of emissions, turbidity, material stewardship and improved energy efficiency; and in every country with the potential for placer mining it is recommended to establish specific SD guidelines for each specific ecosystem that occurs. Due to the continuous and concurrent reclamation method only a small amount has to be reclaimed for complete closure. The South African department of minerals and energy developed a useful guideline to estimate closure costs. For further research the Gold Sands project in Peru is chosen to verify the validity of Sustainable Development issues in AMO. The main conclusions concerning the sustainable cash flow model are: Data collection to valuate sustainable indicators that affect the cash flow is difficult. The required social related data is eventually only applicable for Peruvian mining operations. Despite the difficulties for sustainable data collection, a sustainable cash flow model has been developed successfully. The mining systems selection tool serves both integrated investment analysis and production planning. The effect of alterations in the selection tool is clearly visualized in the plotted graphs. Project’s economic viability is positive within the sustainable case and the sensitivity analysis shows that sustainability is not a key parameter that influences the viability of the project.","alluvial mining; SD; guideline; cash flow model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","","",""

Results showed that the CM is more efficient at low torques. The same results were used to derive and validate a steady state model for the CM. The Model is based on four major losses in the CM.

(mentor); Gerard, M.P. (mentor)","2010","With the growing interest for vehicles with electric propulsion, research has been done on more modular car designs where the driveline and steering system is integrated in the wheel corners. Such a corner module containing an in-wheel motor and active brake and steering system is denoted as an Autonomous Corner Module (ACM). Using this module tyre forces can be freely assigned within the chassis solution, which could lead to improved stability. The goal of the thesis is to design a controller for an ACM which needs to generate two desired output forces (longitudinal and lateral) using the inputs (wheel spin velocity and steering angle). The controller design is restricted to the field of Model Predictive Control, since this method can deal with nonlinearities, multivariable systems and constraints. Throughout the thesis the potential of MPC for this particular application is investigated. Two types of controllers are proposed, the first type is a Non-linear MPC where the non-linear model is directly used in the online optimization. The design method allows for easy adjustment of the model, but the non-linear optimization is time consuming and therefore only applicable at velocities up to 20 km/h. To speed up the computation time, a second controller is proposed, which is a Linear Time Varying MPC. This type of controller is faster than the NMPC, since the optimization is performed on a local linearization of the non-linear model. Simulation results show that this controller could be a serious option for online implementation for velocities up to 50 km/h.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

We hebben het in dezelfde taal geprogrammeerd als de andere applicaties, het bestaande proces was geschreven in een andere taal. Voor het verkrijgen van de requirements hebben we voornamelijk gebruikgemaakt van interviews met medewerkers binnen Hostnet. Dit was ook de enige mogelijkheid omdat er nauwelijks technische informatie over het oude syteem beschikbaar was. Alle requirements hebben we ingedeeld volgens de MoSCoW methode. We hebben uiteindelijk alle Musts en Shoulds kunnen verwezenlijken. Om het ontwerp duidelijk te presenteren naar Hostnet hebben we gekozen om hun stijl te gebruiken en de processen in flowcharts weer te geven. Voordat we aan de implementatie begonnen, hebben we ook nog klassen en volgordediagrammen en een dataflow-diagram gemaakt. De implementatie zelf verliep redelijk voorspoedig. Wel hebben we ongeveer veertig procent van deze tijd gebruikt voor het vergelijken van de uitvoer van het nieuwe en oude systeem. We kunnen concluderen dat we in korte tijd veel werk hebben verzet. De extra motivatie die we kregen doordat het eindresultaat van onze opdracht daad- werkelijk in gebruik genomen gaat worden en de vriendelijke medewerkers heeft hier zeker bij geholpen.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Technische Informatica - Software Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Mulder, I.J. (mentor)","2010","This thesis describes a process to accomplish the following goal; to enhance the communication between stakeholders during the design process of the patient’s room en thereby improving the patient’s room interior design to the advantage of all stakeholders. An explorative research was done, in the form of literature studies, observations and interviews on the following critical areas which have most impact on the patient’s room interior design; trends in the design of the patient’s room, the stakeholders and their involvement, and the existing and promising design process methods. Introduced from the United States are the Evidence Based Design and the Healing Environment principles. These withhold the principle of the healing aspects surroundings can have on the well-being of patients. Although these principles are promising, they solely look at quantitative research. To design patient’s rooms which meet the stakeholders’ (latent) needs the stakeholders should be included in the design process. If looked at the existing stakeholder involvement in the design process, Dutch hospitals claim to be patient-centered. However, from the interviews with different hospitals dealing with new real estate, patients are only sparsely directly involved in the design process. Again hospitals only look at quantitative research in their design of the patient’s room. To be truly patient-centered one not has to look at the patient, but has to look at the patient’s needs. This is only possible by doing research with the patient. Due to the fact the organization of hospitals is complex and opaque, the process of building hospitals can take years. Because there are multiple stakeholders each having influence and decision power, makes the communication during the design process difficult, resulting not beneficial for the interior design of the patient’s room. To achieve the goal a Design Support is developed to help the interior designer with the design process in order to enhance the communication and therefore the mutual understanding of the stakeholders. The Support allows the interior designer setting up a design process according to a user-centered design method (SPARC). The Support also allows specific subjects to be researched on specific stakeholders. The Support also should increase the involvement of the stakeholders and thereby build up mutual understanding between the stakeholders. In an evaluative research with open interviews the concept of the Support was addressed to different stakeholders to see what they thought of it. Adjustments to the Support still need to be made in order to increase the usability. The Design support enhances the communication and mutual understanding on three different levels. By including the different stakeholders during the design process the stakeholders are forced to think about the others. By implementing and showing the different outcomes in the design, the stakeholders see the other side. By showing the entire process step by step, the stakeholders can see why the different steps need to be done in order to get a proper outcome. Although the concept of the Design Support is promising, the interior designer should do further research and testing in order for the Design Support to work properly. However, with implementing the Design Support in the building processes of hospitals, hopefully hospitals can get truly patient-centered and future hospitals will be a more comfortable place to stay in for both staff and patient.","patient; patient room; design support; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Het gebouw heeft een niet vaak voorkomende route van het gebouw (eerst verticale openbare route omhoog en de entree van het museum op het dak) levert een nieuwe beleving op voor bezoekers aan musea. In musea als Guggenheim museum te New York en het Mercedes Benz museum in Stuttgart, levert de tocht naar boven door de liften geen extra belevenis op voor het museum. Waarbij de openbare route in het havenmuseum een openbare introductie is voor het museum. Zonder de introductie zijn de bezoekers op nog vrijwel geen enkele wijze geïnformeerd of geïntroduceerd over het gebied. De aantrekkingskracht van de naar bovengaande route in het vierkante gevelbeeld zorgt ervoor dat de bezoeker aangetrokken wordt om de openbare route naar boven te pakken. Waarbij de steeds nieuwe indrukken van het gebied de bezoeker stimuleren om de route volledig te volgen. De openbare route die direct delen van het museum laat zien, trekt de bezoekers aan om daarna daadwerkelijk het museum te bezoeken. Het gevelbeeld geeft vanuit de omgeving een duidelijk beeld over het karakter van het gebouw (havenmuseum). Met het ontwerp voor het museum is geprobeerd om de bezoeker van het museum door middel van manipulaties van het daglicht te begeleiden bij een bezoek aan het museum. De werking van het daglicht, ondersteund door kunstverlichting, levert een aangenaam bezoek op waarbij grote contrasten tussen interieur en uitzicht worden verzacht door gebruik te maken van verschillende lichttechnieken. In tegenstelling tot veel musea waarbij geen daglicht als verlichting wordt gebruikt, vanwege de negatieve eigenschappen (warmte, direct zonlicht) van het daglicht, is het (nog) geen standaard basisverlichting geworden voor museale collecties. In dit ontwerp is door de gevelzone het licht behandeld naar de gewenste situatie in het interieur. Uiteindelijk schuilen deze verschillende geveltechnieken achter een gevelbeeld. Waardoor er vanaf buiten een gesloten volume blijft bestaan, maar waar in het interieur een spel van het licht plaatsvindt. Het spel van het licht begint bij de entree van het gebouw, waar het daglicht vanuit het atrium de bezoeker begeleidt naar de verticale openbare route en daarna vervolgd wordt in de museale ruimtes. Het gevelontwerp vormt de integratie tussen de architectuur en de techniek. Waarbij de gevel het licht manipuleert voor de verschillende situaties in het interieur van het museum. Het ontwerp van de gevel, op basis van daglicht, voldoet niet gedurende het gehele jaar. Waardoor de integratie tussen dag- en kunstlicht van belang is om in het interieur een gelijke werking over te houden. De verschillende lichtbewerkingen begeleiden de bezoeker daadwerkelijk door het museum heen, waarbij de bezoeker over steeds nieuwe gedeeltes van de haven geïnformeerd worden. Het gebouw kan een toevoeging gaan vormen als toeristisch trekpleister voor de stad Rotterdam en de ontwikkelingen op het RDM terrein. Daarnaast wordt het havengebied zichtbaar voor de bezoekers van Rotterdam.","havenmuseum","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-10","Architecture","Architecture","","Architectural Engineering","",""

This model can subsequently be used to find the optimal steering system design by using computerized optimization routines, or by developing a steering system that adapts to the driver while driving. Also vehicle stability control systems (VSC) can be improved by driver centered design, providing artificial force cues via the steering wheel that aid in controlling the vehicle. A suitable driver model needs to incorporate a neuromuscular (NMS) structure. The validated model of de Vlugt (2004) is used as a basis. Since this model is identified for isometric conditions only, two main adaptations are needed before this model can be used for driver simulation during more extreme maneuvers. First, the driver’s reflexes are given a moving reference point determined by the desired steering wheel position. Second, the muscle forces needed to generate the desired steering wheel angle are calculated by a so called inverse internal model. This model reflects the driver’s learnt dynamics of his arms and the system to be controlled. The new driver model shows to be capable of steering large angles and simultaneously modeling the physical limitations of the driver. Optimization techniques were used to find the optimal driver model parameters, depending on his driving mood and driving task. The same optimization techniques were used to find the optimal steering ratio, where the optimal ratio showed to changes significantly depending on the mood and task. This indicates there is room for improving steering systems as they currently mainly depend on vehicle velocity.","driver modeling; neuromuscular; steering system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Bruil, I. (mentor)","2010","Ever since quality of life has been introduced in the BBSH, housing corporations invest more and more in housing conditions and the neighbourhood. Housing corporations try to influence the housing conditions and neighbourhood by developing social real estate, as it is they who benefit from a well functioning neighbourhood. This research centralises the community school (brede school) De Waterlelie, a facility in the city of eidschendam-Voorburg, and also an example of social real estate. De aterlelie offers facilities for children as well as adults; for instance a primary school, day-care centre, sports school and adult education. The main question in this research is: Does the community school De Waterlelie generate social and economical value for the neighbourhood the Prinsenhof? The goal of this research is proving that De Waterlelie adds extra value to the Prinsenhof. A distinction has been made between two research directions: social and economical value. The social value has been researched by means of an inquiry amongst local residents, address files from the primary school and day care centre and interviews with the two housing corporations, the municipality and the primary school’s principal. The economical value has been researched by comparing WOZ-values in the neighbourhood the Prinsenhof with reference values. The investments in the Prinsenhof are also important to this research. In the first place, a community school concentrates on increasing children's development chances. Apart from that, community schools (and also De Waterlelie) concentrate more and more on the neighbourhood. The community school can for instance contribute to the social cohesion in the neighbourhood by offering activities to local residents. The social value is researched by looking at the possible effects of De Waterlelie on the local society. An important indicator in this research is the local residents' use of De Waterlelie. Apart from that, the local residents' satisfaction concerning De Waterlelie is important. The goals of De Waterlelie have also been put on trial. The basic assumption of the economical value is that an investment in a certain area can possibly cause an increase in value of the (economical) value of surrounding real estate. Social value In order to reach the research's results, analyses concerning the local residents' use of De Waterlelie have been carried out. Important in this is whether De Waterlelie is a facility for the neighbourhood or for a larger area, whether children as well as adults make use of the facility and which services are used within the facility. Research shows that child care Duimelijntje users come mainly from outside the Prinsenhof. This is opposed to users of primary school De Springplank and playgroup Vlietkinderen; they come mainly from within the Prinsenhof. The primary school and playgroup are visited by the same type of user which makes it possible for these two facilities to work closely together and stimulate a good exchange between them. This is in contrast to child care Duimelijntje. An important concept, and also goal, of De Waterlelie is that the facility is to be used by children as well as adults. The use of the facility by adults seems to coincide with the presence of children in the family and/or their use of the facility. It appears that local residents without children hardly ever use the facility. The urban development plan of the building makes it impossible to just walk past the building. That is why people who have no reason to visit the building, will hardly ever come into contact with the facility. Apart from cooperation between various facilities within De Waterlelie, another important goal is to improve the neighbourhood's social cohesion. Research shows that local residents who visit the facility fairly often (weekly) get to know new people due to this. However, since this group is relatively small, it is likely that the neighbourhood's social cohesion has not or hardly not been improved. A final important theme is local residents' satisfaction concerning De Waterlelie. It is striking to see that users as well as non-users are (very much) satisfied with the facility De Waterlelie. Non-users are satisfied with the facility as they think that De Waterlelie has a positive influence on the neighbourhood. Economical value In recent years much has been invested in the Prinsenhof by the municipality (layout new park, building De Waterlelie) and housing corporations (renovation houses). On average these investments per house total  34,000. Looking at the value development of the Prinsenhof in the period from 2001 to 2005, it is evident that its course is slow compared to the reference values. Circa 2006 the Prinsenhof recovers and connects to the reference values. As there are only relatively small differences between the WOZ-values and reference values, it is likely that the investments of  34,000 per house have not or not yet repaid themselves.","brede school; brede scholen; maatschappelijk vastgoed; economische waarde; maatschappelijke waarde; woningcorporatie; wooncorporaties","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-06","Architecture","Real estate and housing","","Housing","",""

In several industries, RM is already being developed to contribute to an improvement in technology and for the building industry, it could also be worthwhile to explore the possibilities in the field of façade design. The technical performance within the façade industry could potentially be brought to a higher level by implementing the positive properties that the technique can provide. A façade has to integrate a lot of functions for it has to deal with thermal, visual, hygienic and acoustic comfort, provide safety and meet the requirements for aesthetics as well. Looking into further depth to the visual comfort of a façade, shading devices play an important role, because they are dealing with the entering of heat and light in the room. The production method determines the appearance and the properties for the detailing of a façade. When RM is used as a production technique, the design will become different than when contemporary production techniques are used. Geometric freedom, material properties and the fact that the design is independent on production eliminates a lot of boundary conditions for the design process. There will be intermediate steps between the façade produced with current processes, and the fully rapid manufactured facade. During the introduction of the technique, printing shall first be introduced to produce only parts of the façade in a hybrid or a modular approach, applied in the area where the highest profit can be reached, and gradually be scaled up to building size.","facade design; rapid manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Running robots often have their center of mass (CoM) located on the hip. This decouples the pitching and CoMdynamics and therefore allows for simple control schemes. However, by creating an offset between the CoM and the hip, and herewith introducing coupling between the pitching and CoMdynamics, the performance of the running robot might possibly increase. In this simulation study, we calculated the optimal CoMlocation for a running robot with hip actuation. We measured the performance of the system as the largest step-down and push that can be corrected in one or two steps. We found that the largest step-down can be corrected in one step when the CoM is located above the hip. The largest push on the other hand can be corrected when the CoM is located under the hip. For two-steps recovery strategies, placing the CoM exactly on the hip is the worst option out of all possible CoM-locations. In this case, the corresponding disturbance rejection is approximately a factor 10 worse than for the optimal CoM-location. Therefore, we conclude that placing the CoM of the torso on the hip is far from optimal.","running","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor); Coninx, K.M. (mentor)","2010","This thesis clarifies the graduation project for the master program of Integrated Product Design at the University of Technology Delft. It describes the development of an application guide for the Fortimo SLM (Spot Lighting Module). The Fortimo SLM is a light engine, based on LED technology and consists of a LED spot light module and driver combination. Philips Lighting needs an application guide for the Fortimo SLM. This involves a document which describes the functional specifications of the SLM module and driver. Secondly the requirements for the interfaces are defined towards the complete fixture. To demonstrate the feasibility of a fixture with the Fortimo SLM a reference luminaire is designed. Currently an application guide is available for down lighting modules and outdoor modules and drivers. This does not fulfill all the needs of a spot light fixture builder (OEM). Therefore the goal of this thesis is to provide the additional design rules that are necessary for a spot light fixture builder. Part 1: Analysis During the analysis phase, the gap between the design guide of the down lighting module and the requirements that can be expected from a spot light fixture builder are investigated. Therefore the perspective of the OEM is investigated towards their customers. This defines the typical requirements that are necessary for the fixture builder (OEM). This to minimize the risk that design rules outside the technical scope of the OEM Philips relation are overseen. The missing aspect, which has to be researched by the development of concepts, and finally the reference fixture design are: - The optimal conditions for the secondary optics and how a clear light beam can be created; - The different options and restrictions of heat sinking, and how the module can be cooled most efficiently; - The possibilities and limitations towards the usage of track lighting. And how this influences the complete fixture design. Also the major trends that the design of fixture builder will have to deal with are described. During the development of the reference fixture, these trends have to be kept in mind: the light effect, flexibility and sustainability, and how the different concepts influence this. Part 2: Design During the design phase, the design requirements of the track lighting application are clarified. From the general requirements several concepts are developed. This to align with the trends that OEMs have to deal with in the their new fixture portfolio; flexibility, transparency and compact with LED. The three concepts are evaluated and compared. One is chosen to develop into a reference luminaire, based on the following objectives: (1) Provide guidance to prevent luminaire builders to make standard mistakes, (2) Give direction towards the market, (3) Make a practical example of the feasibility of the module The two concepts that fit the goal of the application guide the best are transparency and flexibility. The biggest difference between these concepts is the use of respectively a passive and an active cooled heat sink. Where the application guide is intended for direct use, active cooling is preferred. This type of cooling does also fit the developments of the complementary partners and will therefore be the best fit to the market. On the other hand, passive cooling scores better related to sustainability. It is recommended to keep the possibilities of passive cooling in mind and communicate this towards the complementary partners, when the LEDs are increased in performance. Finally, the concept “flexibility” is selected to develop into a reference luminaire. Part 3: Application guide The analysis and the product development has generated several insights, regarding the usage of the Fortimo SLM. This information is used to write an build-in guide for the new application.","LED; spot light module","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-04-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The ultimate goal was to improve child education with the aid of computers. A structured experiment was designed and performed to empirically acquire measurements of collaboration, usability, and learning. The children did a pointing, text-entry and drawing task using both input methods. The task itself was based on recognizing emotions in photographs of faces. Self-report methods were used to inquire preference, ease-of-use, enjoyment, and effectiveness. Automatic logging was done to obtain performance data in terms of task scores and interaction duration. Video recordings were annotated to get behavioral information of arousal, valence, cooperation, and attention. Within-subjects significance tests were used to analyze the collected data for usability and collaboration differences. Between-subjects significance tests were applied to study differences in learning. The traditional input devices were more effective, but the stylus yielded higher satisfaction. Efficiency depended on the location and the input task. Location further also affected the intensity of the other usability findings. Based on the results, a theory was posed that the stylus brings forth a more playful attitude, compared to a more formal stance with traditional input devices. No difference between the stylus and traditional devices was found with respect to learning or collaboration. With the findings, organizations that consider using stylus input for children in educational settings may better understand the implications of their decision. The primary decision revolves around the relative importance of effectiveness and satisfaction.","Stylus; keyboard; mouse; Brazil; Netherlands; collaboration; usability; learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction","","Media & Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stappers, P.J. (mentor)","2010","This report presents an awareness display for supporting family carers of independently living seniors. The focus was on providing awareness and promoting peace of mind. It was developed as part of a graduation project. In a literature research, family care, context awareness systems and state of the art were studied. User research was conducted to further explore the user context and the awareness needs of the family carers. The results of the literature research and user research were used to design a concept of the Family Care Book. In a field study, the final design was tested with end-users, in order to determine if the Family Care Book is able to support the family carer’s awareness and provide peace of mind. The increase of senior citizens will put pressure on the professional care system since the number of people providing the care is expected to stay the same. Senior citizens often prefer to live independently in a familiar setting. The trend of seniors living independently is recognized and supported by the government. Senior citizens living on their own can help lower the pressure on the care system. Aging often makes it harder for senior citizens to complete normal daily activities. Therefore it is very important for an independently living senior citizen in the need of a support to have a good supporting net. The family carers, the friends and family, often play an important role especially when a support starts to be needed. Family carers need to be aware of the senior citizens situation in order to provide care in the right way and pick up on changes in the situation. It often is difficult for family carers to be aware which causes them to worry about the senior. Often a balance needs to be found between the senior citizen’s desire to live independently in a familiar setting versus the need for a safe living situation. Awareness systems are considered a promising means to support independently living seniors and their caregivers. Currently there are remote monitoring products to capture everyday routines. However acceptance issues arise since the current options do not fit the need and pose a tension between privacy and independence. The results of the literature research confirmed context awareness systems as a promising means to support independently living seniors and their caregivers. The challenge is thus to design a device that incorporates contextawareness technology and fits the need of the family carer and is accepted by both the family carer and the senior. Literature suggested that when seniors notice the benefits of a technology, they are more likely to accept this technology. In an operational research conducted among 8 target users, the needs and wishes of this group were examined. This research provided insight into the lives and worries of the family carers. The research consisted of a contextmapping study and semi-structured interviews. The information need as described by literature and the user research are consistent. The user research confirmed that worries can cover all levels of human needs identified by Maslow. However the awareness displays developed in previous researches never provided awareness of all 5 levels of human needs. Often only the bottom two needs are monitored. The contextmapping study shows awareness is also wanted on all levels of human needs. The exact information can cover all human needs. Based on the literature research, research with the family carers, the awareness needed of the seniors situation to promote peace of mind and how to present the information was determined. The awareness needs included a combination of monitoring sensor data and communication. This combination provides a broader look on the situation and includes the senior in the system. Based on the awareness needs and findings from the user research and related work a final design was developed. The final design is named the Family Care Book. A journal metaphor is used to convey the information to the user. The interaction is based on the personal interest social intimates have for each other and the worries connected to an aging senior. The Family care book does not only tell the family carer when things are going wrong, but also shows when things are going right. The Family Care Book gives an overview of the senior citizens day. Sensors are used to provide a view on the senior’s day and indicate when it is going considerably different from normal. Communication through messages is used to share experiences, messages and feelings. In order to verify if the application reached its goal, a prototype was built and tested. The prototype was developed to enable the basic functionalities needed to test if the Family Care Book could help provide awareness and support peace of mind. A field test was conducted with two couples consisting of a family carer and the independently living senior they cared for. The family carer was given an iPhone and the senior had a touch screen in her home with the Family Care Book application. Unfortunately the validation of the test results is limited. In the first test the participants close living distance made the need for awareness support very low. During the second test many problems occurred with conveying the sensor information. The two participant couples involved in the field test confirmed the possible usefulness of the concept. - the Family Care Book is appreciated by the current family carers - the Family Care Book contributes to the family carer’s awareness - the Family Care Book will strengthen peace of mind. At the same time it is important to keep in mind that it has little value when there is a small distance between the carer and the carer receiver. Secondly basic computer skills are needed to be capable of using the Family Care Book. A larger-scale user study with a better functioning prototype is needed in order to collect significant results, these preliminary findings do suggest that the approach taken in terms of a portable awareness display which allows sharing practical information with social communication seems promising.","design; awareness systems; family care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","ID/DCC","","Design for Interaction","",""

Om tot nieuwe betekenissen te komen zullen we geprivatiseerde ruimtes zoals parkeergarages anders moeten benaderen. Parkeergarages behoren meestal niet tot de openbare ruimte. Hier ligt een kans om juist deze private toegangsgebieden open te stellen, om tot nieuwe uitgangspunten komen. Ik wil laten zien dat door middel van gecomprimeerd parkeren er een extra programma gecreëerd kan worden om tot een levendige/stedelijke parkeergarage te komen. Die gezien mag worden in de openbare ruimte van de stad. Met als vraagstelling: Hoe kunnen we een parkeergarage ontwerpen die niet als autonoom object functioneert, maar als katalysator? Waarbij onder katalysator wordt verstaan; een stedelijke levendigheid, met stimulans tot sociale veiligheid. Het is een ontwerp wat een netwerk neerlegt voor zowel de infrastructuur als voor de ontmoetingsplek. Het kan op de verschillende niveaus ervaren worden als een publiek domein. Het heeft als essentie om openbare ruimte terug te geven aan de stad en aan de mens als voetganger. Als kwaliteit het verschillende toelaatbare schalen heeft zoals mobiliteit, landschap en stedelijkheid. Het verweven ligt in het sociale netwerk als een theater ervaring zien en gezien worden. Juist het zien en gezien worden als tussenschakel werkt tussen de verschillende schalen; Waar is het ontwerp generiek en waar specifiek voor Utrecht. De tunnel en het systeem zijn generiek en kunnen worden toegepast één of twee keer per binnenstad. Per binnenstad zal de maat van schaal anders zijn, toespitst op de vraag of beschikbaar oppervlak. De vlonderstructuur is cultuur historisch gezien gekozen, specifiek voor de stad Utrecht zelf. Tot slot is een stedelijke ontwikkeling in het voorstel het uitgangspunt geweest, dat zich verhoudt tot de historische stad en hierdoor zijn verankerde identiteit behoud. Parkeren hoeft geen norm te zijn waar we ons aan dienen te houden, het kan mogelijkheden bieden tot perspectief. De interpretaties van het verleden zoals, sociaal en politiek kunnen onderbouwd worden in de toekomst. Het heeft een discussie los gemaakt waarin een andere verdeling van m² kan worden opgezet. Het is efficiënt door de boxen en het dubbelgebruik van de tunnels door auto’s en voetgangers. De kwaliteit is dat mobiliteit, architectuur en stedenbouw tot een diepe mall tot een ruimtelijk opzet komen. En de bovenliggende openbare ruimte als kwaliteit terug geeft aan de stad.","Herontwikkeling & ruimtelijke kwaliteit","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-04-19","Architecture","Architecture","","Explore-lab","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2010","This master thesis started with the assignment to redesign a telepresence software in order to make it suitable for an online exhibition visit. This assignment was formulated by the art collective Cybercity Ruhr, who planned two exhibitions for the second half of 2010. During these exhibitions the teenagers’ view on the future of cities is shown by means of scale models (1/50). These scale models are created during workshops the art collective organized at high schools in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands. By controlling video robots, positioned between the scale models, local and online visitors can enjoy a ‘pedestrian view’ of the scale models. This explains why the exhibitions are called The Third Eye. Shortly after the start of the project it became clear that new software should be developed in order to meet the wishes of the art collective. Next to that this project strives for an enjoying experience, which is in line with the approach of the art collective. These two adjustments transformed the original assignment to the following project goal: To develop an enjoying online exhibition experience for an exhibition of scale models, with as core function controlling a video robot through the exhibition. In order to create a more profound understanding of the fields in which the project goal was rooted, a literature study on enjoyment, way finding, augmented reality, regular museum visits and information transfer was preformed. Next to that the fields of exploration vehicles and online exhibitions were explored. Findings derived from this desktop research are presented in the analysis and translated into points of attention for further concept development. In order to evoke an enjoying experience the software should: Provide social opportunities Provide challenges Provide surprises Please the senses However literature could not provide all the desired understanding needed for a suitable concept development. Rich user insights were needed to know if the gathered points of attention could also be applied on an online exhibition experience. Especially for the control of the video robot it would be hard to make decisions only based on literature, since this is a currently non-existing application. During a contextual research the experience of controlling a video robot in an unknown physical environment from a remote location was investigated. The main focus of these researches was to discover what makes the control of a remote controlled video robot enjoyable. In order to evoke an enjoying experience the online exhibition should: Explain the exhibition intentions Provide goals Be surprising Support sharing experiences Give visitors the chance to be in control With all these insights the concept development was started. To prevent the generation of a haphazard collection of features, personas were used. Each persona represented a visitor group of the Third Eye exhibition. By doing so five personas were created: Tim the Teen, Patty the Parent, Spencer the Spontaneous, Arthur the Art lover and Uli the Urbanist. For each persona a concept was developed and afterwards tested with a person from the corresponding visitor group. Taken into account the feedback from the personas and the points of attention gathered in the literature study and contextual research the first version of the Online Exhibition Experience was born. During this fusion the feedback of Tim the Teen was considered most valuable, since teenagers are the biggest visitor group. The online exhibition experience 1.0 consists of three elements: Robot Driver, here visitors can control a video robot Catalog, here visitors can browse through the collection Short Movies, here visitors can watch robot-trips made by other visitors. Next to driving a video robot the other unique features of the online exhibition are the ‘tag cloud’, by which visitors can create a goal, and ‘sharing and commenting’ which visitors provides social opportunities. The Online Exhibition Experience 1.0 was tested in two situations: (1) in a test setup at the office and (2) during a small Cybercity exhibition. In order to makes these tests valuable, a working prototype of the Robot Driver was developed. The goal of these tests was to evaluate the Online Exhibition Experience 1.0 in order to generate requirements for version 2.0. With the outcomes of the user tests version 2.0 was developed (see picture below). This report concludes with recommendations regarding further development of the Online Exhibition Experience and the development of the exhibition platform and video robots.","user interface; telepresence; museums","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Master Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Steenhuisen, B. (mentor); Trott, P. (mentor)","2010","Techno-starters are seen as value creators of the economy, but they are struggling to survive and 90% quits within 10 years. Due to this high failure rate effort is put towards business planning, but the importance of improvisation is not yet widely acknowledged. This research investigated the role of improvisation in start-ups and how improvisation could contribute to the success of techno-starters by comparing improvisation to business planning in a case-study and literature. Currently limited literature is available for techno-starters on improvisation. This is a critical gap, because improvisation can help techno-starters to maintain flexible and survive when resources are scarce. According to current literature business planning has several positive effects, but it has difficulties dealing with changes that occur in start-ups. As markets become more and more dynamic alternatives for business planning are required. Improvisation merges decision and execution and therefore is opposing business planning where there is a time gap between the decision and execution. Business planning and improvisation are both to be used in a company as for example large goals are planned in advance and daily activities are improvised. The case study investigated four techno-starters from the Yes!Delft incubator by conducting longitudinal interviews (as main collection method), a questionnaire and observations. The reliability and validity was secured by using propositions, multiple collection methods and multiple cases. The results were discussed per case (for sketching the background) and per proposition (for analyzing the results). Business planning should be utilized to set a vision and the goals of the company, while improvisation will help to take advantageous of opportunities with a short reaction time. The balance between the usage of both concepts is dependent on a variety of interrelated factors like investment and market dynamic. The influence of these factors is also different for techno-starters then the factors stated in the literature for large companies. With the findings of this research the framework in Figure 1 was developed. This framework enables to position a techno-starter on the continuum between improvisation and business planning (y-axis). The importance of a decision (vision vs. screw position) has a large influence on whether to plan or improvise (x-axis). The framework helps the techno-starter to understand their improvisational and planning behavior. This will help them to optimize their behavior and adjust their behavior when necessary (e.g. changing environment). Although research of improvisation for techno-starters is in an early stage, it is expected to be valuable. All techno-starters agreed on the importance of improvisation for entrepreneurs. Future research should focus on the influencing factors to improve the value of the provided framework.","improvisation; techno-starter; business planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Department of Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","","",""

Additionally research on thermoplastic glass fibre composites shows promising results, concerning material properties as well as manufacturing and assembly processes, for the application of thermoplastic composites in a rib-spar-skin design of a turbine blade. Thermoplastics are not compatible with traditional core materials of sandwich constructions. A monolithic design on the other hand mixes very well with capabilities of thermoplastic technology, such as rubber forming and welding, and has a potential in cost and weight reduction. This thesis is focused on the design of a hat-stiffened panel as an alternative for a conventional sandwich structure, which is used as a skin in modern wind turbine blades. Although thermoset glass fibre composites are used in this thesis the research is aimed at development of thermoplastic wind turbine blades. A sandwich panel was isolated from a turbine blade design in order to be used as a reference for the design of a hat-stiffened panel. The sandwich panel has been analyzed on failure modes due to longitudinal compression and a reference compression load was established. Several methods were used to develop an optimization methodology for the design of a mass-efficient hat-stiffened panel. In order to validate the theory, a scaled version of the designed hat-stiffened panel was constructed in order to be used in experiments. Furthermore a test rig was designed to provide simply supported boundary conditions during the experiments.

(mentor)","2010","This is a brief summary of a research which has been commissioned by the Royal Dutch Embassy in Rome in collaboration with the Technical University in Delft about the opportunities for designers from the Netherlands on the Italian design market. This research is conducted in 4 sectors in which Italy has an important position: The automotive sector, the yacht sector, the furniture sector and the household appliances sector. In order to find the opportunities and threats for designers from the Netherlands, a theoretical framework is constructed. The theory is the basis of 26 interviews with leading Italian and Dutch designers or design critics. The result of the research is a list of recommendations for designers from the Netherlands and the Dutch government, concerning design activities and perspectives on the design market in Italy. 2. Theoretical framework 2.1 Design in New Product Development Design is more and more recognized by companies as a differentiating factor. Especially in hard economic times companies are looking for new strategic differentiators. Previous research indicates that design has a positive effect on companies’ performance. (Gemser and Leenders, 2001) Innovative companies have a higher percentage of international employees. (Dell’Era and Verganti, 2009) This implies opportunities for designers from the Netherlands with a desire to enter the Italian design market. The biggest chances for them can be found in high tech and design minded companies. (Ravasi, Racotti en Stigliani, 2008) Some Italian companies use a different approach to innovation than other companies. The strategy they use is called Design Driven Innovation. (Verganti, 2009) 2.2 Innovation strategy Design driven innovation According to the Design driven innovation theory (Verganti, 2009), product innovation can follow from 3 types of information: Technology, user needs or product language. When the innovation is based on a technology it is called technology push. When it is based on user needs it is called market pull. When the innovation is based on the product language it is called design push. A user gives meaning to a product. This meaning is transferred from the product to the user by product language. The meaning is not just based on aesthetics of the product. It is also based on functional and symbolic or emotional values. Design driven innovation is innovation on the level of product language and it based on the translation of socio-cultural knowledge. 2.3 Typology Traditionally there is a dichotomy in the design world. There is a group of artistic designers and a group of market oriented designers. The difference between these two is visible in the end product as well as their approach to design. The most important differences are listed in table 1. Artistic designer Market oriented designer Niche products Mass products Artistic products Practical products Less market research More market research Design centered User centered Design Academy Eindhoven Technical University Delft 3. Methodology This research is divided in a qualitative and a quantitative part. The quantitative part contains figures about the 4 sectors, in Italy. For the qualitative part of the research 26 interviews are performed; 17 face-to-face interviews, 7 interviews by telephone and 2 interviews by mail. These interviews are the basis of the answers to the research questions and the verification of pre-assumptions. 4. Recommendations Based on the interviews the following recommendations for the Dutch Government and designers from the Netherlands are formulated. 4.1 Government 1. Focus promotion of the design sector in the Netherlands on the background of design from the Netherlands instead of focusing on the end products or on a few important designers which are connected to the Dutch Design label. 2. Focus the attention of design promotion in Italy on Milan and especially during the Milano Design Week. This is by far the most important moment in Italy to promote design products. This week is dedicated to the interior and household appliances sector. 3. The production clusters in Italy are very interesting to designers from the Netherlands for producing prototypes. This concerns designers who have their own production. (Mostly artistic designers) It is also interesting for Dutch production companies. 4. Improve the connections between the Italian and the Dutch parties in the design world. This could be done by supporting networking activities on fairs and supporting trade missions. 5. Focus the attention of the activities and the promotion of the Dutch design sector on the relevant industrial clusters. These clusters are most interesting for organizing activities. 6. Develop special programs specifically for the support of the design sector from the Netherlands in Italy. Such a program should be focusing on interior design and yacht design because these two sectors are best accessible and promising. The program should focus on the cooperation between Italian clusters and designers from the Netherlands and on Milan preferably during the Salone del Mobile. 4.2 Recommendations for designers 1. Study contextual design methods. In this way you can find a better connection to the Italian way of dealing with design problems. The Vision in Product Design (Loyd Hekkert & van Dijk 2006) or the Design driven innovation strategy (Verganti 2009) are interesting theories to look at. 2. Be sure to integrate in the Italian culture. Not only the language but also the way of doing business and organizing and implementing projects is crucial for the chances of success. 3. Italy has very important industrial clusters in which very high quality products can be produced. This is a very interesting possibility to produce prototypes. It is less interesting to larger scale production quantities because labor costs are relatively high. 4. It is important to present yourself in the right way in Italy. Make a strategic choice of presenting yourself as an architect, a designer or an engineer.","Italy; design; strategy","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-04-01","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""
