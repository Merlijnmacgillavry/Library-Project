Cyclotron production of such radiometals using liquid targets solve critical impurity problems seen with current conventional production methods. Purification employing liquid-liquid extraction in microfluidic environments has recently been investigated. Fluid behaviour in microfluidic environments are deeply laminar, and one of the dominant factors in mass transfer in such environments is diffusion. For optimal design, numerical models are being developed to theoretically describe mass transfer in a microfluidic environment. To achieve this, diffusion coefficients of radiometals in their respective liquid target solutions need to be known. Exploiting the laminar flow properties in microfluidics, microfluidic devices have been employed in determining diffusion coefficients. This study presents a simplified 2D theoretical description of mass transfer in single phase flows in microfluidic channels. It has been attempted to verify the proposed model by determining the diffusion coefficient with methylene blue in an aqueous solution for direct comparison with literature. The method was tested for microfluidic devices of varying geometries, different flow rates and alternative setups, and yielded overestimations of a factor of two regarding literature. Consistently finding this overestimation, along with the discovery of several small mistakes in work presented in literature, does not render the method inaccurate. Further research in what range microfluidic devices remain an appropriate tool for determining diffusion coefficients is required. Diffusion coefficients for 68Ga in target solutions of varying concentrations of zinc nitrate, dissolved in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations of nitric acid were investigated. The influence on concentration of nitric acid was minimal, while the diffusion coefficient was found to be inversely proportional to the viscosity of the target solution, in correspondence with the general behaviour of several empirical correlation relations for finding the diffusion coefficient.","radiometals; microfluidic; Diffusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, inconsistencies in electroencephalography processing for extraction of human intent lead to contradictory results in SMR modulation abilities. In this report, a paradigm is suggested in which people are asked to navigate a virtual cursor to a target with their SMR activity. Once they reach adequate control, mechanical perturbations are applied to their wrist to measure reflex responses. This report summarizes the development and validation of the protocol. Five participants took part in the experiment, four of which successfully acquired control over their SMR. Furthermore, results from one subject suggest that with sufficient modulation of the SMR, changes can be seen in the strength of the stretch reflex.

To mitigate their plight, systems that warn drivers and pedestrians in case of a possible collision have been developed. Among systems that focus on the pedestrian's perspective, existing concepts are capable of predicting collisions but lack elements that monitor the visual attention of pedestrians. We address this gap by developing a gaze-based pedestrian warning system based on the Tobii Pro Glasses 2, a head-mounted eye-tracker. The system consists of: (1) a custom trained fast neural network (YOLO v4) on the KITTI object detection dataset that processes the video feed of the eye-tracker to detect approaching vehicles and (2) a module that uses the pedestrian's gaze to identify whether their attention falls on the closest moving vehicle that is approaching the pedestrian, both in real-time. If the pedestrian does not look at the approaching vehicle, they are given an auditory alert that warns them of a possible collision. In a pilot study conducted on a busy road in an urban environment, the system was evaluated under different pedestrian walking speeds and gaze behaviours to test the algorithm's robustness. The pilot study revealed that our system alerted the inattentive pedestrian with an accuracy of 67%. The mean vehicle detection accuracy and a mean moving vehicle identification accuracy from the pilot were 93% and 60%, respectively, a promising result given the use of only a mono camera. Despite the use of computer vision techniques, the system worked at an inference speed of 50 FPS due to the multi-processing capabilities of our algorithm. Our efforts are a first step in developing pedestrian warning systems based on eye-tracking technology to improve road safety in the future.

(graduation committee); Blok, K. (mentor); de Jong, W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Following the Paris Agreement of 2015, Indonesia aims to reduce emissions by 29% by 2030, compared to the business as usual scenario. In Indonesia it is expected that between 2015 and 2030 the electricity demand could triple and the total energy demand could increase by 80%. Bioenergy would account for more than half of all renewable energy in 2030 in Indonesia. However, the expansion of energy crops contributes to negative effects like deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and competition with food production. An other problem Indonesia currently deals with is the large amount of degraded land. A solution to these problems would be to cultivate biomass on degraded land. Bamboo can be used as a biomass feedstock, as it meets all selection requirements to be produced on degraded land. This thesis report quantifies the extent and finds the location of degraded land in Indonesia. Also, the technical and economic potential of bamboo cultivation on the degraded land locations is assessed. The research question that will be answered is: how much degraded land would be needed to cover Indonesia‚Äôs electricity demand by 2030, when using bamboo as a biomass feedstock, and how likely is this land available? This research question is answered by first doing a geographic information system (GIS) analysis. Through the QGIS software, the degraded land locations in Indonesia which are suitable for bamboo plantations can be found. This is done by layering multiple datasets on top of each other in four steps. Next, the technoeconomic potential analysis is done by calculating how much degraded land would be needed to cover a certain percentage of Indonesia‚Äôs electricity demand by 2030, and calculating the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of different biomass conversion technologies. The results show that between 0.21% and 49.9% of Indonesia‚Äôs total land area can be considered degraded according to different scenarios. The suitable area for bamboo plantations lays between the 0.01% and the 13% of Indonesia‚Äôs total land area. Using these areas the potential electricity that can be reached lays between the 0.4732 TWh for gasification, 0.3533 TWh for combustion, 0.3506 TWh for anaerobic digestion, and 0.1266 TWh for pyrolysis. The area needed to cover 25% of Indonesia‚Äôs electricity demand by 2030 ranges from 2.05.6% of Indonesia‚Äôs total land cover when using different conversion technologies. For 100% electricity demand this area increases to the range of 8.122.4% of Indonesia‚Äôs total land cover. The LCOE goes from 13 US$ct./kWh for gasification, to 16 US$ct./kWh for combustion, 22 US$ct./kWh for anaerobic digestion, and finally to 45 US$ct./kWh for pyrolysis. The result show that when using the least strict degraded land scenarios, it would be possible to cover a significant amount of Indonesia‚Äôs electricity demand. However, it is not likely that these scenarios will be applied. The definition of degraded land, still is not completely clear, and extensive field research needs to be done to validate the degraded land results. This research shows that bamboo cultivation on degraded land for electricity generation in Indonesia might not be applicable to generate large amounts of electricity. Nevertheless, it can be applied on smaller scales and it is a step in the right direction of Indonesia‚Äôs energy transition. Finally, some recommendations for future research can be made. First of all, uncertainty exists about the datasets used to assess the extent of degraded land in Indonesia. It is recommended that the datasets are validated through field research. Furthermore, in this research an assumption for the yield of bamboo is made, which can be tested against the actual yield of a bamboo plantation on degraded land in Indonesia. Also, socioeconomic and environmental effects of bamboo plantations are not considered, which provides the opportunity to address these in further research. Finally, other end uses like biofuel, other conversion technologies like cofiring, and pretreatment technologies to enhance the conversion efficiency can be evaluated in more detail in future research.","Sustainable Energy Technologies; Degraded land; Electricity generation; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

To determine the optimal performance and energy management required with such novel powertrain configurations, a knowledge-based aircraft and powertrain performance model is developed. The model is then used to set up an optimal control problem, which is transcribed to a non-linear programming problem using global orthogonal Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation for single phase problems, and Hermite-Simpson local collocation for multiphase problems. The solution to the control problem allows identification of the best control strategies and energy management strategies. A case study is performed on the HY4 hybrid fuel cell aircraft and the hybrid electric Pipistrel Panthera. Solutions show that for best fuel economy, flying at a minimum drag airspeed, and keeping a constant power setting, proved more important than the choice of altitude. This was more noticeable for the HY4, with its relatively low power available and good aerodynamic properties following from its glider-based airframe. <br/>The Fuel-optimal energy management strategies proved identical for both aircraft investigated. Batteries are used to provide a power boost during takeoff, after which batteries are discharged gradually throughout the remainder of the flight to maximize discharge efficiency. The engine or fuel cell are kept at approximately constant cruise power settings throughout the flight. The Panthera showed<br/>consistent flight profiles with increasing range. For the HY4, however, achieved airspeeds reduced with increasing range, and additional measures were required to force a climb to non-zero altitudes due to its under-powered nature. The fuel-optimal trajectories offered an average of 10-15% of possible fuel<br/>savings, depending mostly on the size of the onboard batteries. Fuel savings increased significantly at low ranges300km, where the contributions of the batteries have more impact.<br/>Comparing different transcription methods and problem setups, it was concluded that global orthogonal, or pseudo-spectral, methods like Legendre-gauss-Radau collocation are not only faster, but also more consistent compared to simpler direct collocation methods. However, if the problem complexity increases and the performance limits of the aircraft are pushed, switching to a simpler method like Hermite-Simpson collocation reduced the time required to find a solution, with negligible differences in the resulting trajectories. Opting for a multiphase problem set-up, essentially splitting the problem in a series of individual subproblems, appeared less advantageous. While offering more control over the trajectories, time required to find solutions increased drastically, and offered no additional insight into the best energy management strategies.<br","Hybrid aircraft; Fuel cell; Hydrogen; Optimal control; Trajectory optimization; Direct collocation; Transcription; Pseudo-spectral collocation; orthogonal collocation; Performance model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","MAHEPA",""

Among these requirements, the construction industry plays a vital role, as it accounts for the consumption of about 50% of the total raw materials. In<br/>line with its targets of 100% recycling by 2050, the industry in Europe, and particularly in the Netherlands is shifting towards the use of circular and sustainable construction products. This thesis investigates into both these aspects: Circularity by addressing the requirements for demountable structural elements, thus providing scope for reusing, and Sustainability by addressing the impact of substituting concrete and steel with timber products.<br/><br/>Structural timber products obtained from sustainable forestry are considered as eco-friendly construction products. The benefits are two-fold: First of all, it is produced or grown naturally, and thus avoids the emission of harmful gases during production. Second, growing timber products helps in CO2 storage for the duration of the technical service life of the product. Thus, increasing the market share of timber products in the construction industry can play a huge and decisive role to achieve the targets of sustainability.<br/><br/>The focus of this thesis is on steel-timber floor systems i.e., a floor system with timber slabs supported by steel beams. There are many timber products available that can be used as slabs, as a substitute to hollow core slabs and steel-concrete composite slabs, which are the conventional solutions for floor systems in the Netherlands (the former more than the latter). Owing to the disadvantage of timber in stiffness, coupled with the effects of creep, steel beams are considered for traversing larger spans.<br/><br/>From the plethora of steel and timber products that can be coupled together to form a floor system, the best solution is obtained with the help of a Multi Criteria Analysis. This is done by scoring the different floor systems on the aspects of utility, circularity and sustainability. The obtained solution is a conventional non-integrated floor system with Lignatur surface elements as the slab, supported by steel I beams. Lignatur elements are box-shaped slabs that can span over large<br/>distances typically required for office use. Being made of sawn timber, it boasts the advantage of being more sustainable than other timber products made of cross laminated timber and laminated veneer lumber. I beams were found to perform better than other steel beams, posing as more accessible for demounting, over the other beams.<br/><br/>With the help of a case study, the benefits of the chosen steel-timber floor system were evaluated and compared against the hollow core slabs and steel-concrete composite slabs. Owing to the lightweight nature of timber, the chosen floor system was approximately 45% lighter than hollow core slabs, and 25% lighter than composite slabs. They were comparable in terms of floor height,<br/>to the composite slabs. <br/><br/>The main benefit was the fact that the use of concrete and/or steel could be substituted with the use of timber slabs, and the supporting steel frame could be lighter owing to the lightweight nature of timber. A life cycle analysis was done to compare the different floor systems. Due to the use of sustainably produced timber, the steel-timber floor system had the least environment impact. Considering the effects of carbon storage meant that the total environmental footprint of the floor system could be negative. On further analysis, by excluding the benefit of carbon storage, the steel-timber floor system was still found to have the least impact (39% lesser than hollow core slabs, 31% lesser than steel-concrete composite slabs).<br/><br/>Another aspect that was investigated in this thesis was whether the consideration of composite action (similar to that in steel-concrete) could lead to any benefits i.e., composite action between the timber slab and the supporting steel beam. Based on the calculations in the case study, it was concluded that there were no such benefits i.e., the reduction in size of the steel beams was not<br/>enough to justify the use of added shear connectors. <br/><br/>Another limitation of timber was found to be its lack of reusability. Being a biomaterial, timber is associated with a large reduction in strength for each reuse (although this reduction cannot be quantified using the present state of the art). Other materials such as steel and concrete do not experience this strength loss, and thus assume to have better performance than timber regarding this aspect.<br/><br/>The main barrier for implementing a steel-timber floor system would be in terms of costs. Though not explicitly investigated into in this thesis, it is expected to be more than that for its conventional counterparts. Currently, hollow core slabs are the most widely used, in the Netherlands, which is mainly owed to its low costs. Thus, the circulation of a product is closely related to its costs in the<br/>market. By showing light on the benefits of the steel-timber floor system, it is expected that the results of this thesis will help the industry shift to the more responsible choice, in the near future. Wider circulation of steel-timber floors can help in reducing its costs, thus making it more desirable.","demountable construction; Composite action; Life Cycle Analysis; Floor system; steel-timber; Circulair economy; Sustainable construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

Elastic scaling allows applications to add or remove computing resources based on the load experienced by the application. When the load is high more resources are provisioned enabling the application to keep up with the load. When the load is low resources are removed ensuring that no resources are sitting idle. When implemented correctly elastic scaling allows applications to use fewer resources while maintaining application performance. One type of application that can benefit greatly from elastic scaling is a distributed stream processing application. Distributed stream processing applications are suited well for elastic scaling because the data coming through the data stream can be dynamic. This dynamic data stream makes it difficult to provision the right amount of computing power. One way to solve this problem is by using an auto-scaler that elastically scales the stream processing application. In this thesis, we compare different auto-scaling techniques for the distributed stream processing application Apache Flink. We implement a modern version of DS2 using metrics native to Apache Flink.

This thesis provides an account of the evolution of dissolved concentration in the vicinity of the electrode surface for alkaline water electrolysis for the bubble size, the electrode height, the dissolved gas uptake by bubbles, and the bubble generation at the electrode surface. Included are an analytical and numerical model that not often include local electrokinetic effects coupled with a gas-liquid flow model. As is commonly found for experimental data on dissolved hydrogen and oxygen, the dissolved species is either an average concentration measured relatively far from the electrode surface or an average concentration at the electrode surface without any local effect of the electrode kinetics. In this thesis an agreement is found for the analytical derived natural convection up to an height of 0.01 [m] with the numerical model. The fraction of dissolved hydrogen and oxygen taken up by the gas bubbles is enhanced for smaller bubbles, a high frequency of bubbles generated, and an increased mass transfer of dissolved gas at the electrode. Moreover, a clear difference is found for the dissolved hydrogen and oxygen evolution near the electrode for horizontal and vertical electrodes. Horizontal electrodes have more dissolved gas at the electrodes, likely due to the dissolved gas not being able to transfer to the gas bubbles as easily for vertical electrodes. Also, for both vertical and horizontal electrodes the dissolved gas concentration flattens for increased current density, likely due to homogeneous nucleation. For an increasing electrode height a lowering of the dissolved gas was observed, associated with an increased dissolved gas uptake by the bubbles. Most of these local effects are able to be modelled using an analytical and numerically combined model. These simulations greatly improve the understanding of dissolved hydrogen and oxygen evolution in the vicinity of electrodes.","alkaline electrolysis; numerical modeling; Dissolved gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-30","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Jongbloed, B.C.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Research and development of thermoplastic composites has been ever increasing owing to the advantages brought by it over conventional materials such as metals and thermoset composites. Higher processing rates, automation, the possibility to recycle, weldability and better mechanical and chemical properties are some of them. Fusion bonding of TPCs that involves application of heat and pressure at the localised bonding area promises faster assembly times and weight reduction and is thus attractive to the aerospace industry. When comparing different welding techniques, ultrasonic welding has the lowest welding times and energy consumption and also overcomes certain challenges that come with the other techniques. The ultrasonic welding process has been a part of the plastic industry for decades, and with time, the research has also shown promising results in welding advanced thermoplastic composites. Heat generation in this mechanical/frictional welding technique occurs due to surface friction and viscoelastic heating caused due to high frequency and low amplitude vibrations. The process creates quality welds in seconds and can be controlled in-situ, ensuring robustness and repeatability. Scaling up the static process to a continuous process enables continuous sealed welds having a more uniform distribution of load and higher load-carrying capability. However, the continuous process brings challenges. The state of the art continuous ultrasonic welding (CUW) equipment at TU Delft has demonstrated quality welds for CF/PPS fabric laminates. However, problems like excessive through the thickness heating (TTH) and deconsolidation of welds need to be understood and overcome.<br/><br/>As the industry moves toward welding larger and more complex composites structures such as stringers, frames and skin joints, the CUW process becomes more attractive. The primary thermoplastic structures would involve the use of unidirectional materials. The material that has been proposed for the future structures is the Carbon fiber/ Low Melt - PolyArylEtherKetone composite. LM-PAEK polymer exhibits comparable properties to the other advanced thermoplastic materials like PEEK and PEKK but has a lower processing temperature enabling faster processing. To the author's knowledge, no literature is currently available related to CUW of this material. It was believed that when welding UD / LM-PAEK, the problem of excessive through the thickness heating might be present, leading to fibre and polymer squeeze-out and porosity in the adherends and the need for longer consolidation time. Therefore, this research was focused on investigating the extent of TTH in the ultrasonic welding of this UD material and the solutions to mitigate the effects of TTH on the welds. Static and continuous welding experiments were conducted, and temperature readings were obtained from the adherends and the interface. Along with this, different characterisation techniques such as lap shear tests, fractography and cross-sectional microscopy were used to observe the effects of TTH.<br/><br/>CUW showed overall higher TTH. It was observed that changing the fibre architecture from fabric to UD exacerbates the effects of excessive TTH in the adherends. Also, the change in the boundary conditions from that of a static weld to that of a spot or a continuous weld brings in the differences in the viscoelastic bulk heat generation in the top adherend. The cause of this difference is yet to be understood. Changing the process parameters and shape of the sonotrode helped in mitigating the overall TTH in the CUW. The use of a round sonotrode helped in reducing the preheating during welding and the lower welding speeds used, brought the advantage of consolidating the welds for longer times. In conclusion, it was found that changes in the welding and consolidation parameters, and the equipment, can help mitigate the effects of excessive TTH on the adherends. Overcoming the problem of excessive TTH is one of the first steps toward enabling CUW of UD/LM-PAEK composites for future applications.","Ultrasonic welding; Through the thickness heating; Unidirectional thermoplastic composites; Welding of composites; Continuous ultrasonic welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-05-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.990469, 4.376814"

This is a potential safety hazard since it may lead to accidental detonation. A better understanding of the mechanism causing the munition articles to react can help improve safety. A finite element model combined with post-processing is used to model a Steven test. This thesis specifically looks at the absence or occurrence of a self-sustaining reaction in energetic material PBX-9501, a polymer bonded HMX based explosive. A reference paper (Gruau et al., 2009) was used to model the behaviour and validate some of the results.<br/>The PBX is predicted to react if it has satisfied a certain reaction criterion based on the hot spot theory of ignition. This theory poses that known chemical properties of the material, the plastic shear strain rate and the hydrostatic pressure can predict the occurrence of a reaction. A finite element model was used to find the plastic strain rate and hydrostatic pressure in the energetic material subjected to a case-crushing loading. Next, the reaction criterion is computed in a separate script. The energetic material was modelled as a homogeneous continuum with a Drucker-Prager yield criterion. This material model did not include any post-yielding behaviour, like strain hardening. <br/>First, a finite element model was constructed that was used as the baseline model throughout the thesis. The combined FEM and post-processing model was shown to be more sensitive than the model in the reference paper. The combined model also predicted a reaction at a lower velocity, which, according to tests in the reference paper, should have not produced a reaction.<br/>The baseline model, and consequent models in the parameter study, also showed excessive deformation. This can be attributed to the use of a simpler Drucker-Prager material model for the PBX as opposed to a more complex material model. The absence of any hardening behaviour, and the resulting deformation, also contributed to the instability of the finite element model.<br/>A parameter study was conducted by adapting the baseline model. Varying the velocity of the projectile was the most impactful change.<br/>In conclusion: the developed model gives a first indication of parameters that contribute to the sensitivity of certain munition articles to case crushing. However, the material model used should be improved to create a more stable finite element model. An improved material model could also better capture the mechanical behaviour of the complex energetic material. It is recommended that future research should focus on this improvement. <br","FEM; Impact Assessment; Energetic Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Because in a frame the multiple columns and girders work together, the buckling mode also depends on the frame itself and the neighboring beams. There are two types of frames according to their buckling mode, a sway and a non sway frame. For determining the effective buckling lengths Eurocode 3 is studied for general rules for frames and calculation methods for effective lengths.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Although modern technologies such as smartphones with GPS functionality make navigation substantially easier, automobilists still rely on traffic signs to inform them which exit to take or which lane to follow. These traffic signs on highways are of substantial size rendering them, and their support structures, extremely susceptible to aerodynamic load induced fatigue damage. <br/><br/>In this thesis traffic sign support structures in the form of steel portal frames consisting of square hollow sections are considered. Antea Group designs such structures using conservative generalized methods prescribed by the Eurocode and ROK norms. In order to investigate whether or not the structures may be optimized with respect to fatigue, a more elaborate load and dynamic response model is formulated.<br/><br/>Aerodynamic loads are primarily considered as these are the most significant dynamic loads, which are governing for fatigue damage. The two types of aerodynamic loads that are considered are traffic induced pulse loads generated by large vehicles passing close to the sign, and stochastic turbulent wind flow. The former is in the form of a pulse load, while the latter is in the form of a super-position of sinusoidal waves based on the Solari wind turbulence spectrum. These loads are applied to a dynamic finite element method developed in Python specifically for this thesis, consisting of one dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. The dynamic response is evaluated using a modal analysis. The resulting dynamic cross-sectional signals are transformed into weld-stress signals using a finite element model in \textit{IDEA StatiCa}. Finally the Rainflow Cycle Counting algorithm is used in combination with the Palmgren-Miner rule and SN-curves provided by the Eurocode in order to estimate the fatigue damage of the structure during its lifetime.<br/><br/>This methodology is applied to an existing reference structure, and an optimized design. The optimized design is optimized according to the Eurocode with respect to the ultimate and serviceability limit state, but fails in the fatigue limit state. From the results it is established that the calculation model presented in this thesis yields much lower magnitudes of stress range cycles compared to those found in the design norms, leading to significantly reduced fatigue damage. However this model does not take instantaneous wind gust loads into account, reducing its range of applicability. It is suggested to utilize the simulation model for loads that occur more than 10e5 times in a 50 year life time, but utilize the existing design norm models for loads that occur less often. The traffic induced pulse loads are found to be of significant size under the current assumptions, but due to a lack of research in this field the validity of the magnitude of the pulse loads remains uncertain.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is show that there is potential for optimization with respect to fatigue, but the simulation model should be used on more structures and should be further evaluated in order to create a more simplified and generalized analytical model that may be applied quickly to any design or even structure.","Fatigue; Modal Analysis; Power Spectral Density; Aerodynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This picture has only been magnified by the increased size, complexity, and urgent demand for their delivery. Responding to this circumstance has taken different paths. One of these has been updating and improving how the relevant parties of a project interact to achieve the intended results. This way, alternative delivery methods have emerged with different adaptations depending on the country's legislation and policies. A general acceptance has been gained over those systems where the parties interact more closely to reach a final product. This moves away from the classical division between Client and Contractor. Usually, the first takes a controlling role, while the second proceeds on the elaboration of the documents and works. The alternative approach requires from the participants a high component of collaboration. As a scheme where the Contractor is involved from an early stage of the project, the Dutch construction industry has used for a long time the Bouwteam agreement. However, the original drafted model lags from the updates implemented into the country's legal framework. This situation resulted in two independent organizations releasing their interpretation of this concept. The developed agreements give a good perspective on the activities to be done by the different parties during its implementation. However, these do not provide a clear insight into the Allocation and Control of the risks among the participants. Intending to incorporate the missing aspects of the Risk Management process within this collaborative setting, a model was developed to help identify hot spot areas of Risk when Bouwteams are used as a Project Delivery Method. The research also proposes a set of control strategies to help effectively tackle these. A multimethod approach was implemented, with different techniques following the same epistemological perspective. First, a Literature Review was used to build on the concepts relative to Project Delivery Methods and Risk Management methodologies. An empirical study with the analysis of four infrastructure projects in The Netherlands was carried out. During this second phase, the documentation of the projects was examined, and interviews with the project participants were held to investigate the risk management process when using this agreement. The result was a preliminary model consisting of three elements linked to the steps of the Risk Management Process; a set of Risks for the Bouwteam clustered in Risk Groups; a diagram to help assist in the allocation decision; and Control Strategies for these risks. The model was validated through an expert review, and insights into its possible implementation were discussed. The research concludes with a final model and a roadmap for its implementation. Procedural aspects and a set of contractual provisions are needed to incorporate the allocation and control of risks before and throughout the design phase. The elements presented in this research could work as the blueprint to include these within the Bouwteam setting.","Risk Management; Project Delivery Methods; Bouwteam; Risk Allocation; Risk Control; Two-phase delivery; Case-based modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

At these conditions they are susceptible to a transition from ductile failure to a dangerous brittle (cleavage) predominant type of failure, which occurs well before yielding. One of the main challenges in employing thick sections is the through-thickness heterogeneous variance of microstructures as a result of the processing route owing to a gradient of cooling rates from the surface to the bulk. As the material‚Äôs mechanical and fracture behaviour strongly depend on the microstructure, the through-thickness microstructural heterogeneity leads to a significant scatter in mechanical and fracture properties, which makes it difficult to predict and control cleavage fracture.<br/><br/>From the body of literature establishing microstructural dependence on cleavage failure, several features contributing to this type failure can be identified. Phases, grain size, grain boundary misorientations and the presence of secondary phase constituents can play a major role in failure through cleavage. Additionally, cleavage failure is also sensitive to the crack depth to width ratio (a/W). This study investigates the microstructural features contributing to cleavage failure in a 100 mm thick S690QT high strength steel plate by performing mechanical and fracture toughness tests. In order to improve mechanical properties and cleavage fracture toughness, an isoparametric study employing rapid cyclic heating with the objective of grain refinement was performed.<br/><br/>The steel plate has coarser prior austenite grain (PAG) sizes, and a larger area and number fraction of inclusions in the middle section. Additionally, segregation bands as a result of solute segregation during the solidification process were observed to be dispersed throughout the middle section. The middle section was also characterized by lower hardness compared to the top section. The detrimental effects of the middle section were evidenced by inferior low temperature tensile properties and cleavage fracture toughness. This was attributed to the larger PAG sizes, larger area and number fractions of inclusions, and segregation bands in the middle section. The specimen orientation with respect to the rolling direction was found to have no effects on the tensile properties. Additionally, different a/W geometries and notch orientations with respect to the rolling direction were used to investigate the role of constraint effect and rolling orientation, respectively, in the fracture behaviour. Shallow-notched specimens representative of the defects found in offshore structures demonstrated a higher fracture toughness than the deep-notched specimens. This was attributed to lower hydrostatic stresses at the crack tip, which reduces stress triaxiality. The isoparametric study resulted in average grain size reduction by 41% and proved to improve micro-hardness, low temperature tensile properties and cleavage fracture toughness by 5%, 13% and 41% respectively. Fractographic analysis on the fracture toughness specimens revealed the presence of O, C-rich regions which are known to promote brittle behaviour.<br","High strength steel; cleavage fracture toughness; crack tip opening displacement; grain size; segregation bands; inclusions; isoparametric grain refinement; gleeble","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-01","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

However, in a known and controlled environment, being able to localize its position at a given time instant is sufficient for the robot to navigate autonomously. Therefore, to solve the problem of pose estimation of a mobile greenhouse robot, Visual Odometry (VO) was the best-suited approach. This thesis focuses on the pose estimation of a greenhouse robot using images from an onboard camera only for its motion on the guided rails. A review of the literature revealed that most of the current state-of-the art VO techniques were developed for autonomous navigation in an urban environment or an indoor space. Even though there were publicly available benchmark datasets for VO evaluation such as KITTI and TUM datasets, there was no VO dataset available for a greenhouse environment. A key challenge in collecting visual datasets in a greenhouse was obtaining the ground truth poses associated with all the images. Therefore, an experimental setup was developed to collect VO datasets along with ground truth using store-bought table plants, tomatoes, a mobile camera, and a stereo camera. The experimental design was focused to emulate the greenhouse environment as much as possible. The camera's motion during the experiment was also chosen to emulate the robot's motion on the guided rails.

In addition, the monopiles are subjected to both lateral and vertical loads. The influence of vertical load on the lateral design of short rigid monopiles in clay soil is not clear. This study aims to perform a comprehensive study on the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of monopile foundations in clay soil.<br/> <br/>All analysis in this study was performed using 3D finite element modeling in PLAXIS 3D software. The NGI-ADP constitutive model was adopted to simulate the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of clay. Considered in the analysis is a short rigid pile with a diameter of 10 m (L/D = 3) and a long flexible pile with a diameter of 2 m (L/D = 15). The analyzed clay soil profiles consist of a normally consolidated clay soil and an overconsolidated clay soil with a constant undrained shear strength profile equal to 30 kPa. For each pile in each type of clay soil, a pure lateral loading scenario is performed first to assess the validity of current design methods. Subsequently, a combined loading scenario is performed to assess the influence of vertical loading on the lateral behaviour of rigid monopile in clay soil.<br/><br/>Results of the pure lateral loading scenario suggest that current design methods heavily underestimate the lateral capacity of rigid monopile foundations in both clay soil profiles analyzed. According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that current design methods are not fit to provide an accurate assessment regarding the lateral load response of rigid monopile in clay soil. In order to correctly assess the lateral load response of rigid monopile in clay soil, a method consisting of a 3D finite element model akin to the model used in the research or a PISA design model is advised. A potential third design method, the 1D rotational spring model, is also proposed. <br/><br/>Results of the combined loading scenario suggest that the presence of vertical loading causes a decrease in lateral and moment capacity of the rigid pile in both clay soil profiles analyzed. However, the influence is negligible when the vertical load magnitude is smaller than 50% of its bearing capacity. To quantify the influence of vertical load on a monopile foundation, a series of load analysis were performed on a real offshore wind turbine with a 5MW power capacity. It was found that the vertical load on a typical monopile foundation in clay is around 27% of its bearing capacity. According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the influence of vertical load on the lateral response of rigid monopiles in clay soil is limited and can be ignored in foundation design.<br","Monopile; Offshore Wind Energy; PLAXIS 3D; NGI-ADP; Finite Element Analysis; Geo-Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

It is a problem with many variations but the core idea is to create a plan that resolves as much demand as possible.<br/>There are different approaches in use to solve a planning problem, one of which is by using heuristics. Heuristics are used to get to a relatively good solution within some feasible amount of time compared to trying to get to an optimal solution. Expertise of the problem is often required to come up with good heuristics or to improve existing ones. When such an expert is not readily available alternatives need to be considered, one of which is machine learning.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to create a machine learning model that can improve the heuristics used in an existing planning algorithm at Outperform. This heuristic decides upon a sequence in which products are included in the planning algorithm. Using a different sequence can lead to vastly different results for the algorithm both in quality and time required. Our focus will be on reducing the amount of time required for the algorithm by learning a heuristic that can provide better sequences.¬†<br/>To achieve this goal, two models are created and evaluated. These models use imitation learning to replicate the sequences that were the fastest. Due to the lack of an expert to provide the fastest sequences, an oracle is created that attempts to search for a sequence as fast as possible within some feasible amount of time. The trained models are evaluated on several supply chains provided by Outperform.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van Dijk, N.H. (graduation committee); Fu, Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Self-healing of creep-induced damage in newly designed 12Cr self-healing ferritic steels is studied. The damage healing is achieved by the segregation of supersaturated solute atoms at the free surface of the creep-induced cavities, and in this research, the healing phase is the W-riched Laves phase. Two kinds of self-healing steel with different precipitation driving forces of Laves phase are investigated, namely fast self-healing steel (FSHS) and slow self-healing steel (SSHS), in which the FSHS is designed to show the healing effect after 280 hours, while SSHS is designed to show healing effect after 27000 hours. Although both systems are self-healing systems, only FSHS is expected to show the self-healing phenomenon under the testing condition of this study, while SSHS not. Creep tests were performed on bone-shaped samples with constant stresses ranging from 100 to 260 MPa at 550 ¬∞C. The creep behavior is compared with traditional 9-12Cr ferritic steels, the relationship between the minimum creep rate and stress obeys Norton's power law, and the relationship between the lifetime and stress also obeys a power law. The total strain and stress exponents in power law of both SSHS and FSHS are relatively high compared to traditional 12Cr ferritic steel with similar grain size. The microstructure of the creep-failed samples, including the fracture surfaces, the uniformly-strained region (i.e., the stress-affected region), and the stress-free region are investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By comparing the feature of the stress-affected region and stress-free region exposed to the same thermal history, the effect of high-temperature exposure could be isolated from this. The effect of stress on the Laves phase precipitation behavior and the damage evolution could be understood more clearly. For both the SSHS and FSHS, a ductile and transgranular fracture mode is confirmed by analyzing the fracture surfaces. In the stress-affected region and stress-free region of the creep-failed samples, M<sub>23</sub>C<sub>6</sub> precipitates, Si/C-rich impurities, and pores were found in all observed samples. The Laves phase was only found in the samples with a longer lifetime (&gt; 300 h). A TEM observation and EDX scanning was conducted on the FSHS sample with a lifetime of 2487.2 hours. Laves phase precipitates were found on the grain boundaries and in the matrix, while no grain boundary cavities were found. Statistics based on pores observed on samples tested under different stress showed that the pores were present prior to creep tests and are generally not due to creep. A combined analysis of creep behavior and microstructure showed that dislocation climbing is likely the dominant creep mechanism. The absence of typical creep grain-boundary cavities was allocated to the relatively ductile matrix of 12Cr self-healing steel or the unfavorable dominating creep mechanism for creep cavity forming. With the prerequisite of self-healing not found in all tested samples, self-healing was considered not found under current testing conditions. The statistics based on the Laves phase showed that the precipitation depends on creep time, and the stress is indeed lowering the nucleation barrier, thus promoting the Laves phase to precipitate in the stress-affected areas.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

There is an increasing interest in using the serverless paradigm to execute data analysis tasks. Serverless functions often interact with external services, which can be considered similar to the concept of side-effects in regular programming. Haskell uses monads to isolate side-effects and to structure the composition of functions using side-effects. This thesis explores whether the concept of the monad can be applied in a serverless computing environment, ideally in a way that is flexible with regards to platform. An abstraction of side-effects was developed in the form of a monadic layer that is added to serverless functions. The monadic layer interacts with monads using an interface and exposes the API of the monads to the user. A monadic implementation was also created for a platform-independent function composition mechanism using orchestrator functions. An implementation of a shared state side-effect has also been created as a practical use-case for the monadic layer, and to explore the usability of monads on platforms with more restricted composition frameworks. The implementations are evaluated on performance, expressiveness and usability.","FaaS; Serverless; Monads; Cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Among various depth sensing technologies, the Time-of-Flight (ToF) approach is emerging as a widely applicable method because it has the potential of reaching much longer distances at higher speed and accuracy, is natively suitable for mobile phones or AR.<br/>One obvious problem is that the dToF system mainly targets the automotive industry or 3D imaging in close range, which means different power, accuracy, and fewer area requirements than mobile phone or AR applications. The application of the dToF system in the mobile phone or AR industry needs to be tested. The data volume is another problem of dToF. Usually, in the read out part, the dToF time-to digital converter (TDC)‚Äôs timestamps will all be saved into a histogram. The peak value of the histogram is the detected result.

The Zandwindmolen is a fixed CO2-neutral dredge, transport and nourishment concept that nourishes sediment continuously. The purpose of using a Zandwindmolen is to provide the entire surrounding area where the Zandwindmolen nourishes with sediment and allowing it to grow with the (accelerated) sea level rise. With the traditional nourishment method, it is often desired that the sand remains at the vulnerable site for as long as possible. Whereas, in a nourishment with the Zandwindmolen, it is often desirable for the sand to move to other nearby parts of the coast as quickly as possible.<br/>Between 2011 and 2020, 27.5 million m3 of sand has been nourished at the Ameland Inlet. Therefore, it might be considered as an erosion hotspot. Because of the fixed nourishment method of the Zandwindmolen and the continuous sand shortage at the Ameland Inlet, there is a match. However, the usefulness of a Zandwindmolen depends on the extent to which the nourished sand volume is dispersed by natural processes in the short and long term.<br/>In this study, both the short- and long-term effect of a continuous point nourishment in a tidal channel is investigated for four sediment fractions (100, 200, 300 and 400 Œºm). The goal is that the sediment is dispersed by nature in order to allow the entire Ameland Inlet (adjacent coastlines, coastal foundation, outer delta and Wadden Sea basin) to grow along with sea level rise.<br/>For optimal dispersion, the nourishment must be carried out by means of a spreader pontoon with a sediment mixture concentration of 1-2%. By doing so, a mixing plume is created in which sediment settles according to their individual settling velocity. This makes the mixing plume prone to the tidal ebb and flood current and can therefore be steered towards either the North- or Wadden Sea. <br/>In the short term (time scale: instantaneous to a few weeks), it appears that the dispersion of sediment is mainly determined by the initial sedimentation process of sediment and by re-suspension of settling sediment particles. The dispersion by natural sediment processes is minimal. In the longer term (timescale: half a year) the sediment spreads further after it has settled to the seabed. Based on half a year, the total dispersion is mainly determined by the short term dispersion.<br/>It is found that a continuous nourishment with the Zandwindmolen is expected to ensure that the intertidal areas in the eastern Wadden Sea can continue to grow naturally with (accelerated) sea level rise. Moreover, the natural distribution of the nourished sand will, through sediment connectivity, compensate for the erosion (autonomous and due to sea level rise) of the inlet (especially the outer delta) and is also expected to contribute to keeping the North Sea coast of Terschelling and Ameland safe. Therefore, the Zandwindmolen could be a useful new sustainable nourishment method in a tidal inlet.<br","Morphodynamics; Sediment transport; Nourishment strategies; Tidal inlet system; Sustainable dredging; Coastal dynamics; Delft3D; Building with Nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Zandwindmolen project","53.44826014059726, 5.585993393854232"

For these complex high precision applications it is important to understand the fatigue properties of the materials used to prevent premature failure, as these materials are subjected to large numbers of stress cycles. A material that is used for high precision applications is Ti-6Al-4V, as its material properties are highly adaptable and can be fine-tuned for a wide range of applications. Material fatigue due to stress cycles knows two stages: crack initiation and crack propagation. This research focuses on the latter and looks into the influence of microstructural features on crack propagation in Ti-6Al-4V. The influence of the microstructural features is tested by applying a load shedding method to form cracks in Ti-6Al-4V samples. These cracks are analysed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) in order to relate the microstructural features to the crack path. There are two main microstructural features found to have a large influence on the fatigue crack propagation in Ti-6Al-4V. The first of these is the Schmid factor, which relates the applied stress to the slip system available. As there are only a small amount of slip systems available in Ti-6Al-4V and limited crack path propagation opportunities, large crack deflections can be the result. The second microstructural feature found to have a large influence is the misorientation angle of the grain boundaries. When the misorientation angle is large enough, a shift from transgranular cracking to intergranular cracking is observed. Intergranular cracking can cause deviations of the crack path around the grains and the formation of secondary cracks. The deviations in crack path as a result of a low Schmid factor and a high misorientation angle extend the fatigue life of the material. The Schmid factor was found to have a large influence on crack deflections observed, whereas the high misorientation angles were mostly found around sites where bifurcation occurred, especially at lower applied stress ranges. This study proposes that the influence of the microstructural features on fatigue crack propagation in Ti-6Al-4V can be expressed as two probability functions describing crack deflection and bifurcation. The probability of a crack deflecting is relatively high for a lower Schmid factor, a high misorientation angle and a low deflection angle. The probability of bifurcation is relatively high when a near-threshold stress intensity range is applied and also for a high misorientation angle and a low deflection angle.","Schmid factor; Ti-6Al-4V; Fatigue crack propagation; Microstructure; Misorientation angle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-25","","","","","",""

For this study, four different fillers (calcite, lignocellulosic filler 1, lignocellulosic filler 2, waste-based filler) and two different fibres (flax, bamboo) are used, with calcite as the reference filler. A primary goal to be achieved by NPSP is to reduce or eliminate calcite as the primary filler due to its high density and brittle nature. Promising results have been obtained within two iterations of using the model for the different filler/fibre systems used.<br/>Additionally, the thesis also investigates the rules of mixing for multi-component systems to develop analytical models that predict the mechanical properties of the composite. The Lewis-Nielsen model and the Cox -Krenchel theory have been used to compare theoretical values with experimental data points. The initial binary phase curve fitting followed by applying cascading to obtain ternary and quaternary phase mechanical properties provides approximate results for most recipes made. Finally, recommendations to improve both models have been covered, and a potential to combine both approaches has been shown.","bio-based; rule of mixtures; data driven design; composites; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

The reconstruction of viral strain-specific genomes using sequencing reads is referred to as viral quasispecies assembly, and it is also crucial to determine the relative abundances of the viral strains in the mixture for various treatments. There are currently many software tools available to transform NGS sequencing reads into haplotypes but earlier benchmarks of viral quasispecies reconstruction tools were only tested using simulated datasets but do not reflect closely on the real-world scenarios and on virus evolution. In this research, using realistic evolutionary viral populations, we assessed six viral quasispecies assembly tools. The existing real dataset mix that is still being used for experiments is a decade old, so it has become important to create broader and complex high quality real datasets as a new standard for future haplotype caller experiments. We introduce a new high quality benchmarking dataset for viral quasispecies assembly from real samples. The aim of this research is to evaluate extensive performance of six tools approaches that allow for reconstruction of unique viral haplotypes which are necessary to research complex and heterogeneous virus communities thoroughly. A comparative study of the performance of these tools has been done. Based on the results achieved, to improve the haplotypes generated, an existing de novo method is used for reconstructing full-length haplotypes from pre-assembled contigs of challenging mixed samples.

Although several systems that integrate medical devices have been developed, surgical energy devices have yet to be integrated into these systems. Current measurement systems of surgical energy devices are not yet suitable for this integration, due to a lack of being manufacturer-independent and being limited in the amount of measured information. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is the development of a manufacturer-independent measuring system that can estimate and communicate the state of any surgical energy device in real time. To realize this goal, a measurement system has been developed that measures the state of any surgical energy device through image recognition. The system is integrated into the OPeLiNK system of the Smart Cyber Operating Theatre, SCOT. It can however, be integrated in any of the other integrated ORs. The system has been tested through several experiments, showing that the accuracy and measuring speed meet the requirements of 90% and 0.2s. The system outperforms the state of the art in the amount of data that is being measured in real time at the cost of a small delay of 0.07s. Currently the bottleneck is the communication through the OPeLiNK system, where the communication frequency has a set limit of 1Hz. It can be concluded that the developed measurement system can be used for the integration of surgical energy devices in the integrated operating room. The next step is to further improve the system in terms of robustness, easier use, and increased measurement capabilities.","OPeLiNK; Energy devices; Image recognition; Template matching; Integrated operating room; SCOT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Fiber-reinforced polymer composites have gained relevance in the aerospace industry due to their great potential for weight reduction. This, thanks to their outstanding specific properties and ability to be tailored to different applications. Developing efficient composite joining techniques is a challenge that requires great attention as it is key to a more sustainable industry. Thermoplastic composites present the great advantage that they can be joined via fusion bonding, a joining technique in which the interface is virtually erased and is generally faster than other available techniques such as mechanical fastening and adhesion bonding. A fusion bonding technology that stands out for its short processing times and cost-efficiency is ultrasonic welding, a process in which the joint is developed via low-amplitude and high-frequency mechanical vibrations that heat up the interface. Although the effect of different parameters is well known, the particular effect of the part -commonly referred to as adherend- thickness is yet not fully understood. <br/><br/>This thesis investigated the effect of the adherends‚Äô thickness on the process response and weld evolution on static ultrasonic welding of CF/LMPAEK thermoplastic composites. Different characterization techniques were used to assess the latter, such as the output from the welding equipment (power and displacement), temperature readings, microscopy analysis, high-speed camera recordings, and numerical models. The results showed that increasing only the top adherend‚Äôs thickness gradually increases the heating in this adherend up to a point where significant fiber squeeze-out is observed at early stages of the process. This overheating was associated with hammering and the differences in compliance when increasing the thickness. It is hypothesized that this hammering may contribute to overheating. Welding with a higher force significantly decreased the overheating in the top adherend as hammering is reduced, whereas changing the amplitude did not show to be as influential. In contrast, increasing only the bottom adherend‚Äôs thickness did not have as much effect on the process. The dissipated power and cooling rate were the two variables that showed to be most affected, and both were associated with more bulk viscoelastic dissipation as the thickness increases. Finally, changing from fabric to UD reinforcement and welding only different top adherend‚Äôs thicknesses resulted in less hammering and fewer differences in the process response and weld evolution between thin and thick adherends, which was associated with the variation in compliance. <br/><br/>The findings of this study indeed contribute to the understanding of the effect of the adherends' thickness. However, more research is required to fully grasp this effect on ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites. For example, developing a process envelope that quantifies the thickness limitations for different process parameters and investigating the effect of the thickness in continuous ultrasonic welding are some of the next steps towards a more robust and well-understood joining technology for thermoplastic composites.","Ultrasonic welding; Thermoplastic Composite; Hammering effect; Fiber architecture; Adherend thickness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.99002830231493, 4.375278582716706"

Next, participants are segmented based on query language capabilities to distinguish between non-experts and experts. A common way to retrieve information from databases is by using SQL. Thus knowledge of SQL is assumed to be a proxy for participants' skill level (i.e. SQL proficient, non-SQL proficient). We create an approach that uses an automated near semantic equivalence evaluation for user-generated queries against a predefined gold-standard SQL query and thus segment participants. We find that 70 out of 242 participants are identified as SQL proficient. To differentiate between the segmentations, we define 42 requirements often implemented for NLIDB systems, from which both segmentations pick a selection as their preferred requirements. We are unable to find statistically significant differences between the segmentations' preferences. However, exploratory findings reveal the importance of origin, namely the banking industry, which prefers explanation over answer accuracy, different from other segmentations.<br/><br/>Study 2 is inspired by the exploratory findings of Study 1 and uses requirements from Study 1 to create an application that tests two conditions, one with an explanation by using color-coding (i.e. to show the relations between the natural language question asked and the models' output columns) and another without. NLIDBs make it hard for users to verify if the answer provided by its model is correct. Therefore, Study 2 uses these two conditions above to test if color-coding improves performance for the participants.

This project has been carried out to explore the possibilities for transitioning industrial IoT sensor nodes into the circular economy.<br/><br/>Wireless sensor nodes are battery powered instruments for monitoring processes and condition of industrial equipment. They need to endure harsh environments and are subjected to critical certification. In general, they are discarded once their internal battery depletes, meaning their embedded potential is lost.<br/>Structuring the analysis of Edge Dynamics‚Äô current product on circular aspects using tools such as HotSpot mapping and the Disassembly Map framework, revealed the disassembly steps and activities that inhibit circular activities such as repair, remanufacturing and recycling. These key components are responsible for a significant fraction of the product‚Äôs environmental and economic footprint, or are subjected to a high rate of replacement.<br/><br/>The outcome of the project is a concept sensor node featuring an optimised product architecture. The concept uses a novel way to configure the internal components as such that the key components have the top priority in disassembly. The redesigned sensor node is faster to repair, faster to assemble and disassemble and houses less components. Moreover, the product is made up of less materials and better fits recycling processes as no materials are mixed.<br/>On a system level, circular strategies such as repair and remanufacturing can considerably reduce the environmental impact of the sensor nodes, as giving nodes a second or third lifespan will prevent the need to use virgin materials for the manufacturing of new products.<br/><br/>On a product level, the current product‚Äôs key components are sufficiently easy enough to reach and repair that a redesign will only make a significant difference in time savings, and thus costs, on a certain scale. Optimising the sensor node has not increased the embedded footprint. Reusing the circuit boards by for instance repairing sensor nodes can dramatically reduce the lifecycle footprint.<br/>On a material level, using exclusively recycled metals and polymers in the sensor node could reduce its carbon footprint with 4,9% compared to the use of materials containing typical recycling fractions. Moreover, the effectivity of recycling processes can be improved by avoiding the use of mechanical fasteners mixed with dissimilar metals.<br/><br/>Besides the potential reduction of the environmental impact of wireless sensor nodes, a financial incentive is likely at hand as well. Depending on the scale of operation, significant cost reductions can be achieved by faster maintenance and repair when operating a circular business model.<br/><br/>Combining the efforts of each level will lead to the highest potential for sustainable sensor nodes. Edge Dynamics can take a leading role in the industry, offering circular IIoT devices.","Internet of Things; Circular Product Design; Circular Economy; Industrial application; Design for Disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Wind turbine blades only last a few decades, and are difficult and therefore not economically desirable to recycle.<br/>One proposed solution to this issue, is to repurpose the blades. Over the last years, several small-scale projects (such as playgrounds and urban furniture) have been realised that show how these high-end objects can serve new purposes successfully.<br/>As the wind industry has grown exponentially over the last two decades, the resulting composite waste stream is expected to follow this same growth in the coming decades. For this reason, more impactful solutions are required.<br/>To this end, the Blade Barrier is proposed by Blade Made, a spinoff startup from Superuse Studios. A roadside sound barrier has the potential to incorporate a large number of blades into its construction, and extend their life-in-service for another two to five decades, simultaneously eliminating the need for virgin materials.<br/>The blades represent the starting point of the project, while the sound barrier is the final goal. The project is about connecting these two points through various research and design methods. Analysing the blades offers an understanding of the opportunities and limitations of the material, while research into sound barrier design yields insights into what makes a well-performing barrier. Throughout the project, the expertise of experts has been consulted to be able to expand this understanding and make well-grounded design decisions.<br/>Based on this research a design vision is formulated, focussing on aesthetics, circularity and scalability. After the creation of three concepts, the idea for a green urban corridor was selected. This concept has the potential to transcend the simple idea of a sound barrier, and fulfil multiple purposes. It could offer a cleaner and more biodiverse urban area, and create an enjoyable surrounding on the resident side of the barrier.<br/>Through an iterative process, this concept was further developed. The result is a design that is adaptive to the availability of blades and the requirements of the barrier location. Acoustic simulations are used to validate the performance of the design, and physical prototyping steps were taken in order to elaborate upon the production process. Vegetation is incorporated into the design to enhance its aesthetics and acoustics, and to stimulate biodiversity.<br/>The design is applied to a location in Rotterdam to show how it integrates within the urban environment. The flexibility of the design enables it to be constructed in various different locations with varying types of blades. This way, it offers a solution to the blade waste problem anywhere on the planet.<br/>The design was presented to the wind industry at the 2022 WindEurope conference in Bilbao. The design was received well there, and several parties are currently in touch with Blade Made to explore the possibilities for the construction of a Blade Barrier.<br/>To this end, the report concludes with several recommendations toward the realisation of the design.","wind turbine blades; repurposing; acoustic; barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Suppose a patient suffers the symptom but is unsure of the action he needs to take, a self-diagnosis tool can help the patient identify the possible conditions and whether this patient needs to seek immediate medical help. However, the accuracy and quality of the service provided by those self-diagnosis tools are still disappointing and need further improvement. This thesis focuses on an automatic differential diagnosis task with a comprehensive evaluation of reinforcement learning methods. Also, we present a systematic method to simulate medically correct patients records, which integrates a standard symptom modeling approach called NLICE. In this way, we can bridge the gap between limited available patients records and data-driven healthcare methodologies. This project investigates both flat-RL methods and hierarchical RL in an automatic differential diagnosis setting and evaluates the performance of those two kinds of methods on simulated patients records. More specifically, the action space for the differential diagnosis task is inevitably large, so the flat-RL performs relatively poorly in complicated scenarios. The hierarchical RL method can split a complex diagnosis task into smaller tasks: it contains two-level of policy learning, and each low-layer policy imitates one medical specialty. Therefore hierarchical RL method increases the Top 1 success rate from 23.1\% in flat-RL method to 45.4\%.<br/><br/>Besides the advanced policy learning strategy, this thesis explores the ability of NLICE symptom modeling in distinguishing conditions that share similar symptoms. The experimental results experience increases in flat-RL and hierarchical RL models and finally achieve 36.2\% and 71.8\% Top 1 success rates, respectively. To further solve the sparse action space problem in the automatic diagnosis domain, the reward shaping algorithm is implemented in the reward configuration part. The average gained reward of hierarchical RL increases from -3.65 to 0.87. Additionally, we model the general demographic background of patients and utilize contextual information to perform the policy transformation strategy, which eliminates the miss classification problem in highly sex-age related diseases.<br","Primary Care; Reinforcement Learning; Automatic Differential Diagnosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Minimizing this disutility is valuable to increase travelers' satisfaction. To be able to reduce this disutility, transfers have to be identified first. Multi-operator smart card datasets allow for the identification of transfers between different operators, as well as between the same operators. However, it is unknown in the literature how such a multi-operator smart card dataset can contribute to the minimization of transfer disutility in Public Transport. An answer is given by analyzing a multi-operator smart card dataset for the Haaglanden area in the Netherlands that uses a 35-minute time interval to identify transfers. Also, a measure has been implemented for one of the transfers with the highest potential for transfer time loss minimization and the effects on the network are examined in a transport model. It is found that a multi-operator smart card dataset can identify important transfer stations and individual transfers, for which the associated disutility factors can then be identified manually. Then, measures can be implemented to reduce the disutility of a transfer. The measure, a reduction of the waiting time, implemented on a transfer in this study resulted in changing traveler's route- and mode choices. For further research, it is recommended to explore the possible effects of implementing the measure as it can lead to crowding or other inefficient transfers, which could increase the disutility. Furthermore, further research should look into the disutility values of the case study to draw better conclusions whether, and to what degree, (dis)utility factors explain transfer flow sizes for this case specifically.","Public Transport; Transfers; Transfer penalty; (Dis)utility; Smart card data; Transport modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In this study, we explore the possibility to use an expanding in‚Äêpedicle anchor with the goal of increasing the contact area of the in‚Äêpedicle anchor with the pedicle cortex to reduce toggling. Toggling is the rocking motion that can occur when an in‚Äêpedicle anchor is subjected to lateral forces that can occur during the patient‚Äôs daily activities. A stainless steel scaled‚Äêup 2D proof‚Äêof‚Äêprincipe prototype was developed and manufactured consisting of a central bolt with flattened sides, a nut, and ten sliding wedges. The wedges expand by applying a compression force by tightening the nut. In order for the prototype to reach the pedicle cortex, it needs to compress the surrounding cancellous bone first. It was shown in experiments that the proof‚Äêof‚Äêprinciple prototype was able to compress 5 and 10 PCF Sawbones solid foam, which corresponds to osteoporotic human cancellous bone. The proof‚Äêof‚Äêprinciple prototype was able to make contact with the top and bottom of a custom‚Äêmade 2D pedicle model where a conventional screw would have been limited to contact on the two flanks. The proof‚Äêop‚Äêprinciple prototype showed a better resistance<br/>to lateral loads than an unexpanded model with the same dimensions. The proposed in‚Äêpedicle anchor shows potential for improved resistance to caudocranial toggling by increasing the number of contact points with the pedicle cortex.

The average relation between this stiffness range of interest and corresponding wave characteristics is described using a set of coupling coefficients which are determined using numerical simulations. For this, a batch of reference laminates is constructed that covers the entire stiffness range of interest. Input for the system are the group velocities of the zeroth-order symmetric and antisymmetric guided wave modes, measured on the structure of interest. The potential of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a numerical feasibility study based on numerical simulations. Good results were obtained for different test scenarios, varying in the amount of structural information available on the structure of interest. Thereafter, the in-situ application of the methodology has been examined in an experimental setup. Good measurement and analysis times were achieved by using a compact measuring device that is capable of recording the wave signal in five directions simultaneously. A reliable accuracy assessment of the in-situ application of the methodology was, however, difficult to obtain due to the lack of reliable reference studies. Therefore, in future research reliable reference information should be gathered. Additionally, a next step for future research should focus on decreasing the amount of information available on the structure of interest.","Non-Destructive Evaluation Techniques (NDT); Composites; Ultrasonic measurements; Stiffness prediction; Structural Reliability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

This is done in order to figure out why the joint structure is experiencing significant crack propagation and what potentially could have led to a structural joint failure and death of an operator within a crane of the same model.<br/><br/>Assessment is performed by simulating stress distribution within the problematic joint structure and assessing high-cycle fatigue damage accumulation around its welds. Loading conditions affecting crane upper arm are established through multi-body dynamic simulations, which are meant to replicate operation of a lemniscate crane. Multi-body dynamic model is verified for its accuracy using available crane operation measurement data. Loads are acquired within the time domain and include temporal effects of luffing, slewing and hoisting operations as well as pontoon motion.<br/><br/>Fatigue analysis is performed to evaluate damage accumulation within the tubular joint structure of the crane upper arm. A detailed shell finite element model is established to acquire time-dependent stress responses. During stress evaluation stage - a particularly large stress concentration has been observed at the joint brace saddle position. To assess which method best simulate damage accumulation in the joint structure - three specific fatigue assessment approaches are tested: nominal stress approach, hot-spot stress approach and multi-axial fatigue approach. Nominal and hot-spot stress approaches are evaluated and compared to determine how inclusion of stress concentration effects into fatigue assessment influence damage accumulation results. Result comparison has shown a large disparity in results with hot-spot stress approach, indicating that the method capable of determining locations of dangerous stress accumulation, in relation to what has been observed in the real structure.<br/><br/>Evaluation is performed to determine whether multi-axial fatigue assessment is needed to improve calculation results of fatigue damage accumulation.<br/>Based on stress direction properties within the analysed structure - most favorable multi-axial fatigue assessment approach (capable of analysing proportional stress responses) is used. Multi-axial fatigue assessment method results are then compared with results of conventional hot-spot stress approach to evaluate the differences in damage accumulation rate. Analysis results have shown that both methods are capable of determining locations of critical points with present disparity within magnitude of damage accumulation. This indicates that hot-spot stress fatigue approach, which uses Von Mises stress, is more conservative out of two methods. Fatigue analysis has also presented that original joint structure is inherently flawed, as its stress concentration locations are not easily accessible without crane disassembly and its structural capacity has been underestimated during design stage.<br/><br/>Finally methods for extending operational life of crane upper arm structure are evaluated. Three methods for reducing stress within the structure are assessed: increase of structural capacity, stress redistribution and load reduction. Increase of structural capacity is performed by adjusting thickness of relevant joint elements, with optimal thickness being established using a sensitivity analysis algorithm, which simultaneously acquires combined thickness setup for multiple joint elements - making the joint capable of surviving predetermined fatigue life. Stress redistribution approach is implemented by producing an alternative upper arm joint design, which could be exchanged with the problematic original joint during crane refurbishment. Load reduction approach is performed to investigate whether it would be possible to increase fatigue life of the original joint structure without affecting work efficiency, by only adjusting crane motion profile within multi-body dynamic simulation environment. All three methods are quantified and compared through fatigue damage factor results acquired using multi-axial fatigue assessment method. Result comparison has shown that joint redesign is the most preferred approach due to its ability to efficiently improve fatigue life of the structure without significant structural weight increase, while exposing any potential points for crack initiation to locations easily accessible for inspection and repair.","Fatigue Analysis; Multiaxial fatigue; multi-body dynamics; Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, a choice experiment is carried out, and the retrieved data is analysed using a Multinominal Logit (MNL) model and a Latent Class<br/>(LC) model. The weights retrieved by the MNL model align with the assumptions that travel time and costs are most important for station choice. When applying an LC Model, two classes are found. One class (65%) is highly influenced by travel time and parking costs, which is equal to the MNL results. Males and students are very likely to belong in this class. Whereas the other class (35%) is also highly influenced by lighting and security in the bicycle parking and parking costs have a very low impact on the station choice for this class. Females and elderly (65+) are most likely to belong in this class. Thus for 35% of the population, satisfiers play a strong role in station choice.

(mentor); De Vries, Laurens (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","br/>Power system planning is a strenuous exercise for both people and computers. As carbon goals and geopolit- ical complexities intensify, the number of scenarios for electricity system development is limitless. In search of robust policy and profitable investments, policymakers and investment managers rely on long-term elec- tricity system simulation models. Those seeking to simulate myopic investment behaviour in systems reliant on intermittent generation, batteries and seasonal storage then encounter a computational barrier. The sole model detailed enough to conduct such simulations ‚Äì MIDO (Myopic Investment Detailed Operational) ‚Äì takes over 12 hours to run a 20-year scenario. Exploring avenues to cut back computational time is key to un- locking the potential to meaningful scenario analyses. Also, due to its novelty, many of its assumptions and modeling choices were not validated with stakeholders. Research into methodologies to reduce the computational burden at an acceptable compromise to model behaviour thus holds merit.<br/><br/>To this end, this methodological thesis explores myopic optimisation, developing the MODO methodology: Myopic Optimisation, with Detailed Operational analysis of system performance. We have realised an 85% improvement in computational efficiency with a sufficient degree of accuracy for it to be considered as an alternative to MIDO. The essence of our approach is the replacement of an iterative investment loop with a single optimisation. In doing so, we transfer insights from the field of agent-based modeling into the field of myopic optimisation, potentially enabling the revitalisation of a research area which has seen little activity in recent years.<br/><br/>MODO has been implemented as a modular toolkit in Linny-R, in such a way that users need not have any technical modeling knowledge to be able to construct their own system and/ or analyse their own scenarios. The implementation in Linny-R greatly enhances model transparency and usability.<br/><br/>We create a projection for the state of the Dutch electricity system by 2030 and use MODO to simulate the transition path from 2030-2050. Preliminary results suggest the significant potential of both seasonal (hy- drogen) and battery (lithium-ion) storage to lower electricity prices below 2030 levels, bringing down annual consumer spending to EUR 15 bn annually in a scenario with mid-range commodity price forecasts. Addi- tionally, results affirm the functionality of MODO in more complex electricity systems.<br/><br/>We identify three exciting avenues for future research. The risk of contemporary investment decisions is largely mitigated through long-term contracting, such as bilateral power purchase agreements or forward ENDEX markets. Ideally, academic work would converge to the point where a first model simulates a range of potential portfolio choices based on long-term contracting, after which - based on risk appetite - the upside potential of offering excess capacity on spot markets is assessed with a methodology such as MODO. However, as the data on such long-term contracting is often kept secret, research into ways to approximate the data or work with it using ‚Äôblack-box‚Äô models could prove fruitful. Secondly, researchers could choose to build upon this work by leveraging it to conduct large-scale exploratory analyses. The case studies in this work illustrate the potential of MODO, but only provide a preliminary insight into system development. Whilst model devel- opment has been informed by a stakeholder consultation, the scenarios analysed have not. This is simplified by the highly accessible nature of MODO‚Äôs implementation in Linny-R. Lastly, we suspect that qualitative re- search into the empirical applicability of power system simulation models might prove invaluable. Research that treats decision-makers and policy analysts as clients to discover their modeling needs could result in a roadmap for the participatory development of power simulation models in order to better foster their adop- tion, and that of their findings.","Power System Planning; Myopic Optimisation; Electricity Market Design; Long-term electricity system development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Macri, E.M. (mentor); Wesseling, M.G.H. (mentor); Seth, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","BACKGROUND: Research on the role of patellar biomechanics in patellofemoral (PF) joint pathologies requires accurate and reliable measurement of the patella relative to the femur (patellar tracking) but current methods have limitations. In vivo measurement of PF kinematics is done using medical imaging techniques but these are expensive, involve radiation exposure or only allow slow, supine motions. A widely used alternative is optical motion capture combined with musculoskeletal modeling. However, due to the large motion of the skin relative to the patella, the typical approach using anatomical calibrated skin-markers is unsuitable. As the shape of the patella is grossly visible underneath the skin, placement of a grid of skin-mounted markers on the skin covering the patella might offer an alternative for patellar tracking.<br/>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a patellar tracking framework designed to measure in vivo PF translations using a grid of skin-mounted markers and to compare it to in vivo measures derived from dynamic CT images and musculoskeletal model estimates. <br/>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two participants performed a supine knee flexion-extension motion with a grid of 42 retroreflective markers placed on the right knee during four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) measurement and optical motion capture. A patellar identification algorithm (PIA) was developed to estimate the PF translations in the medial ‚Äì lateral (ML), superior- inferior (SI) and anterior ‚Äì posterior (AP) directions. PF translations were determined by four different methods: CT bone geometry-based (CT_BONES), CT marker grid-based (CT_GRID), optical motion capture marker grid-based (OMC_GRID) and by musculoskeletal modeling (OMC_MODEL). To evaluate the feasibility of our method we first compared CT_BONES to CT_GRID. Next, results obtained by different measurement types (CT_GRID and OMC_GRID) and results obtained by two different marker-based methods (OMC_GRID and OMC_MODEL) were compared. To compare ranges of motions, patellar excursions relative to the femur were evaluated and compared for all knee angles (KA_ALL) and for knee angles &gt; 20¬∞ (KA_ENGAGED).<br/>RESULTS: Differences in patellar excursions given by CT_BONES and CT_GRID during KA_ENGAGED were less than 4 mm and RMSEs less than 3 mm. These differences were less than 5 mm between CT_GRID and OMC_GRID (RMSE: 5 mm) and less than 16 mm between OMC_GRID and OMC_MODEL (RMSE: 10 mm) for knee angles lower than 20¬∞. Larger differences in patellar excursions and RMSEs were seen during KA_ALL.<br/>CONCLUSION: PF translations could be measured using a marker grid with an accuracy within 3 mm for knee angles larger than 20¬∞ (i.e. during patellar engagement). However, our method performed worse for knee angles smaller than 20¬∞ flexion (an accuracy within 12 mm). The findings of this study provide valuable baseline knowledge for non-invasive, marker-based patellar tracking. Future studies should include larger sample sizes to allow for proper validation.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Recent research shows that bias exists against different types of speech, including non-native accents, in state-of-the-art (SOTA) ASR systems. To attain inclusive speech recognition, i.e., ASR for everyone irrespective of how one speaks or the accent one has, bias mitigation is essential and necessary. In this thesis, two SOTA ASR systems (one is based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the other is based on the transformer architecture) are built to uncover and quantify the bias against non-native accents. Here I focus on bias mitigation against non-native accents using two different approaches: data augmentation and by using more effective training methods. For data augmentation, an autoencoder-based cross-lingual voice conversion (VC) model is used to increase the amount of non-native accented speech training data in addition to data augmentation through speed perturbation. Moreover, I investigate two training methods, i.e., fine-tuning and Domain Adversarial Training (DAT), to see whether they can utilize the available non-native accented speech data more effectively than a standard training approach. Experimental results show for the transformer-based ASR model: (1) adding VC-generated and speed-perturbed data to train the ASR model gives the best bias mitigation performance and the lowest word error rate (WER); (2) fine-tuning reduces the bias against non-native accents but at the cost of native accent performance; and (3) compared with the standard training method, DAT does not leads to further bias reduction. While for the RNN-based ASR model, all the 4 bias mitigation approaches do not show obvious benefits.","Bias Mitigation; Speech recognition; Data augmentations; voice conversion; speed perturbation; domain adversarial training; Fine-Tuning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The current planning process and the generation and collection of throughput times relies heavily on experience-based information. Generating throughput times with data analysis could contribute to the creation of a more accurate and predictable project planning. The proposed method is necessary since the current planning process in the construction industry has a number of factors that obstruct a direct path to implementing data analysis. The current planning process is analyzed by a number of interviews with project planners and additional talks with a panel of experts in the planning process. A literature review is used to analyze how other industries use data analysis in their processes and what conditions are necessary to make data analysis possible in a planning process. Additional interviews are used to find the possibilities of data analysis in the planning process. A case study of one infrastructure construction project is used to find the missing aspects in the current planning process that would possibly enable data analysis. The case study is analyzed by following the steps of the Cross Industry Standard Procedure for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). The final product of this research is an alternative version of the CRISP-DM method. This method is focused on establishing a database filled with planning information, design information and combining those two datasets. It proposes steps to avoid undermining currently present intricate negotiation processes between contractor and subcontractor. The method makes sure the database is expanded and diversified and that proper evaluations steps are in place and that a benchmark is met in the accuracy of output values. The steps are divided in separate cycles to be applied on individual construction activities (e.g., sheet piles) since there is so little information available and it would not be feasible and justified to implement the steps on all construction activities. It is recommended that the proposed method is used to provide a proof of concept of generating detailed throughput times of construction activities in the planning process of the construction industry. This proof of concept is necessary to expand the data mining operation and try to fit evidence-based information in the workflow of project planners.","Project planning; Data analysis; AEC industry; Throughput times; Data driven; CRISP-DM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Not only has the chassis design improved substantially, the addition of things such as airbags and seat belts has significantly reduced the fatality rate of passengers involved in traffic accidents. A more recent development are driver assistance systems such as the anti-lock braking system (ABS) and the electronic stability program (ESP). ABS prevents wheel lock during emergency braking and ESP preserves lateral stability. These are active systems designed to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle and prevent dangerous situations from occurring.<br/><br/>One type of accident that has not been addressed enough by these driver assistance systems is the rollover accident. Though a relatively infrequent occurrence, rollover accidents are extremely dangerous. According to statistics from the NHTSA the passenger fatality rate for rollover accidents is almost fourteen times as high compared to the overall accident fatality rate. In fact, despite its infrequent occurrence, rollover accidents account for 33\% of all passenger vehicle fatalities. This highlights the need for a rollover prevention system in modern vehicles.<br/><br/>The aim of this thesis is to design an accurate yet computationally light rollover prevention controller.

In this work, the novel Predictive Load Transfer Ratio (PLTR) is used to estimate rollover state. This rollover detection method has good accuracy and does not require special measuring equipment. Moreover, the PLTR has slight predictive properties as well. This is then coupled with a model predictive controller (MPC) in order to actively prevent rollover, as opposed to a more reactive feedback controller. The controller is designed using differential equations derived from a two-track vehicle model in order to keep it as computationally light as possible. A benchmark controller is also designed using the same MPC framework with another rollover detection method.<br/><br/>The controllers are then tested in a virtual environment, with the test vehicle performing the fishhook maneuver which induces rollover in the vehicle. Analysis from the results of the simulation show that the proposed rollover prevention controller has better rollover prevention properties compared to the benchmark controller while being more efficient as well. However, this comes at the cost of reference yaw rate tracking. Based on these results, future work can be done to merge this controller with an ESP system where it only activates in critical rollover scenarios.","Model Predictive Control; Rollover prevention; Vehicle control; Vehicle dynamics; Rollover detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

(mentor); Glazunov, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","From 2019 into 2021, phishing incidents tripled, while phishing was found to be the largest used cyberattack vector. One commonly used type of phishing is a credential phishing attack over email. This is an act where an attacker tries to steal credential information from a target via a phishing website. This phishing website is delivered to the target over email. Even though much research has been done on the detection of such attacks, this rise in incidents was not prevented. In this thesis, it was found that a credential phishing attack over email consists of four phases, with an important phase being the attack conduction phase. This attack conduction phase comprises four stages. Most phishing detection systems focus on two of these stages, the ‚Äôemail received‚Äô stage and the ‚Äôwebsite visited‚Äô stage. Though, all research focused on either of the two stages, not a combination of both. Every research handled phishing emails and phishing websites as isolated entities. Also for any other stage, no research on detection was found comprising more than one stage in any of the phases in the credential phishing attack chain. To perform this research, a dataset containing both benign and phishing emails has been selected. The dataset originates from a combination of an openly available dataset and private datasets. Each email used originates from the period from 2015 up to 2022. To increase phishing detection capabilities, a more holistic approach to the phishing attack chain was introduced in this thesis. Emails and any (phishing) websites in that email were handled as one entity. This opened up new phishing detection capabilities. Features have been identified that made, amongst other aspects, use of brand recognition in both email and website. To extract these features, a brand recognition system has been created. This system is able to detect the logos of brands in emails and websites and name the brand associated with that logo. The system consists of a combination of neural networks and Google reverse image search. An XGBoost algorithm has been built on top of these brand recognition features. This resulted in a phishing detection system which was able to predict phishing emails from the dataset with a precision of .834 and a recall of .836. The extraction of the brand recognition features took on average 70.18 seconds per email. Though, this execution time grows linearly with the number of URLs present in an email. By building a phishing detection system of features using information from a combination of email domains, website domains, website URL redirects, certificates, email content such as brand names in text, domain registration dates, DMARC and SPF, an XGBoost model could be created with a precision of .957 and a recall of .943. The extraction of those features took 25.57 seconds on average. By combing all feature types (both brand recognition and non-brand recognition types), a precision of .967 and a recall of .947 could be obtained with an XGBoost model. This was called the ‚ÄôFusion module‚Äô. This Fusion module thus shows very decent phishing detection capabilities on the dataset. Using the same holistic approach as before, another phishing detection system was proposed. For this holistic approach, systems performing phishing detection at several stages in the credential phishing attack chain were combined into a single classification system. A Structure module has been designed and created, performing phishing detection solely on emails. This ‚ÄôStructure module‚Äô used 68 features focusing on the structural aspects of an email. The best classification performance of this model was obtained with an XGBoost algorithm, which had a precision of .977 and a recall of .957. A ‚ÄôWebsite module‚Äô performed phishing detection on whether a website was likely to be a phishing website. It used a simpler version of the brand recognition system used in the Fusion module. This module obtained a precision score of .661 and a recall of .775. The prediction of these two models for an email, along with the prediction of the Fusion module, was used as input for another machine learning model. A Support Vector Machine model was selected, and this model was then able to perform phishing detection on the dataset with a precision of .985 and a recall of .974. This holistic system thus showed improved performance over the individual prediction systems. The holistic system was able to increase overall phishing detection by combining phishing detection systems from different stages in a credential phishing attack over email.","Phishing Detection; Cyber Security; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

This is widely attributed to the fast changing and dynamic environment of construction projects. It is argued that the project management mostly used has a traditional and conservative approach which is incapable of dealing with contemporary projects and its constant changes, creating a growing need amidst practitioners to employ a flexible approach. Within the changes arising in projects the type being accredited as the one with most significant impact is design change. Thus, the purpose of this project will be to provide an insight on how the implementation of flexibility in project planning helps manage design change causes. <br/><br/>Firstly, a qualitative research will be carried out to create a theoretical framework and answer the first three research sub-questions. Firstly, an extensive literature review is conducted to gather information on flexibility in project management and planning, and changes in construction projects. Following, exploratory interviews with DPR‚Äôs practitioners is performed to complement the findings in the available literature. As a result of this first step the causes of design changes in projects will be established, as well as the different flexibility recourses to be used in the planning of projects. These two will act as the input for the next step.<br/><br/>Secondly, a quantitative research will be conducted to analyze the relationship between the causes of design change and the flexibility recourses already established. These two will act as two sets of variables and a correlation analysis will be performed. For this to be possible, the causes of design change and flexibility recourses are translated into statements and assessed by the use of a survey. In total 115 responses were used for the correlation analysis. <br/><br/>Furthermore, from this correlation analysis 10 significant correlations were found which were comprised by 3 flexibility recourses. As well, some open questions in the survey introduced the mindset of respondents about flexibility and its practices. From all this, two main conclusions were established.<br/><br/>The first one is that the use of the flexibility recourse ‚Äúcross functional and multi-disciplinary teams‚Äù helps to reduce the appearance of design change causes in projects. It is recommended to explore the different ways in which this recourse can be used and improve. In the Implementation Roadmap are some suggestions that can be implemented in a practical way. This flexibility recourse used in the planning helps managing design changes in construction projects by reducing their appearance. The second one is that the use of the flexibility recourse ‚Äúincremental planning‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinuous locking‚Äù does not help reduce the appearance of design change causes in projects but evokes them. However, the possibility of using these recourses to manage the design changes once they arise in projects is still viable. This flexibility recourse used in planning helps in managing design changes as a reactive measure.","Flexibility; Construction Projects; Planning; Design Change; Change Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

With this constant stream of data, the dynamic organization of waste collection schedules is enabled as containers are visited for collection only when it is necessary, which consequently leads to demand-responsive services. Domain experts attest that operating a demand-responsive service brings financial and environmental gains to a waste collection service, but it simultaneously introduces complete variability in the system which is undesirable in real-life operations. To solve this problem and consequently optimize the waste collection service‚Äôs performance, domain experts stress the need for a balanced trade-off between dispatch consistency and flexibility. This means, being able to exploit to the highest degree possible the benefits of demand-responsive operations, while also maintaining a certain level of dispatch consistency when demand varies from day to day. This research focused on developing a solution approach to solve the IoT-based waste collection problem, which is derived from the knowledge and requirements of the domain. The use of the knowledge of the domain is significant as it ensures that the model is tailored and applicable to a real-life IoT-based waste collection service.

Hence, precise orbit determination of satellites is crucial for the success of Earth observation satellites like the Sentinel family of satellites. TU Delft is an analysis center of the Copernicus precise orbit determination Quality Working Group and provides orbit solutions of Sentinel satellites for the external validation of the Sentinel orbits computed by the Copernicus Precise Orbit Determination Service. The GIPSYX/RTGx software is used for orbit determination using a reduced dynamic approach. <br/><br/>Existing research has focused on the overall accuracy of the orbit solutions to improve orbit accuracy. However, knowledge of the overall accuracy cannot provide much information about modeling errors. In this research, a data analysis approach was taken to aid the identification of the sources of errors in TU Delft's precise orbit determination strategy of the Sentinel satellites. From a thorough study of the precise orbit determination strategy, a set of parameters were selected for analysis, and a database was created for each satellite. Data analysis methods were customized to create a data analysis framework for the orbit determination data analysis. This framework was applied to the orbit determination data of Sentinel 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3B satellites, and the results were interpreted.<br/><br/>The two most common sources of error speculated were errors in the antenna phase center offset or phase center variations, and errors in the location of the center of mass of the satellite. Recommendations were issued regarding ways to confirm the error sources.

Increased mechanical forces result in fracture of the growth plate. Factors increasing the mechanical forces include for example obesity and endocrine disorders. As a result of the fracture a shift of the bone shaft towards the femur head occurs, causing mobility issues and pain. A treatment option for these patients is an intertrochanteric osteotomy with plate fixation. Restoring range of motion and pain reduction are the main aims of the surgery. <br/><br/>This intertrochanteric osteotomy alters the femur anatomy, resulting in a mismatch between bone and conventional plate fixation. These plates do not fit to the reconstructed bone, resulting in high chances of plate failure. The best option for these patients is to use patient-specific designed bone plates for femur fixation. Optimal mechanical properties of the patient-specific plate are important in limiting plate failure. These properties are dependent on design parameters, which can be adapted dependent on patient criteria and anatomy. Investigations towards patient-specific bone plates and the optimal design parameters for efficient and stable fracture fixation is lacking.<br/><br/>The focus of this study is on a specific SCFE patient case treated with corrective osteotomy using a patient-specific Ti-6Al-4V plate and screws for bone fixation and stability. A valid numerical model (i.e., finite element analysis (FEA)) is created, with physiological loading corresponding to two leg stance and walking, for an initial designed (ID) patient-specific bone plate to analyse plate performance. Screw configuration analysis and topology optimization of the ID plate were performed to design an alternative topology optimized (TO) plate. Biomechanical experiments with digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were performed for mechanical strength analysis and validation of the finite element model (FEM).<br/><br/>Both ID and TO plate were able to withstand two leg stance loading conditions according to both FEA and experimental testing. For walking loading conditions the ID plate showed instability, which could result in higher probability of failure in the plating construct. Quasi-static compression experiments showed failure in the most lateral proximal screw in all tests. The failure in the screws was caused by high bending moments. Optimization of the ID plate resulted in an alternative plate design in SCFE treatment. The TO plate consisted of six screws, decreasing plate length by 18.1%. The TO plate had a variable thickness, where thickness was increased around the lateral side of the plate compared to the ID plate. <br/><br/>The steps followed in this study to design a patient-specific implant and evaluation plate mechanical behaviour with FEM and additional experimental testing have shown to be adequate in investigating plate performance and can be used in the evaluation of newly designed patient-specific bone plates in SCFE patients. <br","Patient-specific implant; Finite element analysis; Topology optimization; Femur; Bone fixation; slipped capital femoral epiphysis; Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-05-20","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The safety of a commercial aircraft is a factor to consider from the early stages of its design to guarantee that this one's structure can protect the occupants inside in a low-speed crash. In an aircraft's primary structure such as a fuselage, where the occupants and cargo should be protected, the design regulations imposed by the EASA have been applied for decades to conventional metallic designs. These designs had aluminum as the main constituent for being a lightweight material. Nevertheless, this project improves a component's design from a fully thermoplastic fuselage. While two commercial aircraft (A350, and B787) have already implemented some composite parts in their design to aim for sustainable and lightweight components, thermosets were the composites used in primary structures mainly. Composite materials do not present the plasticity metals do, which means that the regulations from EASA can no longer apply in the A350 and B787 hybrid designs. With the introduction of composite materials in these aircraft, organizations like the FAA and EASA had to write some new guidelines for these aircraft structures. These enable the protection of the passengers and cargo from the loads exerted on the aircraft during a survivable crash. Therefore, the new regulations are the ones taken into account for this thesis project, since these can be applied to similar composite structural designs, such as the fully thermoplastic fuselage section, whose numerical model is inherited from the Clean Sky STUNNING project. <br/><br/>What is wanted for the fuselage section's crashworthiness is for its structure to absorb as much energy as possible from the crash. All while minimizing the peaks of force that this one experiences. That way, the loads that arrive at the cabin of the aircraft are reduced and the structure becomes safer for a low-speed crash of under 30 ft/s (about 10 m/s), meaning that the passengers inside have a higher chance of survival and it is less probable they suffer from severe injuries. That is the aim of this project, focusing only on the structure's behavior caused by the changes in the fuselage struts. <br/><br/>The numerical analyses performed in LS-DYNA increase single components‚Äô structural complexity until optimizing the layup of a tube to improve its crashworthiness behavior. It is after this optimization that the component is introduced as a strut in the STUNNING fuselage section. To further improve its global crushing in low-speed crushing conditions, the struts (or energy absorbers) keep the square geometry cross-section from the tube exercise, as well as the optimized layup. However, these are changed in size to improve the fuselage‚Äôs crushing behavior with little to no increase in mass. This study considers a fuselage section that neglects the passengers‚Äô mass, their cargo, and the upper part of the fuselage airframe in the section's model. Considering only the cargo mass for six passengers on the model causes a change in the fuselage‚Äôs final design crashworthiness, which proves that a more representative crushing conditions setup should be considered in future studies to better predict the structure‚Äôs crushing behavior numerically.","Finite Element Analysis; Finite Element Modeling; LS-DYNA; LS-OPT; Numerical Analysis; Crashworthiness; Thermoplastic Composite; Fuselage design; strut; Aircraft; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

This has started a discussion on what type of damage is caused by earthquakes. These discussions are typical in the forensic engineering field, especially in complex cases. The problem is the lack of regulations, in terms of standardizations and uniformization. <br/>To solve that problem, experts can be provided with an independent tool which can contribute to the investigation of the cause of building damage. The tool can help to indicate potential damage causes. This will support the findings of experts. Also, it can draw attention to overlooked damage causes. <br/>The tool is based on relations found in a database of damage cases that have been determined earlier. The database consists of damage cases in the Groningen province. Not all available damage cases were incorporated in this thesis, because processing the damage reports to a database was a labour-intensive job. The analysed dataset consists of 1830 damage cases in 49 buildings. Experts were able to determine the cause of damage in 1180 of these damage cases, which results in a ratio of 64.4% known cases. Only the known cases where applied in the analysis. The buildings were located in seven different areas in the province of Groningen. <br/>Each analysed damage case consists of a damage cause and a description. A description has been structured in 191 characteristics. These characteristics have been categorised into three types: building characteristics, context characteristics and damage characteristics. Building characteristics say something about the function, materials and size of the building. Context characteristics explain the sub soil, vibration sources and external forces in the surrounding of the building. Damage characteristics describe how damage is presented in terms of position, location and shape of damage.<br/>Whether the found relations can be deployed in practice, depends on how useful those relations are. Useful is defined as reliable and meaningful. Reliable is how a found pattern performs according to a test, mostly measured in terms of accuracy or coefficient of determination. Meaningful is whether the found relations are logical to be explained by literature or plausible damage situations. The pattern recognition can introduce some relations and can provide them with a reliability value. However, if the relations are not explainable, they do not mean anything for use in practice.<br/>The relations in these data were found by deploying pattern recognition methods. Two algorithms were utilized as a pattern recognition method: decision tree and linear regression. A decision tree algorithm splits the data into groups by applying thresholds on case characteristics. These thresholds can be made visual in a decision tree figure. Linear regression tries to obtain a target value by means of a linear relation of characteristics. Therefore, the linear regression algorithm determines the slope value of each characteristic. <br/>Classification analyses were done with decision trees on six damage cause categories. The results of that type of analysis were capable of determining if or which damage was caused by a certain cause. Linear regression was performed in order to find regression relations where the technical attributability of a damage cause could be calculated for each case. In the more complex task of regression analysis, only three damage cause categories were suitable for finding a relation. <br/>To determine whether damage was caused by earthquakes, earthquake load in terms of PGV is an important characteristic. Also, the age of a building and trees has a possible significant influence on the occurrence of earthquake damage, according to the found pattern. A relation between those last two characteristics and earthquake damage is not described in literature. Besides that, this decision tree pattern seems to be the most useful pattern for in practice.<br/>Another interesting finding is that hindered deformation mostly occurred at the inside of a building. Combined with other characteristics, a pattern on this damage cause performed with the highest score in this thesis. It has an accuracy of 77%. This means that 77% of the cases in the test set were correctly predicted by the produced classification decision tree. However, the found relation with the characteristics is not always explainable or meaningful so as to be applied in practice. More conclusions of classification analysis are shown in Table 1.<br/>&lt;Table 1, See abstract in report&gt;<br/>The presented findings above are classification relations. Regression analyses were difficult to execute. A desired positive coefficient of determination (R2) could not be reached without subjective interference in the pattern recognition. The best regression result was obtained on damage caused by earthquakes. It had a R2 of 0.48. Which means that 48% of the data was describable in a linear relation. More conclusions of regression analysis are shown in Table 2.<br/>&lt;Table 2, See abstract in report&gt;<br/>It has been interesting to study the relation between characteristics and damage causes. However, the results are not of decisive importance. The building and context characteristics supported by literature were not always selected or applied properly by the pattern recognition. Also, the potential of damage characteristics was not recognized by the algorithms. Nonetheless, the results of earthquake related damage seem promising. They even indicate characteristics which may be worth investigating more closely. <br","Building Damage; Pattern Recognition; Forensic engineering; Groningen earthquakes; Damage causes; Case characteristics; Damage characteristics; Context characteristics; Building characteristics; Decision Tree; Linear Regression; Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Thin cap fibroatheromas are plaques with a high risk of causing clinical events due to rupture and espousal of thrombogenic components to the bloodstream. The rupture of the plaque is not yet fully understood and for this reason, tissue engineered plaques were created in a previous study to assess the rupture of the plaques based on the displacement field registered with Digital Image Correlation during a uniaxial tensile experiment. The knowledge of the material properties of the tissue-engineered fibrous cap structures makes it possible to link deformations to external loads and contributes to the understanding of plaque rupture. The study aims to create a pipeline for local mechanical property characterisation of tissue engineered fibrous plaque structures.<br/>Methods: In this novel method inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) was combined with the Differential Evolution machine learning algorithm to assess global and local mechanical properties of tissue engineered fibrous plaque structures. The method required three main steps. Step one was the implementation of the uniaxial tensile test into a computational model using ABAQUS version 2016 Finite Element Method (FEM) software. To couple loads and deformations the hyperelastic reduced polynomial function of second order was implemented in the FEM. The characterisation of the c10 [kPa] and c_20 [kPa] parameters in the model is the main focus of this study. After the creation of the FEM, the computed displacement field and the previously registered DIC displacement field were implemented into the iFEM pipeline. Preliminary to the experimental data study, the pipeline was tested on a synthetically generated displacement field, in order to investigate the expected accuracy of the method. In step two the global mechanical properties of the fibrous plaque structures were investigated, using the assumption of homogeneous material property distribution in the samples. The resulting material properties after the global estimation served as an initial guess for the local estimation procedure. In step three the local material properties were investigated by creating sections with independently variable material properties, thus introducing heterogeneous distribution of material properties within the samples.<br/>Results: The global mechanical property assessment was carried out successfully and the resulting material properties are within the range of previously reported stiffness values of plaques with a similar composition. Local mechanical properties were characterised using up to twelve independently variable material parameters to investigate the heterogeneous mechanical behaviour of the constructs. <br/>Conclusion: During this project a new method was established to assess the local mechanical properties of tissue engineered fibrous cap structures. The pipeline shows high potential to be useful when investigating plaque rupture in a controlled environment using tissue engineered constructs. The knowledge of local material properties in combination with local deformations is a great addition to the understanding of plaque rupture.","Atherosclerosis; Plaque; inverse Finite Element Method; Material Properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Because they are not incorporated into a single digital ecosystem, the journey from door to door is becoming less seamless the more mobility providers are added to the market. The goal of this thesis is to fully understand what exactly constitutes seamless mobility and how it can be incorporated into the Dutch mobility sector. Consolidating research presented in this thesis in combination with previous research, a full traveller journey map is constructed in which anti- seamless behaviour is identified. Checking in to both a train station gate and a shared modality are the least seamless aspects of the journey. Therefore a new novel seamless interaction idea is presented. The proposed interaction is essentially the inverse of the current situation revolving around the idea of a wireless digital handshake. Wherein the old scenario the traveller must physically present a modality-specific identifier to a permanently closed barrier i.e. gate or moped, a traveller now carries a small modality non-specific token which can be detected by a gate at the train station or by a parked shared modality if it is in close proximity. Check-in gates at the train station are now permanently open and subsequently will only close when a valid token is not detected i.e. the digital handshake cannot be made. The same goes for checking in on a shared modality. Shared modalities are permanently unlocked and turned on and will cut the power, apply the brakes, or sounds an alarm when a valid token is not detected i.e. the digital handshake cannot be made. The combination of the wireless technologies PKES and UWB are selected. The introduction of the aforementioned seamless mobility scenario is dependent on the integration of public transportation and shared mobility services. Based on interviews with a municipality, a shared mobility provider, desk research, and leveraging the future introduction of Account Based Ticketing, nine strategic interventions are proposed. Now made possible by the strategic blueprint, research is done on how future travellers will react to the reimagined seamless mobility scenario. This is done through a series of interaction prototyping tests. Insights are translated in a redesigned travel token, a seamless train station gate, and a seamless scooter. A demonstrator prototype is built for attendees at the thesis defence to experience the reimagined seamless travel scenario.","Seamless; Mobility; Strategy; Embodiment; Concept; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Degree Master Thesis in Strategic Product Design and Integrated Product Design","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, maturing gas turbine technology is a big bottleneck towards this goal and hence, this project focuses on the technical and economic feasibility of a new type of propulsion system, called Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell- Gas Turbine or SOFC-GT hybrid propulsion system. SOFC- GT, even though being a low TRL technology, has the potential to reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and operation costs, making it a suitable candidate for a future propulsion system.<br/><br/>This research concludes that in order to achieve the full potential of the SOFC-GT hybrid, engine parameters like BPR, FPR and cooling air requirements need to be changed. The Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) for the propulsion system has decreased by 6.03% and 19.89% for 1 MW and 4 MW fuel cell power output in Off-Design (Cruise) condition. Along with this, core mass flow rate or size, cooling air requirement and Turbine Inlet Temperature for Cruise condition has decreased. The emission results show that the NOx emissions have been reduced by 29.11% and 78.05% respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that the thermodynamic efficiency is most sensitive to engine parameters but the impact of fuel cell parameters is increasing as the fuel cell power output is increased.<br/><br/> The economic analysis done in this study shows that the SOFC-GT hybrid is not feasible for the commercially available fuel cell because of the substantial increase in weight of the propulsion system. However, the propulsion system will become feasible at the fuel cell system specific power of 2.30 kW/kg and 2.10 kW/kg for no emission tax and highest emission tax scenario respectively at a fuel price of $ 6/kg. Along with this, increasing the fuel cell power output leads to the increase in required specific power for fuel cell or has a negative impact on the overall economics. The overall economics of the aircraft is most sensitive to aircraft parameters but increasing the fuel cell power output decreases sensitivity substantially. In the end, the emission has a low impact on the overall economics of the aircraft. <br/><br/>This research shows that it is possible to integrate a SOFC with the turbofan if the fuel cell technology improves in the future. Along with this, the research provides multiple novel methodologies for technical and economic analysis of the SOFC-GT hybrid.","Gas Turbine; TSFC, Thrust-specific fuel consumption; Aircraft; Feasibility; Hybrid System; Propulsion system; Integrated; emission; PyCycle; SOFC-GT; Efficiency; Solid oxide fuel cell; Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","","52.0022, 4.3736"

The current definition of integrating sustainability in projects is ambiguous (Schipper, Sivius, &amp; Nedeski, 2012) and stakeholders hold different perspectives on the topic. Integrating sustainability in projects has greatly shifted from the concept of reusing, recycling of materials in projects to reducing the delays in the projects to save the CO2 emissions and in increasing energy efficiencies in the projects (McPhee &amp; Dias, 2020). Although, integrating sustainability into projects has gained traction in recent years, project management profession has faced difficulties in incorporating sustainability principles in large infrastructure projects especially in first of a kind project (‚ÄúProgress of PM‚Äù, 2022). This is because, technologies or methods to be employed in these projects are unknown and there is no precedent or project expertise to guide these projects. This has proven to be vulnerable to severe cost and schedule overruns and performance deficiencies. These projects are built with a strong motive to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions but, due to the delays by new technology or methods involved, saving carbon dioxide emissions during the construction have been proved difficult (‚ÄúProgress of PM‚Äù, 2022). The research is thus grounded by the gap of exploring tools/practices to reduce the delays in first of a kind project which will aid in saving the CO2 emissions and in meeting the energy efficiencies targets.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Depending on the situation, different gait patterns can be observed, e.g., moving around the house, performing different sports, or even in case of injury. Even though the gait has been analyzed thoroughly for many decades, there are still some unexplored aspects that require more insight, especially those related to the influence of various parameters on the optimality and diversity of gait patterns. Many gait trajectory optimization strategies have been proposed in literature, however, most of them focus merely on optimizing for one metric (e.g., energy efficiency or joint torque). In this study, a multi-metric gait optimization framework is proposed, simultaneously accounting for joint torque, fatigue, and manipulability. To that end, 45 gaits, varying in stride length, step height, and walking speed, were recorded in a motion capture experiment, together forming a solution space of dynamically stable and physiologically feasible gaits, for the proposed optimization framework. Specific user needs (gait requirements) can be accounted for by adjusting the optimization weights, after which brute-force optimization is applied to either analyze the gait within the collected subspace or select the optimal gait with respect to desired parameters. Results are presented for a baseline case (with all optimization weights set to one), which can be used as a tool for gait analysis, in particular giving insights into specific aspects of the gait, e.g., joint loading, long-term performance, and capacity to sustain ground reaction forces (GRFs).","gait optimization; multi-metric; joint fatigue; manipulability analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

However, the results for certain flows are inaccurate. The main source of error in popular RANS turbulence models is the Boussinesq approximation, assuming a linear relationship between the Reynolds stress anisotropy and the mean rate of strain. Experiments show this is simply not correct. Most state of the art research in data driven turbulence modelling is focused on replacing or augmenting this linear relationship.<br/><br/>The research presented in this report implements two corrections, one to the Reynolds stress anisotropy and another to account for the modified production of turbulent kinetic energy by the modified anisotropy tensor. The magnitude of the required corrections is found by comparing RANS simulations to more detailed CFD algorithms such as large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation.<br/><br/>A state of the art symbolic regressions framework named deep symbolic regression (DSR) is used to find explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models. DSR uses a recurrent neural network to create expressions and is able to find complex expressions that fit the data very well.<br/><br/>The expressions found with DSR are implemented in a custom k-omega SST turbulence model and validated in CFD. Large improvements over the standard turbulence model are achieved. The results are compared to results of the SpaRTA framework where the same method of corrections is applied. DSR is able to produce better fitting expressions and these result in improved flow fields over the best models found with SpaRTA. <br/><br/>The best model is also tested in a true prediction of a flow at a Reynolds number that is roughly three times as large as values encountered during training.

(mentor); Brand-de Groot, S.C.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","As new technologies will allow for a new kind of driving there is room for implementing innovative interior architecture in future luxury cars. The main goal for this master thesis was to find out what a user truly needs in a Mercedes EQ interior for a level 4 autonomous driving vehicle in a context around the year 2035. Furthermore, the design brief specified a sustainability frame as a key part of the design scope. <br/><br/>Problem<br/>One might think it is easy to imagine a vehicle that operates fully autonomously and in which a user is totally irresponsible for driving the vehicle. But before we arrive at this point, we will see cars transitioning from the way they are now through a stage in which a user is partly responsible for driving yet can partly disengage driving obligations in specific situations. Also, with the automotive industry being under increasing pressure to become sustainable and classic status obtaining features such as big engines mismatching this goal, Mercedes stated the desire to have the user gain status through being sustainable in a luxury vehicle. <br/><br/>Analysis<br/>To deliver a fresh insight to the industry and client it was chosen to use the Vision in Design-method. This method was fitting for envisioning a well-argued future context and to map likely behaviour of the Mercedes driver but also other people involved in this future context. Different attitudes in luxury automobiling were found and it was decided that the attitude of obtaining status by ‚Äòbeing a paragon of sustainable automobiling‚Äô would be the segment in which we would aim to position Mercedes EQ to subsequently pull the Mercedes-Benz brand as a whole into this direction. Furthermore, to make the concept Mercedes-fitting, an extensive analysis of the brand was executed to integrate a clear and expected link to specific elements of Mercedes‚Äô heritage in the design. <br/><br/>Vision<br/>Following the newly formulated strategy, a design vision was created. This vision covers a mission statement that aims to have Mercedes EQ users be a ‚Äòparagon of sustainable luxury automobiling‚Äô and to provide a ‚Äòcar interior in which the user can optimally be, considering everyday and real situations‚Äô. Multiple moods to cover these everyday and real situations were summed up, and it was found that a cosy old train coupe lounge served as a fitting interaction analogy for the desired interactions. In this analogy and through extensive brainstorming and sketching, a table and/or desk surface was found to be a key element in the interior around which the rest of the architecture could follow. <br/><br/>Design<br/>Extensive research and ergonomic reviews lead to a tangible design basis.<br/><br/>Evaluation <br/>The design tells an honest story in which the need to rush for users is decreased. The integrated elements are, also with the help of industry experts, well-argued and in a research based future context. They can be further detailed following the classic design for sustainability principles. The ideas were valued so much by Mercedes that, during this thesis, their research and development team put effort in helping with developing the proposition.<br","Design; Interior; Mobility; Car; Sustainable; Luxury; Future; Transport; ViP; Premium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Even though the airline business is not the first thing which comes to mind when regarding sustainability there are huge efforts in play to extend the life of airplanes and its corresponding components. This is done via remanufacturing. Remanufacturing can here be defined as:‚Äù Returning a used product to at least its original performance with a warranty that is equivalent to or better than that of the newly manufactured product‚Äù (Gunasekara, et al., 2018). Even though numerous attempts using traditional techniques like Lean have been tried at KLM E&amp;M, none have yielded the long term desired results, which is why a different approach is needed. Remanufacturing brings numerous problems with it, unknown to traditional manufacturing (Guide Jr &amp; Daniel, 2000). These problems result in the operational level of the organisation not having control over the process, which leads to subpar performances. Furthermore, a gap originates between higher level management and the operations, which leaves a lot of potential uncovered as well as discourage operational level progress. The proposed model is designed to help gain control over an uncontrolled process, improve its performance and sustain the newly found control, which is also the purpose of this research. This is all achieved using a more bottom-up integral approach. This proposed model is combined with the operational lean maturity model developed by Maasouman (Maasouman, 2015), in order to create a Remanufacturing Process maturity model, which indicates the maturity level of each aspect used in the Remanufacturing Process control model, resulting in a model which has both quantitative and qualitative aspects.","remanufacturing; Process control; maturity model; MRO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

The palm oil industry has been growing rapidly over the past decades, so that the amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) generated from the palm oil production has been increasing as well. The anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is a treatment solution that can remove organic pollutants from POME while generating methane as an energy source. In comparison to conventional anaerobic digestors, the AnMBR technology has an additional membrane unit that can produce effluent with higher water quality. More specifically, if ultrafiltration is applied, the AnMBR will be able to effectively remove bacteria from the effluent, making it suitable for direct fertigation (Uman et al., 2021; Bray et al., 2021). However, in cases where infectious viruses are also present, further disinfection method might be required. In this experiment, a lab-scale AnMBR system was used for POME treatment. In order to evaluate how well the system can perform in terms of pollutant removal and methane production, under the controlled experimental conditions, several criteria were monitored: (1) chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, (2) biomass growth, (3) biogas production, (4) digestion efficiency, and (5) volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation. A Long chain fatty acids (LCFA) analysis method was developed using the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), to elaborate on underlying conversion mechanisms. A COD balance analysis was also conducted. Factors that would potentially contribute to the COD gaps in the COD balance analysis were quantified and discussed in this paper as well to validate the experimental results. The solid retention time (SRT) was controlled at 140 days, and the organic loading rate (OLR) at 3 gCOD¬∑L-1¬∑d-1 during the first phase of the experiment, when synthetic POME and VFAs were added to the bioreactor. During the second phase, the SRT and the OLR of POME remained the same, whereas the VFAs were replaced by starch and the OLR of starch was increased, in order to simulate the real POME composition, because in addition to lipid, carbohydrate and protein are also found in POME. During Phase I, the AnMBR system could remove 98%-99% of the incoming COD, and produce about 5 L of methane each day. During Phase II, the microbes did not have enough time to adapt to the new experimental condition, but the stability of the AnMBR system could be achieved overtime, when the mixing is improved and the buffer solution is adjusted properly according to the pH variation. Although, based on the positive biomass net growth and the increased methane production, it could be predicted that adding carbohydrates to the feed for a more representative POME composition would promote biomass growth and methane production, suggesting that the AnMBR system would have higher potential when the real POME is used for energy recovery.","palm oil mill effluent (POME); anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR); anaerobic digestion (AD); ultrafiltration (UF); solid retention time (SRT); organic loading rate (OLR); chemical oxygen demand (COD); biomass; biogas; methane; volatile fatty acids (VFA); long chain fatty acids (LCFA); COD balance","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Heijne, K.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The project is done in the context of the visual thinking Agency Flatland. The aim of this project was to explore reverging in the context of visual thinking. <br/><br/>Reverging is the phase that bridges the diverging and converging phases in creative facilitation. The goal of reverging is to revisit and rearrange the options generated in the divergent phase to create a better understanding of all the options to select the best ones in the converging phase.<br/><br/>The initial design statement was to make reverging more deliberate at Flatland instead of implicit at Flatland. As reverging is a deliberate activity (Kalina, 2018: Heijne &amp; van der Meer, 2019).<br/><br/>DISCOVER<br/>To better understand the project's topic, a literature review, interviews with Flatland, and case studies have been conducted. <br/><br/>The literature review¬†concluded that reverging is essential for creating a shared understanding of the options generated in the divergent phase. Moreover, it was found that sketching and visualizing help externalize (tacit) knowledge. This enables the sharing, grounding, manipulation, and generation of ideas. Finally, transdisciplinary learning and knowledge creation can be supported by boundary objects, allowing the translation, transfer, and transformation of knowledge.<br/><br/>The interviews with Flatland reveal the different skills and characteristics needed as a facilitator or illustrator at Flatland, why visual thinking works according to Flatland, and how they would identify reverging in the Flatland process. <br/><br/>The case studies disclosed that the Flatland methodology is more a process flow to hold on to instead of a strict step-by-step plan that needs to be followed. Additionally, it revealed the success factors, risk factors, and requirements for fruitful reverging in visual thinking.<br/><br/>DEFINE<br/>Based on the findings from the discovery phase of the project a general model was constructed to bring all the findings together. The general model served as the starting point for the design requirements and opportunities.<br/><br/>In addition, reverging at Flatland has been described and analyzed more in-depth. The analysis revealed that there was no common knowledge about the concept of reverging. However, it was found that reverging was done at Flatland, but more unconsciously rather than deliberate. Two types of reverging moments at Flatland have been identified: (1) reverging exercises done with the client during a session and (2) the activity called whiteboarding, which is a separate session without the client to make thinking steps based on the output from the previous session.<br/><br/>This project focused on the second type of reverging moment because it is a formatted and formulated phase at Flatland, setting a clear boundary for highlighting the problems and developing a design. The main difference between reverging at Flatland compared to the rules described in theory is that it is done without the client. This may lead to the not-invented-here syndrome, which often results in the client's difficult acceptance and implementation of the outcome, according to Buijs &amp; van der Meer (2013).<br/><br/>DESIGN BRIEF<br/>Based on the output from the general model, design opportunities have been identified. The chosen opportunity for this project was to guarantee client ownership by involving the client more in the whiteboarding reverging process. A design statement and requirements have been formulated to guide the final design‚Äôs creation. <br/><br/>Additionally, the metaphor of a magic map maker has been formulated to describe the selected opportunity. This narrative was used to make the findings from the research more concrete and get the conversation started.<br/><br/>DESIGN <br/>Different creative sessions have been held to come up with the starting point for a solution to guarantee client ownership. Based on the input from the co-creation sessions different minimum viable products were created iteratively. These have been discussed with Flatlanders and adapted according to the feedback obtained during the iteration rounds. <br/><br/>DELIVER <br/>The final design, the whiteboarding tool, consists of three sub-parts:<br/><br/>The Flatland workstyles, based on the narrative of the metaphor of the magic mapmaker, balancing the map maker and wizard workstyle throughout the entire process<br/>The Flatland journey is adapted from their current setup of the general project flow. The whiteboard phase was not included yet. The Flatland journey aims at making that explicit. Revealing the problem in the focus area (whiteboarding phase) of reverging steps happening without the involvement of the client and therefore the client potentially lacks ownership of the final outcome<br/>In order to solve this problem finally the Whiteboard canvas has been developed to help Flatland involve the client in the whiteboarding phase and make their reverging steps explicit so they can be shared and discussed with the client.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The impact of this project was created through (1) the research, (2) the metaphor, and (3) the tool. <br/><br/>The research highlighted the discrepancy between the literature and Flatland‚Äôs way of working. The gap served as the initial starting point for giving recommendations to Flatland and coming up with the final design. <br/>The metaphor served as a narrative for Flatland to talk about the highlighted problem and reflect on their workstyle.<br/>The whiteboard tool served as an intervention to do the whiteboarding in a more structured manner with the client's involvement. The canvas has been tested with members of the Flatland team and is ready to be used in Mural, Photoshop, or real life! <br/><br/>To conclude the project, the limitations have been highlighted, and future research directions have been proposed.","Reverging; Visual Thinking; Creative facilitation; Sketching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","51.923239462733356, 4.469197322043913"

The controlled environment of greenhouses enable data collection and precise control. Delphy's current solutions focus on the needs of the crop, but a grower also needs to consider the economic aspect of taking certain decisions on the greenhouse climate. A potential method for solving this complex problem is Constraint Programming (CP). In this work, the applicability of CP for the greenhouse economic optimal control problem will be studied. The contributions of this work are threefold; First, the greenhouse climate is modelled with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) machine learning models. Secondly, an LSTM model is embedded into a CP model. Lastly, the profit of the grower is optimised through this CP decision support system (DSS). The performed experiments show that both types of time-based machine learning models can model greenhouse temperature and humidity deficit with reasonable accuracy, while light and CO<sub>2</sub> are harder to predict. The correctness of the LSTM-in-CP embedding is validated. The implemented DSS is not yet practically applicable, as the search space is too large to come to reasonable results for realistic instances. For small instances however, the DSS is able to improve the decisions of the grower, demonstrating the potential of using CP for economic greenhouse decision making.","Neural Networks; Constraint Programming; Optimization; Horticulture; LSTM; TCN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior experimental works focused on parametric studies on transition location with limited measurements close to the step. In addition, studies using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) assume two-dimensional flow and consequently do not capture transition location. All of this makes comparison between existing experimental and numerical data rather cumbersome, hindering the problem understanding.</p><br/><p style=""line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">In light of this, the present study aims to close-examine the TS waves at the step to identify which are the relevant mechanisms that modify their growth and move transition upstream. To do so, this work presents an experimental and numerical investigation jointly conducted by TU Delft and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) on Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves interaction with a Forward-Facing Step (FFS). Experiments are conducted at the TU Delft low-turbulence anechoic wind tunnel (A-tunnel) on an unswept flat plate model. Single-frequency disturbances are introduced using controlled acoustic excitation. The temporal response of the flow in the vicinity of the step is measured using Hot-Wire Anemometry (HWA). In addition, the global effect of the step on laminar-turbulent transition is captured using Infrared Thermography (IR). Two-dimensional (2D) Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) performed at DLR provide detailed information at the step. Experimental and numerical comparison is performed in subcritical step conditions. At larger step heights only experimental data is provided.</p><br/><p style=""line-height:1.38;text-align: justify;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Experimental and DNS results in clean and subcritical step conditions present very good agreement. Both methods predict large distortion of the TS wave downstream of the step, where DNS results present different growth trends between streamwise and wall-normal components of the fundamental mode. Furthermore, while upstream of the step the TS waves exhibit exponential growth, downstream of it they present a complex growth behavior followed by regions where the perturbation energy production term changes sign along the streamwise direction. Finally, regions of highly negative and positive production seem to correlate with the tilting of TS waves in and against the mean shear direction, respectively. These findings point towards the presence of different growth mechanisms triggered by the step which could modify the level of amplification of disturbances far downstream.</p><br","Transition; Tollmien-Schlichting Waves; Roughness; Experiments; Acoustic Forcing; 2D DNS; Stability; Laminar Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the Netherlands, 362.000 people suffered from atrial fibrillation in 2019. During a catheter intervention, the tissue that causes atrial fibrillation is destroyed by heat generated by an alternating current exerted from an ablation catheter. Two problems of this treatment are over-ablation of the heart tissue and the non-contingent surrounding of scar tissue around the pulmonary veins. Better surgical outcomes can be obtained if an extra imaging technique is added to prevent these problems from occurring. Impedance spectroscopy has potential, it is already widely used for measurements and food characterization and it enables the measurement of the distinct dielectric properties and impedance of different tissue types. Based on the dielectric properties and impedance, different tissue types can be distinguished from each other and the surgeon can adapt his procedure according to this information.<br/><br/>The goal of this Master Thesis is to distinguish different tissue types in the radiofrequency range with impedance spectroscopy during a cardiac ablation procedure. Impedance data for this Master Thesis are gathered via impedance measurements on three porcine hearts with two-needle electrodes over a frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Ablated lesions are created with an electrosurgical knife in fulguration and pure cut mode. To distinguish between different tissue types with impedance spectroscopy there is a need for a parametric model that can parameterize the impedance spectra. This enables the comparison of different tissue types based on a couple of parameters instead of a complete spectrum. A parametric model is fitted to the measured impedance spectra and the resulting best-fit parameters are evaluated. The parametric model that is used is a series combination of a CPE model and a two-pole Cole impedance model. The CPE model models the electrode polarization contribution to the impedance spectrum. This way no a-priory knowledge regarding the electrode polarization is needed. The two-pole Cole impedance model models the tissue contribution to the impedance spectrum.<br/><br/>In the measurements that are performed in this Master Thesis, an increase in impedance is seen after ablation. The differences between the healthy and ablated measurements are mostly described by (significant) differences in the parameters of the CPE model (K and m) and the second Cole term R2, t2 and a2). The mean values of R2 and a2 increased after ablation, while the values of t2, K and m decreased after ablation for most measurements. Classification of healthy and ablated tissue is performed based on a formula consisting of a combination of these model parameters. The sensitivity and specificity are both around the 80%. This classification serves as a first impression, with the results indicating that discrimination of healthy from ablated tissue is possible with parametric modeling.<br","Impedance spectroscopy; Parametric modelling; Cardiac ablation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To achieve this, a seamless combination between the different modes is necessary. The Dutch train station operator NS tries to enhance the combination of the bike and train by providing a train station-based round-trip bikesharing (SBRT) scheme located at train stations throughout the country. This scheme allows users to rent a bike to connect the train station and their destination. The round-trip characteristic SBRT makes it unique in comparison to widely applied one-way bikesharing schemes. While on the latter a wide range of research exists, little research has been conducted on round-trip bikesharing, especially when being integrated into an existing public transport scheme. This paper aims to fill this gap by identifying potential temporal and weather-related determinants for SBRT-rentals of the Dutch SBRT-system OV-fiets using multiple linear regression (MLR). The results are compared with findings on one-way bikesharing schemes. The results are then used as an input to forecast short-term demand. To identify a best performing forecasting method, the statistical methods MLR and Prophet are compared with the neural-network based method Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). <br/>It is found that for hourly rentals in an SBRT-system, the highest explanatory power achieved with the number of train travelers leaving the corresponding train station, followed by temporal and weather-related determinants. Further, the magnitude of the correlation between the determinants and the hourly demand differs across the stations in the system. For forecasting, the performance of the methods differs across the stations and forecasted periods due to the stations' distinct characteristics. But, especially in times of uncertainty, LSTM is likely to outperform the others due to it's capability of adapting to short-term changes in the demand.","bikesharing; Long Short-term Memory; Multiple Linear Regression; Bike-train; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

A non-monotonic trend carries complex information which has outliers and nonessential signal values. The goal of the project is to motivate the usage of monotonic constraints to treat non-monotonic signals of a degrading component. The problem is presented as follows: Determining if the monotonic constrained method at a preprocessing step shall assist prognostics to estimate the remaining useful life of a component accurately. To explore this research, a monotonic constraint - Average Conditional Displacement (ACD) is used at the preprocessing step of a model, in comparison with regular preprocessing methods. The model is experimented on the NASAs simulated C-MAPSS datasets of turbofan engine and modelled with two prognostics algorithms. The model performance is measured<br/>with performance metrics.

The first one is signal design for accurate Time-of-Arrival estimation using a number of frequency separated signals. Rather than use a full UWB band, we will use sparse subband signals spanning the full band to construct a new virtual UWB signal. To evaluate the performance of the constructed signal, Cramer-Rao lower bound and auto-correlation are used. And given a given fixed bandwidth the number of subbands within a 1 GHz UWB channel, and optimal subbands' allocation will be found based on the evaluation results.¬†Our results show that when three 50 MHz subbands are used to construct a virtual 1GHz UWB signal, a lower CRLB and better auto-correlation performance can be reached when subbands are close to the edges of the virtual band. However, the auto-correlation still has multiple peaks, which poses a serious challenge for accurate time estimation.The second topic is to investigate the frequency dependence of the channel impulse response of subbands with different frequency separations. We propose a covariance calculation method to determine the frequency dependence which changes with frequency separation.To validate the method, different artificial UWB channels with distinct paths are given. The results show that covariances between the subband CIRs stay at a high level when measured at the direct path and the majority of interference caused by other paths can be eliminated by a wider bandwidth subband. Given UWB channels measured from 5 to 10 GHz with a link-budget of 120dB, the frequency dependence of the direct path and reflections are determined, different bandwidths and frequency separations are used, and the results show that the channel impulse response of the subbands will become different when measured at different center frequencies, where the difference increases with an increased frequency separation of the subbands. The correlation of the direct path is maintained over larger frequency distances than that of reflected paths.","Ultra-wideband; Subbands; Frequency dependence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

This research assesses the suitability of an existing civil helicopter noise model for the military helicopters of the RNLAF. In order to achieve this noise modeling platform HELENA, which uses hemispheres created for the Apache in a previous project, has been integrated as input data in this research. HELENA has previously been used for civil helicopters. Surrounding the Gilze Rijen Airport, the noise measuring network Casper is installed. From Caspers Noise Measuring Terminals (NMT), noise levels &#x1d43f;&#x1d434;,&#x1d45a;&#x1d44e;&#x1d465; and &#x1d446;&#x1d438;&#x1d43f; are extracted for every helicopter that passes by. These values are compared with the calculations from HELENA.<br/>For this research a set of flights has been selected, carefully keeping the limitations of both HELENA as well as Casper in mind. The most ideal flights would be steady, straight, symmetric and repeatable flights. Transit flights departing to or returning from a northeast positioned low-level flying area, encompass most of these requirements. These flights pass three NMTs. For a full year, all Apache flights passing these three NMTs were collected. The formation flights and flights with a maximum &#x1d43f;&#x1d434;,&#x1d45a;&#x1d44e;&#x1d465;&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;) relatively close to the background &#x1d43f;&#x1d434;,&#x1d45a;&#x1d44e;&#x1d465; ‚â§ 70&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;) were removed. In total 108 noise events were selected for the model-calculation comparison. In general, the noise events were underestimated by HELENA. The error, measurement minus calculation, showed a large difference with a mean of&#x1d707; = 4.9&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;) and variance of &#x1d70e; = 2.9&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;). Upon closer inspection, the performance varied amongst the NMTs. One NMT (58) had the least noise events after selection but produced the largest difference between measurement and calculation (&#x1d707; = 8.8&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;) and variance &#x1d70e; = 3.3&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;)). The NMT with the most (70) noise events produced the smallest error with a mean (&#x1d707; = 4.2&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;)) and variance (&#x1d70e; = 2.4&#x1d451;&#x1d435;(&#x1d434;)). The underestimation could be due to certain circumstances that influence the measurement but are not included in the calculation. No correlation could be found for the presence of wind, deviation in speed relative to the speed of the corresponding hemisphere, distance or addition of ground effect.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Ice released from hydrated silicates formed inside planetesimals might be the cause of this compositional gradient. One of the mechanisms known to cause significant heat in the early solar system is radiogenic heating by 26&#x1d434;&#x1d459;, so a different formation time for each Galilean moon could potentially explain a fully dehydrated Io, a low ice mass faction on Europa and ‚àº 50% ice mass fractions on Ganymede and Callisto.<br/>Aims: We aim to determine the mass fraction of hydrated silicates of the planetesimals in Jupiter‚Äôs CPD formed by radiogenic heating of 26&#x1d434;&#x1d459; to constrain the formation times of the Galilean moons.<br/>Methods: This is done using a numerical thermal evolution model capable of evolving planetesimals over time and altering the composition based on the internal temperature. Planetesimals are initiated with an ice mass fraction, temperature and ammonia ice concentration similar to the dust in the CPD. Their interior compositions alter by aqueous alteration, differentiation and dehydration.<br/>Results: Hydration of rocks inside planetesimals does not occur for formation times later than 4 Myr after Ca-Al inclusion (CAI) formation, and a mass fraction of hydrous rocks of 73% is formed for 3 Myr after CAI formation. Larger planetesimals able that produce hydrated silicates dominate the compositional evolution of the population. A reduction in ammonia concentration in the ice by 50% increases the time needed to create hydrated silicates at 3 Myr after CAI formation from 1.5 Myr to &gt; 2 Myr.<br/>Conclusions: If Io formed before 4 Myr, it should have lost its ice no later than 1 Myr to prevent aqueous alteration. The low ice mass fraction on Europa could be explained by planetesimals formed at 3 Myr after CAI formation over a period of 1.5 Myr with a hydrous rock mass fraction of 66%, able to release 6.3% ice mass by dehydration. If the interior of Ganymede differentiated by radiogenic heating, the planetesimals should be formed before 4 Myr after CAI formation. Callisto‚Äôs partially differentiated interior requires formation times of planetesimals after 4 Myr after CAI formation.","Galilean moons; Satellite formation; CPD; Short-lived radionuclides; Hydrated silicates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Many insights have been obtained regarding the positive effects of coastal dune vegetation on dune formation and growth in the past. Several recent studies have demonstrated the ability of both aboveground and belowground dune vegetation to reduce dune erosion during storms. <br/><br/>However, the impacts of dune vegetation during collision regime storm conditions are not taken into consideration in morphological numerical modeling. Consequently, it is unclear how to evaluate vegetation impacts during design assessments. Therefore, the goal of this research is to investigate the potential effect of dune vegetation on dune erosion during collision regime storm conditions and subsequently link this with dune rehabilitation projects. This research is divided into two parts.<br/><br/>First, the capability of the numerical model XBeach to simulate the potential effects of dune vegetation during the collision regime is investigated. Four vegetation approaches are identified in the model, which could possibly represent different dune vegetation effects. Using beach-dune profiles and erosion volumes obtained from two wave flume experiments, the performance and sensitivity of the vegetation approaches are tested in XBeach. Thereby, a distinction is made between the effect of aboveground vegetation: hydrodynamic altering and belowground vegetation: soil stabilization. The model results show that XBeach is capable of simulating dune erosion with vegetation during collision regime storm conditions. This can be primarily attributed to the increase of the critical slope in the avalanching module. This approach represents the soil stabilization effects of belowground vegetation. The application of the root model was added for even better simulations. This approach accounts for the additional root cohesion provided by belowground vegetation by increasing the critical velocity for sediment pickup. The values to be used for both vegetation approaches could not be defined systematically yet due to the small number of experiments assessed and little research found in the literature. It is recommended to obtain more information about the effect of dune vegetation on the stabilizing effects and the critical slope for avalanching. The application of a higher roughness value and the vegetation module, which both represent aboveground vegetation by altering the hydrodynamics, have shown to contribute insignificantly to erosion reduction in the examined cases. <br/><br/>The belowground soil stabilization approaches are applied in a case study to give a first indication of the applicability of XBeach at large-scale and in dune rehabilitation projects. An XBeach model of Beira, Mozambique was set up. A higher critical slope demonstrated profile evolution and erosion reduction in line with observations in the literature. During wave impact, the avalanching module is the most suitable approach to account for the erosion-reducing effect of belowground vegetation. The root model appears to be a more appropriate strategy for accounting for belowground vegetation during milder conditions and shorter storm duration. It was proven that XBeach has very good potential to evaluate the effectiveness of dune vegetation in the design phase. The case study illustrates that vegetation will significantly increase the erosion resistance of the flood dunes. The dunes with vegetation can handle an additional 20-30 centimeters design water level or 0.5-0.8 meter storm wave height without breaching compared to the same dune without vegetation. The design with vegetation has shown to be more robust. However, the approaches are based on different assumptions and limitations and therefore the results should be considered carefully. It is strongly advised to conduct more research in this relatively new study area.<br/><br/>This study investigates and proposes a method for quantifying the advantages of vegetation on dune erosion reduction. The relevance and added value of mature and robust dune vegetation for a resilient coastal dune system and protection against erosion and floods are confirmed. As a result, the incorporation of vegetation in dune rehabilitation projects is promoted.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br","XBeach; dune design; dune erosion; numerical modelling; vegetation; climate adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The Potential to Value Circle creates a structured way of working in which the potential of a waste stream is translated to value. Value is generated by combining the perspectives of material, stakeholders and context around a waste stream into a concept direction. Through this process, The Bin guides their clients to take the next steps in becoming part of a circular economy. <br/><br/>This project was done in collaboration with The Bin. The Bin is a startup in the circular economy. They help their clients to become part of a circular economy by creating circular concepts out of their waste streams and setting up a circular system around these concepts. These waste streams can be defined as products at their end-of-life or by-products from a production line.<br/><br/>Currently, the Bin bases its process on the circular frameworks the Value Hill (Achterberg et al., 2016), R9-list (Potting et al., 2017) and the Butterfly diagram (EllenMacArthur Foundation, 2019). These frameworks give the bin a high-level overview of circular value creation. However, they want to have a more step by step process that helps to turn waste streams into circular concepts. This was the essence of their request for this graduation project and resulted in the Potential to Value Circle.<br/><br/>The Potential to Value Circle approaches a waste stream from different perspectives, resulting in opportunities that get turned into a concept direction that uses the waste stream to move towards a circular economy. The Potential to Value Circle is built up in three phases, 1) Analysis, 2) Combining, and 3) Circular design goal. The first phase presents how an understanding of the elements around a waste stream can be created, by analysing material, stakeholders and context. Based on this, potentials are formulated. In phases 2 and 3, the potentials of phase 1 are combined, which allows translating the potentials of the waste stream into opportunities. With these opportunities, a concept direction is formulated that creates value. Three ways of applying the Potential to Value Circle are presented, on which the Workshop is elaborated further. The workshop shows how to work in three hours with the Potential to Value Circle to a circular design goal with the client.<br","Circular economy; Waste streams; Design methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Accordingly, the Dutch government has set up a nationwide programme that aims to achieve a completely circular economy by 2050 with an interim objective of a 50% reduction in raw materials by 2030. This includes creating a network of circular craft centers by 2030, places where product reuse and repair is of paramount importance. <br/><br/>The center for this project is located in the province of North-Holland, where municipalities Heiloo, Uitgeest and Bergen are working together on regional challenges in the ‚ÄòBUCH‚Äô organisation. They aim to contribute with their own vision of such a center, The Circular HUB, whose success highly depends on the involvement of residents and their sustainable choices. This thesis aimed to discover how residents can be involved to visit the center and promote repair and reuse activities.<br/><br/>The challenge was approached by means of a triangulation method, a variety of methods to develop comprehensive understanding of problem context. Topics of waste, circular economy, behaviour change models and good practices for encouraging residents were explored together with other activities including resident interviews, co-creation sessions and surveys. These were used to identify the drivers and barriers of residents on circular activities and their perspective and needs on the center. <br/><br/>The obtained key insights are related to three tools of a behaviour change model, the SHIFT framework. Residents are not aware that even a seemingly small action can make a difference, lacking the knowledge or expertise (self-efficacy). Many are participating in repair and reuse practices and love to share their knowledge, but nothing is in place to make this visible to other non-active residents. This makes them unaware of what is possible and what the norm can be (social norms). These two factors can be explained by the current challenges on clear and consistent communication of the BUCH on the meaning of the circular center and circular activities to residents (tangibility). Consequently, residents do not feel involved and are not stimulated to participate on a regional level.<br/><br/>To address these challenges, a communication approach for the BUCH was developed. It aims to create support for key stakeholders of the climate programme to actively involve residents in activities as a preparation for the circular center. This to achieve a unifying vision for the circular center that is shared by all the stakeholders, including residents. The approach is delivered as a guide that consists of four elements that could be implemented:<br/><br/>The importance of communication in encouraging residents<br/>The challenges in the BUCH context and how to deal with them<br/>A strategic vision offering major milestones to take<br/>A roadmap with actionable steps to achieve the vision <br/><br/>Each element can be used separately depending on the type of conversation context The solution contributes to the problem by offering support for the municipalities to involve residents in the communication so that they feel a sense of ownership and involvement on a local and regional level.","sustainable behaviour change; De BUCH gemeenten; Circulair Centrum De BUCH; Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In order to exploit the special properties of graphene, it is therefore important to understand the phenomenon of wrinkling. In this study, strain engineering was applied to study the flattening of wrinkles in a suspended graphene membrane. Initially, a MEMS device was used for inducing strain in a suspended membrane. Transfer of graphene onto the MEMS device was challenging and in this study not successful. Suspended graphene drums with an electrostatic backgate were used as an alternative system for strain engineering. A stress-strain curve was calculated from the drum deflection measurements as a function of backgate voltage. The stress-strain curve exhibits a non-linear regime that is due to wrinkle flattening and a linear regime that is due to membrane stretching. The Young‚Äôs modulus of the membrane is determined using three different methods. An analytical model for the stress-strain curve of a wrinkled membrane proposed in [1] is fitted to the experimental data. The good agreement between the model and the data validates the model and provides insight into the parameters that govern the behavior of the membrane. Wrinkles were visualized individually and were clearly decreasing in size with increasing backgate voltage. Also the surface correlation length was shown to increase with backgate voltage, indicating flattening of wrinkles.","Graphene; Wrinkling; Strain engineering; MEMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-23","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor); Pesch, U. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nowadays a growing concern among the scientific community, and the wider public are pushing politicians and countries to design policies for reversing the course of warming the plant. These efforts are backed up by, for example, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. As resources are limited, studies have<br/>tried to identify sectors and practices which are the most polluting. These industries are typically named Energy-Intensive Industry, referring to the high energy and temperature needs of these industries. Numerous studies have looking into the ways to decarbonize these sectors, technologically, economically, but also to what extend these changes have effect on social and spatial aspects of society. Recently, social protest surged in the IJmond region after black snow was encountered next to the large steel-making industry, the backyard of close neighbourhoods. Questions surfaced regarding public health,<br/>and local externalities of the industry. In this study, the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework is employed to identify what forces and dynamics are stabilizing and destabilizing the Dutch steel-making industry in the IJmond region. As the steel-making industry in the Netherlands accounts for thousands of direct and indirect job opportunities, and it adds to the strategic benefit of having one‚Äôs own steel-making plant, decarbonizing this industry is a complex issue. Asking for a need to balance economic growth, strategic benefits, and public health. But what exactly is the problem? The industry has been in the region for over a hundred years, why is social protest surging just recently?<br/><br/>For this study a non-structured approach is chosen regarding primary as well as secondary data gathering methods. The MLP framework is applied and complemented with the concepts of Social Acceptance (SA) by Wustenhagen et al. (2007), framing by Bruijn (2017), and the geography perspective proposed by Coenen et al. (2012). Secondary data was collected via back- and forward rolling on articles that happened to be interesting regarding the decarbonization of EIIs, social protest in the IJmond region, and the MLP. The levels of stakeholders (niche, regime, landscape) were identified and resulted in identifying actors to interview with regard to the IJmond region case (Tata Steel IJmuiden BV, Environmental Regulation Service (ERS) IJmond, NH Nieuws). These actors were then questioned about themes that were identified through secondary<br/>data like scientific articles on social, technological and economic barriers and effects, and regional (Dutch) newspaper articles. It was found that both stabilizing and destabilizing factors were present. Stabilization was showed by the abundance of policy power struggles. Information and framing, organized<br/>pressure, and direct lobbying strategies were applied by EII for favourable legislation with regard to their industry practices. Destabilization of the regime span across different concepts. The misalignment of rule sets by both mechanisms of evolutionary-economics (presented by the emerging green-steel niche market preferences and the growing support for supply-push policy measures) and social-institutional ones (normative rule sets were misaligned as residents lost their trust and faith in monitoring bodies) were identified. Cultural discourse was displayed by the presence of both actor credibility deterioration (The polluted snow and graphite rains in combination with their voiced compliance with permits and regulation) and the shift of experiential<br/>commensurability of perceived story-lines between regime and niche actors (When reports on health problems distinguished graphite rains harmful for children, although previously these had been flagged as non-harmful ones, but neglecting the measures that were taken to prevent graphite rains in the future).<br/>Furthermore, the transition phase and path were characterized according to Geels and Schot (2007) and Geels (2019). The niche-innovation of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) is considered to be substituting that of Blast Furnace Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF), and the landscape developments are considered to be applying pressure to the regime to change there industrial practices. Concluding that the nature of interaction between landscape development, niche-innovations and the regime level<br/>are characterized as disruptive and competitive. The niche-technology itself is considered to be ready for progression into regime level, represented by the indicators of market-share, powerful actors joining the support network, and strong expectations that DRI and EAF are on a route towards enhancing their performance and price. The different landscape developments, phase and path are visualized in figure 8 on page 49 presenting an overview of the different forces adding to the socio-technical transition in the IJmond region. Additionally, it is shown that the regime actors, and thus incumbent firms, are able to produce radical innovation routes, also presented by Geels (2019). It must be noted that innovation or sustainability achievements are not merely attributable to the performance of one company alone. institutional comparative advantages and institutional thickness are presented by Coenen et al. (2012) to be of influence and should be considered as well when comparing contexts. The SA concept as proposed by W¬®ustenhagen et al. (2007) teaches u that it has played a considerable role in the past and present decision-making process. But also is going to play an extensive role in future citing decisions, especially now that the ‚Äôgreen hydrogen‚Äô route is chosen. This study concludes with a section on research experiences with regard to using the multi-level perspective and conducting unstructured interviews on a sensitive and controversial topic. In this section critique with regard to the perspective, and additional findings. MLP is considered to be good for exploring the boundaries on which a certain transition ‚Äôproblem‚Äô is extending to. At first the different social groups are seen as discriminating ones, in a sense that problems, values, groups from the real world can only fit in on or the other. But after gathering secondary and primary<br/>data sets, it became apparent that some stakeholders, values, and discussions can fit in more than one social group. Making it difficult for consecutive studies to follow the same methodology and achieving the same results with the same data sets. Socio-Technical system (ST-system) change initiation has been attributed to the niche-level. But resulting from later studies and reviews, this characteristic is also attributed to the landscape-level. It is proposed that also the regime-level can initiate a transition process. Regime actors abandoning social rule sets and believes creating, internal tension between regime actors.<br/>Further exploration on what the geography perspective proposed by Coenen et al. (2012) can enhance the comparison of different territorial transition processes, and how institutional comparative advantages or thickness are determining these differences. Although ¬®Ohman et al. (2022) argue for a different conclusion on the technology readiness of steelmaking production processes, this is based on a different strategy of readiness determination. When ¬®Ohman et al. (2022) way of reasoning with regard to the readiness of technology, the same conclusion is reasoned for.","multi-level perspective; decarbonization; social acceptance; framing; geography; Socio-technical system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

A parallel analysis is made concerning the traffic density and meteorological conditions‚Äô influence.<br/><br/>The simulations use actual air traffic data, obtained from the OpenSky database. Corrective data processing is implemented to minimize the noise due to data resolution issues, and time shifting techniques are analyzed and implemented to counteract the human bias natural in real recorded data. The chosen air traffic simulator is the open-source BlueSky Simulator, which integrates the state-based method analyzed. The data is selected considering the traffic density (Eurocontrol database) and the meteorological conditions (ERA5 data from Climate Copernicus) since Light, Medium, and High bins are created. The traffic density bins generation makes use of k-clustering, while the meteorological conditions bins go through a more complex process to identify atmospheric cold fronts.<br/><br/>The performance is obtained for different classification approaches, showing the impact more flexible metrics have on the results. For flexible metrics, the performance of the state-based conflict detection method is higher than for stricter metrics. For the first one mentioned, values higher than 120s look-ahead time are not fruitful, while, for the second one, all look-ahead times are not effective in state-based conflict detection. An analysis focusing on the flight phase showed the performance is better for the cruise phase, raising the effective look-ahead times to 300s and 180s for each approach, respectively.<br/><br/>Concerning the secondary independent variables, firstly, a higher traffic density environment translates to a lower conflict detection performance. Secondly, the meteorological conditions bins‚Äô difference is not enough to withdraw conclusions, even though it follows a similar trend to the traffic density values.","Conflict Detection; State-based Method; Look-ahead Time; Performance Assessment; OpenSky; Time Shift Scenario; Genetic Algorithm; BlueSky; Meteorological Conditions; Traffic Density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

This concerns shunting yards where the wagons are distributed manually, and communication takes place by telephone. The first problem is that an entire train is considered dangerous if there is a wagon with dangerous goods on the accompanying wagon list. The wagon list shows where each wagon is positioned within a train composition. Due to safety regulations, a certain distance must be kept between wagons for certain dangerous goods classes. Because entire trains are considered dangerous, adjacent tracks must be left empty. This is at the expense of the capacity of the yard.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the wagon list is not 100% correct due to human errors. Random checks show that the wagon list does not always turn out to be correct and that mistakes are made in creating the list. Therefore, smart camera techniques have been developed to detect which wagon contains which dangerous goods on arrival to confirm the wagon list. This opens up new possibilities concerning the sorting strategy of wagons from the arrival track onto the classification tracks in accordance with their destination. <br/><br/>Research is done to find out what this new sorting strategy should look like. Therefore, the following research question is formulated: ‚ÄòWhat kind of method can distribute wagons, including wagons carrying dangerous goods, on a rail yard, considering safety?‚Äô. In order to answer the research question, qualitative research was carried out into the various existing strategies and methods that could be applied. A model is created in which wagons are sorted over classification tracks. The model chooses the track on which the wagons should be placed based on the destination. Specific attention is given to wagons with dangerous goods, for which the model ensures that a specific distance is kept from other wagons on the (neighboring) classification tracks. The model then determines the most appropriate departure time, and the train departs. Different scenarios are tested that the model has to deal with. A distinction is made here between whether the number of classification tracks is equal or not equal to the number of destinations, and whether the rate of dangerous goods over the destinations is equal or not. This makes a total of four scenarios that have been tested. <br/><br/>The effect of using a buffer on the track is examined so that a wagon carrying dangerous goods never stands next to another wagon carrying dangerous goods of a different class if they are not allowed to stand together. This is tested in the model, and the output showed the placement of the wagons and the processing times.<br","Shunting Operations; Freight Wagon; Dangerous Goods; Railway Yard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Samples with pretreatment layers formed in acidic and alkaline environment showed an increase in polar energy and surface roughness, which are strongly related to the coating adhesion properties, in line with the failure stresses obtained from the pull-off adhesion tests. The corrosion resistance was evaluated through the electrochemical behavior that was measured by linear polarization resistance (LPR), potentiodynamic polarization (PP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements.

This part of the operation deserves attention because it significantly impacts project risk and cost.<br/>After initial investigation the main research question was formed: What is the effect of moisture on the granular characteristics of polymetallic nodules in the context of bulk handling?<br/>Royal IHC provided a container with around 50 kg of polymetallic nodules from the Clarion Clipperton Zone. These nodules have been used in earlier research, focused on the degradation of nodules in transport from the seabed to the sea surface. Resulting in broken and damaged nodules. Therefore these are a good representation of nodules coming from the vertical transport system.<br/>The degraded nodules provide an unique opportunity to gain an understanding of the bulk behaviour of the nodules once they have arrived on the ship. <br/>Four experimental setups were used to understand the granular characteristics of degraded polymetallic nodules in a non-destructive manner. In the first setup, particle properties such as density, porosity, and water content have been measured. The second setup identifies the shape of degraded nodules. The third setup measures the angle of repose for different nodule sizes and water content. The last setup measures the friction factor for different nodule sizes and water content, while changing the sliding surface between steel or rubber. Lastly, clay has been added to the sliding surface experiment. <br/>Considering the angle of repose tests and the sliding and rolling friction angle, it is evident that the difference between dry and fully saturated nodules is minimal. For the friction angle: The maximum deviation between dry, saturated and CCZ clay is 8 % on steel and 9 % on rubber, corresponding to 2 degrees. For the angle of repose, the difference between dry and saturated is negligible. <br/>It is concluded that the moisture content only contributes minimal level to bulk behaviour of nodules.<br","Deep Sea Mining; Polymetallic Nodules; dewatering; Moisture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The main technique to obtain their basis is proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), where an energy-based basis is obtained. Such a basis is derived without considering the governing equations. Moreover, if the flow dynamics are not energy-dominated, the resulting POD-ROM can be biased towards that quantity and not represent the case properly.<br/><br/>In this project, a constrained goal-oriented reduced-order modeling (GOROM) technique that optimizes the modes of POD-ROMs is applied to wall-bounded flows. Its semi-continuous formulation allows great flexibility in treating non-linear problems with discrete reference datasets and complex goal functionals, and since the model constraint is considered in the optimization, the output model has a more complete physical interpretation.<br/><br/>Two cases are considered. First, a 1D Burgers equation forced with data from a turbulent channel flow is studied. Different ROM sizes and goal functionals are tested and compared to the reference data statistics. After that, a 3D transitional channel is studied, with a reference dataset that is generated using an initial condition that experiences transient growth. In this case, the ROM size is fixed and the goal functionals used are related to this phenomenon.<br/><br/>The results for the Burgers case show the superiority of the GOROM compared to a POD-ROM. They also depend on the initial guess for the optimization modes, and it is shown how the choice of the goal functional influences the behavior of the solution. After that, the transitional channel highlights the influence of truncation on transient growth problems and shows the model constraint improves the growth prediction significantly. Finally, the use of dedicated goal functionals is shown to improve the prediction of relevant quantities such as the production of kinetic energy.","goal-oriented; reduced-order modeling; wall-bounded; transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This paper investigates the cost¬≠-benefit, payload performance and technical feasibility of green storable upper stage design concepts on their potential implementation with existing launchers. Since the demand for reliable, safe, and cost¬≠-effective transport to space is growing, it is necessary to find sustain¬≠able rocket propellant solutions. Green fuels that react hypergolic with hydrogen peroxide as oxidisers can provide distinct advantages in the performance, complexity and reliability when integrated into sys¬≠tems with severe geometrical constraints, such as upper¬≠ stage propulsion modules.<br/><br/>This research aims to quantify the cost¬≠-effectiveness of green storable upper stage concepts on the commercial market prospect. This is done through detailed research into design concepts operating on various storable propellant combinations. These various design concepts for different propellant combinations are described by the hypothetical storable upper stage called the ‚ÄúPrototype X‚Äù. As an oxidizer, concentrated hydrogen peroxide (HTP), combined with non-¬≠carcinogenic, non¬≠-toxic, and non¬≠ corrosive green storable fuels, can provide reliable and environmentally friendly propulsion solutions. Moreover, green hypergolic storable propellants will lower the operational cost, reduce system complexity and are safer to procure, store and handle. These ‚ÄùPrototype X‚Äù upper stage design concepts will be analysed and optimised on their cost¬≠-per¬≠-kg payload characteristic.<br/>Detailed mass and cost optimization analysis was performed for a green storable launcher upper¬≠ stage concept. It was found that HTP together with screened storable fuels shows promising and acceptable performance characteristics in terms of specific impulse and density specific impulse. Im¬≠plementation of these green storable propellants into the upper stage design results in dry mass re¬≠ductions of over 20% compared to the conventional cryogenic hydrolox upper stage design. Although current ‚Äôgreen‚Äô storable propellants can reduce the cost¬≠-per¬≠-flight of the upper stage by 8.9%, resulting from constructive cost reductions in development, manufacturing and (pre¬≠launch) operation phases, their wet mass burden reduces the payload performance by at least 308.09%. This is mainly due to the reduced performance of current ‚Äôgreen‚Äô storable propellants, compared to cryogenic propellants. Therefore, a cross¬≠-over analysis was conducted for the ‚ÄúPrototype X‚Äù storable design concept. Here the focus was on finding the required performance of a hypothetical storable ‚ÄúFuel X‚Äù that would make the storable concept economically attractive. Calculations suggest that further development in storable propellant engineering can improve the payload performance of the storable upper stage concept by +37.79% for the same wet mass, compared to the cryogenic design, while reducing the geometrical dimensions of the upper stage by roughly 33%. Storable ‚Äôgreen‚Äô propellants significantly reduce com¬≠plexity and add reliability and safety to the system, potentially improving the payload performance even further. Detailed analysis points out that a hybrid launch vehicle, comprised of a cryogenic first stage and a ‚Äôgreen‚Äô storable upper stage, would be the most cost-¬≠effective expendable launch vehicle in the West having a payload performance of 3.80 &#x1d458;‚Ç¨/&#x1d458;&#x1d454;. Taking into account the added safety, higher reli¬≠ability and reduced complexity of the storable systems, it is expected that the proposed hybrid launch vehicle (either expendable or reusable) will outperform all medium to heavy launch vehicles on the market today. These findings indicate that the green (hypergolic) storable upper stage can be a cost¬≠-effective and reliable solution to future space flight applications.","Upper stage; Cost-based optimisation; Design optimisation; Hydrogen peroxide; Storable Green Propellants; Launch Vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Unfortunately, mangrove coasts worldwide are eroding due to deforestation, exposing local communities to flood hazards. In Demak, Indonesia, a Building with Nature approach was chosen to counteract erosion. Permeable dams were built on the foreshore to attenuate waves and restore the sediment balance. The dams have increased the bed level locally and mangroves expand after construction. A new project called MuMaCo (Mussels as Mangrove facilitators for Coastal defence) is launched to integrate mussel aquaculture into the mangrove rehabilitation project in Demak. Mussels increase the roughness and diameter of the bamboo poles, which could increase their wave attenuation capacity. Moreover, mussel culture gives the local communities an economic incentive to sustain the structures. This thesis describes and quantifies how mussels' growth influences the forces acting on bamboo poles. Small-scale experiments are performed in the wave flume of the Delft University of Technology on a scale of 1:3 and 1:6. Physical models were used for experiments with steady flow and waves. The steady flow experiments cover a range of Reynolds (Re) numbers between 10^3 and 10^4 to seek the drag crisis. Single mussel covered cylinders for both scales are compared to smooth cylinders and cylinders with an equivalent diameter. For the wave experiments, cnoidal waves with Keulegan-Carpenter ($KC$) numbers ranging from 3 to 113 that correspond with measured waves in Demak are chosen. Moreover, only mussel covered cylinders are compared to a smooth cylinder for a scale of 1:6. During the experiments, the flow velocity, force, and surface elevation are measured, and the drag and inertia coefficients are obtained with the help of the Morison equation. The drag coefficient shows a clear relationship with the Reynolds numbers for steady flow. Although the drag coefficients display the same qualitative behavior as in other studies in the literature, the drag coefficients of the smooth cylinder are more than 40 % larger than in the literature. This is probably due to large variations in the offset of the velocity meters (EMS) during the experiments. The large mussels show higher drag coefficients than the smooth cylinder. For the wave experiments, the drag coefficients show good correspondence to other studies in the literature, but the inertia coefficients are a factor two larger than expected for smooth cylinders. Treating the peak and trough of the cnoidal wave as individual sinusoidal waves shows similar results and suggest that cnoidal waves can be represented by KC numbers, as it is done for linear waves. The best fit to the literature values was found by solving the Morison equation with the measured force with the depth-integrated velocity squared and acceleration from the Fenton theory. This suggests that the results of the wave experiments have been uncertain due to inaccuracies in the EMS recordings.

The research has been formulated from my interest in both customer-centric design and the automotive industry. <br/><br/>This research started with the aim to introduce short-cycle feedback loops in pre-development departments to enable customer feedback in the early development stages to enable designers and developers to validate their product concept. The departments that will be targeted are the UI/UX pe-development departments of BMW, to be exact teams and departments that work on Natural User Interactions. The BMW Group introduced the term BMW Natural User Interaction (NUI)*, at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona. The NUI combines advanced voice command technology, gesture control and gaze recognition to enable more real-world interaction between the user and product. <br/>Earlier gained knowledge and insights enabled me to see many benefits of implementing customer feedback as early as possible. To analyze the possibilities of customer feedback, literature research was combined with a company analysis. From an outsider‚Äôs perspective, it seemed that the automotive industry is a bit careful and hesitant to involve customers in development processes. Therefore, the motivation of this industry could still benefit from novel customer feedback implementations. Both the customer side and the business side, benefit from streamlined customer feedback implementation in product development. Therefore, this research aims to validate if customers would sense an ability to influence the end products of BMW.<br/><br/>The company analysis started from researching how departments function and interact with each other, to their development processes and finally the data gathering analysis. From the company analysis, the assumption of potential for early customer feedback was validated. <br/>From this point onwards a search for suitable customer feedback methods was started, after considering and analysing many combinations from contemporary methods with new user interaction technologies, a 3-step method was designed to test my proposed VUI IN-Car method. <br/><br/>I am proud to say that promising results have been found from the 3-step test method. Interacting with a speech interaction while giving feedback on speech functions, results in a higher amount of creative ideas from participants. And adding a more realistic context to this setup results in more creative input. These results were compared to a contemporary questionnaire with the same content.

This allows to detect mis¬≠issued certificates quickly and catch the misbehaving certificate authorities. CT makes the certificate ecosystem more transparent and less reliant on trust that trusted certificate authorities (CA) do not issue rogue certificates. Events such as the compromise of the CA DigiNotar in 2011 could be easily and quickly detected with CT. CT makes use of CT logs, where issued certificates from trusted CA are stored. CT logs are append¬≠only ledger that can be accessed by anyone. The entire issue with trust and misissuance seems to be solved by this new technology, CT. But are there any downsides to this solution? Albeit, it helps to detect misissuance quickly, but at the same time introduces an additional source to exploit. CT logs are public ledgers of issued certificates. They can be used to discover new domain names, or to look up what domains exist. Given a domain, an attacker could harness the power of CT logs to look up all the subdomains. CT logs expose every domain, even internal ones that need a certificate but do not want to be known to the public. Furthermore, domains can be easily found without the need to guess domain names or exploiting other resources such as DNS, allowing attackers to generate lists of potential targets easily. In this paper, we analyze the security impact of CT on scanning traffic for domains hosted in IPv4 and IPv6. The domains‚Äô certificates are appended to CT logs, to leak the embedded domain name, which is acting as a honeytoken, a lure. We conduct passive measurements on the domain hosts, the hosting webserver and the authoritative DNS server, perform data analysis on the measurements and evaluate the security impact of the certificate request.","Certificate Transparency; Honeypot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initiated by an increased amount of traffic. Network-wide traffic control is becoming a more interesting field for traffic control. Mainly because computer power has increased and optimisation techniques improved. Network-wide traffic aims to improve the overall traffic state by looking at the entire problem instead of sub-problems. Besides improving traffic conditions, network-wide traffic control could support road operators in simplifying their work by taking over some tasks and keeping track of the situation.<br/><br/>For this research, we compare a pragmatic, user-friendly and transparent control method versus a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. For the MPC controller, the second-order macroscopic METANET model is chosen. The METANET model describes a network as a directed graph. We test both controllers on two small scale freeway traffic networks. The control measures that are implemented are ramp-metering and rerouting. The simulations are done in a SUMO environment. The key performance index (KPI) used for comparison is Total Time Spend (TTS). The resulting optimisation problem is a Mixed Non-linear Integer Problem (MINLP). This problem is solved with a heuristic method by a Genetic Algorithm (GA).<br/><br/>Simulations for the two networks in a demand scenario around critical density are analysed over 20 iterations. The results prove the potential of both algorithms since both improved the TTS significantly. The NM excels in ease of implementation and ease of understanding for non-experts. While the MPC outperforms the NM in TTS reduction, it is harder to configure and understand for non-experts. The MPC is successfully tested on its capability to prevent undesired behaviour from happening by adding penalties to the objective function. For future research, larger networks need to be investigated, with a focus on simplifying the resulting optimisation problem. It is expected that a piecewise affine approximation is a promising method.","Traffic Control; Model Predictive Control; METANET; SUMO; Traffic Network Management; Network-wide Traffic Control; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Offshore deployment of floating PV would be a suitable solution. There are currently different concepts in development for offshore floating PV. One solution is to design the offshore floating solar structures using interconnected rectangular floaters on which the solar panels are mounted. Multiple design choices have to be considered, such as the size of the structure and the design of the connections between the floaters. The main aspect to consider are the forces that arise in the connections due to the motions and loading of the offshore floating solar structure in the waves.<br/><br/>One of the main challenges is to quantify the effect of the different design choices regarding size and connection compliance on the forces within the connections between the floaters. The aim of this research is to give insight into the interaction between connection forces and different concept choices regarding the size of the floaters and the compliance of the connections between the floaters.<br/><br/>A numerical model of two floaters which are connected with two connections at each end of the structure is developed. The forces and motions of the floating structure are computed using numerical tools in the frequency domain.

As a result, the loss score does not solely reflect the performance of the model but also depends on the instance properties. During training, each instance is assumed to be equally informative, while in reality, this informativeness might depend on the difficulty of the instance. In this thesis, we propose four bounding methods which utilize some notion of instance-difficulty to produce difficulty-aware losses. Experimental results showed that, in most cases, optimizing a bounded variant of nDCG, AP or nRBP results in a consistent but marginal increase in the overall performance. More interestingly, we found that optimizing a bounded variant of nRBP and AP may increase the nDCG@k score, increasing the recommendation utility.

The very shallow water conditions (h/Hm0 = 0.3) and complex geometry of the structure, i.e. a high berm and stepped revetment, caused uncertainties in the usage of the empirical equations from the EurOtop Manual (2018) for wave overtopping discharges. Therefore, small-scale experiments have been performed to asses the overtopping discharges.<br/>Physical model experiments can be used to determine wave overtopping discharges, but can be expensive and time consuming. Recent studies show promising results for the use of SWASH as tool to predict overtopping discharges for relative simple geometries, but SWASH is suspected to be less accurate for more complex cross-sections. Two methods (SWASH, EurOtop) are used to predict wave overtopping discharges for the new boulevard Middelkerke and the results are compared with measurements from small-scale experiments conducted in Ghent. The goal is to asses the feasibility of using both methods for this complex structure with stepped revetment in shallow water conditions.<br/><br/>The EurOtop Manual (2018) uses influence factors to account for roughness at the slope and the presence of a berm in the structure. To use the empirical formula to determine the average overtopping discharge for this specific complex cross-section, a berm influence factor was added to the equation<br/>for shallow water conditions developed by Altomare et al. (2016). Recent studies of Schoonees et al. (2021) found that the influence of the roughness of a stepped revetment on overtopping discharge mainly depends on: a characteristic step height, relative overtopping discharge and the wave period at the toe of the structure. Using their research as guideline, a roughness influence factor of Œ≥f =<br/>0.75-0.9 was estimated for the stepped revetment for this case study. Although not validated for this specific configuration, using the (adjusted) equation resulted in very comparable average overtopping discharges compared to the physical experiments in Ghent.<br/><br/>In this case study, the usability of SWASH to predict the average wave overtopping discharges has been evaluated. First, the SWASH model was calibrated based on the incident wave conditions at the toe of the structure (Hm0, Tm-1,0) with the data the physical experiment in Ghent. This were the target wave conditions of this study since they are generally used to determine the average wave overtopping discharges (e.g. EurOtop) and to exclude the wave-structure interactions. Thereafter, the structure was added to the bathymetry with a smooth slope and local friction was added to represent the stepped revetment, as resolving the small steps would require an overly fine grid.<br/><br/>SWASH was able to reproduce the target incident wave conditions of the physical experiment very well (Hm0&lt;3%,Tm-1,0&lt;5%). However, when the structure was added to the bathymetry, larger differences were seen for the wave conditions at the toe compared to the physical experiment, for which no explicit explanation was found. Contrarily, Hm0 and Tm-1,0 include the full wave field, primary waves and infragravity waves, and the limited number of overtopping waves made it difficult to asses the influence of the difference in wave spectrum on the overtopping discharges.<br/>The overtopping reduction due the added roughness/friction compared to a smooth slope reference test, was eventually related to a Nikuradse roughness height for the stepped revetment. A Nikuradse roughness of 1-1.5 times the characteristic step height of the stepped revetment, resulted in very similar average overtopping discharges compared to measurements from the Ghent experiment.<br/><br/>Both the EurOtop Manual (2018) and SWASH were able to reproduce the average wave overtopping discharges from physical experiments, but the results need a wide confidence band since the number of overtopping waves were limited and discharges small (q &lt; 1 l/s/m). Each method has their own benefits and limitations. The EurOtop Manual (2018) is easy to use, but the validity of the empirical equations are uncertain for more complex geometries. SWASH gives more detailed information than only an average q: spatially and temporarily varying surface elevations and velocities along the domain, by which direct attack on the slope and structures (extreme values of u and F) can be calculated. SWASH could also be used as a ‚Äônumerical laboratory‚Äô to further parameterize the influence of roughness on wave overtopping for a wide range of boundary conditions and structural configurations.<br","overtopping; SWASH; case study; stepped revetment; shallow water conditions; EurOtop manual; physical experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.1851, 2.8209"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam (degree granting institution)","2022","Currently, morphological measurements on conventional radiographs are used to assess calcaneal fractures. The two most commonly used angles for determining the degree of depression and displacement of such a fracture are B√∂hler‚Äôs angle (BA) and the Critical angle of Gissane (CAG). However, conventional radiographs only provide limited amount of information and are increasingly being omitted, while computerized tomography (CT) scans are increasingly being used as they contain much more information regarding fracture configuration and displacement. It is therefore important that morphological measurements can be performed using CT-scans. The purpose of this thesis were to design a novel method to perform semi-automated morphological measurements based on 3D models of the calcaneus. The results of the novel method were compared with conventional 2D measurements of the same calcaneus.<br/><br/>119 lateral foot radiographs and CT-scan of the same foot were obtained. The data consisted out of three populations: 40 non-fractured, 39 fractured and 40 reconstructed calcanei. Based on the CT-scans, 3D models were reconstructed through interactive segmentation processes. Measurements on the radiographs and 3D models were performed in a specially designed Graphical User Interface. Three observers measured BA and the CAG, after which they repeated the measurements after a minimum of one week. The inter- and intra-observers reliability were calculated separately for all three populations, using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, the frequency of consensus given an allowed discrepancy was calculated.<br/><br/>The ICC for inter- and intra-observer reliability of the 3D measurements showed an improvement for BA and the CAG for all populations compared with the ICC of the 2D measurements. The ICC for inter- and intra-observer reliability of the 3D measured BA ranged from 0.97 to 1.00, indicating an almost perfect agreement between the observers. For the CAG, the inter- and intra-observer ICC ranged from 0.89 to 0.92 and from 0.87 to 0.96, respectively. To achieve 80% consensus for the BA among the observers, an allowable discrepancy of 20 degrees was needed for the 2D measurements, while only 5 degrees was needed for the 3D measurements. To achieve 80% of consensus for the 2D CAG measurements, an allowable discrepancy of at least 20 degrees was needed. For the fractured and reconstructed population, even an allowed discrepancy of 30 degrees was needed. For the 3D CAG measurements, 80% of consensus was achieved with an allowable discrepancy of 5 degrees, 20 degrees and 10 degrees for the non-fractured, fractured and reconstructed calcanei populations, respectively.<br/><br/>3D morphological measurements based on 3D models of the calcaneus showed better reliability and repeatability compared to the 2D measurements. However, the novel method of performing the measurements is not yet safe for use in clinical practice, as the measurements first should be validated. Nevertheless, the method is well suited to be employed as a reference for the development of further (semi-)automated methods to perform morphological measurements.<br/><br","Morphological measurments; 3D Models; Graphical User Interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

However, MRIs cannot be used in all situations due to their extensive hard- and software. For this reason, research in the field of low-field MRI has been conducted. Low-field MRI systems do not use superconducting magnets but restive, or in this research, permanent magnets. This reduces the costs of these scanners, but these same changes result in a poorer signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than high-field scanners. Based on this hardware, research in single-sided scanners has emerged, and various research groups have been able to reconstruct images with these scanners. They are based on conventional MRI hardware including a radiofrequency (RF) coil, permanent magnets and gradients coils for encoding. In collaboration with the Technical University (TU) Delft, a handheld scanner has been constructed in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). This scanner consists of an RF coil and a permanent magnet and does not have a gradient coil. The inhomogeneity of the &#x1d435;0 can be used for spatially encoding the signal based on translations. The SNR in images is improved with model-based image reconstruction. Although, in theory, this set-up should work, the image results so far have been somewhat disappointing. Therefore, in this thesis, we have investigated a different approach, using a neural network. In this research, the correlation between the received signal of a measurement and a simulation of the same shape is found to be greater than the correlation between other simulations and the received signal. Due to this proven correlation, an image reconstruction deep learning algorithm is constructed based on the AUTOMAP model. Simulated signals are reconstructed into images with promising results; however, the algorithm cannot reconstruct mea- sured data. Therefore, suggestions for future improvement include improving the simulated data set and adding more real measurements that would allow for training on a measured data set.","Handheld MRI; Low-field MRI; Deep Learning; Image Reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

One the most widely used renewable energy source is wind energy and for this purpose both onshore and offshore wind farms (OWFs) are being developed. In recent years the development of OWFs is getting more attractive due to fewer constraints on turbine size, more stable wind resources, and generally less environmental impact. <br/><br/>Offshore wind turbine generators (OWTGs) have various possible foundation concepts for shallow waters of which the monopile (MP) is the most widely used foundation concept. The dominant installation method for MPs is percussive pile driving where energy is transferred from a hydraulic impact hammer to the MP driving the latter into the seabed. Due to this energy transfer, a structural response is induced in the MP which in turn inflicts an acoustic response in the water column and surrounding soil. <br/><br/>The underwater noise emissions generated during offshore pile driving have a negative effect on the marine fauna. This negative effect can be subdivided in three categories, that is instant death or injury from a single noise pulse, auditory damage due to accumulative noise, and behavioural disturbance. For this reason, governmental bodies have imposed rules and legislation concerning underwater noise thresholds during offshore pile driving. To comply with these noise limits, noise mitigation systems are often deployed during offshore construction works of which the big bubble curtain (BBC) is the most frequently applied. A BBC is formed by air being injected into the water through nozzles in air supply hoses laying enclosing the entire MP.<br/><br/>Currently, the BBC configuration is often based on rules of thumb and experience from similar past projects. However, a BBC configuration can be optimized beforehand, depending local technical-constructive and site-specific parameters. This thesis focuses on the link between the influence of different soil configurations on the characteristics of the underwater noise emissions and the intrinsic mitigation performance of a BBC and what this means for the design of a BBC configuration. One objective of this thesis is to provide a framework for optimizing a BBC configuration which consists of a quantitative and qualitative analysis. <br/><br/>For both analyses, use is made of the semi-analytical model SILENCE BUBBLES, which captures the acoustic interaction between MP, fluid, soil, and air bubble curtain. This air bubble curtain model makes use of a one-dimensional coupling approach to capture the interaction between the bubbly medium and the travelling sound wave. Another objective of this thesis is to investigate an alternative approach for modelling waves travelling through the bubbly medium taking into account its two-dimensional properties, thus include the angle dependency of the incident sound wave.<br/><br/>Therefore, the focus of this thesis is twofold with the overarching theme; ""Noise mitigation by a BBC"". On the one hand, a framework for optimizing a BBC configuration is proposed based on three different soil configurations. This framework consists of a quantitative and qualitative analysis. The qualitative analysis focuses on the effect of different soil configurations on the mitigation effectiveness of a BBC. The quantitative analysis provides an optimal combination of BBC configuration parameters for complying with a set noise limit. On the other hand, an alternative two-dimensional (2D) coupling approach is examined for coupling an air bubble curtain model to a non-mitigated field.<br/><br/><b>Optimizing mitigation by a BBC</b><b><br/></b>A sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the model sensitivity to different BBC parameters. Here, it was shown that the model is sensitive to the nozzle diameter and the gas velocity of the nozzle. Furthermore, the radial distance of the BBC is of significant importance for the SEL at r = 750 m.<br/>SILENCE BUBBLES can be used for a quantitative robust approach for determining an optimal configuration of a BBC for different soil configurations. Each soil configuration has its own distinct optimization process.<br/>Together with a qualitative analysis regarding energy distribution over the radial distance and the total energy being irradiated into the fluid domain, the framework presented can lead to a better estimation of whether noise limits will be met for future noise prognoses.<br/><b>An alternative coupling approach for integrating an air bubble curtain model</b><b><br/></b>This thesis presents a mode-coupling approach for coupling a similar air bubble curtain model as the one used in SILENCE BUBBLES to a non-mitigated field. The results showed that for higher frequencies (f &gt; 300 Hz), the 1D approach is conservative compared to the 2D approach. For lower frequencies, the 2D approach is more conservative where the 1D approach shows significantly higher transmission loss for certain frequencies below 300 Hz. It could not be identified where these large differences come from.","Underwater noise; Big bubble curtain; Air bubble curtain modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The maximum attainable CMS performance depends highly on the design of the structural part and the actuator and sensor configuration, as mechanical vibrations can endanger stability. This thesis presents a method for designing CMS's using optimal design. The set of vibration modes that violates the stability criterion might change during the optimization process, which is undesired from an optimization point of view. An aspect of this method is to ensure stability by imposing a constraint regarding the stability of each vibration mode individually. The stability constraint proposed in this thesis aids in well-performing optimization that converges to feasible designs. This thesis presents a new way of modeling the open-loop response. It uses a standard PID controller often used in industry, and the structural model is a function of the poles and zeros of the system instead of the conventional modal parameters. Only three parameters are required to evaluate the robustness of a single mode. A robustness response surface was obtained via simulations and modeled using NURBS. The robustness response surface is used to evaluate the proposed robustness constraint. The surface model is suited for gradient-based optimization methods. The proposed method was tested on a relatively simple model of a motion system. The optimizer converged to unconventional solutions that outperformed designs obtained using engineering principles.","optimal design; optimization; controlled motion system; stability and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The energy transition focuses on using clean energy generated by resources like wind and water. Due to the increasing demand for technology that focuses on generating and storing clean energy, the demand for metals grows. These metals are currently extracted from landbased locations but are also found on the bottom of the ocean. Three types of resources are found on the <br/> ocean floor: hydrothermal vents, cobalt crusts, and polymetallic nodules. To extract these resources from the ocean floor, a project called ‚ÄùBlue Nodules was launched in 2020. This project addresses the challenge of creating a viable and sustainable value chain to retrieve the polymetallic nodules from the ocean floor. Royal IHC is one of the partners on this project and designed the seafloor nodule collector. The total mining system consists of a surface vessel, a vertical transport system, a flexible hose (jumper hose) and a seafloor nodule collector. In combination with a hose developing company, IHC designed the flexible hose. This design was projected on a prior design of the seafloor module collector. Since then, the seafloor module collector design has advanced, but the flexible hose design did not. Therefore the main objective of this master thesis is to design and analyse the flexible hose with its main focus on the dynamic behaviour.<br/>The methodology for this thesis is addressed in the following manner. The old design of the flexible hose was investigated, and all relevant parameters were addressed. A static model was built to verify the parameters that modelled the hose with these parameters. The parameters of interest were: the length of the hose, the distance between crawler and vertical transport system in height and width, number of buoyancy modules, number of buoyancy modules per hose section, starting position of buoyancy nodules. This static model was used to perform a parameter study, resulting in an optimal set of parameters tested against design criteria. <br/>The next stage was implementing the static design in a dynamic software packet called ‚ÄùOrcaFlex‚Äù. Orcaflex is a software program for static and dynamic analysis of offshore systems. The static model is implemented end tested with this software. This resulted in a failure of the set of parameters and adjustment to the static model. After a redo of the parameter study, a new set of parameters was<br/>extracted. This set is tested for an inline motion of the crawler compared to the vertical transport system and for a perpendicular motion. These motions expand in size until the flexible hose reaches its critical values. These tests resulted in a range around the VTS where the crawler could move in. <br/>Results show that the crawler can move in this range for a selected set of parameters. Throughout the research, it is shown that the parameter set needs further development to complete the flexible connection design. It is recommended that some disregarded motions, parameters and environmental forces are further investigated and that the failure criteria that test the hose need to be expanded.","Dynamic analysis; OrcaFlex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tang, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In order to establish a sustained extra-terrestrial presence, habitats need to be built on the Moon and Mars using novel materials made from local resources. Several material processing methods can be applied to transform the locally abundant regolith into materials suitable for structural purposes. One promising method is sintering. This process can be used to create strong material using little to no Earth-imported additives. However, sintering still requires a large amount of energy to heat the material. A possible method to lower the energy requirement is by introducing small amounts of sintering aids. However, little is known about the effect of aids on the properties of sintered regolith. This research aims to investigate the effect of sintering aids on the densification and mechanical properties of sintered Martian regolith simulant.<br/><br/>In this study, the chosen Martian regolith simulant, Martian Global Simulant - 1 (MGS-1), was first investigated using a variety of powder characterisation techniques to assess the similarity with actual Martian material. Using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique, disk shaped samples were sintered at temperatures between 700 ¬∞C and 1060 ¬∞C and pressures of 30 MPa to 50 MPa. Several powder mixtures were used. Two different additives, aluminium and bismuth oxide, were used in two weight percentages, 2.5wt% and 5wt%, and mixed with baseline material. Samples sintered from this enriched material were compared to those made using baseline MGS-1 material. In order to assess the mechanical properties, the Ball-on-Ring (BoR) compression test was used to determine the biaxial flexure strength of the samples. Since the BoR compression test is a semi-standardised method, an effort was made to validate the testing procedure and obtained results using soda-lime glass samples. Additionally, mortar disks were created and tested to provide a reference for terrestrial material properties. After compression testing, some samples were ground back into a powder and examined using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to assess any bulk composition changes induced by the additive and/or sintering process.<br/><br/>The results from the powder characterisation techniques show that the chemical composition of MGS-1 is close to that of actual Martian material. In order to achieve strengths comparable to terrestrial mortar, a relative density of at least 70 % needs to be achieved. For the baseline material, the sintering temperature needs to exceed 1000 ¬∞C in order to obtain these results. This value is 950 ¬∞C for 2.5wt% aluminium additive material, and 900 ¬∞C for 5wt% aluminium, 2.5wt% and 5wt% bismuth oxide additive material. For equal sintering temperatures, the biaxial strength of enriched powders exceeds that of baseline material. Hence, the sintering temperature can be lowered for enriched materials to achieve similar strengths. Samples made from bismuth oxide enriched material exhibited superior properties compared to aluminium enriched material. For aluminium enriched material, no clear increase in properties is observed with increasing additive fraction. For bismuth oxide enriched material, there appears to be an increase in properties with increasing additive fraction. A material behaviour transition from brittle to tough appears to be linked to biaxial strengths exceeding 12 MPa. Compared to literature on Martian regolith-based materials, the results for sintered enriched MGS-1 perform well in terms of required additive fraction and mechanical properties. Using additives could potentially be a way to lower the energy requirement for regolith sintering on Mars. This work opens up areas of further research into the optimal additive, additive amount and sintering parameters for on-site application.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The concept was validated with residents and candidate councilmembers, leading to some important input for iterations. Besides this concept, an overarching strategy was developed that focused on using the poles as a stepping stone to slowly get Crooswijkers more involved and used to participation, and gradually nudging them over to the other participation contexts, namely the municipality‚Äôs digital participation platform MijnRotterdam, and the physical neighbourhood hubs.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Social Design; community development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The reservoirs of these hydropower plants face ongoing sedimentation, negatively effecting the electricity generation, water storage volume, navigability and flood risk. Obtaining an equilibrium of the in- and outgoing sediment flux reduces these negative effects.<br/><br/>The incentive for this report is the planned run-of-river hydropower dam cascade in the main stream Mekong river in Lao PDR. The Mekong river is characterised by the distinct low and high flow seasons and a unique ecosystem. At the location of the planned cascade, the river is located between mountains and the river bed consists of bedrock with alluvial bed forms at the banks and between rock outcrops.<br/><br/>Long, narrow and relatively shallow reservoirs are created due to the construction of the planned dams in the main stream Mekong. Flushing operations have proven to be an effective method to recover reservoir volume from rivers with a high season flow with long, narrow and shallow reservoirs. The Mekong river in Lao PDR has all those properties.<br/><br/>This report attempts to determine operational rules for a run-of-river hydropower dam cascade to increase the sediment flux by flushing operations at the dams, whilst still maximizing the electricity generation. <br/><br/>To do so, two steps are taken. Firstly, a set of experiments on the Mekong river and flushing events at a dam is performed in a Delft3D-FM software with the Real Time Control module. The output of these experiments are used as input for a bucket model with volume conservation to test different operational rules.<br/><br/>Using the Delft3D-FM software with the Real Time Control module, a one-dimensional representation of the Mekong river is made. This model is used for two purposes. First, the reduction of the sediment flux is determined by comparing the sediment flux during a representative year for the situation pre-dam and post-dam construction. Secondly, this model is used to test the influence of the draw down rate, water level set point and duration of flushing operations on the cumulative sediment flux through a dam for four different discharges. The results of the flushing experiments will then be used as input for the second step of the research, the bucket model.<br/><br/>Different simulations are performed using operational rules with different threshold discharges for initiating flushing events, different draw down rates and different frequencies of flushing a reservoir. Using random sampling the influence of these three variables is tested. Additionally, two predetermined strategies are tested and compared to the operational rules tested using random sampling. In the first strategy the dams in the cascade are flushing progressively from the most upstream dam towards the downstream dam. The second operational strategy flushes the reservoirs progressively starting from the downstream dam towards the most upstream dam.<br/><br/><br/>Obtaining free flowing conditions during a flushing event increases the sediment flux significantly compared to flushing events that do not reach free flowing conditions, especially for lower discharges. Increasing the draw down rate proves to have limited influence on the sediment flux further upstream in the reservoir, while the flood wave released at the dam increases. Extending the duration of free flowing conditions after draw down proves to be an effective method to increase the sediment flux at the lowest reducing in electricity generation. <br/><br/>Performing a flushing event with 48 hours at free flowing conditions during the flood season increases the yearly cumulative sediment flux on average by a factor three. The cumulative electricity generation is reduced by just 2.5 %. Extending the duration of the free flowing conditions in a flushing event increases the sediment flux per lost GWh electricity generation.<br/><br/>Current operational rules at the planned cascade in the main stream Mekong do not consider flushing at all. It is recommended to include flushing events in the operational rules which are initiated if the discharge is above the design discharge of the turbines and below extreme discharges to increase the sediment flux and minimize electricity generation loss.<br","Reservoirs; Dam cascade; Flushing; Sediment management; Lao PDR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

As a result of the impact on the environment and the growing awareness of environmental protection, the effects on society and economic development, there is a pressing need and sense of urgency for the sector to become more sustainable. For a highway to be truly sustainable it needs to take the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability (People, Planet, Prosperity) into account. Over the past decades, some sustainability assessment (SA) approaches have been developed in an attempt to integrate sustainability in the assessment of infrastructure projects. Despite these attempts, these SA approaches do not address all the dimensions of sustainability thoroughly and are biased to either an environmental or an economic assessment, while the social dimension is taken less into consideration. However, how designers and decision-makers can integrate these dimensions into the assessments of highway design options is less known. This lack of integration of the three dimensions of sustainability makes it impossible to evaluate and assess the sustainability consequences of highway design choices and options and thus represents a significant limitation.<br/><br/>To address the observed problem, the main objective of this research is to not only provide designers and decision-makers with a SA tool that integrates all three dimensions of sustainability, but also with an understanding of how this can be used.<br/><br/>The triple bottom line (TBL) theory coined by John Elkington, a well-known concept in sustainable development (SD) was selected as a sound theory regarding the three interdependent dimensions of sustainability. A total of 64 SA criteria from the construction and infrastructure sector were identified through surveying recent literature, which formed the preliminary list of SA criteria. This was followed by a filtering process on the SA criteria and subsequently a questionnaire survey to establish which are relevant to the Dutch highway context. This resulted in the conceptual SA framework which consists of 36 SA criteria categorised in their corresponding dimensions of sustainability and related 9 themes. Next, the assessment procedure was provided for the conceptual SA framework, to form the proposed SA tool. In this tool, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to determine the weighting factors of the themes depending on the project. The tool was tested by applying it to a reference case (a highway project in the Netherlands). Based on the results from the reference case, the applicability of the tool was evaluated by an expert involved in the project. In the developed SA tool, the three dimensions of sustainability are integrated into one comprehensive framework specific for the Dutch highway context.<br/><br/>The conceptual SA framework provides a systematic overview of all possible aspects of sustainability that can be taken into account during the planning- and design phase of a highway project. In addition, it can help designers and decision-makers understand how the dimensions of sustainability can be used to decrease the negative impacts of highway projects and embrace the principles of sustainability with respect to environmental protection, economic profitability and human well-being, to make their highway designs more sustainable and to contribute towards SD.<br/><br/>The proposed SA tool can assess, compare, evaluate and rank design options based on the SA criteria. The SA criteria assess to what extent a design choice and option contributes to the creation of sustainable added value. In this tool, design options can be explicitly weighed upon all dimensions of sustainability, related themes and corresponding SA criteria which can support the decision-making.","Triple bottom line; highway design options; sustainability assessment criteria; sustainability assessment tool; sustainability assessment framework; best-worst method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

At present Pakistan‚Äôs 1000km coastline is largely undeveloped and the county is devoid of any wave energy harnessing devices or studies. However, recent years have seen an influx of Chinese investment being made under the China-Pakistan economic corridor agreement, which is stimulus for the near future construction of a large rubble mound breakwater to shelter an assistance vessel basin in the city of Gwadar.<br/><br/>Typically, a WEC is not feasible in low incident wave energy environments because the economic return from minimal energy generation cannot offset the capital cost of the structure. However, the opportunity in Gwadar is unique in the sense that a substantial investment is already envisaged for the creation of a breakwater. Therefore, it is worth investigating if re-designing this structure with vertical caissons embedded with U-OWC chambers is feasible. In this way, the structure can fulfill the dual role of sheltering the assistance vessel basin against wave attack, and produce renewable energy over its design life.<br/><br/>To assist with this task, existing data and methods available in literature along with numerical codes have been utilized. A 10 year SWAN hindcast has been performed, the result of which have been condensed into 60 representative design sea-states on the basis of which the U-OWC chamber geometry<br/>and turbine configuration have been optimized. This was achieved by employing a random sampling technique to determine which combinations produce the most power and by identifying the ideal turbine<br/>operating revolutions for each sea-state.<br/><br/>Next, the approximate cost of the caisson breakwater integrated with U-OWC chambers is calculated and compared against the currently proposed rubble mound design. It is expected that despite an attempt to maximize the energy generation by the device, its levelized cost of energy will be high, given<br/>the low wave energy in the region. Nevertheless, if the design proves cheaper than its rubble mound counterpart, it goes to show that wave energy converter can be deployed in low energy environments provided an opportunity exists where they can be integrated into proposed marine structures. This will<br/>be an important finding, considering that the majority of the global coastline is subjected to moderate to low incident wave energy, and neglected from WEC deployment considerations.","Wave Energy Converter (WEC); Oscillating Water Column (OWC); Pakistan","en","master thesis","","","","","","Various figures in this thesis are the author's illustration unless indicated otherwise by means of a reference.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); de Vries, P.A. (graduation committee); Mehrotra, A.A. (graduation committee); Csillag, Fruzsina (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","For the renovation of the Suurhoff bridge, Arup decided to design and propose a new, innovative strengthening scheme, which improves the fatigue performance of the bridge deck and extends the design life of the bridge by at least 15 years. In this strengthening scheme, a steel plate is placed on top of the existing deck plate with a layer of epoxy in between. Preloaded injection bolts are also used to connect the strengthening plate with the deck plate. This strengthening techniques has clear advantages over the current alternatives with regard to weight, execution time, risks and flexibility in the design. <br/>In order to better understand the behaviour of the renovated bridge deck, verify the effectiveness of the strengthening scheme and check the accuracy of the numerical models, a monitoring scheme is desirable. This is an important step in the development and optimisation of the strengthening approach, especially when the goal is to apply the scheme more often on future bridge renovation projects. To achieve this, the two research questions of this thesis are formulated as follows:<br/>What is the effectiveness of strengthening an orthotropic steel deck with a bonded &amp; bolted strengthening plate? <br/>How can the behaviour of the bridge be numerically modelled to accurately capture the improved fatigue resistance?<br/>This question will be answered through a combination of monitoring and finite element modelling. First, a monitoring scheme is set up with 16 strain gauges that are installed on the deck plate, troughs and cross girder. Quasi-static load tests are executed using a truck with known weight, both before and after the application of the strengthening scheme. <br/>The load tests were successfully and accurately carried out and the results show a large reduction in the stress cycle. Stresses in the troughs are alleviated by 45-55% and stresses in the deck plate are reduced by 85-90%. This is largely in line with what was expected during the design.<br/>Furthermore, the used FE models are validated so that more confidence can be gained in the design decisions. The full influence line is simulated, with the truck positioned at more than 120 longitudinal locations. The numerical modelling was able to accurately predict the shape and magnitude of the influence line generated by the truck loading. A difference in peak value between experimental and numerical results of no more than 25% was observed. The largest differences are observed for local bending in the deck plate of the unstrengthened bridge, but this is largely explained by the large sensitivity to the exact wheel position. For the strengthened bridge, a very good match is obtained in almost all locations. A difference between numerical and experimental results of no more than 10% is observed when not considering the area close to the bolts. <br/>Close to the bolted connection (¬±200 mm), no accurate results can be obtained with a simplified modelling approach that uses shear springs to model the bolts. However, the obtained numerical results are conservative compared to the experimental results. Some simple modelling adjustments have been applied but are unable to significantly improve the results. A detailed modelling approach has successfully been applied in which the bolt has been modelled fully in solid elements. The preload is implemented through a dynamic relaxation phase, so the bolt force is transferred through friction of the plates without any relevant increase in computation time. Therefore, this modelling technique can relatively easily be applied in a global FE model. This modelling technique is more accurate, and analyses have successfully managed to reduce the error by 50%. However, stresses close to the bolt are still overestimated even with this advanced modelling approach and more research is needed for a complete match in this area.<br/>In conclusion, the largely matching results reinforce the decisions from the design report. More confidence is gained in the static and fatigue design life, acknowledging the potential of this new strengthening scheme for future applications.<br/>As recommendations for future research, more testing and design work could be carried out to further optimise the design of the strengthening scheme. Furthermore, the temperature loading can be investigated through testing and monitoring in order to reduce this critical load case. Lastly, more detailed local FE modelling around the bolted connection can help understand the behaviour in this area. This can further increase the potential of the strengthening scheme when bolts are applied in close proximity of critical fatigue details.<br","Orthotropic Deck Steel; Fatigue; bridge renovation; Monitoring; Finite Element Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Individually acting agents can collectively produce organised structures at a larger scale. Possibly the most ubiquitous example of this phenomenon are bacterial colonies.<br/>Everywhere around us, a pandemonium of pushing and pulling produces complex structures. The most researched bacterium is E. coli and partially due to its excellent swimming capabilities, the internal structure of its colony is predominantly shaped through mechanical repulsion coupled with<br/>individual motility. In this thesis, we are interested in the emergent dynamics within a bacterial colony. Our focus will lie on how the colony's density \rho affects the internal structure and motility.<br/>To study the colony's interior, we built a three-dimensional individual-based model (IBM) with self-propelling sphero-cylindrical agents representing E. coli bacteria and governed by mechanical interactions. A downside of IBM is its computational costliness, posing an optimisation challenge which will also be covered in this thesis.<br/>A phase transition spontaneously occurs over time from isotropic to an aligned nematic phase. This transition takes longer for higher-density systems. We found a linear relation between the density and the local order for a colony in a quasi-infinite domain. Furthermore, after equilibration, the particles initially behave ballistically. However, this changes to diffusive behaviour in a later stadium. The Reynolds number Re ~ 10^-3 is two orders of magnitude larger than expected for E. coli, possibly due to underestimating the viscosity.<br/>On a final note, the method to determine the moment of equilibrium tequi gives an underestimation in the case of a two-step phase transition; an improved method is proposed.<br","bacterial collony; self-propelling; individual based modelling; IBM; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-09","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The performance is mainly characterized by three measures: traction, climbing and mobility. However, it was also found that no system level performance analysis including constraints exists. In this work a novel method is proposed to describe the system level performance of C-legged hexapods. Using this model, a computer-aided manual optimization of the leg shape is performed, from which it is observed that there is no unique optimal leg shape. The optima depend on the weight factor posed by the designer; but several leg types prove to perform better than the conventional shape. The most prominent trade-off of this hybrid shape is present between climbing and mobility, but this effect can be superseded when the shape is generated conceptually instead of analytically.","Mobile Robots; C-legged hexapod; Lunar rover; Leg shape; Traction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

A critical part of spinal fusion surgery is the placement of pedicle screws because it is highly complex and can damage the vascular structures and nerves near the vertebrae. To prevent complications, a new anchoring method is developed that strengthens screw contact by following the curved trajectory of the dense cortical shell while avoiding a cortical breach. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is a technique that could be used in a bone drill to obtain real-time information about the location of the drill within the vertebra. In order to drill the correct trajectory, an optical probe using DRS should determine the parallel closeness of cortical bone to the drill tip. To show the potential of this novel technology for improving spinal fusion surgery, this master thesis introduces and validates a flexible sideways-looking probe using DRS to identify the proximity of cortical bone when measuring along the cortical shell of a vertebra.<br/><br/>In this study, the ideal optical design to detect the proximity of cortical bone is investigated by looking into the effect of fiber angulation on the photon propagation using Monte Carlo simulations and phantom experiments. A conceptual design was created based on the ideal optical design combined with the mechanical requirements to make the probe insertable into a vertebra. As a proof of concept, a prototype was developed and tested on a bone-mimicking phantom and porcine vertebrae. <br/><br/>The conceptual design comprises a flexible needle with two optical fibers attached to a rigid tip with a diameter of 2.9 mm. Two mirrors are positioned in the rigid tip, emitting light 45\degree off-axis and collecting light 90\degree off-axis with a source-detector separation of 2.1 mm. These light directions were chosen because they optimize the reflectance spectrum difference between cancellous and cortical bone due to a longer path length, making detecting cortical bone closeness easier. A prototype was made that demonstrates that the probe can detect the parallel proximity of cortical bone at a depth up to 1.5 mm in an ideal phantom setting. The prototype can distinguish between pure cancellous and cortical bone in porcine vertebrae. Additionally, the prototype can also be inserted into the pedicles and bent along the cortical wall of a vertebra. These positive findings show that the flexible sideways-looking probe created in this study can potentially improve spinal fusion surgery by enabling an increase in cortical bone contact without perforating it. Although proof of concept has been provided, it is essential to improve the design for safety and usability and improve tissue type identification accuracy before continuing to clinical trials.","Spinal fusion surgery; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Optical probe design; Sideways-looking probe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-06","","","","","",""

Due to their smaller size, they are safer than conventional nuclear reactors. They can be produced in factories, which solves the problem of nuclear energy projects going over budget due to delays at the installation site. With the increasing demand in energy, small modular reactors can play an important role in the energy transition. Multiple small modular reactors can be coupled together if the energy demand suddenly rises, which reduces the need for a completely new reactor site.<br/><br/>Currently, 72 different models of small modular reactors are being developed. However, this sector faces various challenges, such as safety and standardization challenges. Furthermore, some designs are based on conventional technologies, while others are based on new technologies. These different generations of reactors could pose to be threats to each other and delay the development of reactors. Small modular reactor designs require multiple units of the same design to be deployed in order to be profitable and offer economically competitive energy. Therefore, the sector is highly competitive as not all designs can become successful.<br/><br/>To deal with these challenges, a consensus on technology selection could be beneficial. The Delphi method is used to evaluate if a consensus can be reached. In the Delphi method, experts cooperate by responding to the opinions and views of other experts over multiple rounds of surveys. This creates a sense of understanding of other views which should lead to a consensus on questioned aspects.<br/><br/>Two rounds of the Delphi study have been held. In the first round, 19 participants have filled the survey, while the second round consisted of 14 participants. Participants were contacted via e-mail and LinkedIn. Participants work in the nuclear energy sector as either regulators, advisors, managers or engineers.<br/><br/>This study is based on an idea of the Organization for Economical Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that the SMR sector could adopt a standardization model used in the aircraft sector. The aircraft sector can be used as an example for successful cooperation to deal with global licensing challenges and development of safety standards. The use of passive safety systems in SMRs could provide safe operating conditions at a fraction of the costs of active safety systems, and thus should be the aim when designing SMRs.<br/><br/>This study finds that cooperation within the SMR sector can lead to a consensus on standardization of parts and standardization of regulations, which reduces the financial risk for stakeholders and improves the chances for a viable global deployment of SMRs.","SMR; small modular reactors; Delphi; Delphi method; Nuclear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","Energy transition lab thesis circle",""

The highly flexible nature of the process enables the production of components with materials that are otherwise challenging to process using subtractive manufacturing methods. Invar 36 is a low thermal expansion Fe-Ni alloy deriving its name from the invariability of the thermal expansion to temperature, which is the lowest at a nickel content of 36 wt.%. Invar is challenging to machine due to a low thermal conductivity, high toughness and high susceptibility to work hardening, resulting in low productivity and high machining costs. Consequently, additive manufacturing methods such as WAAM can provide a good alternative to conventional production processes.<br/><br/>The processing parameters required for defect-free deposition of a commercial invar 36 welding wire using GTAW-based WAAM were investigated in this research. Multi-layer structures with a target cross sectional area of 15x15 mm2 were deposited using processing parameters corresponding to heat inputs ranging from 200- 550 J/mm. Microstructural evaluation revealed a coarse columnar grain structure with a mostly cellular mixed mode solidification substructure. Additionally, an increasing heat input resulted in a higher concentration of voids and (micro)cracking along the grain boundaries. Ductility-dip cracking was the most likely cracking mechanism due to the observed locations and fracture surface of the cracks. Defect-free invar weldments were deposited at a heat input of 200 J/mm.<br/><br/>Two 20x120x60 mm3 invar 36 deposits were made at 200 J/mm and 550 J/mm to allow for the machining of tensile testing samples. A higher average strength and elongation was observed in the 200 J/mm heat input samples when compared to the 550 J/mm samples. Samples oriented horizontally in the block displayed a 5.2 % higher UTS and a 8.5 % lower Young's modulus. The highly directional solidification grain structure resulted in anisotropic behaviour due to the Hall-Petch relationship and elastic anisotropy of the austenite crystal. A high concentration of grain boundary defects caused premature failure in 75 % of the 550 J/mm samples. <br/><br/>Multi-wire WAAM, where both invar 36 and nickel welding wires were used, was used to deposit invar alloys with a variable nickel content. A stepwise graded wall was deposited, where the invar composition was increased every three layers ranging from 33-38-42-48-55 wt.% Ni. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed a homogeneous composition in each layer and a gradual increase of the nickel content throughout the wall. A defect-free invar 42 block was deposited at a heat input of 215 J/mm. The nickel composition was found to be homogenous throughout the sample and in accordance with the model created to calculate the weld metal composition as a function of the individual wire feed speeds. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of all invar compositions deposited in this research showed a diffraction pattern matching the fcc diffraction pattern. <br/><br","WAAM; Invar; FGM Functionally Graded Material; GTAW; Welding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Validation by water board ""Hunze en Aas"" has revealed the predictive power of the irrigation model to be very limited. For this thesis project, we developed a methodology for the detection of irrigation of crop parcels based on the radar vegetation index (RVI) derived from remote SAR images. This methodology can be used to improve the existing irrigation model. <br/><br/>To achieve this, we developed a novel model to describe the evolution of a vegetation index (such as RVI) during the growth season. Unlike existing models, the model presented in this thesis includes the effect of precipitation deficit, both as a temporary inhibitor of a vegetation index, and as a long-term influence on the crop growth. The model is non-linear in many of its model parameters. Therefore, heuristic calibration methods are unavoidable. We show that the standard calibration methods non-linear least squares and differential evolution are outperformed by a hybrid of both methods that we specifically designed for this application. <br/><br/>After calibrating the model to time series of 1167 potato parcels in the north-east of the Netherlands, we investigate different ways to cluster the model parameters. We propose explanations for three important clusterings through their RVI time series (speculative) environmental factors. Comparison with information on irrigated parcels for the years 2018-2020 reveals a statistically significant correlation between some of the clusters and irrigation. However, the variation in irrigation rate never exceeded a factor two. Therefore, no accurate classifier can be built based on these clusters. <br/><br/>We recommend two important ways to improve the current implementation. Firstly, the baseline RVI is consistently overestimated, resulting in mostly negative normalized RVI. Because of this, the model cannot properly describe precipitation deficit-driven fluctuations in the RVI. These fluctuations are an important part of system behaviour, so improving the estimation of the baseline RVI should be the first priority for future research. <br/><br/>Secondly, the exact irrigation dates of a set of parcels will be very useful. Comparing these dates to the corresponding RVI time series will make it possible to uncover features of the RVI evolution that are indicators of irrigation. The model parameterization can then be tuned to optimize sensitivity to these features.","Vegetation index modelling; Irrigation; RVI; Plant growth; Crop monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Societal, technical, and institutional developments enable interorganisational and cross-sectoral integration of digital services. However, a lack of trust and legal certainty impedes electronic transactions and the development and adoption of innovative digital services. Digital trust services counter this by providing solutions for secure and trustworthy electronic transactions, which benefits the electronic society. As the development of digital trust services have the risk to develop in isolated manner, interoperability is required to allow wide adoption of these services. Collaborative ecosystems are dynamic and co-evolving communities of interdependent stakeholders, and could support valorisation of digital trust services. Nonetheless, stakeholders participating in such an ecosystem pursue different interests while envisioning different ecosystem operations. Governance contributes to efficient and effective ecosystem orchestration by providing rules on decision-making processes. In addition, the governance needs to fit with the technical architecture of an ecosystem, meanwhile, it assesses external factors and the development through time. The challenges of designing a governance model for collaborative ecosystems are relatively unexplored, as literature is sparse. Therefore, this thesis aims to design a framework which analyses and mitigates the challenges in a current collaborative ecosystem by prescribing a fitting governance model which adapts to its context through time. By following Hevner‚Äôs Design Science Research approach, the following main research question is aspired to be answered: ‚ÄùHow to design a governance model for a collaborative ecosystem which facilitates electronic transactions?‚Äù. By applying this framework to the current collaborative ecosystem of the Trusted Information Partners (TIP) initiative in the Netherlands, the framework is evaluated and validated. The study affirms that a framework should cogitate three components when designing a governance model for a collaborative ecosystem facilitating electronic transactions: I) Identifying the governance tensions enables context setting of factors affecting the ecosystem, II) Prescribing governance mechanisms boosts the mitigation of power dynamics, and III) Pursuing governance consistency checks whether proper governance takes place in decision-making. The framework contributes to the knowledge base of governance networks, because the research provides building blocks for establishing a governance model for collaborative ecosystems. To boost the service delivery of collaborative ecosystems, the framework could be validated by applying it to an operative collaborative ecosystem. As where the framework currently focusses on a developing ecosystem, the insights of an operative ecosystem can increase the generalisability of the framework. Future research on this can provide further alignment between the functioning of ecosystems and the governance model. Applying improved framework versions to other digital ecosystems, could also stimulate the valorisation of trusted services in society as a whole.","Public-private collaboration; Ecosystem; Governance; Information Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

At the same time, liveability, sustainability, health, and social equity are becoming increasingly important. This demands for mobility solutions to use urban space more efficiently, while maintaining and improving accessibility. A grid of neighbourhood hubs could contribute to a better use of space, which requires users to actually adopt the amenities offered at these hubs. However, in practice and science it is unknown how the locations and amenities of hubs could be aligned with the needs of users. Therefore, this thesis gathers knowledge about locations, amenities, and users of neighbourhood hubs, and translates this knowledge into the Neighbourhood Hub Design Approach. Users are classified into user profiles, and researched by using a literature review and focus groups with Dutch and foreign hub experts. From the results it can be learned that any user profile can be incentivized to use neighbourhood hubs, if they have the right motivations. Still, from an adoption perspective it is most preferrable to develop neighbourhood hubs in areas with a high share of the Young &amp; Hopeful and Average Joes &amp; Janes user profiles. Besides, the presence of user profiles influences which amenities should be offered at each neighbourhood hub. By using this knowledge, the Neighbourhood Hub Design Approach is assessed in a case study for the Municipality of Almere. It can be concluded that the Neighbourhood Hub Design Approach is a suitable tool to determine the most preferred locations in combination with amenities for neighbourhood hubs, based on users. Future research could build on this thesis by empirically researching the needs of user profiles. Moreover, it is recommendable that policymakers engage residents as much as possible when developing hubs in their cities.","Mobility hubs; Neighbourhood hubs; User profiles; Locations; Amenities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Schlangen, E. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Mustafa, S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","When concrete is subjected to imposed deformations, stresses may develop. If at any point in time this stress exceeds the tensile strength of the material, the concrete will crack. Early-age cracking of concrete structures may lead to problems with durability, serviceability and aesthetics. During hardening of concrete the material properties are still in development. Therefore, to be able to predict the crack width, understanding of the stress- and strength development is required. In addition, concrete is a visco-elastic material which means that stresses are affected by phenomena such as creep or relaxation. If the design codes predict the crack width in concrete structures under imposed deformations accurately remain subject of debate. The CROW report published in 2021 [9] provided the starting point for this research. The aim of this study was to gain more insight on the background of the design codes, and to explain the fundamentals of the crack width prediction in case of imposed deformations. For this purpose, the following research question was formulated:<br/>‚ÄùWhat is the applicability of the design codes regarding the crack width prediction of reinforced concrete structures under imposed deformations?‚Äù From the literature study it became clear that the main difference between the design codes was related to which boundary conditions and cracking theory were applied. The majority of the design codes applied the well known tension bar model theory where both ends are fully restrained. In addition, there were also codes using the continuous base restraining theory in which the tensile member is continuously restrained along one edge. This made a huge difference in the prediction of the crack width. From the finite element analysis which was performed, it turned out that there is a difference between the steel stress development of imposed loading and imposed deformations. In addition, in case of imposed loading less cracks were developed than under imposed deformations. However, from this specific numerical analysis it turned out that the maximum crack spacing and crack width is smaller in<br/>the imposed loading model in comparison to the imposed deformation model. The only explanation for this is that in case of imposed loading the cracks are more evenly distributed. A case study was used to simulate the hardening process of concrete in combination with autogenous shrinkage as imposed deformation and compared with a finite element analysis. The goal was to determine a set of model properties that are useful for future engineers. The accuracy of the input parameters was verified with the experimental work carried out by M. Sule. Overall, when performing a non-linear finite element analysis a lot of knowledge was required. It turned out that specific choices such as the constitutive model type, the kinematic and equilibrium condition have a major impact on the outcome. Using the modified Bar model of Lokhorst in combination with this numerical approach resulted in good agreement with the experimental findings. <br/><br/>The parameter study showed that regarding the tension bar models, the bar diameter has the largest influence on the crack width prediction. While with respect to the continuous models there was no onesided answer to the question which parameter had the largest influence on the crack width prediction. In one of the design codes based on the continuous model theory named CIRIA [8] the degree of restraint clearly stands out as the most important parameter. Whereas in the another design code based on this theory, namely the ICE [4], all parameters that were investigated in this thesis have limited effect on the crack width prediction. The design codes considered in this master thesis do not yet fully represent the crack width due to the hardening of concrete or due to autogenous shrinkage. The design codes are applicable for the<br/>crack width prediction of reinforced concrete structures under imposed deformations if conservative assumptions such as a weak bond between concrete and steel reinforcement are taken into account. It is clear that the problem treated in this report has more complexity than what one initially may think.<br/>Opinions on how to determine the crack width of reinforced concrete tensile members under imposed deformations differ. The difference is related to the type of restraint and the cracking theory which are suggested in most used analytical design models. This report contributes to a better understanding of<br/>the crack width development under imposed deformations through non-linear finite element analyses and verification with experiments. The results from this master thesis suggest that an approach to a more consistent crack width prediction under imposed deformations should investigate how bond in the interface between concrete and steel influences cracking. This has lacked attention in the current formulas in the design codes.<br","Imposed Deformation; Crack Width; Design Codes; Tension bar model; Crack width prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-04","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Residual tensile stresses are formed during the welding process and the distribution depends on many factors. Knowledge about the residual stress distribution is required for accurate fatigue assessment. The rib-to-crossbeam detail in the design of the new Schipholbridge does not meet the fatigue requirements according to Eurocode 3 when using a reasonable geometry. Therefore, high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) post weld treatment will be used to improve fatigue resistance. Incorporating the residual stress distribution in fatigue life prediction models will improve their accuracy, which can lead to more favorable results which can avoid the use of HFMI. The main objective of this master thesis is to determine the accuracy of a subsequently coupled thermo-mechanical finite-element model which predicts welding induced residual stresses in a segment of an OSD. The fatigue life prediction is not included in the scope of this thesis. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparing temperature<br/>and distortions with experimental data from three specimens consisting of a 900x400mm deck plate, a 350mm deep trapezoidal stiffener and a 600x15mm crossbeam web with a Haibach cope hole. During the welding, temperatures were recorded by a FLIR¬© E96 thermal camera. Welding distortions were obtained by subtracting the geometry before welding from the geometry after welding. The 3D<br/>geometry was obtained by the Artec¬© LEO scanner. The scans were post processed in Artec¬© studio software and data was extracted by the NumPy-stl package in Python. The predicted temperature distribution and deformations corresponded well to experimental results. The maximum deviation in the<br/>temperature distribution 1.8s after welding was 67 ¬∞C and occurred at the last position of the welding torch. The maximum deviation between predicted and measured upward displacements of the deck plate 10mm from the edge was 0.2mm, with smaller deviations on average. Due to the good correspondence<br/>of experimental and numerical results, residual stresses were presented. On the deck plate in longitudinal direction, tensile stresses of yield strength magnitude were obtained after unclamping. At the rib-to-crossbeam connection, the stress in the direction perpendicular to the weld toe at the location of the weld toe was equal to the yield strength after unclamping. The stresses quasi-linearly go to zero through the thickness of the rib.","Fatigue; OSD; Residual stresses; Welding simulation; Welding distortions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

While some aerosols do not pose any serious threat to humankind, others have devastating effects. Thus, it is important to understand the type and distribution of these aerosols in the atmosphere. While traditional satellite data pose delays due to the huge amount of data that it has to process through the traditional pipeline, machine learning is quickly proving to be a likely winning candidate in providing accurate and efficient models. The advances in machine learning and cloud computing combined with the terabytes of data from the earth observation satellites open up avenues for creating newer and variant data products of better accuracy in the domain of aerosol classification. There is a recognized need for distinguishing and characterizing different kinds of aerosols in the 5.6 billion dollar air quality market. This research focuses on the investigation and designing of machine learning models for the aerosol retrieval process. To meet this end we implement supervised learning on satellite data to achieve aerosol classification to distinguish the different types of aerosols. The two satellites whose data will be analyzed are POLDER-3 and OMI. In this study, the three supervised learning algorithms SVM, RF and KNN were implemented to classify aerosol types for the year 2006 on POLDER-3 and OMI satellite data. We used results from previous studies on POLDER-3 as eight input aerosol class labels along with selected microphysical parameters for supervised learning and could achieve a very high reproducibility of the aerosol classes with a reduction in training time. Similarly, we used three aerosol label classes as input along with selected microphysical parameters to generate a high reproducibility. The results showed that SVM performed best on POLDER-3 data while RF was the best performing algorithm on OMI data. Using SVM on POLDER-3 dataset with hyperparameter tuning we reached an overall accuracy of 99%, precision of 99%, recall of 98%, and f1-score of 99% on POLDER-3 dataset for the eight classes of aerosols. Using RF on OMI dataset with hyperparameter tuning we reached an overall accuracy of 99%, precision of 99%, recall of 99%, and f1-score of 99% on OMI dataset for the three classes of aerosols. It was concluded that while machine learning still has a long way to go, it shows promising results in the field of satellite data processing for aerosol classification.","Aerosol Classification; POLDER-3; OMI; Machine Learning; Supervised Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-03","","","","","",""

First, economic-engineering model design uses analogs between mechanical systems and the housing market, ensuring that the model contains only economically and mechanically interpretable parameters.
