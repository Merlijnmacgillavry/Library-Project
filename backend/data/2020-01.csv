These guidelines are formulated in “Wettelijk Beoordelingsinstrumentarium” (WBI). The largest difference with the previous version of the guidelines concerns the material model that is prescribed to determine shear strength parameters. In triaxial tests shear strength parameters are to be determined at ultimate state (25% axial strain), which is assumed to be a good representation of critical state. Critical state is a concept from Critical State Soil Mechanics (CSSM) and assumed to be a good representation of the state reached after large deformations induced by macro instability. Another fundamental assumption in the WBI is the use of the SHANSEP method. This method encompasses a laboratory procedure and a normalisation method. CSSM was originally defined and elaborated under isotropic stress conditions while in engineering practice anisotropic conditions are mostly used.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to investigate the undrained soil behaviour of organic clay in triaxial tests following the SHANSEP procedure and compare the results to the CSSM framework. In order to do so a series of eight K0-consolidated triaxial tests is executed using silty organic Oostvaarders plassen clay, which is assumed to be representative for a typical Dutch soil. A large range of over consolidation ratios is applied (1-20). Both compression and extension tests are executed. The triaxial tests are complemented by two K0-CRS tests and an isotropic compression test to determine relevant soil properties. The results are compared to the CSSM. The qualitative soil behaviour is analysed as well as the actual predicted undrained shear strength Su. Parameter relationships as described by CSSM are tried to be established from the data. The undrained shear strength is predicted by using numerical and analytical formulations of the Modified Cam Clay model, which is the most basic implementation<br/>of CSSM. From the data a clear failure line could be determined in p'-q space. In the triaxial compression tests failure at ultimate state gave very consistent result, a failure line could precisely be determined. In extension failure at peak strength showed the most consistent results. Ultimate state could not be reached under representative stresses because the formation of large shear bands and necking during shearing. A unique p'-q-e relation was much harder to establish. The general trend as described by the CSSM was clearly visible but the uncertainty was rather large. Several factors contributed to the uncertainty. Among which the void ratio determination method that was used to determine the void ratio after the triaxial test, which is prone to errors. The MCC model was not able to model the stress path correctly and p'_0 at failure was not correctly predicted resulting in incorrect Su prediction. The MCC model overestimated Su in compression tests. In extension, however, Su is well predicted by the MCC model. The SHANSEP method turned out to be a very convenient way to normalise the undrained shear strength of the triaxial tests, both in compression and extension. Only at very large OCR Su/σ'_v0 is slightly overestimated.","Organic Clay; Critical State Soil Mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

A correct prediction of its behaviour is of great importance in the design of aerospace composite structures. Nevertheless, when using simple numerical models which do not account for the delamination migrating to other interfaces or other intralaminar damage mechanisms, the accuracy of the numerical analyses is restricted by the inadequacy of the standardised experimental determination of the fracture toughness. This interlaminar property is usually measured using unidirectional specimens, which ignores the effect of the lay-up. Furthermore, the changing fracture toughness as the crack propagates, the so-called R-curve effect, is generally ignored as well by only employing the initiation values from the experiments. This leads to highly conservative results as the resistance to delamination is not correctly accounted for. The aim of this MSc Thesis was to contribute to the improvement of the blind simulation of delamination in co-cured composite aerospace structures. In particular, the experimental determination of the fracture toughness in coupons without a 0/0 interface to then be used as parameters in the simulation of one structural component: a single-stringer compression (SSC) specimen.Based on the lay-up formed by the skin and the stringer of the SSC specimen, various layups were defined for DCB and MMB testing. After evaluating them numerically, the fracture toughness was measured experimentally in unidirectional [0<sub>12</sub>//0<sub>12</sub>] and multidirectional [0<sub>11</sub>, 45//-5, 0<sub>11</sub>] coupons, in DCB and MMB for mode mixtures 20% and 50%. The R-curve effect of the multidirectional specimens was far greater than for the unidirectional ones, the steady-state fracture toughness was around three times higher, due to the crack migrating to other interfaces or propagating simultaneously in between different plies.The experimental results were used to improve the numerical analyses of the tests performed. A new approach was presented to model the measured R-curve effect by varying the fracture toughness values according to the distance to the crack tip. The improvements achieved were especially relevant for the multidirectional specimens. This approach and the R-curve from the multidirectional specimen were employed in the analysis of the SSC specimen. The results obtained emphasise the importance of accounting for the effect of the lay-up and the crack growth length on the fracture toughness. Furthermore, it was shown the potential and shortcomings of using an experimentally determined material law, accounting for delamination migration and other damage mechanisms, to improve delamination modelling.","Aerospace Composite Structures; R-Curve; Multidirectional Interface; Delamination; Post-buckling analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

At this time HMF cannot yet compete with oil-based analogues, such as p-xylene, due to the high costs of production. Future incentives to encourage the transition to a bio-based economy may increase the feasibility of investing in a HMF production process, but only if an efficient and cost-effective production method is designed. Previous research showed promising results using a reactive extraction unit. However, the selection of the organic solvent has a large influence on both the overall yield, as well as on the energy requirements in the final recovery of the HMF in a subsequent separation step. In this work, an intrinsically better, but hard to separate solvent, tri-butyl phosphate (TBP), was compared to methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), a solvent which is easy to separate from the HMF by distillation. The chosen method of separation for the TBP-HMF reaction mixture is back-extraction, using an anti-solvent to transfer the HMF back to an aqueous phase. By using backextraction, it was possible to lower the energy (steam) requirements of a TBP-based process under the benchmark calculated for a MIBK-based process by 18%. A drawback of the TBP-based process is its increased complexity, leading to higher capital costs. A model was developed to assess the balance between reduced steam demands and increased capital and operational costs. It was found that even if an optimistic scenario for the effectiveness of the anti-solvent was used, the MIBK-based process was superior across nearly all key performance indicators. Most indicative of the relative feasibility is the minimum selling price of HMF (at a production of 20 kton/year), which is €1.85/kg or €1.64/kg, for a TBP- and MIBK-based process respectively. The only area where the TBP-based process performs slightly better is sustainability, with calculated emissions of 1.90 kgCO2eq/kg HMF compared to 1.97 kgCO2eq/kg HMF for a MIBK-based process.","HMF; Reactive Extraction; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

With this change in program, a new design proposal is made. This new proposal benefits affordable housing, high-end housing, and the developer's interest. Affordable housing is made possible by introducing high-end housing catering to the high land value, for a hypothetical business case. By implementing affordable housing as a base for high-end living, high-end housing is therefore realized on a higher level, gaining a more valuable view over Manhattan.

They protect the interior from the exterior environment regarding weather conditions, noise, security and so on. While they also, in contrast to walls and floors, connect the two, creating links and providing rooms with daylight, fresh air and views in and out of the building. The most governing element of the window is the insulated glazing unit (IGU). There are many developments concerning coatings to add functions to the glass ,such as solar control or self-cleaning windows but they contain critical materials such as cobalt, copper and titaninum. Added elements such as coatings, foils for laminated glass and the sealant prohibit the IGU from being recyclable, as the prevailing glass industry requires high quality and clean ingredients only. This makes the IGU a finite, single life product resulting in almost 125.000 tonnes of post-consumer glass waste each year in the Netherlands. The IGU works optimally as an insulating element as long as there is dry (argon) gas inside the glazing panes. However, the life span of current IGUs is just around 15-20 years and is dependent on the butyl seal which is just 1% of the costs and 0.1% of the weight. During its life span the seal starts failing by allowing water molecules inside the cavity. The panel as a result starts building up water vapor and the coating inside will start to corrode, the glass shows fogging and the thermal performance drops down due to outgassing of the panel. In the current design of the IGU no refurbishment is possible, meaning that the glass panes and the spacer will not be re-used, but instead end up as landfill while these materials exceed the life span of the sealant by a large margin (Veer,2016). This thesis therefore focusses on the possibility of remanufacturing the IGU. The re-designed edge seal system for the IGU makes it easy to remanufacture the IGU on-site. The design utilises a detachable butyl seal that functions as a dry gas and vapor barrier and a hollows section that assures the tightness of the seal. This idea shows the possibility to replace the weakest part of the whole glazing panel every ten years so that the glazing panes which have high stored embodied energy and the spacer bar, which is currently approaching the theoretical value in terms of energy efficiency, both can have a life span of more than 100 years. The interlocking design of the spacer bar and butyl sealant is a result of a form finding process. A fiberglass hollow section can be slid into the butyl profile to assure the load is transfered to the window system. Furthermore, a check valve type is chosen to fill the cavity again with Argon gas with every remanufacturing cycle.","remanufacturing; Window; Insulated glazing unit (IGU); sealant; edge; seal; resealable; interlocking; on-site remanufacturing; Service Life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Amsterdam is expected to reach a population of over one million within two decades, and with scarce space for development the city is being forced to reconsider its position on density. Now with the ambition of transforming a part of the harbor into the new district of Havenstad, challenges regarding space, mobility, water management and heat stress arise and come to a head. How can this area be developed into a resilient high-density environment? In this research the themes of density, liveability and ecosystem services are combined in the pursuit of an evidence-based approach to develop a city for the future, capable of absorbing changes and allowing a wide variety of uses within the area. Here ecosystem services perform a crucial part in safeguarding and increasing liveability within this high-density environment. To understand the interrelations the research relies on a combination of a literature review, external input and refernce studies into high density environments within planned and existing neighbourhoods in Amsterdam and other cities. This project operates along the lines of the opportunistic approach as explained by Ahern(2007), to treat spatial challenges, widely present in the area, as opportunities, rather than as complications, looking for additional uses of the existing environment. The design has a strong focus on the mobility, to make a necessary shift away from personal motorized mobility, and the blue green networks that provide ecosystem services for the area, to allow for a high density whilst maintaining a high liveability in the area.","Amsterdam; Density; Liveability; Ecosystem Services; Resilience; Mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.392109, 4.851146"

Preserving the physical quantities from the continuous domain in the discrete domain is therefore of utmost importance. There is however a broad range of techniques that can accomplish the translation between the continuous and discrete domain, e.g. finite difference, volume and element techniques, fourth order Runge-Kutta or Störmer-Verlet to name a few. Accompanied with the aforementioned come strengths and weaknesses but have the common thread to try maintaining the physical behaviour of the continuous system closely. The mimetic spectral element technique is used to develop an energy-conserving spectral element scheme through a Lagrangian formulation. This new formulation of the mimetic spectral element technique allows for solving time-dependent problems and the simple harmonic oscillator serves as the sample problem in this thesis. The solution has been derived from Lagrangian mechanics in a variety of ways. Discrete Lagrangian formulations have been investigated at rst and their respective equations of motions have been tested against the exact solution of the simple harmonic oscillator. This method achieved marching in time and no damping of the solution, yet energy was only bounded and not exactly conserved. The mimetic spectral element formulation of the Lagrangian formulation showed diculties when using variational analysis, i.e. boundary treatment in the future. Arbitrary domain mapping was among the possible solutions, but this formulation was found to be unreliable and unsuccessful. It was found that a more robust formulation, i.e. the spectral marching method, was most suitable. Throughout this thesis the focus was put on the conservation of energy using a Lagrangian formulation. Except the spectral scheme using arbitrary domain mapping, all schemes kept the energy of the system bounded, but no energy was conserved up to machine precision. Using arbitrary domain mapping, the energy seemed to grow over time.","discretisation techniques; mimetic spectral element methods; energy-conserving; Lagrangian dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One of the major sources of noise is the rotor, and thus, there is a need to optimize the rotor design for aerodynamics and aeroacoustics. A possible technological solution is represented by Co-rotating rotors (i.e., two rotors connected through the same shaft with a prescribed axial and azimuthal separation). Such configuration can offer significant potential in noise reduction without affecting thrust and power distribution in a vehicle. At present, there is a lack of knowledge on the mutual interaction between the two rotors which limits physics based optimal designs.<br/> The purpose of the present study was to investigate the behaviour of a co-rotating rotor when its geometrical parameters are varied, such as: axial and azimuthal separation, collective pitch, etc. The simulation was performed on commercial software 3DS PowerFLOW which uses Lattice-Boltzmann Very Large Eddy Simulations (LB-VLES) for flow-field simulation and Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FWH) analogy for far-field aeroacoustic post-processing. Results show that, a higher angular separation results in higher thrust and lower noise, while a higher axial separation increases thrust but with noise increase with respect to a single rotor. However, thrust of co-rotating rotors is still smaller than the sum of two isolated rotors. This is due to the potential effect due to mutual interaction of the streamtubes of each rotor, blade-vortex interaction and flap effect (i.e. the lower rotor acts as a flap for the upper rotor when angular separation is small). Noise reduction is instead caused by destructive interference between the sound scattered by each rotor. Thus, a co-rotating rotor with higher azimuthal angle will produce less noise than a single rotor, both producing the same thrust. These findings suggest that the design of the two rotors can be optimized to account for the interaction effects, thus potentially doubling the effective thrust but still reducing noise.","Aerodynamics; Aeroacoustics; Urban Air Mobility; Drone; Propeller; Rotor; Co-rotating rotor; PowerFLOW; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Computational Aeroacoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It is responsible for the partitioning of precipitation into evaporation, transpiration, percolation and run-off. Soil Moisture monitoring is used to indicate droughts in vegetated areas and is an important parameter to early warning systems for flood. Therefore, throughout the years human population attempted to monitor and control it. The advent of Remote Sensing, during the past decades, enormously influenced soil moisture research by enabling acquisition of large scale data. Many Remote Sensing systems were developed exclusively to study this variable. Land subsidence, triggered both by human activity and natural processes, is another phenomenon whose monitoring is crucial for the environment and the human populationa and is thus an essential variable which needs to be continuously monitored in vulnerable areas, since it can damage buildings’ foundations. Remote Sensing and more specifically Microwave remote sensing has been pivotal in studying land deformation and subsidence in near real time. Detecting and monitoring land subsidence and deformation with InSAR method has been meticulously researched however there are still obstacles to overcome such as vegetation. The aim of this research is to study whether InSAR closure phases can be used to detect moisture changes. The idea of using closure phases for soil moisture estimation was proposed by De Zan, Parizzi, et al. 2013 and further studied by Zwieback, Hensley, and Hajnsek 2015a. The closure phase inversion model of De Zan and Gomba 2018 is implemented in this thesis using Sentinel-1 C-band for the inversion and SMAP data for the evaluation of the results. The results support the idea that this method has potential over bare soil and low vegetated areas but struggles to overcome vegetation due to its limited penetration capability. Furthermore, soil moisture changes may introduce a systematic error to land subsidence measurements. For this reason, the idea was to make use of the generated soil moisture data to produce interferometric phase corrections over the study areas. However, the results are inconclusive due to the poor quality of the data over vegetated areas.","Soil Moisture; SAR; Sentinel-1; Closure phases; Phase triplets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This method will also provide evidence on the various relations between the institutional form of education, the delivery mechanism of knowledge (books, lectures, screen), the role of the teacher and the actual space of education (classrooms, libraries, archives). The design intention is to dissolve the division/spatial separation between university and town, expanding the university into key buildings and spaces around the city and the landscape and developing ties between industry, institutions and the university. A parallel speculation on the future shifting of Gibraltar’s culture and economy, raises the issue of the provision of services to the students (accommodation, amenities, leisure). The project aspires to address these kinds of questions in the context of Gibraltar, I will further answering/reacting/counter-propose both for the procedure of learning and the future vision for the University of Gibraltar.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This is an approach to land development that includes a municipality acquiring land, servicing it with infrastructure and public amenities and disposing it to a real estate developer, in which the value increase of the land through its development in principal should cover the costs of the operation. In recent times, critical remarks about this way of approaching land development have increasingly occurred, especially since Dutch municipalities lost considerable amounts of money due to investments in land during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. After this, the collective idea seemed to be that municipalities had to get rid of this way of land development, adopting merely passive land policies. However, as it turns out municipalities have not abandoned the active land policy at all. This research aims at unraveling the characteristics and specifics of land policies and at finding out how municipalities decide on which type to apply. Through a literature review, the spectrum of different land policies is researched, after which an empirical research is done through case studies of eight municipalities to find out how the process of choosing and implementing a land policy in Dutch municipalities currently works. In the end, the lessons from practice will be compared to the existing literature, and a recommendation on how to treat land policy within municipalities will be done.","land development; active land policy; passive land policy; urban area development; Dutch municipalities; land policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Starting with understanding the distinction between object, subject, and how they are related, the search continues for architectural means to make a place that enables a change of perception. What changes this perception, is often a small trigger, a salient detail that can be highlighted in design, inviting a change in meaning of the object for the subject. An interplay of inside and outside, authenticity and inauthenticity, will allow for a change in perceiving and understanding both food and ourselves. That is how a fixed and frustrating relation with food can be abandoned, and how a meaningful relation is enabled.","Food; Phenomenology; Salient detail; Security; Freedom; Specifying; Authorizing; Inviting; Architecture; Scenario; Speculative Design; Pallasmaa; Tuan; Merleau-Ponty; Norberg-Schulz; Relph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

In an escape room, a group of players, usually between 2 and 20 people, are locked in a room, where they have to find clues and solve puzzles to escape. When such a room is played, there is always an operator, monitoring the progress of the players and keeping an eye on their safety. Modern escape rooms are quite technologically advanced, where all components of the room interact with each other. To run these games, Raccoon Serious Games needs a system which should manage all technical aspects within the room and provide a way for the operator to keep track of the players. Furthermore, the system must be flexible enough to handle many different escape rooms, which are hardcoded in configuration files. To meet these needs of Raccoon Serious Games, a team of three developers has developed a new system, called S.C.I.L.E.R.. In ten weeks, they have created a system from scratch. First, they researched technologies and requirements that would be necessary for the system and afterwards implemented the system based on their findings. S.C.I.L.E.R. allows an operator to monitor a complete escape room. The system connects a user interface to all the devices in the room, which are controlled by the user as well as the configuration of the escape room. This configuration is generated from a JSON configuration file, containing all information for the escape room. The system allows the operator to send hints to the players, control the time and manage their progress through the status of devices in the room and the puzzles they have to solve. It also contains the feeds of cameras in the room to actually see the players. Furthermore, it provides the user with a way to check a configuration file and put it to use. The system will be used by Raccoon Serious Games in the near future for the escape rooms that they will be hosting.","escape room; sensory; communication; parsing configuration","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

The housing shortage, combined with the booming economy, are causing housing prices to rise relatively fast. Although the housing market is pressured in many different regions and is affecting many households, especially middle income groups seem to suffer from the situation. These households generally earn too much to be eligible for social housing, but too little to obtain a regular mortgage. They are therefore located between the social rented sector and full-price homeownership, and increasingly have to rely on private rented housing (in Dutch also referred to as middeldure huur), where rent prices are often disproportionate to their income. A solution to bridge this ‘affordability gap’ are intermediate housing tenures, however, they are no longer applied on a larger scale due to the change of the Housing Act in 2015, as housing associations since then have to focus on their core activity (providing social housing). However, especially when housing affordability is becoming an increasing urgency to a growing group of households, it is remarkable that the main type of providers are being limited in their possibilities to do so. The main aim of this research therefore is to explore the potential enhancement of the Dutch intermediate housing sector, so that the provision of these tenures could be stimulated again. To be able to come up with measures that could be taken, an understanding of intermediate housing tenures in general, and the context in which Dutch intermediate tenures are operated, must be gained. The research therefore also aims to gain more insights in the concept of intermediate housing tenures and its characteristics and to understand the context in which intermediate tenures are and could be developed. In this research, literature study is carried out first, in which intermediate tenures have been defined and categorized, and a timeline of the development of Dutch intermediate housing tenures has been created with contextual factors that have shaped this development. The literature study has been complemented with an empirical study, in which interviews have been conducted to identify additional factors that (could) hinder or enable the development and provision of such tenures. Based on these findings, recommendations have been formulated that include measures that could be taken to enhance the context of intermediate housing tenures nowadays. These recommendations have been validated by housing professionals by means of an expert panel. The main measures include a more active role of the municipality to facilitate and stimulate the provision of such tenures in their municipality (varying in different levels of ‘activeness’), a national housing policy including intermediate housing tenures or other affordable housing solutions and demanding action from municipalities, setting up an advocacy group that unites all users of intermediate tenures and represents their interests and keeps track records of applied intermediate tenures to provide tangible proof of success, and focussing on developing potential new intermediate tenures that combine renting with capital accumulation or eventual homeownership.","Intermediate Housing Tenures; Affordable Housing; Middle Segment; Affordability Gap; Housing Policy; Housing Associations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","",""

Young adults are behaving very differently towards finances compared to previous generations (Williams et al, 2010). In addition, young adults have little trust on financial institutions and no one to turn to for actionable advice (Deloitte Millennial Survey, 2019). Adults in their twenties and thirties are struggling with money, feeling overwhelmed and lost (Foundation for Economic Education, 2018). A gap in the market was found, where no current solutions fostered long-term behaviors for young adults towards a secure financial future. I wanted to use my skills as a designer to solve this paradigm involving young adults and finances. The goal of this graduation project is to provide guidance and support for young adults in changing their current money habits so they can ensure their future well-being. This societal issue regarding young adults and money is a shared problem in countries all over the world. For a better understanding of the relationship young people have, the context was scoped down: the project was based in Madrid, Spain and it was targeted for young adults belonging to this country. Under this context, the research of the project provided valuable findings which led to the final design. Those findings can be extrapolated to non-spanish young adults. Young adult’s current money habits and the desired financial behavior for a sustainable well-being were identified and mapped in two frameworks. The transition between both was possible through the creation of a new product- service-system. As a result, a product-service-system, named Volt, was designed. Volt crafts a new meaningful relationship between young adults and money and consists of a smart phone case, a related digital application and the system that sustains both. Through the phone case, young adults will progressively save by clicking a button and check their financial health thanks to a coloured light. The digital application will first help young adults to budget on their personal financial goals into vaults or buckets and keep track of their financial health and progress. After some digital application use, the digital application will provide young adults with actionable financial advice and the entrance to a community of young people with similar financial situation, so they can feel supported and have the peace of mind they crave.","Design; Finance; Behavioral change; Design-Driven Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

By choosing this graduation topic, I was able to tackle a problem that many cities are facing and will be facing in the future if nothing changes. The stock of natural resources is shrinking, which is caused by our consumerism and throw-away society. Cities are becoming more and more dense, because of the urbanization. And these problems together will create massive amounts of waste in the city that can’t be send to landfill because there is not enough space. And it can’t be burned because it creates to much CO2. And the fact that humanity is growing, will make the problem even bigger if we don’t change anything, because we will keep on extracting more and more resources from our earth and we will be sending waste to landfill more and more as well. If only we could change our lifestyle and the way we design buildings, a future in which resources can be used over and over again, will save our earth. The biggest challenge, is changing the lifestyle of people in their homes, as not much residential buildings or homes focus on waste streams. The building I’ve designed is a reflection of this tipping point. The iconic tower is designed by the idea that the building could collapse any time, but it is still holding up because it tries to change the way we use earth’s resources and the way we live today. The building tackles different social challenges regarding to live a zero-waste lifestyle. It supports a self-sufficient lifestyle by integrating a communal vegetable garden, a rooftop greenhouse and a shop with local products. Also, it reduces consumerism because the dwellings are designed including most of the furniture and the building accommodates a shared stuff library, which makes it possible for people to rent stuff and products we don’t use daily. The building also accommodates separating waste streams, as this is very important if we want to be able to reuse, recycle or rot products in the future. Next to the social challenges, there were also some technical challenges in designing a high-density tower. The structure of the building is made out of wood. The design reduces the use of materials, which means that the ‘ruwbouw-is-afbouw’ principle is used as well as the design is based on standard sizes, which reduces ‘waste’ materials on site. The building is designed in a low-tech energy-efficient way, so it is almost zero-energy on itself. The building is an addition to future sustainable developments, in which one of the larges problems to tackle is the exhausting of our earth. This building could change the way we design residential buildings and change the way we use them. The design is based on twelve zero-waste design guidlines which have been formulated by extensive research. By using these design guidlines, every future architect will be able to design a building that supports a self-sufficient lifestyle and a circular building.","Zero-waste; Lifestyle; Design; Circular building; Zero waste lifestyle; Zero waste design; Sustainabilty; Dwelling; Dutch Housing; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","",""

Additionally, these developments often come along with major uncertainties, risks, and unknowns regarding the end-results. This has resulted in the publication of several documents in the past few years pointing out that the current tender system may not always provide for the most optimal urban area developments - calling for more efficient, flexible and quality oriented tender procedures. More specifically, the partner-selection method, which is a new phenomenon, has been introduced in practice. Many professionals say that this new method could be the answer to the rising complexities in urban area developments. The aim of this research is therefore to explore its potential and its credibility. More importantly, the goal of this research is to design a partner-selection process that is robust and trustworthy through organising it in such way that it accommodates for the formation and continuation of successful partnerships. The main research question of this graduation research is therefore: ‘How can a partner-selection process be designed so that it enables the formation and continuation of successful partnerships in municipal land developments’ To answer this question, literature studies were carried out in order to 1) obtain knowledge on the newly introduced partner-selection process and its ingredients, and 2) to map the success factors that lead to successful partnerships. Three case studies were then explored through conducting semi-structured interviews in order to 1) obtain further knowledge on the partner selection process, 2) to enrich the current knowledge on the mapped success factors, and 3) to tailer the most important success factors specifically to the partner-selection process and to obtain an understanding on how the success factors can be organised specifically in the partner selection process. The information obtained from the empirical studies was then used to design an event based partner-selection process model. <br/><br/>This process model is a proposal which presents and illustrates an example of how a partner-selection process could be designed and organised. It is specifically directed at municipalities, but could of course be used by other parties to obtain a further understanding on what the partner-selection methods entails. Furthermore, all municipal land developments are different, meaning that each project requires a customised process. The events and elements of the proposal can therefore be moved around until seen as fit. All in all, the proposal serves as a tool to guide municipalities when setting up a partner-selection process.<br","urban area development; partner-selection; municipal land development; successful partnerships","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Approximately 50 per cent of the total turnover in construction is generated within the country’s large cities. It’s expected that this percentage will grow to 80 per cent in the near future(De Bes et al., 2018). Inner-city construction activities and the large logistical supply stream connected to it has a large impact on the liveability of the city. Almost 30 per cent of al business traffic is related to construction logistics (Vrijhoef, 2018). Consequences of these activities are a nuisance for neighbours due to noise, congestion, poor air quality due to the emission of greenhouse gasses and particulate matter, and a negative impact on road.<br/><br/>The development of Construction Consolidation Centres is an innovation in the logistical process that helps with lowering the impact construction has on the cities. The benefits for society and involved companies would suggest that the CCCs are a great success and are widely used in practice, the reality is different. Researchers debate the ability of CCCs to be financially self-sufficient (Browne et al., 2007) or state that the implementation of CCCs in the construction process is expected to increase when the financial benefits are transparent. De Bes et al. (2018) stress the need for the development of financial models that enable supply chain partners to consciously decide for the implementation of Construction Consolidation Centres based on predicted financial benefits. An important step in the development of these new logistics solutions is proving their value by measuring the impact on efficiency and costs (De Bes et al., 2018). <br/>The implementation of Construction Consolidation Centres in the Dutch construction sector is limited due to a lack of tools to prove the financial benefits. A calculation model that predicts the impact of the logistical costs on the construction costs in the preparation stage of the project to prove the financial benefits of the Construction Consolidation Centres has not been developed yet. <br/><br/>The aim of this research is to develop an alternative model for cost accounting in the construction industry. This model includes the activities of the construction logistics process impacted by the implementation of a Construction Consolidation Centre. The developed model needs to enable the prediction of the impact of the implementation of a CCC on the costs of a construction project in the preparation stage of the process. <br/><br","Construction Consolidation Centres; logistics; costing model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Focusing on the Orleans Lakeside sub-basin, this project builds on previous work through a joint design-engineering approach. This project seeks to address two shortcomings of existing proposals such as the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan: consideration for extreme weather events in the design framework as well as focusing on the integration of technical adaptation measures with the built environment. Hence, the main research question answered in this report is “How can Orleans Lakeside be made more flood and drought resilient by integrating multi-layered resilience capacities of the built environment, whilst safeguarding consistent design of technical adaptation measures within the urban space?”. The development of a design framework and detailed design interventions follows from a synthesis of earlier proposals, supplemented with a vulnerability analysis that focuses on the different capacities of the built environment in dealing with weather events of various magnitudes. For this analysis, the threshold (preventing damage), coping (mitigating damage), recovery (recovering from damage) and adaptive (flexibility to change) capacities of the built environment are investigated. The multidisciplinary approach taken in this project culminates in an urban water management design for Orleans Lakeside which is focused on introducing open water in the urban environment. This design proposal offers a high potential of meeting the required water storage capacity, with the intention to reintroduce the lost identity of wetlands to the suburbs of New Orleans. Typological and urban design across scales aim to integrate water system elements into the urban fabric, and to merge a new water-based urban environment with traditional desired American neighborhood qualities.","New Orleans; flood resilience; drought resilience; climate vulnerability; urban regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","30.007347,-90.090443"

It is isolated from chaotic cities, with a positive climate (300 days of sunshine a year), green slopes, sea views, fresh air, and quieter streets.<br/>Gibraltar is the perfect set because of the current and forecasted importance of healthcare in its economy. Based on Gibraltar's budget between 2017 and 2019, a forecast envisions a growing expenditure in the healthcare field. The forecast demographic increase suggests almost 30% of the new population will be composed of children under 18.<br/>In the peaceful ambience of the mighty Rock, only a short walking distance from the Royal Naval Hospital, a block of sheltered housing with primary health facilities (emergency, occupational therapy, and imaging departments) aspires to renovate, making the transition from home to hospital imperceptible. By all measures, in fact, the home is the future of healthcare. <br/>Specifically, the proposal focuses on the design of a long-term residential paediatric centre, targeting young patients and families who normally travel far from their homes to specialized hospitals. Hence, the design for Gibraltar's 2050 hospital envisions the city-state as a place for treatment, healing, and recovery, strengthening the economy by serving the population expansion and strengthening Gibraltar’s position as an attractive and pleasant place to live.<br/>Architecturally, the bottom-up complex provides an experiential journey from medical processes and foyers, common spaces, and a public healing garden (the Rock itself), to rest, healing, and independence. The new social and architectural melting-pot attempts to combine the notions of domesticity and hospitality in a secluded area on the Rock.<br/>In summation, this social-architectural project aims to reach a point of privacy and dignity, especially through its small, human scale. Families and residents of all ages and origins can enjoy much-needed breathing space, and carry on their normal and dignified lives.<br","hospital; domesticity; Healthcare architecture; Pediatric healthcare; forecast-driven; Gibraltar; Beyond the Rock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

It is<br/>not a new phenomenon, but due to better understanding of the topic and therefore knowing it’s dangers better, the urge to do something about it grows. Nevertheless, loneliness is a complex issue. This is because feeling lonely is<br/>a subjective feeling. In Amsterdam alone 300.000 people have the feeling of being lonely. 80.000 of them have the feeling of being severely lonely. That is 13% of the whole population in Amsterdam. In may of 2017 the municipality of Amsterdam presented a plan of action to reduce loneliness in the city, which underlines the necessity of taking action. The chief government architect Floris Alkemade also sees this as one of the challenges of the future. He says that<br/>the fundamental changes on demographics, technology and care asks for<br/>new spatial challenges and opportunities in the residential areas. The post-<br/>war neighbourhoods do not fit in with the current society. Alkemade points to the increasing loneliness, the great reliance on informal care, which has limits, and the growing dichotomy in society. The number of single people living has increased, but many post-war homes are suitable for families. This requires other types of housing. The design of the public space also needs adaptation to promote social cohesion and to prevent or reduce loneliness.<br/>The goal of this project is not to solve urban loneliness. First of all because loneliness isn’t something that can totally be solved. Loneliness is also something you don’t entirely want to get rid of because of the biological function it has as a warning system for our social needs. The fact that Loneliness becomes chronicle is something we can do something about. And one small piece of the puzzle is to design the built environment in a way that prevents chronicle loneliness to a certain extend. This building doesn’t have the intention to serve for a group of lonely people. This building isn’t build for lonely people where they are trying to get rid of their loneliness by the way the building functions. The purpose of this building is to minimize the probability of loneliness to manifest. Because buildings can be a catalysator of loneliness. The solo dweller is the perfect target group to start with. The building will function more in a preventive way in a problem solving way. Research showed that people who live alone are more likely to camp with loneliness issues. They have different demands when it comes to housing than other groups. There is currently a mismatch between this growing group and what the housing market is offering. This results is a declining living quality for the solo dweller group. The goal for this building therefore is to present a design proposal for a social residential building with dwelling types and living environment that suits the solo dweller needs due to the mismatch of current residential buildings and the demands of this target group.","Residential building; Solo dweller; urban loneliness; Solid timber; Dwelling; Social","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","Dutch Housing Studio","52.397727, 4.875264"

For this, a Building Energy Simulation and Optimization method (BESO), was carried out. Such a method introduces multi-objective optimizations, which can help identify design solutions that need to satisfy multiple and possibly conflicting objectives. The optimizations were carried out separately for all three major climate zones of the country, using a typical classroom-corridor topology as a simulation model.

This integration of digital technologies into everyday life is what is called the digitalization process (IGI Global dictionary, 2018). It is a process that can be seen as a long-term societal transition influencing our daily life, like the way we work, how we do our shopping or how we communicate with friends and family (Van Winden &amp; De Carvalho, 2017). As the way we live influences our use of the space around us, changes in this process also change our use of the space around us. On the other hand, our surroundings influence the decisions we make as well.This graduation projects will focus on the use of public space and how public space is affected by the introduction of digital devices. It is believed that this digitalization process has introduced new behaviour, making public space not just a space for traditional uses, like meeting people, but also places where digital devices are used more often, either for practical or for social purposes. Public space is seen as one of the fundamental elements of cities and thus also of Dutch cities, and cities need to prepare themselves for future changes. This graduation project tries to find a new synergy between this traditional use of public space and the use of digital devices in public space, by analysing the phenomenon in the Indische Buurt, a neighbourhood in the eastern part of Amsterdam. It will provide an analysis of this neighbourhood, research the impacts using personal digital devices have on the use of these spaces, and how to deal with these changes. The results of the analysis will be translated into urban design interventions which have the ultimate goal to find a new synergy between the different uses of public space. With reflecting on these interventions and proposals, a matrix will be produced to show how certain interventions are connected to different types of use and user roles. This will show how the design interventions could be integrated in other neighbourhoods or cities.","Digitalization; Public space; Human behaviour; Urban design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","",""

From a linear increase, we can see an increasing trend since the 1990s. According to recent scientific research, the sea level in the Netherlands will rise 1 to 2 meters by 2100 with a maximum global warming of 2 degrees Celsius. With a temperature rise of 4 degrees, the North Sea water level will rise 3 meters. At the end of the next century, the rise can increase up to 8 meters. This project focuses on the Wadden Sea, one of the last remaining large tidal areas where the forces of nature are free to do as they please. It is the last of the authentic nature in the Netherland and is essential to millions of birds and fish. The whole Wadden Sea area, which stretches between Den Helder in the Netherlands and Esbjerg in Denmark, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009. Along the coast of the Northern Netherlands, salt marshes were created outside the dikes through the deposition of sand and silt with a spontaneously established vegetation on them. The plants, such as sea lavender, samphire and sea aster, are resistant to the regular flooding by salt tidal water. Salt marshes are one of the few Dutch landscapes of very great international significance. Salt marshes can play a role in protecting coastal regions from flooding. These intertidal zones are delimitated by wooden barriers created by man in settling fields, in order to reclaim land from the ocean. With the tide come sediments that are then held back by the wood enclosure as the water retreats. Salt tolerant species then stick to the mudflats making it more stable and bringing oxygen into the soil for regular plants to grow in these coastal ecosystems. The project therefore includes a territorial intervention: environmental engineering for coastal protection, a landscape Intervention: increase accessibility of the site, and a building intervention: offshore cabins inserted into the primary structure. The tidal area can be saved by the same forces of nature that make it unique: sedimentation can potentially be increased at the same pace as sea level rise, with help of low impact and low cost brushwood dams. With salt marshes breaking the waves, the impact of incoming seawater is muted, it promotes the wealth of species, and retains sediment. As a result, the marshes can grow with rising sea levels. The eroded brushwood dams from earlier times can be rehabilitated to reclaim land in front of the dike. The dams are extended into a floating boardwalk, which unlocks the engineered intervention as common ground. Offshore cabins are inserted into the primary structure on every intersection, overlooking the different landscapes. This increases attractiveness of the land in front-, on- and behind the dike and makes it better accessible from the Frisian hinterland, despite the sea level increase.","Wadden Sea; Intertidal flats; Coastal protection; Engineered landscape; modular architecture; Wood architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","Graduation project",""

Unfortunately, children who have a Congenital Heart Defect (CHD), may suffer from a lack of opportunity to perform physical activity, decreasing cognitive maturation, motor development and autonomy during childhood (Krol, 2003). This impediment arises due to a misunderstanding from parents, who do not know to what extent their child can exercise safely, and therefore adopt overprotective behaviours (Schwerzmann, Thomet, &amp; Moons, 2016).In order to understand better overprotection during childhood, 305 online parental stories from various patient-association websites were analysed using Natural-Language-Processing techniques. The results exhibited the lifetime journey of these families, where an uncertain future evocated a constant search for symptoms. The findings of this phase were employed during generative interviews with seven families with a CHD paediatric patient to understand the continuous search for symptoms during exercise. The combination of the insights gathered from interviews and the lifetime journey was presented to five medical team members to inspire a co-creation session. The outcome of the meeting helped to define the problem and create a design vision which helped to ideate a potential Product-Service-System (PSS) solution to support parents to let their children safely perform physical activities. To encourage families to have a safe, ordinary sports-life, BO is introduced, a smart PSS aiming to support parents and their children with a CHD to understand better the safety boundaries of exercise during free-living conditions. With an activity tracker and his nine system modules, Bo aims to guide the child through different heart rate zones defined by doctors. Furthermore, Bo has a conversational agent function where parents can send concerns to the medical team and find relief when seeing their child’s heart rate zone.A functional prototype of the conversational agent was developed and implemented in the real context of four families to understand how could it influence overprotection. The implementation experience and overall concept of Bo were evaluated through in-depth interviews with paediatric CHD patients and their parents and three different specialities from the medical team. The results showed that Bo provides a supportive exploratory environment for the family, where the child can self-discover the safety boundaries and parents, instead of limiting the child, adopt an encouraging attitude towards physical activity.","Product-Service-System; Conversational Agent; Design for Children; Healthcare Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

A solution to both problems is the use of a multi-agent system (MAS). However, no fault-tolerant MAS solution exists for the type of flow network that the highway network is. We therefore design our own fault-tolerant MAS solution for flow networks where the failure of a controller does not change the characteristics of the flow network. Our design associates an agent with every outstation in the network giving it the ability to make its own decisions. The communication protocol used by these agents to communicate with each other is capable of detecting communication failures with outstations and rearrange them so that the control action remains unchanged. This results in a system which keeps the highway safe when one or more outstations or their communication abilities fail.","Multi-Agent System; Traffic control; Flow Control; IOT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

As the famous economist and business strategist Michael Porter note. Business practice is overflown with an increasing number of societal and environmental concerns, trumping economic activity and trapping businesses in a vicious cycle in which taking responsibility is repaid with taking even more responsibility. On the other hand, these societal concerns cannot be ignored and need to be addressed. As shelter, water, food, and welfare must be provided to a growing population in a durable and future proof manner. <br/>Urban development practice is burdened with this same complex problem. Businesses are confronted by an increasing number of public sustainability regulations and with neo-liberal influences shifting more responsibilities towards the market. Scholars raised their concerns if the public social value can be safeguarded by the market. However, business practice proofed to be capable of taking their social responsibility and even found a way to contribute to both society and their business performance, linking their social behavior towards their corporate reputation. This phenomenon is called CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) benchmarking, in which social reporting and labeling are used to enhance their client base. The danger, however, is that these activities are often better displayed in these reports than performed. Besides, these reports primarily enhance the environmental concerns and leave the ‘softer’ aspects of sustainability ill addressed. These limits of the CSR-benchmarking concept are mainly caused by the intrinsic perception of businesses towards these social activities. Social activities are seen as a costly practice and with the ‘enterprise culture’ still present many businesses today. These activities are not likely to be performed. This problem became the starting point of this research. Can this intrinsic perception of businesses towards social activities be changed? <br/>The Shared Value Creation (SVC) concept fitted this question with its aim to turn corporate social activities from a costly practice into a value-creating activity. By exploring the concept of SVC this study aims to change this business perception towards social activities and eventually contribute to creating sustainable urban areas.","Shared Value Creation; Corporate social responsibility; social sustainability; Social innovation; Corporate social opportunity; Urban Area Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Residual strength hypothesis were formulated based on a literature study and the current design norm of dyke design on soft soil layers in the Netherlands. A Limit Equilibrium Method analysis of the pre and post failure geometry served as a basis to determine the peak and residual strength of the soft soil layers following the residual strength hypotheses. The 3D effect was taken into account in these analyses, and determined to be around 20\%. A Material Point Method model of the experiment without sheet pile wall was then created to test the different residual strength hypotheses. Factors were applied on the strength properties calculated from the LEM model to match the MPM model. A factor of 1.23 was applied to account for 3D-effect and 1.16 to correct for water on passive side being absent from MPM discretization.<br/><br/>The Material Point Method model showed that during failure the behaviour of the clay layers could be expressed with an Undrained SHANSEP formulation. In this formulation the residual strength of clays was found to be independent of the Over-Consolidation Ratio. In a Mohr-Coulomb formulation this results in a complete loss of cohesion. Leaving the OCR out of the strength formulation of clayley layers resulted in horizontal displacement of 4.5 m, which is close to the 6 to 8 m found during the experiment. Further decrease in S-ratio of 30\% resulted in horizontal displacement going up to 7.5m in the MPM model. A reduction of 0 to 30\% of the S-ratio could therefore be concluded to be a range of friction softening. This was concluded to be in accordance with what was found in literature. Laboratory testing and correlations based on index properties effectuated prior to the experiment showed residual friction angle around 30\textdegree. The residual strength backcalculated are much lower, and therefore in contradiction with the laboratory testing results effectuated. The use of cyDSS and LDSS tests was therefore deemed inappropriate for the determination of residual strength.<br/><br/>The Limit Equilibrium Method analysis of the dyke with sheet pile wall was deemed inappropriate for the back analysis of the soft soil layers. The horizontal forces induced by the soil-structure interaction cannot be disregarded. It is recommended to back calculate the peak and residual strength of the peat layer using a Finite Element Method analysis. The displacement measurements of the failing dyke with sheetpile wall in the peat layer showed similarities with strain localisation in a DSS test.<br","MPM; Residual strength; SHANSEP NGI-ADP; Eemdijk test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","","52.2586733, 5.3283188"

A new food culture is developed from production to consumption across the peninsula and over time, gradually alleviating Gibraltar’s culinary life. ""Culinary Cultures"" introduces a change in the familiar setting of the Public Market, highlighting particularities that it already offers, aiming to smoothly imbue the shift in the local culture. Making people aware becomes then a strategy to shrink the current ratio of obesity and overweight residents that affects three out of five Gibraltarians. The purge of the current “effortless” street food culture should be an invitation for participation, resulting in an understanding of what we should consume and how. Gibraltar’s expected population doubles by 2050 and becomes even more diverse in terms of the nationalities living in the territory. As a result, its survival depends on the maintenance of its differences, and even its further differentiation. Incorporating new dietary habits and dining settings of people from northern Africa and east Asia becomes the new challenge. Within the scenario of the local food production around this infertile land, architecture in relation to food has the chance to alter its current consequential condition. Food and dining should not take place in generic spaces that happen to be there, but in spaces created to host them and enhance a coherent food culture across the territory. The ritual of eating in ""A Gibraltar in the Making"" is an integral part of the coastline and even the sea, materializing in a multilayered scenario from production to consumption. The “Vessel Food” becomes a symbolic place to dine with friends, where the production and preparation of food takes place in a performative manner in front of consumers. In a contemporary urbanized society like Gibraltar, cooking provides one chance most people have of taking some control over what they eat. Cooking is not just about what goes on in the kitchen, it is a pivotal point in the food chain—the one that arguably affects everything else in it. Cooking, like talking and writing, requires education— and like these essential skills, it comes easily once you know how.","food chain; Gibraltar; Food; Culture; habits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-28","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","Beyond the Rock","36.14474, -5.35257"

More particularly, it is about an upgrade of a ship repair yard known as Gibdock. It is aiming to counterbalance the issue between the ecological and Gibraltar’s economy, improving a better quality of the local environment to Gibraltar, and while providing efficiency and convenience as if a pit stop, to make a profit on the global stage of the maritime industry.It is strategically located in the western Mediterranean but cannot accommodate the majority of current container ships due to its limited size of dry-docks. Historically, Gibraltar has been fortified for many centuries, and human activities happened both on land and on ocean—Gibdock used to be a British naval dock (S, M and L size) for repairing and docking battleships, and has dominated Gibraltar’s economy with the naval dockyard providing the bulk of economic activity until 1984— this, however, has changed after then, and these undersized docks impeded Gibdock to catch up on new demands in ship repairs and refits currently.The upgrade strategy critically considers new international marine regulations, anticipating standard sizes, operations quantity, type of repairs for the next decades. It finalizes what kind of refits to ships need to complete, in order to comply to new rules. This anticipation of design is based on a wide range of sizes in relation to container ships, machine operations, spare parts, and considers how this design can turn the side effect of heavy industry in positive way. As a consequence, a new piece of infrastructure modernizes these S, M, and L docks while a new wet-dock in front of the existing docks enables Gibdock to modify XL boats. The service Gibdock provides is part of a larger marine business strategy called the ‘’one-stop-shop”. By offering all the services in one place —Gibraltar can gain a competitive advantage over Ports which only offer one or two of these services. This modification of ships at Gibdock is another service alongside those that Gibraltar already provides: refueling&amp; underwater cleaning (at North mole), loading &amp; unloading (at container berth), crewing &amp; de-crewing, mooring (at Quayside), repairing and refitting (at Gibdock).","Gibraltar; Industrial buildings; Shipping Industry; One-stop-shop; Gibdock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","Beyond the Rock","36.126884, -5.354560"

When the influence of architectural means is not limited in its own profession in this Post-truth era.

The image of Gibraltar – which remains vague, mysterious, exotic in most minds – is thus ideal to generate rumors. The spatial influence of the new type of Chinatown interfered in smaller scales, on personal level.

To design an effective architectural rumor, the method is analogy to the ordinary way of designing architecture. The design brief, the objective of all the Chinatown rumors, is to suggest the Chinatown in Gibraltar either directly or implicitly, the site and program are chosen on media where we learn about Gibraltar, and the reference can increase reliability of the rumors. The Chinatown rumor disseminated in Europe might be on websites and stories about Brexit and cultural transformation to increase exposure. The Chinatown rumor disseminated in Gibraltar might be on local forums with exclusive stories.

It describes how Gibraltar’s geomorphology—a mountain surrounded by water, located between two water bodies and two continents—has resulted a unique local ecology that is vital for the global ecosystem. Carried by the winds, migratory birds soar across the Strait; ocean currents and water temperatures determine the spawning locations of marine life migrating through the Strait; human migrants settle on their way to cross the Mediterranean; tourists travel to the peninsula to observe its unique and dynamic biodiversity. The Rock and its morphology produce local winds and precipitation, which have shaped the Rock into two distinct sides: an urban and cultivated west side, a steep and uncultivated east side, and a Nature Reserve on the Upper Rock. In turn, these sides have framed settlement patterns, from early military settlements between walls and on the Rock, to reclamations and Marinas on the verge of the surrounding waters. Levante clouds and limestone formations provide humidity and alkaline soils for endemic plants; the seeds of which are taken by the wind, insects, birds and Barbary macaques that reside on the Rock; whose residence in turn attracts troops of tourists and their accompanying taxi drivers. The project explores how both the global and local ecologies affect and are affected by human settlement and design. As humans are part of the same ecosystem as all other species, they shape it, and are shaped by it. Birdwatchers travel to coastal areas to see the journey of the flocks; cruise ships and dolphin tours interact with migrating marine life; urban settlements expand into the sea and onto macaque-territory; Mediterranean woodlands are cultivated and become Maquis-vegetation; behavioural patterns of Barbary macaques are influenced by the tourists coming to see and feed them and the architecture that provides for them; as well as vice versa. In a context of climate change and population growth, two paintings and a series of models anticipate changes in global and local migratory and settlement patterns and explore the role of design within these ecosystems. As sea-level rise, droughts, changing temperatures, and extreme weather conditions reshape global and regional migration and settlements areas of all species, the projected intervention in Gibraltar is an examination of the role of design in the balancing act of the global ecosystem.","Nature Inspired Design; Artificial; Gibraltar; Flux; Flora and Fauna; The Berlage; Migration; Settlement; Berlage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","Beyond the Rock",""

More specifically, it is an investigation of how architecture is used to provide a background to civil society and induce meanings through spatial and structural constructs whose realization is based on exchange value. In the transient territory of Gibraltar, where current and future construction boom run the risk of encouraging local authorities to dispose of land and property assets to real estate developers, the project takes the form of a hotel, with its ability to provide the means through which the relationship between public and private space is negotiated, while capitalizing on the capacity to produce different formats of social encounter. Hence, the modus operandi of this contribution within the grand scheme of things is twofold; The hotel comes in as a point of convergence whose sole purpose is based on continuous movement of people and capital, facilitating the predicted boom of the tourist industry and the increasing influx of people into the territory. More importantly, however, it presents itself as a private commercial venture offering an alternative ground for social and political participation in a privatized city. <br/>It is the political charge of the hotel that this project uses as a means to articulate the civic potential of this particular building type. By introducing politics as a set of activities that take place on the spectrum between public and private, the Inn Gibraltar challenges the hotel as an architectural artifact—with its programmatic, formal, and spatial presence—and its capacity to engender a register of meaning in its own right. To politicize a hotel then means to openly question its importance, not only as a city-forming element, but also as a relevant cultural edifice. To explicate what is often only implicit is to shed light on the forces that shape and will continue to shape not only Gibraltar's, but our urban condition at large. As such the project's main intent is an interrogation of a particular form of hospitality in order to comment on the transfer of responsibility from agencies as different as the state or the family to the corporation.<br","thesis; hotel; public","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

This interest is met locally with directly opposing views, favouring on the one hand the cultural development related to land-based practices, and on the other hand exploiting Finnmarks high resource potential for the benefit of municipal growth and job development. Difficulties arise with the geographic distribution of ethnicities. Proposed developments of the mineral industry find more support in coastal areas and although most indigenous Sámi find their home inland, they depend to a large degree for their livelihood on this coastal areas. The current fractured political landscape is highly related to and tied up with the complex history of internal center-periphery dynamics, colonization and stigmatization, which took (and in a way are still taking) place under the flagship of national assimilation policies of ‘norwegianization’, sustaining Finnmarks not-so-postcolonial present. In this perspective, three mining cases are of interest, due to the different social and political responses to the mining plans: Nussir in Kvalsund, Bidjovagge in Kautokeino and Sydvaranger in Sør-Varanger. Motivations behind decision-making on these cases illustrate clearly the conflicts of interests and demonstrate the difficulties for coexistence of directly opposing world views. Through an understanding of the formation of societal strata, the argument of the thesis unfolds over an in-depth spatiotemporal and on-site analysis of the cases and their specific socio-territorial setting in Finnmark. I argue that we should look more critically at the tendentious role of the modus operandi of urbanists and geologists (more specifically of resource mappers), in their way of influencing decision-making and framing and shaping cultural life, especially in contested territories. The thesis then moves towards a possible way forward through redesigning our conventional tools and methods for a more inclusive territorial-based endogenous growth model, such an inclusive growth model has the potential to bring together on the long term the opposing visions and ideas on the future of the mining industry and the preservation of indigenous culture. I end by arguing that knowledge building from a combined perspective has the potential to evolve the acceptance amongst cultures abiding by different worldviews. Effectively, the newly proposed geological era of the Anthropocene, proposes also the updating modern science with cultural diversity, asking for renewed responses away from the modern tradition.","Socio-territorial identity; Holistic urbanism; Traditional ecologcal knowledge; Territorialization; Indigeneity; Territoriality; Finnmark; Arctic Norway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","Transitional Territories","70.453453, 24.279846"

In particular, it questions the external nature of these techniques to the field, and how the discipline might come to formulate its own critical technicity. This is premised on a systems-view of technical development, which highlights the importance of time and situatedness for any consideration of change, genesis or becoming. In order to then construct an architectural technicity that can grapple with the external character of technical development, I argue using the philosophy of technology of Gilbert Simondon and Stafford Beer’s management cybernetics that what is needed for this is a radical opening-up of the architectural process in the form of a democratization, to augment architecture’s capacity for producing alternate futurity. The design project continues from this with the formulation of a notion of an open architectural system. This is premised on the idea by that taking the passage of time into consideration in architectural interventions the social nature of the processes through which these interventions arise are made explicit: it is therefore an attempt at elaborating a design-, building- and organizational process that continuously engages with the system-environment that constitutes the proposed design location – a concrete plant on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The design is intended as a system that plugs into the existing system on site, gradually supplanting the concrete plant and using it to fashion a material landscape that functions as the substrate for an open residential cooperative. This material landscape is designed as a system that functions to support all processes and flows necessary for the maximization of freedom in architectural expression for the occupants of the site, with the intention of subverting market logic and financialization in Amsterdam’s housing system.","Architecture; Cybernetics; Systems thinking; Complexity; Futurity; Construction process; Technicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

The project is situated in the Hembrug Area. Hembrug is located near the Dutch cities of Amsterdam and Zaandam. The Hembrug site is a former military production site initially part of the Stelling van Amsterdam. It was located in such a way that when the Netherlands would come under attack, it would have all its military production protected and centred. The Hembrug area has recently been vacated by both the Dutch ministry of Defence and the company which made parts on the site, Eurometaal. The buildings now lay vacant and desolate. This is a shame as there are many historically important buildings within the area, including 50 monuments. The area is in need of a new use and redevelopment. Of the entire Hembrug Area, this plan focusses on an area known as The Changeover Zone. Drawing inspiration from the sites historic functions, the tough buildings and its secluded location, a new military function, but not a production function, was searched for. During research, a particular current need of the armed forces was identified, a rehabilitation facility. Up to 400 Dutch military members each year report life limiting problems sustained from their time in the forces 6 months after leaving. These problems can be both physical problems and mental health related. When initial care has been received, the men and women face a society which is not used to dealing with their specific issues and members of society can be outright dismissive of problems faced by military personnel. The concept therefore is to design a rehabilitation facility to aid in a more graceful and hopefully better return to society as a whole. The Armed Forces Rehabilitation Center, to be referred to as A.R.C. is a rehabilitation centre focused on 2nd phase care. By creating a small scale society of kindred men and women in which one can receive care if required but is fully self-supporting in every aspect, a level between the Armed forces and society is created. By arranging the facility as a city block with separate functions in each building centred around a square, people are forced to leave their housing but can still do so in a safe environment. Having to cross the square each time one goes to a different functions also functions as a stimulant for spontaneous interactions and making friends. These friends will then be of great help during the rehabilitation. By creating the square and creating a new raised footbridge, a dynamic range of levels of privacy is created. A person living in this facility is free to move between these levels, allowing one a gradual move back into the public.","Hembrug; Changeover zone; Heritage & architecture; Heritage; cultural value; Armed forces; Care facility; Transformation; Architecture; Rehabilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.421938,4.832518"

In 2013 King Willem-Alexander stated: “Everyone who is able, is asked to take responsibility for his or her own life” (Rijksoverheid, 2013).

In addition, the change of the traditional welfare state into a participation society strengthened the loneliness of the elderly. In conclusion, the housing market of elderly requires a new layout.

Detecting disruptions helps to measure service reliability, which can be used by public transport operators to improve this reliability. In this thesis, a methodology is described to automatically detect disruptions offline, using smart card data. The day-to-day regularity of delays is investigated using hierarchical clustering on a training set, to distinguish between regular and irregular delays. The clustering result is used to create a probabilistic classifier. This classifier is applied to the test set to find days that do not correspond to a regular pattern: irregular days. After that, disruptions are detected within the irregular days. The outcomes of this study can be applied in multiple ways. Locations where disruptions have occurred can be found and the related passenger delay can be calculated. This can help public transport operators to prioritise which locations to focus on to reduce passenger delays. Furthermore, not only public transport networks, but also other networks can benefit from the outcomes of this study. Speed data of road networks could be used to find disruptions that are caused by accidents, instead of regular traffic jams. On top of that, this study could be used as a step towards real-time disruption detection, for both public transport and road networks.","Public transport; Offline disruption detection; Smart card data; Hierarchical clustering; Probabilistic classification; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In these datasets, cell identification is mainly done manually, which is subjective and time-consuming. As a consequence, most datasets are annotated at a different resolution. This is not surprising as cell types form a hierarchy, but it can be problematic for downstream analysis or comparison of datasets. Several supervised methods have already been developed to overcome the drawbacks of unsupervised learning. None of these, however, combines the information found in multiple datasets and preserves the definition of cell populations in each dataset, while this consistency is necessary for downstream analysis. Furthermore, a supervised classifier should be able to detect new cell populations in an unlabeled dataset. Here, we introduce a hierarchical progressive learning pipeline with a one-class classifier to face these challenges. Using this pipeline, it is possible to construct a hierarchical classification tree by combining the information of multiple datasets. If datasets are annotated at a different resolution, their cell populations will be at different levels in the tree and all definitions are thus preserved. By using a one-class classifier for each cell population it is also possible to have a correctly working rejection option and discover new cell populations. In this paper, we show that it is possible to construct a classification tree for simulated data and immune cells. When comparing the pipeline with a one-class to a linear classifier, we show that a one-class classifier can indeed improve the rejection option. Using a linear classifier, on the other hand, results in a higher accuracy. Choosing between a one-class and a linear classifier is a trade-off between the ability of discovering new cell populations and a higher performance.","Cell types; Transcriptomics; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology | Bioinformatics","",""

However, finned tubes make heat transfer in the convection section of fired heaters considerably more complex. Consequently, engineers depend heavily on correlations to determine heat transfer in the convection section of fired heaters. The problem related to the use of these correlations is twofold. First, these correlations have been developed approximately forty years ago by performing wind tunnel experiments for 1"" tubes and 2"" tubes, after which the results have been extrapolated to accommodate for 4"" tubes. Second, industry developments led to the use of 6"" tubes or even 8"" tubes in the convection section of fired heaters. As a result, it should be questioned if correlations still provide accurate results for these tube sizes. This study aims to validate an entirely new way of calculating heat transfer and pressure drop in the convection section of fired heaters proposed by a recently developed analytical method. In contrast to correlations, the analytical method provides insight in the working principle of fins, is in theory applicable for large tube sizes, and ultimately has the potential to design convection banks more accurately. The latter would result in a reduction of fuel consumption, and with the focus on reducing emissions to reach climate goals, this would mean a significant improvement over existing correlation methods. Numerical models based on the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model have been developed in ANSYS Fluent to be able to validate the analytical method. The values of the heat transfer and pressure drop coefficient relative to the bare tube area have been compared with the values calculated by the analytical method and the ESCOA correlation method for one tube row and for multiple tube rows to see which method resembles the results calculated by the numerical models the closest.","Fired Heaters; Convection Section; Convection Bank; Fin; Finned Tube; Convective Heat Transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The site functioned as military production stores, testing site and as the logistical heart of the “Stelling van Amsterdam”, the defense line of Amsterdam. This former military industrial site comprises of several different building ensembles, which include fifty monuments, historical green and water structures and remains of the former infrastructural system. The set-up of the military site followed a functional approach which, in combination with the former exclusive functions, led to a closed-off, inwards oriented character. Nowadays Hembrug is located in an industrial, excluded area. But the city of Amsterdam is expanding rapidly, growing towards Zaanstad and the industrial areas around Hembrug will be transformed into residential areas. Hembrug will also be connected to the public transport by the metro network. Within this project the aim for Hembrug is to transform the site into a vivid part of the developing Amsterdam-Zaanstad metropolis. The area should not only provide amenities and diverse qualities to the individual area, but also to the upcoming residential neighborhoods that will surround Hembrug. The new design for the Plots in the woods aims to connect people and nature through food and thereby strengthen the relationship between food consumers and producers. Functioning as a platform for urban farming, by means of providing space for food production, education/ innovation and social interactions. To accomplish this the plots in the woods will house the following functions: a food market containing a greenhouse along the south façade with innovative techniques for food production which are accessible through workshops combined with a food market with all kinds of food and market stands; office space ranging from permanent offices to public workspaces with reservable meeting rooms and other needed facilities to study or work; diverse food joints ranging from a small coffeebar to a luxurious restaurant using the local products; an education center which will be used to give workshops, exhibitions and lectures about possibilities to grow your own food within the city and an event hall which will function as a flexible, big open space for all the functions on site. The landscape was just as important for the functioning of the factory as the buildings. Therefor in the new design the earlier mentioned functions are not strictly binded to the interior spaces but will also flow towards the open spaces. There will be a vegetable garden, public square and flexible furniture which can be used in multiple ways.","Heritage; Hembrug; circularity; urban farming; social hub; Revitalising heritage; Architecture & heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Revitalising Heritage: Hembrug Peninsula",""

This development has resulted in more sensitive receivers, but this increased sensitivity also has increased the susceptibility of these receivers to interference from external sources. One of these sources that is known to disrupt terrestrial communications is the Sun. The DISTURB project aims to provide the means to observe and study interference phenomena generated by the Sun between frequencies of 10 MHz and 3 GHz. Furthermore, DISTURB stations should provide the ability to observe the Sun from sunrise to sunset, at any location in the world and thus require full hemispherical coverage. This master thesis project is concerned with the design of a conformal phased array antenna for a novel application in radio astronomy. The goal of this project is to provide an initial conformal array design that is able to provide full hemispherical coverage in the 1500 MHz to 3 GHz band of the DISTURB project. A quasi-spherical array of radius 1.55 metres and with 343 crossed modified bow-tie antenna elements, distributed using a novel geodesic topology, is proposed and found to satisfy DISTURB requirements in the frequency range of 1.3 to 3 GHz. Hence, the designed array is found to achieve a fractional bandwidth of 79% and therefore even exceeds the initial design goal. Finally, the designed array is compared to a parabolic reflector antenna, resulting in an insight in the complexity of a conformal phased array antenna design and the advantages and disadvantages such a conformal phased array antenna may bring to the DISTURB project.","conformal; phased; array; DISTURB; wideband; wide-band; wide; band; ultra; UWB; quasi; spherical; radio; astronomy; geodesic; HEALPix; antenna; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Firstly, the iADP controller is designed to achieve automatic Online rate control to track pilot commands via setpoints provided by the manual outer loop on Citation II Aircraft model. Secondly, to assess the controller performance in the presence of sensor dynamics and actuator dynamics, an analysis is carried out to identify causes of any performance degradation. The simulation results from iADP longitudinal control using full state feedback indicate that the discretization of sensor signals, sensor bias and transport delays did not have any significant effect on the controller performance or on the incremental model identification. However noisy signals and sensors delays are found to cause controller performance degradation. Appropriate filtering of signals resulted in better estimation of the incremental model subsequently improving the controller performance due to noisy signals. Control performance degradation due to sensor delays should be addressed in future before conducting flight tests on Citation II Aircraft.","Reinforcement Learning; Intelligent Flight Control; Flight Control Systems; Machine Learning; Adaptive Flight Control; Incremental Control; Incremental Approximate Dynamic Programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

One adjective is sufficient to identify the city of Venice; more complicated is to figure out its singularities: the city of canals, trades, cultural exchange, gate between the west and the east, the city of the myth, the romantic city, the city of the endless descriptions. “At once solid and liquid, at once air and stone”, claimed Erica Jong, almost as if she wanted to seize in a sentence the multiple facets of the Venetian character. The several representations and attributes that depict Venice not only precede its reality, but constitute a determinant part of its character: the island is simultaneously more than its narrations and more than its reality. Starting from this dicotomy, the following project focuses on the analysis of Venice’s reality, the one of its present situation, by keeping its narrations as a boundary condition. The consideration of Venice not being the most serene Republic anymore is a fact. The city is experiencing a transitional moment in its lifetime: events as tourists’ invasion, drop of the population, transformation of the building stock to accomodate tourists’ needs are determinant factors for the future of the city, internationally recognised as slowly dying. The transformations are influenced by the effect that phenomena as overtourism produced on the island. And it is precisely the relationship between overtourism and Venice the topic that is tackled in this project, by taking the city as a case study, a symbol in the broader discussion about city and overtourism. Therefore this project does not want to be considered as a method for the definition of a solution for all the cities that are experiencing the aforementioned situation, but the opposite: the foundation for the development of an architectural proposal for the Venetian context, with the aim of invigorate the international debate around the topic of overtourism and cities’ transformations. Therefore, 'Of Stones and Travelers' is a project that relates with the city of Venice, considered as the symbol of the difficult relationship between cities and tourists, stones and travelers: the situation in which the city is transforming into a productive machine in its own consuming. It is by acknowledging this present condition that I have decided to analyse the city of Venice, by trying to understand what can be done, as architect, in order to affect its condition, with the aim of positively affecting its future. The exploration perpetuated with the project aims to understand and test the way in which the permanence of visitors in Venice can be affected via architectural terms. The theoretical approach adopted to reach this goal is the one of developing an exploration of the logics that undermine the characters of the city of Venice, therefore their understanding and transposition into a modern design. It is important to clarify that such exploration is not an aesthetical re-interpretation of Venice but the opportunity to test how the assemblage of the city can evolve without being stuck in its picturesque idea. Therefore, the value that I have researched is the understanding of Venice as an assemblage, as a combination of different layers which relationship define the character of the city. Its dissection and application in modern time is the value I have tried to pursue in my design.","Venice; Italy; regeneration strategies; city expansion; architecture theory; Urban Planning; big scale project; oil tank; Restoration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","Explore Lab 28","45.450204, 12.265579"

The old explosive factory within the site of Hembrug has an unexpected relationship with its natural environment. The abundant greenery on this site is not only important for how the site is currently experienced, but it is also a crucial part of the sites heritage. Therefore it should also be an important part of this areas future. Thus this design aims to preserve this natural environmental by redeveloping this site with a minimal intervention strategy.

This way the design balances both the natural and build environment of the site and shows how these do not need to be mutually exclusive in a Heritage site such as Hembrug.","Heritage & Architecture; Hembrug; Sustainability; Revitalising Heritage; Nature; Hotel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Revitalising Heritage: Hembrug Peninsula","52.420132, 4.838347"

Failure of frequently used acetabular reconstruction components are, among others, caused by the lack of biological fixation, a non-physiological stress distribution and stress-shielding. Attempting to diminish these drawbacks of current implants a new acetabular cup has been explored. The double layer of this new acetabular cup better fills the acetabular defect. According to Wolff’s law this should reduce stress shielding and stimulate bone ingrowth. Part one of this study explores the relationship between unit cell size of the titanium and mechanical properties for the body centred cubic unit cell. Three graded lattices using different unit cell sizes were designed and 3D-printed out of commercially pure titanium (Grade 1) using selective laser melting. An unconfined compression test with cylindrical samples as well as a confined compression test with hemispherical samples were performed to obtain mechanical properties. An additional finite element study was used to validate the confined compression test. Acetabular defects were made in five Sawbones hemipelves which served as the basis for the design of the ‘patient specific’ acetabular cups. Three triflange and two unflanged acetabular cups were designed and 3D-printed out of commercially pure titanium (Grade 1) using selective laser melting. Mechanical properties were obtained from the unconfined compression tests. All acetabular cups were inserted by two orthopaedic surgeons at the UMC Utrecht. Cyclic testing was performed up to 1000 cycles to assess femoral head penetration under load after insertion. Additional penetration of the femoral head was found to be between 0.1781 and 0.3793 mm. Future work is needed to prevent strut breakage upon insertion and more research is needed in the fatigue behaviour of these new cups and their biological effect on living bone tissue.","3D Printing; acetabulum; defects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It involved nine interviews with logistics buyers, fulfilment companies and integrators, after which findings were validated by means of a focus group with industry experts. Key challenges were found to be mainly technological; a lack of relative advantage when comparing it to the status quo and the risk of potential downtime were indicated by participants numerous times. Furthermore, among organizational factors, available resources were identified to play a moderate role and regarding environmental factors, the lack of marketing efforts surrounding Shipping APIs was argued to be of marginal impact. From this unique view of different stakeholders in the outbound logistics chain, this study hopes to promote API adoption and provide insights into the new emerging API paradigm within the supply chain network. The insights gained from this research can help to better formulate implementation strategies concerning integration technology, in an industry that is adapting to a new composition of consumer buying behaviour.","integration; outbound logistics; API","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

About 65% of the plastic litter is buoyant in fresh waters, meaning it has the capability to float, making transport over rivers relatively easy. A better understanding of how plastic litter is transported via rivers is crucial. Both for quantification and mitigation of the plastic problem. Most research on quantification of the plastic flux is based on surface-measurements only, up till about 50 cm water-depth. Thereby, most cleaning strategies focus on skimming only the surface. This research investigates the distribution of buoyant plastic litter over the water depth in rivers. Given the wide use of marginal buoyant plastics, it is hypothesized that a significant share of the plastic in rivers is transported below the first 50 cm surface-water, due to the mixing ability of turbulent flow. In such case, a great share of the plastic litter is overlooked in both flux estimates and riverine removal strategies. The question arises: How is plastic distributed over the water depth in rivers and how is this distribution related to prevailing flow conditions? The research is based on four pillars: Knowledge on the hydraulic plastic parameters (1), in combination with experimental observations (2), might lead to an explanation of the distribution with a theoretical approximation (3), based on existing literature from neighboring research fields. Lastly, manipulation (4) of this plastic distribution by hydraulic interventions is investigated. With this research, a first insight is created on the vertical behavior of plastic in relation to the flow conditions. This study shows that marginal buoyant plastics can be sensitive to turbulent motions in flow and a significant amount of plastic might be transported below the surface. In order to create a complete picture of the behavior of different kinds of plastic in stream flows, more extensive research is needed.","plastic; buoyant; floating; suspension; rivers; turbulent flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research field ventures beyond the traditional approach towards ecology and introduces the city as an ecosystem of its own. The theme of urban ecology is strongly represented in the program envisioned for the area of Hembrug, but also in the design approach for the area itself. The landscape and architectural design should reflect this combination of nature with the existing built fabric and can be viewed as an experiment to test the principles of urban ecological design.","Heritage; Urban ecology; Hembrug Terrain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Revitalising Heritage","52.421468, 4.834436"

Since the financial crisis of 2008, a shift has been made to more organic approaches to development. Currently, a paradigm is evolving which is able to deal with complex challenges that the built environment faces today: a shortage of housing and a transition to sustainable energy. Industrial area Schieoevers Noord, situated in Delft, is developed with the rationale of this new paradigm: directing into the direction of a mixed-use and densified city district, yet with an open end. Since the Municipality of Delft does not own land in the 75 hectares large district, interdependencies exist between the municipality, project developers, and the current users: industrial companies. The problem statement of this research project: how to plan for sustainable energy supply (heat and cold supply) in a complex context characterised by interdependencies. The concept of adaptivity has been explored as a potential strategy to implement in a process of sustainable energy planning, resulting in the design of a five-step approach: the Schieoevers Noord approach for adaptive energy planning. Six characteristics of adaptive processes have been found based on a literature review. Three of these turned out to be absent in current approaches for sustainable energy planning: a way to explicitly incorporate uncertainties (unpredictability and interdependency) in planning, mechanisms for iteration, and the creation of conditions for development (rather than planning actual developments). The latter has been intensively studied by investigating heat and cold balances in different building scenarios (densities and function mixes), concluding in the need to shape conditions for development in Schieoevers Noord, by the proposal of energy-based design guidelines, ensuring energy-neutral developments, no matter the building volume or mix of building functions.","Sustainabilty; Energy Transition; Heat Transition; Area Development; Complexity; Adaptivity; Adaptive Planning; Uncertainty; Municipal policy; Delft; Schieoevers Noord","en","master thesis","","","","","","The master thesis is the result of a joint graduation project of the masters Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences (Track: Building Technology) and Science Education and Communication (Track: Science Communication).","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","51.994657, 4.366390"

Stereolithography and particularly, the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology appears as one of the most auspicious printing techniques for the fast creation of mechanically stable hollow structures. However, the diﬃculty in developing hydrogel bioinks, which could be used for the fabrication of high resolution complicated architectures with structural integrity, remains a challenge. In the present study, eﬀorts were focused on ﬁnding the components that could be used for the creation of an optimal bioink suitable for DLP printing. After deciding on the most promising components, the bioink’s optimization in terms of printing resolution was performed taking under consideration the fundamental principles of stereolithography. To achieve this goal, the working curves and all the key parameters, which deﬁne a photopolymer’s behavior were studied. After the optimization of the resolution, the prospective bioinks were characterized in terms of their crosslinking eﬃciency and mechanical properties. Consequently, complex porous scaﬀolds were fabricated from the selected bioinks and mechanically tested. Finally, the encapsulation of cells into the bioinks, as well as, the seeding method were performed for the creation of cell-laden scaﬀolds, which were also studied through the performance of cell viability and proliferation tests.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An example of this is Smart Lighting, a field in which Chess Wise is active for over 6 years. By adding sensors and communication lighting can be controlled more efficiently. For example motion sensors to turn off lighting where no movement is detected, or a light level sensor to achieve the same light level throughout the day. This saves energy when natural light is available. Extending the wireless network with a gateway to the internet opens even more possibilities to control and monitor the wireless network. The technology used by Chess, called MyMesh, is a proprietary mesh network. One node is a small embedded device with limited resources. The MyMesh network is selforganizing. All nodes have the same function in the network. All nodes cooperate to get messages from node A to node B. Being selforganizing allows nodes to be added or removed at any time. By leveraging the communication between nodes their limited resources can be combined into a big shared resource. The MyMesh network currently uses an protocol, SharedState, to combine the limited memory capacity (cache) of the nodes. During communication nodes exchange memory items, called Tokens. By moving these tokens around each node has access to the combined memory space of the whole network. In this thesis a renewed algorithm is proposed that improves the overall storage capacity of the network. This renewed algorithm also scales better with the number of nodes compared to the current algorithm. SharedState used a probabilistic approach to transmit tokens and replace tokens in the cache. With the renewed algorithm per cache entry two additional fields (age, rx) are added. These fields are stored to calulate the informational value by Shannon[19]. The age field indicates how long ago the token was placed in the cache. The rx indicates how many times the token was received during that time. Using the age, rx and the average number of tokens received per round the informational value can be calculated. This informational value is higher for tokens that are received less often. Each round the cache is reordered saving the tokens with the highest informational value at the top. Tokens that do not fit in the local cache are discarded. These discarded tokens carry a low informational value. To transmit tokens the renewed algorithm uses the cache position as the probability of ending up in the transmit message. The higher the position in the cache, and the higher the informational value, the more likely a token is to end up in the transmit message. Using this new proposed algorithm the storage capacity now grows with the number of nodes. And more tokens are retained in smaller networks.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

This has a negative impact on Bali’s environment, local society and its tourist driven economy. With lacking waste management facilities and local awareness plastic waste enters Bali’s rivers, through which the waste ends up in the ocean. A concept small-scale recycling business, aiming to improve local waste management and awareness, is proposed to solve the problem at the source. The goal of this research is to investigate the technological, social and financial feasibility of the concept recycling business and to find a target location. The research first aims to choose three potential locations with different social-demographics through a literature study on Bali’s regional social-demographics and the results of previous ”Pantai” Project researches. Based on this three locations are chosen: Denpasar, Canggu and Pulukan. For better understanding of the areas of interest, the crucial steps for setting up a business on Bali and its local waste management are investigated. A detailed stakeholder analysis is therefore also conducted. This is researched through participatory observation, literature study and interviews with local inhabitants, local businesses and governmental institutions. Surveys are conducted in the areas of interest to analyze how to Balinese handles their plastic waste, their mentality towards the plastic problem and their willingness to participate in the concept recycling plan. The results of the survey show enthusiasm of the local people towards the concept recycling business in the target areas. However, not all stakeholders are represented in conducted surveys, thus care must be taken when concluding the social feasibility. To investigate the technological feasibility literature study is done on plastics and different techniques in all steps of the recycling chain. Through this, feasible techniques for all steps of the recycling chain are chosen, regarding the concept recycling business. Plastic waste is to be sorted by hand and processed by easy operable machinery based on the open-source designs of Precious Plastic. A conceptual model of the small-scale recycling business is introduced for better understanding of the plastic and money streams involved in the concept recycling facility. To investigate the financial feasibility, first the plastic stream is evaluated. In each location households separated and collected all their plastic from the rest of their waste for one week to estimate the composition and quantity of their weekly plastic waste production. From this result the plastic input per location is estimated through calculations. A model is presented to evaluate financial stability of the concept recycling business. Input values for the model are the results from own waste collection measurements and the values acquired from connected parties. Calculations show, although being a rough estimate, financial feasibility. However more in-depth market study has to be performed for more detailed results. Taking everything into account it can be concluded that it is indeed feasible to start a small-scaled recycle business on Bali in Pulukan or similar areas, which is determined by a multi criteria trade-off. However close consideration of local conditions should always be taken into account.","Pantai; Bali; plastic; recycling; Indonesia","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Multidisciplinary project",""

The is connected to an understanding to people’s personal experiences. Social media is playing an increasingly important role in daily life, as the technologies to do social media mining is developing, it is becoming a great database for learning about people. These data from social media is becoming a valuable dataset that is scaled, updated in every moment, and its access is being increasingly democratized. <br/>These rich data are bringing a lot of opportunities for emo:on designers to scale up research and design. They form a dynamic dataset of people’s emo:ons related to their preferences, opinions, geographic locations, communities as well as social news and events. However, social media mining has not yet been employed for emo:on-driven design. Currently there are various tools and methodologies that support design conceptualization, but with no tools yet to employee the dynamic social media data as a material. This project investigate the role of the user- generated content on social media to emo:on- driven design, bridging the two with meaningful stories that reflect people’s subjective experiences in emotional events. Later on, experiments and tests were done to explore a workflow of how can designers discover the meaningful stories from Instagram. This resulted in a basic approach and a set of data exploration techniques. Therefore, the goal was set to developed a data exploration tool for designers, which facilitate them to do controllable explorations and flexible searches with with the qualitative, unstructured social media data. The target group is designers who are interested to look for meaningful stories in social media but have less experiences in data mining. In the end, a data exploration tool is developed , and it is evaluated by designers on the effectiveness aspect and experience aspect. The evaluation indicated that the story exploration in social media with the tool could sensitize the designers with their target users’ daily life emotional experience, and can broaden the designer's horizon by having an overview on the possible experiences. The tool is recommended to be used in the very early phase of emo:on-driven design.","Emotion-driven design; Social media data; Data mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This suggests that the current selection procedure of armourstones is not flawless to all degradation mechanisms, especially in dynamic environments. In this work armourstone is meant to include all rock that is used in river, coastal and offshore constructions, including rip rap and rock fill. Armourstones are in the Netherlands selected by their CE marking, which lists the description of the armourstone product and information on regulated characteristics. These characteristics are tested according to the European standard EN 13381-1&amp;2:2002, which specifies the properties of aggregate acquired by processing natural materials for use as armourstone. This research is executed to provide a contribution in the quality control and assessment of armourstone and rock fill to ensure proper handling and installation in coastal and waterway protection structures. The research started with a durability investigation according to the standard EN 133831&amp;2:2002 on sampled sandstones and limestones that will be used in a submarine trench backfill, to check the regulated armourstone characteristics. Next, a petrographic analysis under the microscope was performed on methylene blue (MB) stained thin rock sections to investigate the presence of deleterious constituents and structures. This analysis was followed by extensive index testing to investigate the applicability of simple testing tools in a durability investigation. These tools include the Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) test, an indirect tensile strength test, the Equotip test, a surface hardness tester that records the surface rebound of an impact body, and the MB adsorption and staining test. MB is a dye that colours constituents with an excess in negative electric charges. The tests according to EN 13383-1&amp;2:2002 suggested that the sampled armourstone bulk satisfies the required durability parameters and no evidence was found that indicates rapid degradation during the engineering lifetime. Nevertheless, variability in the armourstone pieces was spotted and some individual rock pieces approached or exceeded minimum durability requirements. The BTS test revealed considerable variation in tensile strength, a key parameter to assess degradation, between armourstone blocks and within a single block when a similar orientation of the bedding was maintained. Moreover, the orientation of the bedding in the sandstone had large influence on the tensile strength, where the values obtained perpendicular on the bedding were twice as high than parallel to the bedding. Single impact method (SIM) Equotip measurements on rough, untreated aggregate surfaces were consistent. The rebounds correlated to visual features like grain size, cracks, surface roughness and degree of weathering within handheld specimens. Equotip measurements on the rock cores and sawn surfaces obtained higher mean rebound values and smaller standard deviations. The mean and standard deviation are considered most suitable to be used in a durability investigation. The repeated impact method (RIM) by the Equotip was not successful to indicate the degree of weathering of single hand specimens. The mean Equotip values on the aggregate correlated well to the water absorption when divided into proper density and size classes. The mean rebounds on the cores distinguished well between weathered and intact cores when saturated, and correlate well to the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) values. Furthermore, the Equotip mean rebound value related to the BTS value when performed on isotropic rock disks. The MB adsorption test and MB staining of the thin sections indicated the presence of localised spots and laminae rich in clay or organic matter. The staining of sawn aggregate surfaces agreed with some of the deleterious structures in the thin sections, yet was not consistent throughout the tested rock pieces and varied between the dark coloured limestone and light coloured sandstone. The Equotip test, BTS test and MB adsorption test are quick, easy and cheap methods to obtain more understanding in variability and rock behaviour which are not necessarily captured by the standard laboratory tests according to EN 13383-1&amp;2:2002. The simple index tests should always be accompanied by the standard laboratory tests to provide a proper reference and understanding. Detailed mechanical durability tests, like the slaking test or wet-dry cyclic tests, should be performed when the durability assessment indicates a high amount of deleterious minerals and structures, to identify the amount of degradation caused by swelling behaviour of these minerals.","Armourstone; Rock Durability; Equotip; Simple Testing Tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

This does not only increase the fatigue loading on the monopile, but it also increases underwater noise that affects marine life. The increase in installation costs due to additional material on the monopile, noise mitigation and longer installation times drives contractors to look for alternative installation methods.<br/>GBM’s Vibro-drill strives to install monopile foundations through a combination of jetting, liquefaction and fluidization to reduce the soil resistance to such low levels that the monopile will penetrate the soil under its own weight and thereby significantly reducing underwater noise. Although the working principles are still being tested, the Vibro-drill design needs to be improved for commercial application. The design must include the three operational functionalities stated above, but to make the Vibro-drill re-usable for consequential monopile installations, additionally retrieval and structural rigidity are required.<br/>For this thesis, the Vibro-drill is re-designed to include these functionalities. Starting from a process description, all load cases and additional design requirements were found. Based on a first global load case, a first selection was made for the connection mechanism. Subsequently, a Multi-Criteria Analysis was performed yielding two suitable concepts: the Vibro-Boxer and the Vibro-Polyp.<br/>The Vibro-Boxer relies on three extending arms that connect with a specially designed pile shoe using twelve hydraulic grippers. To feed the system with hydraulic fluid, water and air, an umbilical connects the installation vessel with the central hub of the Vibro-drill. At the end of each arm, eccentric weights are used to vibrate the pile tip. The Vibro-Polyp has a similar lay-out except for the arms and connection mechanism. Nine hinged arms form three sets of folding parallelograms to expand or contract the Vibro-drill. The connection is made through a set of pins on each arm that slide into holes in the pile shoe.<br/>Due to unknown soil properties and effectiveness of jetting, liquefaction and fluidization, the loads on the structure cannot be determined deterministically. Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to perform the structural analysis based on a best guesstimate for the distribution of these unknown parameters. Based on this approach, a tool is created that aims at performing the structural analysis while iteratively improving the design. As test results will become available after finalizing this thesis, input for the unknown parameters can be updated to improve the results of the structural analysis.<br/>Subsequently, based on this progressive insight, the design of the Vibro-drill can be optimized further. Note here that for the structural analysis, the system is assumed to be quasi-static which is a gross simplification of reality. Although this imposes limitations to the reliability of the results, this assumption is allowable for the preliminary re-design phase considered in this thesis. The structural analysis described here has been applied to both suitable concepts. For each concept, the external loads were identified and the internal loads<br/>were calculated. A series of structural checks in the Monte Carlo simulation provided a probability of failure. For both concepts the probability of failure was initially too high and therefore improvements to the structural components were made. Based on the design criteria, the two optimized design concepts were compared. Due to the smaller frontal area of the Vibro-Polyp its soil resistance on the tip of the monopile and the Vibro-drill is the smallest and therefore requires the least eccentric force. Nevertheless, the structural analysis shows that its hinged arms are fatigue sensitive yielding a higher probability of failure. Therefore, despite its larger frontal area, the Vibro-Boxer has a higher reliability and is the most suitable concept for the Vibro-drill. Finally, a more detailed design of the Vibro-Boxer concept is delivered that complies with all design requirements. For this design, recommendations are given on how to update the design based on the dynamic analysis and future test results.","Offshore Wind; Monopile foundation; Installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-29","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Developing countries especially are struggling to manage the increasing volume of untreated wastewater. A preliminary study of a Dutch-Indian partnership, developing universal watermanagement (LOTUSHR), has shown some indication of ortho-phosphate removal by mineral wool. The objective of this research is to understand the ortho-phosphate removal mechanism of mineral wool used for wastewater treatment. It was hypothesized that mineral wool dissociates ions due to biologically mediated pH changes, which subsequently interact with ortho-phosphate, forming minerals and removing ortho-phosphate from wastewater. First of all, the chemical composition of mineral wool was determined. Secondly, the dissolution of mineral wool was quantified by batch experiments at different pH and phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, geochemical modeling with PHREEQC was used to analyze the thermodynamic potential of wastewaters to precipitation, not containing mineral wool. Additionally, the phosphate removal rates of a flow-through experiment, using mimicked Indian Drain Water and mineral wool, was compared with PHREEQC simulations. Results showed that based on chemical analysis mineral wool contains: 188.0 g/kg silicon, 187.6 g/kg calcium, 79.3 g/kg aluminum, 43.1 g/kg iron, among other elements. The mineral wool showed no significant dissolution of ions under different pH and phosphate concentrations. Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected, as the mineral wool did not release ions when stressed with different pH. Consequently, biological conversion will not facilitate ion release from the mineral wool either. The mineral wool did show a self-buffering effect, due to its alkaline properties. Furthermore, with use of PHREEQC, amorphous tricalcium phosphate was characterized as the major mineral phase. In conclusion, the hypothesis formulated was rejected. This research performed did not lead to the identification of the removal mechanism responsible for the ortho-phosphate removal from wastewater by mineral wool filters.","Mineral Wool; Phosphate; PHREEQC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","LOTUS-HR",""

However, many women across India struggle with it. Due to a number of barriers, these women are not able to use sanitary products resulting in a risk of contracting reproductive tract infections (RTIs), also their self-esteem and self-confidence also gets affected. This has consequences: girls dropping out of school, women quitting work, reluctance to be part of social events and the infections leading to severe health related complications to name a few. Hence, social entrepreneurs in the field of menstrual hygiene management decided to address this social problem by establishing small-scale production units that make low-cost sanitary products and run awareness campaigns. However, the diffusion of these low-cost sanitary products remains very low. Therefore, raising questions about the sustainability of these small-scale production units that have cropped up across India. Thus, in this research, a conceptual framework is built to help understand the social innovation (SI) process of making and selling low-cost sanitary products, and clearly identify the salient factors that influence the diffusion of these sanitary products made by the small-scale production units for this complex market. Eight salient factors were identified that influenced the diffusion of low-cost sanitary products among women in India: relative advantage, complementary product &amp; services, network &amp; interpersonal ties, promotion platforms, intermediaries, social structure, political factors, cultural &amp; psychological factors. Based on these findings, it led to five policy recommendations and three recommendations to the social enterprises. The policy recommendations are: i. Changes to GST exemption on sanitary products. ii. Central action committee to ensure consensus in promotion of sanitary products. iii. Revision in existing standards for sanitary products. iv. Sanitary waste management. v. Programming for menstrual health programs. While, the recommendations to the small-scale production units are: i Develop environment friendly sanitary products with more size and colour variations. ii.

Its purpose is to validate the results obtained in recent core experiments reported by Janssen et al. (2019) and provide mechanistic interpretation. In these experiments authors injected a surfactant slug into sandstone cores, initially brought to residual oil saturation. Low oil/water IFT leads to oil mobilization and the formation of emulsions. Furthermore, authors found that oil is more effectively mobilized when the injected surfactant is at optimum salinity. In this study the following experiments are subsequently conducted in a microfluidic device to validate this optimum surfactant slug: primary drainage, waterflooding and surfactant flooding. In case of the surfactant flooding experiment, the micro-emulsion formation was observed at 1.5 PV and 1.25 PV for the under-optimum and optimum conditions respectively. In both conditions, an increased oil mobilization was obtained, compared to the waterflooding experiment. However, the optimum condition, with a slug salinity of 2.0 wt% NaCl outperformed the under-optimum condition with a slug salinity of 0.4 wt% NaCl in terms of oil recovery. The increased salinity in case of the optimum condition results in an lower IFT compared to the under-optimum condition, which in turn results in an higher capillary number. The obtained results indicate a dependency between the capillary number and the amount of oil droplets. The optimum capillary number can be found at the lowest oil saturation with the largest amount of droplets. Based on the results obtained from the conducted experiments on this microfluidic device, upscaling is considered to be a viable and educated recommendation.","microfluidics; Surfactants; slug salinity; winsor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays the majority of the patients is treated with radiotherapy. Recently research in to a new paradigm of radiotherapy, so called FLASH radiotherapy, has opened up a new insight in to reducing negative side effects. FLASH dose rates (&gt;40 Gy/s) have the ability to reduce the prevalence of negative side effects in patients without sacrificing tumor control. This study focuses on whether dose rate affects the degree of damage to healthy tissues caused by ionizing radiation. Understanding the biological mechanisms that influence the response to radiotherapy and specifically FLASH radiotherapy is therefore key knowledge in the development of new therapeutic protocols.This study evaluates dose-rate effects using zebrafish embryos as a small model organism. To study dose-rate effects the zebrafish are irradiated at 24 hours post fertilization and biomarkers are researched to asses dose-rate effects. They are irradiated using a Co60 irradiator providing a dose-rate of 0.015 Gy/s and a second one providing a dose-rate of 0.211 Gy/s. Several biomarkers for radiation damage are identified, including rate of embryonic development (hatching), DNA breaks and apoptosis. The DNA breaks are measured using a TUNEL assay and apoptosis through a caspase-3 assay. The results of the assay's are measured using confocal microscopy.Monte Carlo simulations of the experimental setup were performed to assess the uniformity of radiation and effective dose. They show a homogeneous dose throughout the sample, they show a 37% lower dose in water in the sample compared to air.The hatching biomarker shows that the hatching rates are 0.24 +-0.03 for non irradiated samples and 0.37 +- 0.31 and 0.43 +- 0.20 for samples that have been irradiated with respectively 0.008 Gy/s and 0.015 Gy/s with a total dose of 10 Gy. It shows that the hatching rates decreases for the irradiated embryos compared to the non irradiated samples however no significant difference can be found for different dose-rates. The sub-cellular biomarkers, the TUNEL assay and the caspase-3 assay, seem more promising in detecting dose-rate differences but more research is needed to find the dose-rate effects on DNA damage and apoptosis. In order to gain a fuller picture into the biological mechanisms of FLASH dose-rate radiation a greater variety of biomarkers and more research in to DNA damage and apoptotic biomarkers is needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

The increased popularity of these structures comes with a boost to the development of wind turbines in general, resulting in larger and higher constructions. To ensure the support structures of the turbines are able to withstand the extreme loads and environmental conditions, it is subjected to a series of tests and checks, prescribed by codes and standards. This thesis focuses on buckling checks, with global buckling in particular. Several codes and standards define buckling checks, differing in approach. For example, the global buckling check is based on global buckling (compromised stability due to an axial force), but also takes eccentricities into account. How these parameters and safety factors are incorporated is analyzed for the Eurocode and the DNVGL, which are considered the most relevant design standards regarding offshore wind turbines around the Netherlands. Difference between both global buckling checks are analyzed using a monopile based reference wind turbine. Looking to the more mechanical termof global buckling (also called Euler buckling), one finds an expression for the buckling load, based on the flexural stiffness and the buckling length of the structure. However, both parameters vary over the height of the support structure: the monopile has one relevant buckling value, where the flexural stiffness varies with its geometry. Therefore the buckling length cannot be constant for the structure. To tell something about this buckling length, the support structure is modeled with Euler beams as visualized in the figure. Subsequently the buckling force is analyzed, a constant value for the flexural stiffness is derived and the buckling length is calculated. Finally, the influence of the soil conditions on the buckling length of the structure is analyzed. To determine whether a second order analysis is required to calculate the buckling force of the support structure, a comparison ismade. Two Euler-Bernoulli beam models are introduced, one with a second order term, one without. The influence of the term on the bending, rotation, moment and shear force is analyzed, as well as the influence of the Euler buckling force. Subsequently an incremental load factor is introduced to incorporate the second order effect in themore simplified beam model. Finally, the relevance of global buckling is considered. How relevant is the global buckling check for the currently installed wind turbines, and how relevant will it be for the larger support structures that are to be expected? To answer these questions, comparisons are made between the buckling checks and how far from failing the checks are. Subsequently, the local buckling is introduced to compare the global buckling check to the local buckling check regarding relevance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

However, one of main limitations of battery application in on-board power systems is the aging of batteries. Applications of instantaneous power input/output such as propulsion dynamic assistance and heavy seas operation of ships, have an adverse effect on battery lifetime meaning that degradation of energy capacity over time is accelerated. Additionally, limited by their maximum current rating, batteries cannot deliver effectively high C-rates and therefore are not able to fully absorb the engine fluctuations. A typical solution for this problem is to over-size the battery system. By paralleling more batteries, the max. C-rate is lowered, and battery lifetime can be extended. On the other hand, an over-sized battery system will result in additional capital cost and weight. Therefore, it is evident that in conventional approaches there is an undesirable trade-off between battery aging and battery size. As an alternative practical approach into this problem, this thesis proposes an on-board hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that comprises of a battery and a supercapacitor component. By placing the supercapacitor in parallel to the battery and by using it for high peak currents, it is possible to reduce the stress on the battery and thus extend battery lifetime while improving the availability and the reliability of the power system. In addition, by taking advantage of the high specific power of the supercapacitor and the high specific energy of the battery it is possible to optimize sizing of the energy storage system for high power applications. In this thesis, a parametric approach of combined sizing and energy management for hybrid energy storage system is developed and integrated into a typical DC shipboard power system . Based on a case load profile, the HESS operation is simulated and benchmarked to battery-only installations.

The proposed intervention is there for an affordable hurricane resilient building system that firstly transforms Sint Maartens linear economy to a circular economy. By using local waste materials, and producing new building products from waste it improves the urban metabolism of the islands economy. Secondly it improves the socio-economic resilience by bringing together different actors to create a more resilient and productive actor network. On an urban scale the system can grow incrementally.

Through a research on the Bauhaus educational system and contemporary educational systemz, the statement is made that the student is the new master. Removing the clear hierarchy that existed within the Bauhaus university. From this research the function of the building is defined as, an inter-disciplinary school where the student is its own master. The personal development of the student is then separated into staying, learning, collaborating and sharing, in which each theme has its own defined functions. Following the removal of hierarchy, the spatial sequence of the building follows this idea of a dynamic network. There is a dynamic society within the building, where all rooms play a role within the education. No hierarchy between the spaces. It is a continuous space where all the spaces are linked together. Instead of one big building, it will become a collective of spaces. Building as a community. Based on the adjacency scheme of these functions a simulation was run to define the optimal functional distribution of the functions. The qualities of these simulation results were then analysed and used to establish the design rules on macro scale. Then different design methods were used to explore the suitable architectural language for the project. Set up similar to a Bauhaus workshop the methods included; simulation, scripting, digital design and computational design. These results were then synthesized into one final design. A continuous building that activates both internal and external spaces, that connects multiple building blocks through a contemporary design language. The connection is shown through an increase in fragmentation of the building, growing from orthogonal to a fragmented façade, that grows into a curvilinear interior.

However, the island had been struggling with many problems far beforehand. Consequently, the recovery program is still extremely difficult as the rebuilding/construction issue is not the only problem calling for resolution. Destroyed buildings and people struggling with rebuilding their houses are only the tip of the iceberg.<br/>Sint Maarten’s history is strongly interconnected with natural disasters and - simultaneously - lack of proper governance and preparedness plans against more and more frequent hurricanes in the region. The above context triggered my interest in disaster relief methods and post-disaster projects which, later on, formed the base of my design. Researching into the best possible contemporary disaster relief frameworks, showed effective ways of tackling natural disaster related problems. This also helped with designing a solution that results in effective community based relief. Thus the outcome of my research is directly translated into the design by creating ‘a building learning centre’, an institution which promotes hurricane-proof building knowledge among communities on Sint Maarten. The centre helps to create an optimised and self-sufficient disaster relief on the island and - hopefully - even beyond. The long-term goal is to enable gaining knowledge around building methods which would be held by skilled construction workers. These people would gradually improve building environment over the years. This will eventually contribute to minimising damages with every hurricane to come. The school's program and specific knowledge of 'hurricane-proof craftsmanship' could help in creating communities that actively participate in strengthening and speeding up the recovery time after possible future disasters. The design would not only bring potential relief programme but also a way for diverse income generating solution for local communities. The programme of the school includes also traineeship which enables locals to combine employment and training in order to gain a nationally recognised qualification. In this way many people, who struggle economically, could gain new opportunities. These contribute to creating financial stability and help with rebuilding homes faster after hurricane.<br/>The centre’s design and program are both based on the effective disaster relief elements. They bring knowledge, contains co-planning and co-designing aspects, which - as a consequence - create trust within the community and other actors. All the above can be accomplished by creating an on-spot fixed building, which hosts facility working on the resilience and at the same time building itself being a community facility as an asset-based design. <br/>The relief method (i.e. building learning centre), merged with economic diversification program, would hopefully provide people with knowledge and experience in order to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside help. The inspiration of hurricane preparedness and post-disaster projects not only aims to deal with the ‘tip of the iceberg’ problems but also to create a long term strategy.","Natural Disasters; Humanitarian Architecture; Strategie; Disaster Relief; Adaptive resilience; Reconstruction; Local Communitie; Building Center; Construction; School","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Some choices are based on personal preference to find my style within minimalism, which makes this research very much based on intuition. The main question is: What are the characteristics and boundaries of minimalism in art, architecture and my own work? The first part of the research is a literature study, in which the thoughts, features and historic perspective of minimalism will be explored. In the second part of the research several case studies will be done. The cases are divided into three categories, namely art, architecture, and my own work. This allows the different areas of minimalism to be compared. Six general themes emerge from literature: geometry, form, repetition, light, material and simplicity. These six themes are analysed in the artworks of Jan Schoonhoven and Joost Baljeu. In order to find my preferences in ‘minimalism’ all artworks are placed within a scheme of two axis, beauty and fascination. The analysis of the scheme shows that the artworks, who hold both beauty and fascination, form a clear contrast with the opposite corner. For example, I prefer precision and refinement in an artwork and the artworks in the opposite corner are more coarse. It is also important that there is a clear direction in the organisation of the work, making the work readable. This shows that readability is essential to create a reduced image and is also one of the boundaries of minimalism. Subsequently, four architectural projects by architects John Pawson and Vincent van Duysen are analysed. This shows that context, function, details, light and spatiality must be included in the analysis. The projects in the beauty and fascination side of the scheme are characterised by texture and materialisation, which appears to be one of the most important elements to achieve my desired result of a reduced image. However, the choice of materials remains behind in my designs. Another returning characteristic throughout the entire research is horizontal and vertical organisation, which is visible in the plans and sections of my designs. Organisation improves the readability of the designs. Ultimately, I would like to be able to use ‘minimalism’ as a guiding theme in my design. Which means that some elements must be included more in the design process, such as material and texture. I do, however, strive to reach an optimum in beauty and fascination, and the characteristics I found are essential in creating my style of ‘minimalism’.","Minimalism; Art; Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

It provides quantified insights for architects and governors to deliver energy-efficient approaches. There are already quite a few energy simulation software or engines on the market. Among these tools, Ladybug family, a series of open-source python packages have its advantages: easy to use, high level of customization and low cost of adoption. It could be run in Rhino Grasshopper, a visual programming interface widely used by architecture industry. Taking 3D geometry created in Rhino and local weather data, Ladybug tools (Ladybug and Honeybee) prepare simulation recipes to run energy simulation with validated software engines like EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. With all these advantages, when using Ladybug and Honeybee for urban energy simulation, there are two major flaws: it is tedious to build 3D models of all building blocks in Rhino one by one and many key parameters required by energy simulation have to be entered manually. This geometry creation and parameters entering process could be avoided when using CityGML data as input, as CityGML with EnergyADE data already has 3D geometry and energy-related attributes of city within its data model. In this research, a mapping table between required simulation parameters of Ladybug tool - Honeybee and CityGML with EnergyADE data model is created. Based on this mapping relationship, by following a database approach, all information stored in CityGML with EnergyADE data is retrieved and stored in tables of 3DCityDB and later queried in Rhino Grasshopper and used in data mapping and processing workflow. Energy simulation results could be saved back to database too. It is concluded that using CityGML with EnergyADE data as input for Honeybee tools is applicable as there is a sufficient mapping relationship between their data models. However, as Honeybee has certain restrictions on input geometry (shared surface areas should be independent surfaces and surfaces should be convex etc.) and it runs energy simulation of buildings not simultaneously but one by one, it is not efficient to use Honeybee for large scale urban energy simulation.","CityGML; Urban Energy Simulation; Ladybug; Honeybee","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

However, besides historical value and age value, other values such as use value, newness value and rarity value should also be considered in the value assessment, which makes decisions between demolishing, reserving or redesigning more convincing. Furthermore, the value assessment encourages architects reflect on history and find strategies for new design fit for the nowadays and look to the future. The value assessment can help find out the spirit of the heritage and the spirits of the can help to bring building into new life.","architecture; cultural value; Heritage & Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","Acciona, 2018 SUSTAINABLE BUILDING MATERIALS, Retrieved Spetember 17, 2019 from https://www.activesustainability.com/construction-and-urban-development/sustainable-building-materials/https://www.activesustainability.com/construction-and-urban-development/sustainable-building-materials/ Fermacell, 2019 Special solutions Underfloor heating, Retrieved October 15, 2019 fromhttps://www.fermacell.nl/nl/vloersystemen HNS Aluminium, . 2018, The weight of double and triple glass unit, Retrieved Nov. 23, 2019 from https://www.hnsaluminium.co.uk/the-weight-of-double-and-triple-glass-units/ ,Petzet, M.

On the one hand, it is used by its owner to achieve its corporate objectives, also in terms of feasibility. On the other hand, it is a place which is accessible to all and serves the societal and urban needs in terms of transport, activities, encounters and many more. In current urban developments, these places in the city are changing rapidly. The concept of transit-oriented development describes the reason why this is happening. Due to the high demand for space in the city, the quest for available land often leads to places that are both available and well accessible. Station locations are examples of these places. Consequently, many new stakeholders are engaged in station location developments, but many rather often follow their own aims and objectives, and substantiate their decisions with own interpretations and assumptions. This leads to uncoordinated collaborations with conflicts of interests. This study wants to clear some of the air in this respect. However, from which perspective should one observe the station location to decide which elements deserve attention? The user has a central position in this regard. Most importantly, their demands should be taken into consideration in order to provide successful real estate. Therefore, this study positions the user of a station location as a central point of attention. More specifically, the definition of the user has been narrowed down to the traveller which encounters various elements at the station location during their door-to-door journey. The study is executed by reviewing thirty Dutch station locations and statistically compare them to each other and to the appreciation of travellers at those stations. As a result, critical elements at station locations have been identified that relate to the enhancement of the traveller experience. During station location development processes, the output of this research can be used by actors to get a clearer view on the demands by the main user. Stakeholders should always critically review this information and assess whether and to what extent their current real estate supply should be adjusted in order to meet these demands.","Railway Station Location; Traveller Expierence; Transit Oriented Development; Railway Station Area; Door-to-Door Journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Westerweel, J. (graduation committee); Kana, A.A. (graduation committee); Miguel Montero, Francisco (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Recently the interest in hydrofoil vessels using a fully submerged hydrofoil increased. Hydrofoil vessels experience a resistance hump and possible instabilities during their takeoff of which both are influence by waves. In order to determine the required power during the takeoff to overcome the resistance hump and to investigate whether the hydrofoil vessel is stable during the takeoff numerical simulations or experiments have to be performed. Experiments covering the full takeoff require a long towing tank and high towing velocities and therefore these experiments are costly. The alternative, performing numerical simulations, is favorable but requires a suitable numerical code. As no validated code is available in which a takeoff can be performed in waves, in this research Panship, a potential flow code suitable for high speed craft and adapted for use with hydrofoil craft, is validated for the takeoff of a hydrofoil vessel. In this research the results of Panship are compared with results of experiments and other numerical codes in four different stage as little validation data is present for the takeoff of a hydrofoil vessel. The four different stages are: a foil without the influence of the free surface, a foil with the influence of the free surface, two foils with the influence of the free surface and the hull and foil system near during the takeoff. In these four stages the lift and drag determined in Panship is compared with available experimental results and numerical codes. As the simulations in Panship require a vast amount of input parameters, the influence of these parameters is studied first to ensure the reliability of the results. Comparing the results of Panship for a deeply submerged foil with another potential flow solver shows that the lift is predicted correctly, but that the induced drag is underpredicted. If viscous effects are required in the solution, the quality of the results of Panship is dependent on the type of hydrofoil used. As some foils have a large viscous effect on lift, the lack of viscosity on Panship, leads to a low quality of the results for lift and induced drag as they are overpredicted. The trends for interaction of a foil with the free surface are predicted correctly but the underprediction of induced drag influences the quality of the results. Panship is able to predict the effects of foil interaction for lift correctly, but the results for foil interaction for drag are poorer. During the takeoff Panship is able to predict the lift fairly correct but the total drag is underpredicted severely. Recommendations are given to improve the results of Panship and for future work.","Takeoff; Hydrofoil; Panship; BEM; Free Surface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the concept selection, a demonstrator is manufactured which excellently possesses four decoupled motions with a relatively large ROM.

This means the older population is not only growing in size, but also in proportion. Apart from this, generations are changing. The elderly of the future will in all probability not have the same needs as the elderly of today. These changes lead to new challenges for society and ask for new solutions spatially and socially. There is a lack of understanding how these factors will influence our daily lives. Which impact will this have on aspects like safety or social cohesion? How will public space look like and how will it feel to live in a society with a lot of elderly and highly developed technology? Currently the public space of neighbourhoods in general and in Nieuw Waldeck in particular, does not anticipate this phenomenon of aging and the unknown needs of the elderly of the future. This thesis aimed to integrate the human perspective of imagining the future neighbourhood, while spatial plans are made for the neighbourhood. With the purpose of empathizing all the stakeholders involved with the future elderly residents of Nieuw Waldeck, so they are able to create solutions which meet the residents’ needs. Observations, interviews and a literature study were done to gain insight in the current context. After ideating and additional literature research the concept for future life stories was created. Prototypes were assessed and evaluated multiple times by the stakeholders. By constantly validating and iterating the concept with the stakeholders, it was improved and adjusted to the needs of the stakeholders. “I live in.. the future” was created as a toolkit to share experiences of future residents with the stakeholders involved in planning the restructuring of the public space of the neighbourhood. The carrier of the toolkit contains different life stories of different future residents about their daily life in the neighbourhood. This carrier is presented in a session in which the stakeholders get a clear introduction and are individually immersed into one of the residents’ perspective by the carrier. This is followed by an open conversation about the stories and the stakeholders’ personal reflection on them. Evaluation tests revealed that all the stakeholders were able to empathize with the future elderly residents. The toolkit can be used as a conversation starter between the stakeholders about the future of their neighbourhood, since everything was easily comprehensible for everybody regardless of their background. The urban planners can use the outcomes of the session(s) to create spatial advices and plans, incorporating solutions which meet the residents’ needs. This toolkit can be integrated into the process of making plans for the public space of neighbourhoods.","design; future; stories; urban planning; communication; design research; user experience design; aging; elderly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In times where human kind is facing serious challenges due to global warming, scarcity of natural resources and inequality, to continue producing food, especially meat, as it is now done, does not seem sustainable. For people that want to continue enjoying their delicious piece of steak, the manner in which meat is sourced will need to be redesigned. One of the disruptive initiatives in this field is in vitro cultured meat. For the cultivation of muscle tissue, one needs cells, chemical factors and the appropriate biomaterials<br/>that function as a scaffold. Meatable B.V. is a food-technology startup that is a pioneer in the cultivation of steak-like meat using induced pluripotent stem cells. Aims. The aim of the study is to optimise the extracellular matrix (i.e. scaffold) mimicry of natural biomaterials to serve as a scaffold for 3D skeletal muscle tissue engineering, using iPSCs. The supplementary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of the optimised scaffold as a proof of concept for cultured meat. Methods. The proof of concept model (Model A) was created in collaboration with researchers from the Loughborough University who demonstrated a scalable model for 3D human skeletal muscle tissue engineering. Their strategy was to use a hard plastic mould to confine and provide initial support for the viscoelastic hydrogel (matrigel and rat tail collagen) encapsulated with cells (C2C12 myoblasts). For the optimisation of the extracellular matrix for iPSCs for the production of cultured meat, this model was copied and repeated with different edible scaffold alternatives. The best alternative biomaterial (Model B) was further optimised in large scale<br/>tissue moulds and compared to the proof of concept model and meat. Lastly, Model C was created by seeding iPSCs in Model B. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons were based on different analytical parameters.<br/>Results. The hydrogel scaffolds of both models A and B were highly comparable in terms of permeability, scaffold compaction by cell activity and cell alignment. The improved model (B) resulted in a higher cell proliferation as seen by cell development and cell density. The stiffness of model A was half the stiffness of Model B, and the stiffness of Model B was more comparable with the higher<br/>stiffness of beef steak (factor 5 difference). Nevertheless, when the improved model was seeded with pre-differentiated iPSCs (Model C) instead of C2C12 myoblasts, the results were clearly less successful than the first models and were not comparable with beef steak. Conclusions. This research describes the successful improvements of an existing 3D in-vitro skeletal tissue engineering method, as prototype model for cultured meat, that was for the first time seeded with iPSCs. Model B should be set as the basis model to optimise for the culture of iPSCs. The bovine collagen model with C2C12s was not comparable to steak, but a longer culture period could result in more comparable tissue. The main reason for the limitations of Model C was the maturation of iPSCs, which could be improved in different ways. In addition, there remain certain requirements to be met for the hydrogel scaold, mainly connected with current developments for recombinant animal-free materials. It can still be concluded that the less successful Model C was a step in the right direction to becoming a feasible model for the culture of in vitro meat.","tissue engineering; cultured meat; ipsc; scaffold biomaterials; skeletal muscle physiology; bioengineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

In the Netherlands, the delta works were developed to protect the hinterland from sea-water during storm surge situations. The storm surge barriers close and the water is kept at the sea. However, if large river discharges are present together with storm surge, the water level behind the barriers will rise because the closed barrier won't let the river water out. In delta areas, this is a major threat to water safety. To tackle these future problems Huub Lavooij and Leen Berke came up with the DELTA21 plan.  The plan is to build a storm surge barrier together with pumps that can evacuate the water from the river in the event of having both storm surge and large river discharges happening simultaneously. As this situation will happen once every ten years on average, there is a risk that the pumps might not function when needed if they were on hold for ten years. To tackle that problem and also producing green energy, a hydro pump storage basin is proposed to take advantage of the pumps already installed for flood protection. This hydro pump storage basin is called Valmeer. As this structure would be built next to the Maasvlakte 2, in a red Natura 2000 area, some ecological value must be gained with this project in return. That is why the Getijmeer (tidal lake) was created. This tidal lake would allow opening the Haringvliet sluices and thus recovering fish migration in that area. Bringing then the ecological, recreational and economic value to the Haringvliet area, which is currently closed to the sea. The objective of this thesis is to create a conceptual design of a hydro pump storage station able to turbine water in for energy generation and to pump it out for the same purpose and also for water safety.  For designing the plant, three locations and three different alternatives were considered. Finally, a pump storage station that is also a storm surge barrier is proposed in the northern part of the DELTA21 plan, next to the Maasvlakte 2. Aspects such as constructability, affection of sediment transport to the plant, wave loading and access to the plant were taken into account for choosing the location and the most suitable alternative.  The chosen alternative was found to be a good option if special care is taken about piping protection (the structure is subjected to head differences of 23 meters) and about methods to avoid water infiltration into the building pit during the construction of the plant (the building pit's floor is at NAP -32 m).  As a part of the design, a life cycle analysis on CO2 emissions was performed. This showed that the hydro pump storage station can bring positive ecological value in terms of CO2 emissions reduction for the grid of the Netherlands. Producing energy at 280 g of CO2/kWh at present grid conditions and at -140 g of CO2/kWh if renewable energy is used to power the pumps. The conventional fossil fuel energy-producing methods do it at between 500 and 1050 g of CO2/kWh.  Therefore this thesis shows that the DELTA21 plan is not only good for flood protection but for renewable energy generation. Contributing then to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of ""affordable and clean energy"" (energy generation function) and ""life on land"" (water safety function).   ","Hydro pump storage; Flood protection; Storm surge barrier; Life Cycle Assessment; LCA; CO2 emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","DELTA21","51.919880, 3.933109"

At the ICU, care is delivered by multidisciplinary healthcare teams who strongly rely on teamwork and communication. Patient handovers are scheduled moments of communication, where information between different healthcare professionals is exchanged. However, there exists an unaccepted rate of unintended patient harm which can be attributed to failures in communication. These failures can be the result of educational, psychological, and organisational factors. To discover how design can overcome these failures in information sharing, observations and interviews within the ICU context were done. The aim of the observations was to understand and interpret the behaviour of ICU doctors and nurses throughout the day and during handovers. The purpose of the interviews was to get a deeper understanding of their personal experience with the different handover moments. The observations provided insights in the interactions between doctors, nurses, and both groups. Discovered communication breakdowns were captured in three different work models. The interviews revealed the experienced qualities and pain points during handovers. Altogether, both activities resulted in three ingredients which need to be considered while designing for enhanced handovers: information sharing, teamwork, and context.<br/> Based on the findings, ICoon was developed in extensive collaboration with the ICU team. ICoon is a tool facilitating that the patient handovers are experienced as more effective and efficient. The tool exists of three different components: ‘overdragen’, ‘overhebben’, and ‘overzien’. ‘Overdragen’, allows that the complete ICU team will have the same expectations of each handover moment and entails that only relevant information is shared in an efficient way. ‘Overzien’ is an addition to the current Patient Data Management System (PDMS), allowing the ICU team to have a proper overview of the patient population on each unit and is supportive in efficiently handing over patients during shift changes. The last component, ‘over hebben’, will enable the ICU team to continuously reflect together on their handover process triggering organisational change. The last step of this design process was to elaborately evaluate ICoon with the ICU team. The aim of the evaluation was twofold: figuring out the added value of ICoon within the ICU regarding the experienced effectiveness and efficiency and assessing the support ‘overzien’ facilitates during patient handovers. Compared to the current situation, the ICU team agreed that ‘overdragen’ provides focus and structure, ‘overzien’ brings overview, and ‘over hebben’ can have a positive impact on the teamwork within and between the team of nurses and team of doctors. The concept ICoon in combination with the involvement of the ICU team resulted into tools and capacities for the realization of innovation at the ICU. The adopted human-centred design approach and engagement with the doctors as well as the nurses resulted into co-commitment of the ICU team, which turned out to be an important first step towards implementation of design solutions within the ICU. Therefore, ICoon turned out to serve as tool for transformation rather than a design solution only.","human-centred design; contextmapping; Intensive Care Unit; Communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

Unsteady aerodynamic conditions have been associated with cyclic loading of turbine blades, which can have hugely detrimental effects on their operational life. When subjected to unsteady aerodynamic conditions, the blade sees an overshoot of lift as compared to steady cases. At high angles of attack, the blade witnesses a very sharp stall from which it may or may not recover. The excursion of lift and subsequent sharp stall cause the lift curve to exhibit hysteresis behaviour, which outlines the phenomenon of dynamic stall. Continued recurrence of dynamic stall in gusty conditions leads to increased risk of failure due to fatigue loading. The primary aim of this project was to investigate the prediction of dynamic stall in quasi two-dimensional (2D) and strongly three-dimensional (3D) flows, using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM) based solver, PowerFLOW. The first part of the project dealt with simulation of dynamic stall in quasi-two dimensional flow. Validation of the computational data was performed against experimental data published by the Ohio State University (OSU) and the National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL). Simulations were performed for two configurations -- the first set with a clean leading edge, and the second set employing a leading edge surface roughness. The second part of the project dealt with the analysis of strongly 3D flow conditions wherein the pitching blade was also subject to rotation. Rotation was implemented using a stationary local reference frame. In both stages, flow field data was analysed using a mix of velocity, vorticity and pressure plots. For the 3D simulation, skin friction was also investigated as a measure of flow separation. In context of the quasi-2D cases, it was found that PowerFLOW faces some limitations when attempting to match experimental data. This was attributed to an incorrect prediction of flow separation, consequent of using a wall model for resolution of near-wall structures. This issue was more pronounced in the clean cases, where laminar-turbulent transition is critical. The tripping of the boundary layer at the leading edge was also seen to adversely affect the formation of the Dynamic Stall Vortex (DSV). For the 3D cases, it was seen that rotation causes an even greater lift excursion. The cause for this was attributed to the generation of strong spanwise pressure gradients, leading to significant spanwise flow. This spanwise flow was found to be present only in regions where flow separation would be expected in a quasi-2D setup.

It is predominantly the people who want to enter the housing market for the first time, the so-called ‘starters’, who face severe problems due to a lack of stock and suitable dwellings. This problem is manifest in the rental as well as in the owner-occupied housing sector. The sole focus of government policies is on housing for the lower social class and the rest of the housing market is dominated by the private sector. Objective – This research aims to define the position of starters on the Dutch housing market in comparison with the position of starters in the context of 1993. The research question that is answered is: ‘To what extent do the factors societal context, housing policy and housing stock influence the opportunities for starters on the housing market in 2018 compared to 1993?’. This question is answered on the basis of the housing choice model. This model is based on the career / life cycle theory of Priemus (1984). In the housing choice model, an extension has been made based on the theory of Dieleman (2001) which takes the external factors that determine the choice of a home into account. Methods – The research is conducted by a literature study and a quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis has been done on data generated from an extensive quasi longitudinal study. Specifically, the data of 1993 and 2018 were compared to each other. Results – The literature study and the quantitative analysis show that the starter on the Dutch housing market has a good social position in terms of income, education and employment. However, as housing policies failed to respond to the changed social context ultimately resulting in too few houses being built, the position of the starter has deteriorated. This deteriation position is confirmed by the data analysis, which indicates that starters conform to the market situation. Firstly, it is apparent that significantly fewer starters than in the past are entering the housing market. Secondly, starters are entering the market at a much older age than their predecessors. Finally, it is clear that starters in every age category are more likely to choose to live in multi-person households to increase their payment capacity. Conclusions – The final conclusion of this study is that the opportunities for the starter on the housing market in 2018 are mainly determined by the housing stock. However, the relative scarcity of housing stock for the starter is chiefly the result of housing policies which have not responded to societal changes. This implies that housing policy is ultimately the decisive factor in the disadvantageous position of the starter. The average starter has a good starting position from a social perspective due to low unemployment, very low interest rates and good prospects for social growth. However, the starter has minimal chances of entering the housing market due to, in particular, insufficient suitable housing stock. This applies to both the free rental sector and the owner-occupied sector and homes are hardly financially accessible for starters. This good starting position has mainly been confined to the lower rental and owner-occupied sector on the housing market in 2018. This means that starters are more likely to opt for a home in a relatively expensive segment or postpone the choice for a home.","Dutch housing market; Starters of housing market; housing choice; Comparison position starter 2018 and 1993; conceptual housing choice model; societal factors; housing policy; housing stock","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Quist, J.N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The current industrial system is established on one fundamental characteristic: a linear model of resource consumption that follows a ‘take-make-dispose’ pattern. However, the emerging concept of Circular Economy (CE) is proposed to change the current production and consumption patterns that put a significant burden on our planet and its environmental capacity. In this context, scholars argue that the built environment is one of the key sectors that can benefit maximally from the development of CE. The Dutch government recognized this opportunity and in the publication of the Transition Agenda: Circular Economy in the Netherlands by 2050 acknowledged the construction industry as one of the five key economic sectors and value chains which will be the first to make the shift. In order to support the transition towards a circular built environment, experts from academia, policy, and business advocate that innovative business models that allow new ownership relationships are required. In this context, scholars argue that a promising business models for the implementation of circular economy thinking in the sector are product-service systems. This research focuses on buildings which are considered the most complex element within the built environment. Literature on the application of circular economy for buildings suggests looking at them as a collection of interlinking layers. This idea based on the “6S” framework developed by Stewart Brand in 1990s which includes six layers, namely: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff. However, researchers argue that there is still great uncertainty regarding the application of circular business models in the Dutch built environment, as well as the fact that the transition from traditional product-oriented business models to service-oriented ones is highly complex and contextual illustrates that further research is required in this area. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to examine the application of product-service systems as circular business models for the products, components and materials in buildings’ Structure, Skin and Services layers in order to contribute to the Dutch built environment’s shift towards circular economy. As a result, the main research question formulated is: “What is the current state of product-service systems as circular business models in the built environment and how can its application contribute to a circular built environment?” For answering the research question a literature review was conducted in order to examine the relevant concepts, along with expert interviews with the aim to explore the barriers, enablers and opportunities of the application of product-service systems as circular business models. Finally, a case study survey was carried out with the aim to analyze the business models of two companies who are active in the built environment and have successfully applied product-service systems as circular business models. The analysis illustrated that even though numerous opportunities are offered by this business model to both the company and the client when applied in the different building layers, it is not yet accepted in the sector and its application is hindered by several barriers. However, a number of enablers which can facilitate the implementation of product-service systems as circular business models were recognized. In addition, the analysis illustrated that for the successful implementation of product-service systems as circular business model incorporating servitization and circularity characteristics in all business model elements is necessary.","Circular Economy; Built Environment; Product-Service System; Circular Business Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This study sets out to quantify, map, and explain the spatiotemporal pattern of annual snow cover duration, which are quantified by regional differences in the number of annual snow cover days (Dsc) and its sensitivities to climate change across the Qilian Mountains between 2001 and 2018. The Qilian Mountains, based on the previous studies on regional climate difference, can be divided into three subregions from east to west. Across the entire Qilian Mountains, Dsc is about 20-40 days at elevations below 3500 m.a.s.l and increases to about 130 days at 4500 m.a.s.l, and more than 300 days above 5000 m.a.s.l. In the west, the interannual average Dsc is consistently lower than the east at the same elevation, and the largest difference is about 200 days at 4300 m.a.s.l. The middle subregion has its Dsc lower than the west below 4000 m.a.s.l, but higher above that elevation. Throughout the 18 years, a 100-200 m upward shift of the RSLE in the hottest months (July and August) has happened in all the subregions of the Qilian Mountains, which certainly results in a decrease of snow cover area and duration. The statistical analysis indicates that on the 3500-4500 m.a.s.l hillside regions in the west section, the number of annual snow cover has the most pronounced decline of Dsc with a rate from -3 to -5 d/year, and this declining trend is caused by the 0.1-0.2 ℃/year increasing trend of the local land surface temperature. The sensitivities analysis of Dsc to temperature and precipitation suggests that, in all the subregions, the annual mean temperatures T has a consistent first-order control on Dsc across the years. However, throughout the elevation, neither the temperature nor cold half-year precipitation has consistent first-order control on Dsc. On the contrary, the data highlight the importance of the interaction between the two climatic variables at 3500-5000 m.a.s.l, where Dsc is sensitive to local climate change. In this elevation range, the positive effects of cold half-year precipitation increasing may partly compensate for the negative effects of temperature rising on Dsc. Furthermore, since the lack of precipitation in the west section, the interplay between temperature and precipitation has its influence on Dsc mostly in the east section, and as a consequence, the significant reduction of Dsc in a large area only happens in the west of the Qilian Mountains. Moreover, we look into the correlation between Dsc and the hillshade and get an interesting result that the medium-hillshade regions, but not the lightest regions, always have the lowest Dsc. The possible reason for this phenomenon is that the lightest regions are more likely the peaks of the mountains i.e. glaciers, while the medium-hillshade regions are more likely the hillshade at low or medium elevation.","Snow cover; Climate change; Google Earth Engine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These days, customers want holistic services tailored to their personal needs. This increased customer demand forces institutions to rethink the services they offer. In addition, new regulations press upon this sector. Know Your Customer and PSD2 are examples of regulations that make the current ways of working out-of-date. Moreover, new technologies give start-ups the opportunity to take over parts of the services offered by existing companies. These three trends together cause existing institutions to search for new ways to innovate; their current way of working will simply not be enough in 5-10 years time. Operating in an ecosystem, which are networks of companies working together to create new customer value, is one of the new ways that financial institutions are exploring for new potential revenue streams. The potential of these ecosystems is high: 30% of the gross world product in 2025 will be created from ecosystems. However, consortia, which are small ecosystems, miss the managerial guidelines needed for success. Furthermore, academic research is lacking on the adoption process of a consortium. Hence, the first aim of this thesis is to bridge this knowledge gap by performing a multiple case study with four financial services clients. This research is performed in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) aka Blockchain, as this technology is seen as the ‘conversation starter’ for collaboration. The research results in a strategic framework that includes the managerial guidelines (drivers and barriers) and the desired steps in the adoption process of a DLT consortium within the financial services sector. The strategic framework identifies a service gap present in consortium adoption and asks for a neutral orchestrator with industry, technical and ideation expertise. Therefore, the second part of this thesis aims to fill this gap by designing an ecosystem proposition that Accenture, a multinational consultancy, could offer her clients. The designed proposition, Maestra, is a cross-sector orchestration service that includes three main activities: spotting opportunities, co-creating cross-sector concepts, and orchestrating the consortium. The purpose of this service is to bridge sectors by collaboration and thus creating social and environmental impact. The deliverables of Maestra consist of a service process, an implementation roadmap and a business plan. The service is validated through expert interviews and a validation session with eight consultants of Accenture. Furthermore, the service is being considered to be implemented by Accenture Benelux and the service process has already been used during a client proposal.","ecosystem; orchestration; collaboration; business plan; roadmap; service approach; financial sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This effect determines the minimal sustained speed and minimal incremental motion of a movement system, limiting the performance in precise positioning systems. Available bearing types without stick-slip suffer from complexity, high cost, energy storage (for example in flexures) or need for active components (for example in magnetic bearings). The ferrofluid bearing has none of these issues. This makes it a potential alternative for current bearings in precise positioning systems. Ferrofluid is a colloidal suspension of magnetic particles in a carrier liquid. This gives the unique property of a fluid that is drawn towards the highest magnetic field intensity. The ferrofluid can be used in two ways to construct a bearing; the pocket bearing and pressure bearing arrangements. This research focuses on the latter, as the pocket bearing has shown bad repeatability. The pressure bearing consists of a ferrofluid in a magnetic field in between bearing surfaces. As a load is applied, the space between bearing surfaces decreases. This results in the ferrofluid being displaced from the least energetic configuration in the magnetic field which induces a normal force on the bearing surfaces. The objective of this study is to improve the performance of the ferrofluid pressure bearing by removing or improving the limitations in stroke length and repeatability. This is done by the creation of a longstroke linear ferrofluid demonstrator stage. The challenges in the creation of this stage are primarily focused on limiting the effects of trail formation, addressing the evaporation of the ferrofluid, and achieving a sufficient load capacity and stiffness to be a feasible alternative to other bearing types.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Winterwerp, Han (graduation committee); Vijverberg, Thomas (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Siltation affects navigation in harbors and waterways by reducing the water depth. To regain depth and safeguard navigation, dredging is required. Water Injection Dredging (WID) is one of the available hydrodynamic dredging techniques, in which pumps on a vessel inject water at high flow velocities and low pressure into the bed and fluidize the bed material into a mixture of water and suspended sediment. The fluidized material travels as a turbidity current to deeper areas, driven by natural processes. Sediment transport is then less controlled and the final destination of the dredged material is more difficult to estimate than for other dredging techniques. The passage of a WID-induced turbidity current produces an increase in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the water column that increases turbidity. Turbidity increase may have a negative environmental impact. Therefore, to evaluate and mitigate the environmental impact of WID, the increase in SSC should be estimated. Additionally, from an operational perspective, the sedimentation footprint of the turbidity current should be determined. Deltares developed with Boskalis a numerical tool named “Lagrangian 1DV model” (Deltares, 2019). The Lagrangian 1DV model can calculate the thickness and density of the WID-induced turbidity current at a distance from the dredger, as well as the deposition rate. It provides the information to estimate the increase in SSC in the water column and the sedimentation footprint. The tool was defined to be a rapid assessment tool, as it is necessary at the early stages of WID projects when there is usually a limitation of time and available data. Such a tool is useful to analyze different dredging strategies and different solutions to mitigate environmental impact.<br/>As its name indicates, it follows a Lagrangian 1DV (1-Dimensional Vertical) approach. This approach follows the turbidity current in space as it moves away from the dredger. It is an innovative approach that requires less computational effort than a 3D or a 2DV (2-Dimensions in the Vertical plane) approach. <br/>Three main steps were followed by Deltares (2019) for conceptual and mathematical modelling: - Step 1: assume that the turbidity current is a 2DV process, thus neglecting lateral gradients - Step 2: schematize the 2DV process as a Lagrangian 1DV approach. - Step 3: select the 1DV Point Model (Uittenbogaard and Winterwerp, 1997) as the basis to solve velocity and concentration profiles over the vertical. In order to schematize the 2DV process as a Lagrangian 1DV approach (Step 2), two main points were assumed:<br/>- Uniformity of the 1DV Point Model (in the Eulerian frame of reference) was assumed as stationarity in the Lagrangian frame of reference - The Lagrangian velocity was defined as a concentration-weighted velocity over the water column, expressed as the ratio between the mass flux and sediment load. <br/>The validity of these assumptions to estimate sediment transport was analyzed in this report. For that purpose, the Lagrangian 1DV model (Lagrangian 1DV approach) was compared to a 2DV computation in Delft3D-FLOW (called Delft3D model) in four sets of numerical experiments. The validity of the Lagrangian 1DV approach for uniform flow was confirmed with the first set of numerical experiments. Experiment Set 2 showed that the Lagrangian 1DV approach is as valid as the Eulerian 2DV approach to represent sediment transport in non-uniform flow when density differences are negligible. Differences between the Lagrangian 1DV model and the Delft3D model in velocity, concentration and, consequently, in the concentration-weighted velocity (calculated in the Delft3D model as the ratio between mass flux and sediment load), arose in non-uniform flow for the cases in which density differences became significant. The results suggest that the origin of the differences between the Lagrangian 1DV model and the Delft3D model in the concentration-weighted velocity relies on the expression of the advective transport term of the sediment transport equation. <br/>In Experiments Set 3 and Set 4, the numerical models were based on laboratory experiments on turbidity currents by Parker et al. (1987) and van Kessel and Kranenburg (1996), respectively. The baroclinic pressure gradient was higher for these sets experiments. Thus, differences in the baroclinic pressure gradient between the models produced important differences in velocity.<br/>In the case of Experiments Set 3, based on Run 13 of Parker et al. (1987), the concentration-weighted velocity was lower for the Lagrangian 1DV model along the analyzed reach. Experiments Set 4, based on Run 2 of van Kessel and Kranenburg (1996), presented the opposite behavior: a higher value for the concentration-weighted velocity for the Lagrangian 1DV model. A possible explanation for these results was found, based on the variation of the sediment load along the channel in the Delft3D model and the magnitude of the baroclinic pressure gradient. In order to analyze possible implications of the observed differences when the model parameters are in the range of the WID application, the variation of the concentration-weighted velocity was calculated in the Lagrangian 1DV model for a typical case of WID. The trend of the variation along the reach was similar to the case of Experiments Set 3. Then, the results suggest that the estimated concentration-weighted velocity in the Lagrangian 1DV model may be lower than the result for the 2DV approach. As a consequence, the travelling distance of the turbidity current may be shorter. More specific cases can be addressed by comparing the Lagrangian 1DV model and the Delft3D model, following the methodology presented in this report.","Water Injection Dredging; Turbidity currents; Environmental impact; Lagrangian; Lagrangian 1DV; Delft3D; Numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","","","","","",""

The emphasis of this thesis is on the modelling, rather than the control theory applications. Most models that are currently employed by oil companies do not model short-term transient responses, but focus on long-term equilibrium modelling. Short-term transient response modelling of oil-economic systems can benefit trading and supply activities of oil companies. The models that are provided in this thesis have the ability to model short-term transient responses, due to the their dynamical nature and economic basis. To obtain these models, this thesis uses economic engineering. Economic engineering is a discipline that models economic systems, using an analogy between economic variables and engineering variables. The model development in this thesis consists of three parts. First, a fundamental economic-engineering model is built that represents the global crude-oil market. The model forecasts crude-oil prices using global crude-oil production as an exogenous input. The parameters of this model are estimated using system identification. Second, this thesis provides specialized models for common oil-market phenomena within the economic-engineering framework. These include refinery modelling, geographic dispersion, the futures market and economic growth. Finally, this thesis suggests applications for control theory. For these applications, various controllers are discussed. The identified fundamental model yields positive first results that do no reject the validity of the modelling approach. Moreover, the specialized models provide satisfactory solutions for several oil market mechanisms.","Control; Economics; Economic-Engineering; Modelling; Oil market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

After closing the mines Parkstad is now suffering from shrinkage, unemployment and fragmentation. Besides that there is the problem of upcoming mine water that forms a problem regarding the ground water quality. In order to tackle these issues Parkstad is working as a corporation of eight municipalities to improve the liveability by stimulating tourism that will simultaneously boost the economy of Parkstad. Similar to the linear economy of the coal mining industry, the economic and social growth that will come with improving touristic attractions are strongly accompanied by an increasing amount of waste, causing unnecessary losses of materials and energy. In order to maintain the population and the increasing amount of visitors in Parkstad, there has to be a change in the relationship between people, energy and the environment. To ensure a sustainable future, an urgent increase is required in energy generated through local available and renewable sources, like geothermal energy from mine water, and circular waste streams. By generating an overview of the input and output on energy, water and materials of the urban metabolism of Parkstad Limburg, a strategy was proposed to improve the resource efficiency to become a circular economy. The most important component of this strategy is the central park situated at the former Oranje Nassau IV mine, where mine water is purified. Here tourists are able to experience how the flows of ENERGY, WATER and MATERIALS come together. The mine water treatment park has three functional levels: the technical buildings, connecting heat and water infrastructures and as a storage and distribution facility, to serve the local heat network, as a public meeting point with recreational and educational facilities to host public activities, and as a symbol for Parkstad as a region of energy and circular economy.

It can provide a large scale seasonal heat storage solution. Thereby it enables an increase in full load hours of the base heat source, which can benefit project performance on both costs and emissions. However, the limited number of successful pilot projects indicates the technology has not escaped its state of infancy. There is a gap from concept to implementation, which is signified by the disagreement of experts on performance drivers and barriers of HT-ATES. This research aims to narrow the described knowledge gap, by improving identification of HT-ATES performance drivers and barriers. Thereby it strives to improve decision making of HT-ATES implementation, and further enhance future HT-ATES application in heating projects. The broad scope of research demands both a diagnostic and design-orientated approach, and fits seamlessly with a multi-criteria decision analysis. The analysis entails the stages of creating, evaluating, comparing and ranking of case-specific scenarios. Parametric variation changes the conditions for HT-ATES implementation across the scenarios. A simulation model is developed and connected to a groundwater model to apply the parametric variation, to create the different scenarios, and consequently to produce the quantitative information for further evaluation. During the stages of creating, evaluating, comparing and ranking, the methodology systematically produces new results on the opportunities and risks introduced by HT-ATES, and additionally on the HT-ATES performance drivers and barriers. The results show that HT-ATES enables the opportunity of improving project performance with respect to the internal rate of return and emissions. Groundwater impact remains the greatest risk, but it can be minimised with smart decision making. To support the decision maker and to overcome the risk of groundwater impact, the research proposes several performance-enhancing, non-explicit guidelines. The guidelines focus on realising an HT-ATES implementation, where project performance with respect to internal rate of return, emissions and groundwater impact are balanced. Thereby they explain the major HT-ATES performance drivers and barriers. The guidelines are summarised below. The decision maker is recommended to .. 1. .. minimise the uncertainty, through thorough subsurface characterization before implementation. Secondly, to focus on aquifers with a minimum depth of 200 [m] and a minimum hydraulic conductivity of 5 [m/d] 2. .. assure network return temperatures during peak demand are below expected storage temperatures 3. .. not consider project life-times exceeding 20 years 4. .. assure yearly maximum base source heat production is always lower than yearly consumer heat demand 5. .. to strive for a flat demand curve and apply peak-shaving, by means of, for example, variable heat prices Currently, the guidelines have the purpose of giving direction to the decision maker, but they will become more explicit once the methodology is improved, and the uncertainty and number of assumptions in the model is decreased.","Multi-criteria analysis; Heating transition; subsurface; Energy storage; energy transition; geology; Netherlands; case-study; decision maker; groundwater impact; internal rate of return; emissions; Simulation modelling; high; temperature; aquifer; thermal; energy; storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

More than 40% of these people live in informal settlements in extremely poor conditions while two-thirds of the population lives on only 5% of the total area of the city. A clear separation can be seen between different income groups within the city of Mumbai, as well as in the rest of India and the global south. This social polarization is not beneficial for the city nor its inhabitants and current housing schemes don’t provide the tools to tackle this problem. In Nalasopara the same issue is at hand where a city is divided into two part: the eastern area where most of the low-income lives while in the west more and more large towers are being constructed for the middle and high-income groups. This problem has only increased in the past 20 years. This increasing social polarization and a widening income gap lead to spatial and social inequality in Nalasopara and Mumbai. This contributes to unfairness between the rich and poor, unfairness in upward mobility, harsh borders between different income groups, different accessibility to public space and ghettoization of certain groups. Which leads to a disconnect between the city and its inhabitants. This project aims to design and create a framework where all income groups have access to accessible urban spaces &amp; affordable housing.

It was found that even though the Netherlands is not as divided as it seems when for instance watching the news, the emphasis on extremes in the public debate is a problem. People want to belong to a group, which results into a pressure to choose for one of the extreme opinions on an issue. People with a moderate opinion either tend to go along with the extremes, or to turn their back on the public debate because they feel unrepresented. This in turn creates polarization. In order to relieve the pressure to go along with the extremes, the desired implication of the to-be-intervention is defined as to augment the presence of moderate opinions in the public debate, by making people with a moderate opinion express themselves in the public debate. The created intervention is the Pine Grenade (Dutch: Granaatappel), an emblem symbolizing outspoken reasonableness and thereby a counterpart to the ‘like’ known from social media. It is meant to serve as an appealing and recognizable representation of reasonableness in the public debate, inspiring people to express themselves in a reasonable way and relieving the pressure to choose for one of the extremes. In order to make the symbol publicly known, public figures representative to the message are approached to become ambassadors of the Pine Grenade.","Polarization; Society; Intervention; Social Design; Reasonableness; Pine Grenade; Granaatappel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Utilitarian cycling is being seen as a frontrunner for replacing everyday motorized travels within and between cities, supported by the rapid emergence of the electric bicycle. Governments are trying to use the increasing opportunities involving bicycle transportation to reduce car traffic and the related air polution, by stimulating the use of bicycles. In this light, interest is drawn to cyclist travel behavior to uncover preferences of cyclists. Existing literature shows a significant impact of weather conditions on cyclist travel behavior in terms of tranportation mode choices. Especially adverse weather condtions leave their mark on the use of bicycles as a means of transportation, as it is recognized by many studies as a main deterrent for cycling. On the other hand, the relation between weather conditions and cyclist route choice is an underexplored topic in existing literature. Consequently, it has remained unclear to what extent cyclists attempt to mitigate the influence of weather condtions through choice of route, and based on which determinants. Insights in ways to mitigate unchangeable external circumstances like weather conditions could be another step forward in stimulating utilitarian use of bicycles in the search for transportation modes that can replace motorized trips. This thesis made an attempt to partially address the research gap in existing literature, by departing from findings in the field of pedestrian mobility. In these studies, pedestrians have been found to adapt their choice of route to the degree of shelter that is offered by the built environment as a measure to change level of weather exposure. These findings were projected on cyclist route choice, to evaluate to what extent cyclist alter their choice of route based on weather conditions and the degree of shelter that can be found within a built environment. An elaborate methodology was proposed in which observed routes throughout the study area of Tilburg (the Netherlands), comprising trips made with conventional and electric bicycles, were compared with shortest and fastest alternatives. The weather conditions under which a route was conducted were modelled through a set of individual meteorological factors, spatially related to the location of an observed route. To operationalize the degree of shelter provided by the built environment, a new method was developed using aspects from existing theories on street climate design and spatial openness in order to provide a detailed description of the potential shelter along a route. Three different shelter factors were established, describing the degree of mean building shelter, maximum building shelter, and vegetational shelter in the form of tree density along a route. Through estimation of a set of linear regression models, independent and combined effects of the meteorological and shelter factors on cyclist route choice were modelled. Initial moderate influences of windspeed, temperature, and cycling under twilight conditions on the choice of route were found, while cyclists generally chose routes with a lower degree of building and vegetational shelter compared to alternative shortest and fastest routes. Interactions between the effects of meteorological and shelter factors showed very limited additional effects, suggesting that utilitarian cyclists in the study area did not value the degree of built environment shelter along a route sufficiently as a mitigator of weather conditions to diverge from the shortest or fastest route. These findings imply that built environment shelter does not have to be accounted for in policy design to stimulate utilitarian cycling.","Cyclist route choice; Shelter; Weather exposure; Movement data; Built environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Baseflow consists of the groundwater flow and a small part of the interflow. During dry periods, streams are dependent on the baseflow. Enhancing the baseflow has a proper effect on the ecologically relevant quality of waters, and is therefore wanted for WBD according to the regulations of the Water Framework Directive. It is needed to quantitatively examine these measures that have been implemented in subcatchments of WBD. Therefore, sufficient data of good quality is needed. Especially, the stream discharge itself is important to collect. In this research, the stream discharge is obtained by a physically based model (the GR4J rainfall-runoff model). Moreover, a new method is applied: relating groundwater heads to stream discharge by applying machine learning algorithms. These two different methods are used for subcatchment Chaamse Beken, for which it is wanted to simulate stream discharge between 2003-2019 (flow measuring weir has been removed in 2003).<br/>Four different machine learning algorithms are used: decision tree regression (DTR), random forest regression (RFR), gradient boosting regression (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR). The training set of these models is set from 1985-1999, whereas the test set is from 1999-2003. Moreover, different input variables and combinations of these variables are chosen for the models: shallow wells (screen-1 wells), deeper wells (screen-2 wells), precipitation and potential evaporation. The model performance is evaluated with the metrics Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute error (MAE), fourth root mean quadrupled error (R4MS4E) and mean squared logarithmic error (MSLE). The first two are considered for overall model performance, whereas the latter two are for high flow and low flow model performance.<br/>The best overall and low model performance is obtained by using the algorithm SVR and using inputs groundwater heads of shallow wells, precipitation and potential evaporation (a NSE of 0.75). In order to examine if this machine learning model can be used in the future for stream discharge simulation, the SVR model is compared with an existing conceptual hydrological model GR4J. The GR4J model has a NSE value of 0.80 and can be rated as good. It has a larger NSE value than the SVR model and performs better than the SVR machine learning model.<br/>It is important to stress that for the GR4J model the memory (or state) of the system is included. This inclusion of the memory of the system is not the case for the machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, an important difference is the fact that groundwater heads play a significant role in the simulation of the stream discharge by using machine learning algorithms. These groundwater heads are not directly used in the GR4J model. Lastly, it is stressed that for building the GR4J model physical understanding of the hydrological system is needed, whereas for machine learning this is not the case.<br/>Overall, it can be concluded that GR4J is still favoured above SVR, but SVR shows promising results for further research in simulating stream discharge.<br","machine learning; stream discharge; groundwater heads; time series analysis Pastas; GR4J model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The size effect is a term used for the relative decrease in shear capacity with an increase in height of the structural member. The beams observed in the experiment failed much sooner than was predicted. These test results have implications for the Heinenoordtunnel, the roof of which shares many of the characteristics of the beams that were used in the experiments. The question is posed what happens to the Heinenoordtunnel in case of a fire, when also considering the recent tests on the size effect of concrete. The Heinenoordtunnel is analysed with a numerical model. First however, in order to account for the observed size effect, the beams from the experiment are recreated. A study is performed on the effect of various parameters on the numerically obtained failure load, cracking load, crack pattern and deflection in order to find a set of parameters to approximate the observed size effect. It was found that a significant reduction in tensile strength and fracture energy is necessary to obtain a better approximation of the experimental results. However, despite these changes the numerical model still overestimates the shear capacity. This information is used to create a model of the Heinenoordtunnel. A situation without a fire load is analysed and validated. The model is compared with the analytical IBBC-TNO method. Consequently, the model is subjected to a fire load. The fire is modelled using temperature dependent properties and by determining the temperature ingress for a 2 hour RWS fire. A significant shear crack is found present due the fire load, the location and shape of the crack suggesting onset of shear compression failure. The model however is still considered to be in equilibrium and so failure has not actually occurred in the model. A comparison with an analytical model suggests that a shift in bending moments from the increase in temperature results in a shift of shear capacity in the roof. It is concluded that, while the numerical model does not fail, some caution is advised for the translation of these results to practical application. The change of material parameters found in modelling the size effect tests still leads to an overestimation of the shear capacity. On the other hand, the situation that was modelled was an extremity. In the model of the Heinenoordtunnel the absolute physical maximum water load was assumed in conjunction with an extreme fire. It is recommended to check the fire load with computational fluid dynamics modelling, to see if the fire load could possibly be less severe than assumed.","Concrete; Shear; Fire; Numerical Analysis; Tunnels; size effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

On the other hand, a few researchers explored the problem of energy performance gap in retrofitted buildings due to a lack of knowledge in energy consumption and a proper way to access the data. Therefore, this study aims to deepen knowledge on the relationship and interaction between the end-user and building’s energy performance, thereby contributing to the academic discussion on the energy performance paradox of retrofitted buildings. With the help of various smart energy tools, it is possible to acquire better insight and to regulate the energy performance of the building with respect to thermal comfort and occupant well-being. This study presents the importance of energy sufficiency through passive design and BMS implementation as a path towards those goals by answering the following main research question ‘How to integrate the Building Management Systems (BMS) requirements to optimize the energy performance and user satisfaction in retrofitted residential buildings?’ Through a case study, the outcome of this master thesis is achieved: A strategic approach towards energy sufficient building design that focusses on adding value to the environment, economy and end-users. By promoting the right ecological solutions and having a conscious user behaviour, energy can be consumed efficiently whereas temperatures are kept at a very comfortable level.

The area becomes a densified area for entrepreneurship and various forms of co-living. Within the transformation, the local businesses are strengthened and possibilities are opened up for new initiatives, varying from small factories, small businesses and places for gathering. Its place identity is preserved by avoiding demolition. This has been made possible by the creation of a secondary raised infrastructure. The plan is not intended to be a static blueprint but offers the boundary conditions for the transformation.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The amount of air traffic worldwide is increasing, with an adverse effect on aircraft noise in the vicinity of airports as a result. Measurements and calculations have complementary benefits and limitations for the assessment of aircraft noise. A common method for the calculation of aircraft noise is ECAC Doc. 29. Various improvements of this method have been developed and studied in the past. However, research often lacks large numbers of measurements to validate these findings. The current study examined the effect of ECAC Doc. 29 model improvements on the differences between measured and calculated aircraft noise levels. The two improvements addressed in this research are: (1) The use of actual instead of standard meteorological conditions and (2) the use of derived flight performance instead of standard flight performance profiles. The calculated results have been compared with NOMOS measurements, the network of unattended microphones around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Using 151,108 flights and 385,001 NOMOS measurements, it was found that the difference between measurement and calculation depends on type of operation, aircraft type, and position of the microphone. The use of actual meteorological conditions showed the ability to reduce variability due to temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. The use of derived flight performance showed the ability to reduce variability due to wind up to 8 m/s. However, the absolute difference between measurements and calculations did not decrease for both improvements. Additionally, the aircraft substitution corrections were assessed. The substitution corrections based on ICAO type code showed smaller differences between measurements and calculations compared to the corrections based on aircraft configuration. It is suggested to study the substitution corrections further in the future. Moreover, it is advised to make use of the advancements in air traffic operations research for noise calculations based on derived flight performance.","aircraft noise; noise modelling; ECAC Doc. 29; noise monitoring; noise measurements; uncertainty; NOMOS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Orbit Determination (OD) algorithms provide the required estimations, assuming that the uncertainty in the state of the object is properly characterized by its state vector covariance and assuming Gaussian processes. However, a common problem of OD processes is the misrepresentation of the RSOs uncertainty through the estimated and predicted covariance. Ultimately, this causes a great impact in the quality and accuracy of SST products as the covariance is overly optimistic (too small) and the true uncertainty of the object is not properly captured. The aim of this work is to devise a novel methodology to improve the covariance realism of OD and orbit propagation processes through the classical theory of consider parameters of batch least-squares estimators.

(mentor); Sinnige, T. (graduation committee); Voskuijl, M. (graduation committee); van Kampen, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","A propeller has a high propulsive efficiency, yet inherently leaves the air it propels swirling. The efficiency of a propeller can be enhanced by placing it in the tip vortex of a wing. Such a tip-mounted propeller configuration lets the vortex created by the wing and the vortex created by the propeller counteract each other, enhancing the propulsive efficiency of the system. Even though the benefits of such a configuration are clear, the concept is not commercially viable. Among other benefits, electric engines are scalable, light and can be placed in advantageous positions. This allows the engine to be placed at the tip of a wing. The batteries for electric propulsion are heavy, so synergistic effects are needed to improve the efficiency to such an extent that electric propulsion will be commercially viable. Another benefit can be defined by tip-mounted propulsion. As the propeller is mounted at the tip of the wing, the moment arm is large. This could result in a large directional control moment. On the other hand, if one engine is inoperative, the resulting moment is so large that it cannot be compensated by a rudder deflection. Therefore, if a one-engine inoperative situation arises, to still produce thrust both propellers have to be interlinked resulting in a heavy system, or both engines should be switched off. If tip-mounted propellers are used to enhance directional stability and control, the vertical tailplane size can be reduced, resulting in a reduction of mass, drag and hence overall power consumption. In this thesis the contribution of tip-mounted propellers to static stability, dynamic stability, and control is researched, for both positive and negative input power. Negative input power denotes that the propellers are recuperating energy fromthe airflow, and is a state that is applicable when one engine is inoperable. The forces on a tip-mounted pusher propeller are obtained by linking a lifting line wing model and a combined blade-element momentum vortex propeller model. The lifting line model is used to calculate wing-induced velocities on the pusher propeller disk. These induced velocities are used as input for the propeller model, and a resulting thrust and power is obtained. These are corrected for an angle of attack on the propeller disk by empirical relations. The thrust, normal force and power are saved to a 7D dataset. A non-linear flight mechanics model of the Piper Seneca III uses the dataset as lookup table and implements the tip-mounted propeller as forces at the tip locations. Thrust variations in the 7D dataset are parametrically visualised, showing the expected trends. Resulting forces are compared with a rudder deflection, to estimate a potential rudder size reduction. When the aircraft is flying slow, tip-mounted propellers can match the maximum moment produced by the conventional rudder. When flying fast, around half the reference yawing moment can be produced by tip-mounted propellers. The static stability contribution of tip-mounted propellers is visualised parametrically for propeller diameter, advance ratio, blade pitch and a toe-in angle. Negative toe-in angles, hence toe-out angles, prove to greatly enhance the directional static stability. High thrust values greatly enhance longitudinal static stability as the reference aircraft’s wing tips are positioned above the centre of gravity. In the same parametric fashion as the static stability evaluation, the contribution of tip-mounted propellers to dynamic stability is evaluated. The damping factor and natural frequency are obtained for first order motions Dutch roll and the Phugoid by fitting an exponential curve to the time-response of the flight mechanicsmodel. This method succeeds in capturing the motion characteristics, and indicates clear trends: the frequency of the Dutch roll increases with toe-out angles and thrust, and the frequency increases with thrust. The Phugoid’s natural frequency increases with thrust, and damping factor decreases with thrust. An attempt is done to use the curve-fitting method for the second order motion Short period as well, yet proves too inaccurate. A typical tip-mounted propeller design is evaluated to summarise the effects of using tip-mounted propellers for directional stability and control. For this non-optimised design, the static stability is enhanced by 37%. The dynamic stability has increased significantly as well. Maximum blade pitch deflection and maximum rudder deflection result in similar time-history sideslip responses when the aircraft is flying slow, when flying fast the tip-mounted propeller design’s sideslip response is around half the reference rudder deflection response. This conclusion also applies to a one engine inoperative simulation. In this thesis, a significant first step is made toward enhancing directional stability and control with tip-mounted propellers by defining the contribution of tip-mounted propellers in a parametric fashion. The results are directly applicable to an aircraft that has been designed with tip-mounted propellers, yet does not rely on tip-mounted propellers for directional stability and control. A typical design is evaluated in cruise, recuperative and one-engine inoperative cases, proving that from a stability and control point of view the vertical tailplane can be reduced in size. Before tip-mounted propellers can be used for directional stability and control behaviour analysis in the stalled regime, more research has to be conducted. This is left as recommendation.","tip-mounted propeller; propeller; propeller-wing interaction; tip-vortex; stability and control; directional stability and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Coating deposition by Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) on high strength steels is an important research project at TATA Steel - IJmuiden. The research is aimed at replacing the conventional hot-dip galvanisation process to obtain a defect-free coating without affecting their well-engineered properties. However, the annealing treatment of the steel, performed to obtain these properties, affects the coating adhesion properties. This is a result of the selective oxidation process, which forms external oxides of alloying elements at the surface. Therefore, a pre-treatment process is required to remove these surface oxides from the steel strips before they are coated. Plasma sputtering is currently being<br/>used for the pre-treatment to remove any contaminants and surface oxides from the steel. To obtain a good coating adhesion, a relatively large amount of surface oxides needs to be removed by sputtering. Also, the removed material is known to contaminate the vacuum chamber in the PVD deposition line, for which frequent maintenance of the chamber might be necessary. Thus, an additional<br/>surface pre-treatment step was investigated in this study to reduce the sputtering process inside the vacuum as much as possible. In the present work, the effect of both direct current electrolytic alkaline cleaning and sulphuric acid etching on the surface of DP800 steel was investigated. Two different baths were considered for this purpose; a 27 g/L NaOH bath with some additive at 60°C and a 50 g/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> bath at 25°C and 50°C. A current density of 1.5 A/dm<sup>2</sup> was applied during the electrolytic cleaning for which both cathodic and anodic polarisation methods were investigated. Also, a range of acid etching times (10s to 120s) was investigated for the given concentration and temperatures of the acid bath to study its effect on the surface. The effect of adding a corrosion inhibitor into the acid bath on the rest of the coating deposition process was also investigated. Various surface characterisation techniques and wettability tests were performed to study the changes in morphology and composition of the surface and their effect on the coating adhesion properties of the treated samples. Finally, coating adhesion tests were performed after zinc deposition to investigate the adhesion performance of the steel after the pre-treatment steps. Initial surface analysis during electrolytic alkaline cleaning showed that the anodic polarisation was more effective than cathodic polarisation of the sample, as the latter tends to reduce the surface wettability by additional deposits of iron fines over the surface. A subsequent acid etching provided a reduction in the minimum required sputter intensity to obtain a good adhesion from 2300 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> to about 800 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>. A further reduction was achieved to a sputter intensity of only 214 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> after retarding the effects of surface reoxidation by vacuum sealing the samples. Acid etching at 25°C provided bad coating adhesion at lower etching times, attributed to the partial dissolution of surface oxides and absence of an initial grain roughening. Good coating adhesion was either obtained at higher etching times or by increasing the temperature of the acid bath to 50°C. Addition of a corrosion inhibitor was considered impractical as high sputter intensities (&gt; 321 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>) was required to remove the adsorbed inhibitor molecules from the surface. Thus, a reduction in the required sputter intensity was achieved by more than a factor of 10 after acid etching, only if the effects of surface reoxidation during the transfer time between acid etching and entering the PVD installation can be minimized.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br","Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD); coating technology; Acid etching; DP Steel; Surface Treatment; adhesion properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","Surface pre-treatment for PVD coatings of HSS | TATA Steel R&D",""

This leaves them vulnerable to drought and changing rainfall patterns due to climate change. Over time, farmers have adopted local strategies and knowledge that help reducing the overall vulnerability to climate variability shocks. One other option to increase the resilience of rainfed farmers to drought, is providing forecast information on the upcoming rainfall season. Forecast information has the potential to inform farmers in their decisions surrounding agricultural strategies. However, significant challenges remain in the provision of forecast information. Often, the forecast information is not tailored to farmers, resulting in limited uptake of forecast information into their agricultural decision-making. Therefore, this study explores whether drought forecast information can be linked to existing farmers strategies and local knowledge on predicting future rainfall patterns. During a period of three months in Malawi, participatory research approaches are used to create an understanding of what requirements drought forecast information should meet to effectively inform farmers in their decision-making. Consequently, a sequential threshold model was established that relates annually monitored meteorological indicators before the rainy season, to the occurrence of dry conditions during the season. Dry conditions were expressed in the drought indicators that farmers require for their agricultural decision-making. Additionally, using interviews among stakeholders and a visualisation of the current information flow, further insights on the current drought information system were developed. Although farmers have their own strategies and timing of decision-making, this research has generalized some of the opinions and strategies to develop the ‘requirements’ which a contextualized forecast should meet. In August farmers require a prediction of the onset of the rainy season, typically starting mid-November. In addition, an update on the timing of the onset of rains is required in beginning of November. An overall indication of the ‘dryness’ of the rainy season is required in September. Here, ‘dryness’ is characterized by the number of dry spells, a composite ‘drought index’ of associated rainfall variables by the farmers. The forecast should be on a scale that is locally relevant (EPA level). This research consequently established a forecasting model, based on meteorological variables from local knowledge which can complement the forecast variables from the DCCMS. The results of forecast verification show that meteorological indicators based on local knowledge have a predictive value for forecasting drought indicators. Subsequently, skill analysis of forecasting incorporating all the above dimensions shows that the accuracy of the forecast differs per location with an increased skill to the Southern locations. In addition, it is also location dependent whether the contribution of wind, temperature or ENSO indicators gives the most predictive value. The results show that a combination of all indicators have the best predictive value. In addition, the results show that local knowledge indicators have an increased predictive value in forecasting the locally relevant critical events in comparison to the currently used ENSO-related indicators by the DCCMS. Additional research is needed to further analyse certain aspects of this research, such as research on the robustness of the model used. Research on the risk farmers are willing to take in their respective decisions could act as another requirement the forecast skill should meet. This highlights the importance of having continuous feedback from the farmers, since farmers may experience adverse impacts from wrongly informed decisions. Despite these limitations, it is argued that the inclusion of local knowledge in the current drought information system of Malawi may improve the provision of forecast information for farmers and shows that it is possible to capture local knowledge in a technical approach. The findings have relevant implications for other stakeholders, such as humanitarian and meteorological organisations, that are implementing drought-risk reduction approaches and climate services.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Unfortunately, most of the propellants used for space activities tend to be highly toxic, corrosives, and even carcinogenic. Toxicity is especially critical for the hypergolics, which in most cases are the preferred propellant due to their simple application as they ignite upon contact. Throughout the history of space propulsion, some chemicals have been left aside due to their low performance when benchmarked against these more powerful hypergolic propellants. However, the trend of ""green'' technologies is pushing research towards green lower performance propellants. This is the case of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which was left aside due to its reduced effectiveness and the complexity to exploit its energy. Nonetheless, the work with hydrogen peroxide has recently acquired a new focus. Its green perspective has instigated large projects by the European Commission, such as GRASP, and approaches to exploit its energetic content are a topic of research. Currently, the use of catalysts to decompose the chemical is the usual procedure. However, their complexity and effect on performance raise some problems. In this thesis, a new approach through thermal energy supply aims at avoiding the catalyst approach to decompose hydrogen peroxide and overcome their related problems. The feasibility of this approach is tested and characterized for different combinations of temperatures and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. In order to characterize this, a first look into the procurement of the chemical is done. The different approaches presented lead to a successful refining technique, which is now patented. This innovative approach allows acquiring hydrogen peroxide in concentrations in excess of 99% in the span of 1-2 days for a reduced price. The simplicity of this technique is unrivaled to the stringent regulations surrounding its commercial availability. The resulting solution is investigated in terms of stability over time and concentration. The final selected concentrations for this study are 75, 80, 85, 90, and 95% H2O2. The thermal activation of hydrogen peroxide is first investigated. Through an open-air drop-test study, the droplets of H2O2 are generated and precipitated over a heating plate at various temperatures. The combinations of temperature and concentration, which lead to decomposition, are recorded and analyzed through a set of thermocouples and a high-speed camera at 6400 fps. For the valid combinations, the analysis returns their maximum temperatures and decomposition delay times. Values of up to 800 celsius for 90 and 95% H2O2 are achieved, and low decomposition delay times below 100 ms were measured for heating plate temperatures of 250 and 270 celsius. This information is put against the decomposition with catalyst MnO2 for comparison, showing a more significant temperature released for the thermal approach, but a slower decomposition. With the valid decomposition combinations, an ignition study is conducted with ethanol as the fuel and hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. Through a drop test on a heating plate, the mechanisms leading to the ignition are researched. The tests showed that ignition is pseudo-hypergolic and can achieve increases in temperature of up to 700 celsius for 95% H2O2 and ethanol, reaching maximum temperatures over 1000 celsius at points. The tests showed that combinations with 90 and 95% H2O2 result on average ignition delay times below 100 ms. The conducted test cases showed that the ignition temperature profiles can be correlated with the recorded filming and that the lessons learned can be applied for a future combustion chamber. In order to test performance-boosting techniques, the gelling of the fuel was done and tested. The results are promising, the ignition of ethanol with 1.8% wt. of hydroxypropyl cellulose reached such temperatures that melted a thermocouple, proving the ability to raise the performance.<br/>Lastly, the gel sample was characterized in terms of a rheology study by performing a strain sweep to find its yield point. Moreover, a shear rate analysis was performed, and its thixotropic nature was tested through a hysteresis loop. The effect of temperature was also analyzed and fitted to an exponential Arrhenius-like form.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To effectively explore the feasibility of these panels as a natural and circular alternative, an industry-oriented product development approach was used. Therefore, this research focussed on parameters thought to be crucial in generating interest from industry players. Within the limitation of the research these were the structural behaviour and scaled production of the product. In an extensive analysis of this novel material both general characteristics as exact properties of Mycelium-Based Composites (MBCs) were explored. This project succeeded in getting a ‘feel’ for it and has applied that deeper understanding in tackling the further steps in the research. A potentially promising industry niche was found in the distribution centre construction sector and its dynamics were studied. It was found that this niche sector is extremely sustainability-savvy, accounting for a total share of 16% of all BREEAM certification issued in 2018. While at the same time being responsible for 16% of the nation rigid foam insulation demand. This large quantity simply applied fossil-fuel derived foam was identified as ideal low bearing, ‘positive impact’, fruit. Through interviews with industry experts and an industry analysis several quantitative and qualitative boundary conditions was collected that formed a foundation for the remaining research. It was decided to perform a number of 4-point bend test, exploring the fungal sandwich panel’s potential to serve as roof plate. Both lose MBC as sandwich panel samples were tested. Based on the data provide by the experiments could be concluded both the properties of the material and the product are currently insufficient for the envisioned application. However, the found result were of an order of magnitude interring enough for further research. The MBC is approximately two to three times weaker than traditional foams. Although, the sandwich samples showed ten times better behaviour its full potential was far from realised. Weak adhesion of the individual components and the following premature delamination were identified as the main cause for this underperformance.Summary | 7 Further development is needed on a material, product and application level to achieve applicability, suggestions of potential fruitful development directions have been made. The order of magnitude of the results is however of such comparable quantity that, especially less demanding, employments of the product can on a short-term be accomplished. It is therefore interesting to see that this research has shown how the production process of mycelium-based sandwich panels could look like. By converting button mushroom facilities, a batch-based production system could be put into place with a scale adequate for the demands from the distribution centre construction industry. Twelve of the envisioned facilities could produce all insulation material for the complete sector. In this explorative project it has been shown that this nature-based technology holds potential. Sandwich panels can be made with a certain quality and quantity. But although current product performance is not sufficient for the studied application other widespread uses can be foreseen. So, although further research is certainly needed in the development of composed mycelium-based circular products it can be concluded that based on qualitative and quantitative benchmarks these products can and likely will serve as a sustainable and circular alternative to traditional, oil-based, rigid insulation products.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-21","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Currently, measurements exceeding the legal limit of 25ᵒC at the tap are exceptional. However, there are reasons to believe that the number of exceedances will increase due to climate change and urbanization. So far the effects of sunlight hours and soil coverage on drinking water temperature have already been quantified quite well. Still lacking is the exact effect of anthropogenic heat sources on these temperatures. In this study more insight is given in the extent of this effect for Rotterdam, and measures are discussed to mitigate or to prevent drinking water warming. First, potential anthropogenic heat sources are identified. By analyzing data on tap temperatures and old soil temperature measurements, several anthropogenic heat sources emerged. A map of the statistically warm drinking water temperatures in Rotterdam, appears to have a lot of resemblance to the city heating system whereabouts. Furthermore, smaller indications point at high voltage power cables and metro lines to be important anthropogenic heat sources. Soil temperature measurements around these potential heat sources confirm some of the expectations. Around high voltage power cables, a limited elevated temperature of 0.6ᵒC is found. Much more alarming results were encountered around the city heating mains. In autumn, primary heating mains warm-up the soil by 4.9 – 5.3ᵒC and secondary heating mains do so by 2.9ᵒC. A temperature elevation of 1ᵒC is measured to a distance of 3.8 - 5.25m and 2.3m, respectively. However, these results are highly dependent of several parameters, like the temperature differences between the air and soil, the thermal properties of the soil, and the depth and state of the anthropogenic heat sources themselves. Several strategies to mitigate the warming of drinking water in the distribution system are applicable. In a general sense, it is most sensible to create a distance between any heat source and the distribution system. By placing drinking water mains in the shade, below grass and away from anthropogenic heat sources, warming of the drinking water can be prevented in a relatively inexpensive manner. Measures targeted at temporary local hotspots can be focused on restraining the heat flux from the heat source to the soil, the heat flux through the soil, and the heat flux from the soil to the drinking water.","Anthropogenic heat sources; Drinking water; Temperature; Drinking water distribution system; Rotterdam; Evides; Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The terrain is located at the intersection of the North Sea Canal and Zijkanaal G and functioned as the logistic heart of the Stelling van Amsterdam. The former military terrain consists of many buildings, including 50 monuments and historical green structures. After the Ministry of Defence and the factory Eurometaal left the site, the area became desolated and taken over by nature. Currently this area, full of potential, needs a new permanent use. ‘Campus South’ is part of the military area and consist of the washing hall, heat treatment building, expedition building and ruin of a bicycle shed. The soothing nature and the pleasant character of the ensemble is of value, and therefore desirable to preserve. The once closed off terrain, will be revitalised in which the new program of cultural initiatives and entertainment strengthens the character of the ensemble, making the area accessible and a place to be for the public. This program exist out of: a beer garden with terrace bar, a film studio, and an information point to welcome everyone to the Hembrug terrain. The challenge will be to find a solution that on the one hand preserves the characteristic atmosphere and on the other hand deals with sustainability and creating a well-designed environment for the new use. For the design approach a restoration plan is created, in which what to preserve, restore and renew will be considered. The main strategy is to preserve as much as possible and to demolish only parts of low value when necessary. Additions can be made, but must be demountable, for the future. Most of the additions, restoration approach and use of materials are inspired by the past. After downfall there is the possibility of growth. This means that there is room for change. The buildings are given a new function, taking ‘the endless waves of transformation’ into account: future functions of the building. Central to this is the past, the basis of what is already there and that what is being preserved. For example the preserved interior walls of the beer garden, these walls tell the story of the origin and transformations, and will be treated as a piece of art. The decay of the buildings furthermore make room for renewal. Apart of the basis of the past, a groundwork is laid for future transformations of the buildings. This means that the buildings are made as sustainable as possible. By doing so a public gathering place will be created, wherein the ensemble is treated as a scenery (décor), where people can come together and relieve stress.","Hembrug; Campus South; Heritage; Architecture; Cultural value; Restoration; Transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Revitalising heritage: Hembrug","52.421472, 4.829769"

(mentor); Arkesteijn, M.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Netherlands is rapidly ageing, while at the same time, seniors themselves are also changing in comparison to previous generations, leading to changing housing demands. Collaborative housing addresses several of these new demands effectively. Nonetheless, collaborative housing is laborious and risky. Therefore, this research investigates how to improve collaborative housing and its development process, in the context of seniors. The main research question is “How can young seniors positively contribute to the realisation process of appropriate housing for themselves?”, where a preference is made for appropriate housing being collaborative housing. Additionally, the research focuses on seniors between the ages of 55 and 65. The main research question is answered through the following five sub research questions:<br/>What are the housing demands of young seniors, and through which criteria’s do they judge their environment?<br/>How will the housing demands of young seniors change over the coming decades? What government policies affect the match, and how? What are the key constraints affecting the development process? How can the constraints be alleviated?  The research takes an empirical, qualitative approach. To operationalise the research questions, Grounded Theory is adopted, with a range of methods and data collection methods: desk research and interviews. The objective of the research is to create knowledge for seniors and external actors involved with these projects, about the nature and common pitfalls of these development processes. The findings show that there are eight aspects of housing that are important to seniors: apartment in a unique building, 70-100m2, a green/sustainable environment, on the edge of town, privacy-oriented, future-proof, with influence on resident selection, and a diverse group of residents. Seven motivations were discovered: positive reinforcement, exploration - new activities - new people, enjoyment, support, cognitive vitality, a chance to redesign life, and the fact that children moved out. From both the government and market perspective, it became clear that there will be more seniors, and that their housing demands will further diversify over the coming decades. Government entities seem to focus on the demographic aspects of the developments, where all entities except provinces seem to have a good amount of knowledge. The market focuses more on the solution required for these demographic changes. Seniors can count on direct and indirect policies, where the majority of policies are of a financial nature (loan, grants and guarantees). There are some ‘ecosystem’ policies in place. One direct policy from the national government provides significant financial support, while most other direct and indirect policies are less significant. Twenty-five constraints were found, present over five constraint categories: economic, legal, process, social, and communicative. Based on presence of constraints across phases, five constraints were found to be most impactful. To alleviate the constraints, 24 tasks were found for residents, and three for municipalities. The tasks occur mostly in the early phases of the projects, and the majority of them involve external advisors. In conclusion, seniors should seek to organise their resident group as professionally as possible, and where possible, “import” the necessary knowledge.","seniors; collaborative housing; constraints; barriers; development process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Now the amount of jobs and job vacancies keeps growing, companies started a battle to attract talented knowledge workers to gain the best organisational market position in the current knowledge-driven economy. There is assumed that work environments can be used strategically to attract employees, wherefore companies invest in their work environments. However, it has not been proven that work environments –involving characteristics on location, service &amp; facilities, building, and workplace level– may lead to increased employee attraction. Therefore the main research question is: “What is the influence of work environments on attracting employees to enhance competitive advantage within the war for talent?”. A literature review in combination with structured interviews and an online survey resulted in information on the influence that work environment characteristics have on the attraction of knowledge workers. The data on the influence of work environment characteristics is generated by implementing the value tree method in combination with the constant sum method within the survey. Subsequently, the data is statistically analysed in SPSS by mainly using a Repeated Measures ANOVA in combination with a Paired Samples T-Test or a Games-Howell Test. From the results can be concluded that the work environment is comparable influential as other, more general, employee attraction factors, but is not perceived as one of the most influential factors. Mainly the location-related factors, geographical location and accessibility, appeared to be high influential on people’s choice for a job. In addition, significant differences between groups from different socio-demographic perspectives were found for almost all tested variables. Remarkable is that no significant differences were found between groups on the value that the influence of the work environment perceived when comparing to the general employee attraction factors. This indicates that there can be assumed that the survey respondents have a comparable opinion on the influence of the work environment on their choice for a new job. Besides, 74% of the respondents indicated that they are willing to give up a certain percentage of their (future) salary in exchange for their ideal work environment. However, as most of the variables did indicate significant mean differences concerning their influence of the work environment characteristics between different groups, the ideal work environment is different for each (socio-demographic) group and even for each individual. The advice for companies is to define their target group and link their target group to the employee profiles as presented in this thesis in order to increase the chance of attracting their employee target group, and thereby enhancing their competitive advantage within the ‘war for talent’.","work environments; employees; attracting; knowledge workers; war for talent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

In the maritime industry, interest in the analysis of ship data has grown over the years. In this thesis, we will take a look at AIS data coupled with sea state data. AIS data is data generated from the ship, concerning the ship locations, speed, and heading, among others. When coupled with data such as the wave height and wave directions at these locations, we can analyse the ship operations in different sea conditions. We analyzed 46 Damen ships of the same type, that operate in different regions of the world. The aim was to make interpretable groups of ships that have similar operation profiles, and to investigate the effect of different sea states on the ship operations. We first enrich the data with port labels, from which we can define trips as sequences of points away from port. We also estimate path lengths between points using Bézier curves. From this we get a relevant set of variables that can use for an unsupervised learning task. We clustered the ships using three methods: principal components analysis, Kmeans, and hierarchical clustering. Principal components analysis showed variation in the ships, but interpretation and definitive clusters were not clear. We then used the K-means method to make 12 clusters of ships, of which six clusters proved to be stable. Hierarchical clustering showed similar results. Interpretation of these clusters was possible, mainly by looking at separate trips. We therefore also clustered the trips, to get classes of trips. We used the K-means method and obtained six clusters of trips, of which five were stable. We also look at ship availability in different regions during different sea conditions. We use an isotonic regression method to test whether ships ships stay in port more often during heavy weather. We found regions where availability decreases during high waves and regions where availability seemed independent from wave height. This most likely has to do with the function of the ship. And finally we look at sailing speeds during different sea states and find that sea state data alone is not sufficient to adequately estimate sailing speeds of a ship. The conclusion is that using the variables that we created, stable clusters can be obtained. These clusters are interpretable and can lead to a better understanding of customer needs. Coupling the AIS data with more data sources however would be a recommendation, since that can lead to more informative clusters, and might lead to more insight into sailing speeds.","clustering; pca; operational profiles; dbscan; Hierarchical; kmeans; isotonic regression; statistics; maritime; ships","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is used for speckle tracking and modified to include prior constraints to guide the matching process among two frames, called as Guided Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Prior constraint is in the form of a directional constraint which determines the probability of vector flow in all the directions according to the orientation of the vessels. The orientation of the vessels is computed using Power Doppler Imaging.

The application of this material in the tension zone of hybrid concrete structures is thus of interest in practice. The interfacial behavior for these hybrid structures is something that is of importance for the composite action. Therefore, a study is performed to investigate the behavior of the interface in hybrid SHCC-concrete beams. This is done by performing an experimental study on beams with a joint at midspan. Several parameters such as the interface roughness, coupling reinforcement cover, curing method and protruding reinforcement have been investigated. The hybrid SHCC-concrete beams are tested in a four-point bending configuration to obtain a constant-bending moment region along the interface. The crack propagation along the interface and through the SHCC/concrete has been evaluated with the use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Furthermore, also a numerical analysis has been performed using DIANA FEA based. The numerical analysis was used to help to determine the experimental campaign. Furthermore, also several experimental samples have been modelled to study the behavior of the beam in more detail and to make recommendations for future modelling of the interface. Based on the experimental results, the influence of the interface roughness resulted in an increased bond at the interface. This is both seen in an increased bearing capacity and a reduction of the interface and joint opening at equal loads. The profiled interface and holed interface resulted in an increased capacity due to the mechanical interlocking at the interface. The bearing capacity of these samples increased by 78.4% and 54.7% respectively compared to the reference sample (13.9 kN). In case of the profiled sample, no delamination of the interface occurred as the sample failed due to a horizontal crack at the level of the coupling reinforcement. This can be attributed to the localized tensile stresses at the reinforcement level. The last sample with a different interface roughness consisted of epoxy and sand (1-2 mm). For this sample, the bearing capacity increased by 51.8%. The failure of this sample was a combination of interface delamination (initially at the joint) and a horizontal crack through the coupling reinforcement. For all the samples with a different interface roughness, no yielding of the coupling reinforcement occurred. Several beams with a smooth interface have also been tested by adjusting the reinforcement cover, curing method and applying protruding reinforcement. The influence of the reinforcement cover didn’t have an effect on the bearing capacity. However, the interface and joint opening reduced significantly as the eccentricity of the reinforcement bars also reduced. Furthermore, also the effective height increased resulting in lower reinforcement stresses. The influence of a different curing method was investigated by placing the sample in a humidity-controlled (50 %) room to investigate the effect of shrinkage. The results showed that the bearing capacity remained similar to the reference samples. This can be attributed to the fact that the bond internally was still good, caused by the restraint of the reinforcement bars. However, the deflection of the beam increased as a result of the reduced stiffness by the shrinkage induced cracks. Finally, one sample consisted of stirrups at a distance of 50 mm from the joint to take up the tensile stresses at the interface (e.g. due to reinforcement eccentricity). The results showed an increase in bearing capacity by 102.7% compared to the reference sample. However, also in this case, no yielding of the coupling reinforcement occurred. The failure of the sample is also caused by the delamination of the interface. Furthermore, as a result of this delamination, fracture of the top part of the SHCC occurred at the location of the protruding reinforcement due to the rotational restraint of the stirrup. The 2nd part of the study consisted of a numerical analysis. A Coulomb-friction model with an interface tensile strength cut-off is used to model the interface. Based on this, a good correspondence between the experimental results and FE results is found in terms of the bearing capacity and failure mode for the sample with a smooth interface(delamination). However, the crack propagation of the flexural cracks through the concrete and SHCC was substantially different.<br/>The sample with a profiled interface has also been modelled in Diana FEA. This is done by implementing the profiled interface manually in the FE model. The model showed a good correspondence with the experimental results in terms of bearing capacity and interface and joint opening. The crack propagation in the concrete is also similar to the experimental results. The model however doesn’t show any flexural cracking in the SHCC layer as a result of the limitation of DIANA FEA. Also, an additional study is done to replicate the behavior of this beam using a smooth interface. Based on this model, it is recommended to use a perfect bond at the interface. For both these models, the FE model wasn’t able to replicate the strain hardening behavior of SHCC. This is due to the limiting material models in DIANA.","Strain hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC); Interface; concrete structure; hybrid structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The multimodal recursive ARX method is an extension of the unimodal recursive ARX method developed in earlier work. The verification of the recursive multimodal ARX method was performed by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. The validation of this method is based on the identification results of a human-in-the-loop experiment.

A forgetting matrix with an infinite memory horizon for the coefficients of the A(q) polynomial and a memory horizon of 5 seconds for the coefficients of the B(q) polynomials was found optimal for both tasks with time-varying as well as linear time-invariant controlled element dynamics. The estimation results for the human operator model parameters gathered during the human-in-the-loop experiment were in line with the results that were found in literature.

It’s head office is situated in the Netherlands and with more than 3000 employees working from sites and offices all around the world, it is able to ensure its local presence on every continent. Nowadays a subsidiary company of Royal IHC, IHC IQIP is expanding the scope of its Internal Lifting Tool (ILT), by using it for lifting as well as for transportation of jackets and topsides from offshore to onshore. The ILT is a tool used for lifting and upending of tubular offshore structures. Furthermore, it is designed for static lifting load acting on it for a short duration of time and not designed against multiple constraints like impact of wave load, current load, wind load etc. Using the same ILT for transportation of the tubular structures requires additional analysis for certifying the tool. During the transportation of tubular structures, the ILT is subjected to periodic wave-induced inertial load, which may induce a fatigue issue in it. The impact of this loading condition is unknown to the ILT’s structural integrity, which is designed for single lifting purposes. Therefore, the possible damage during transportation should be evaluated in accordance to offshore standards. The main objective of this thesis is to determine and demonstrate the procedure required for calculating the fatigue damage and fatigue life of the ILT. This research was performed considering that fatigue is critical during the transportation process. A step-by-step approach was adopted to complete this research. The first step was to understand the fatigue phenomena, based on different loading conditions, different methods to evaluate the stresses were studied. From the study it was determined that the stress based fatigue approach best suits the loading condition applied on the tool. This was followed by determining the method to evaluate the random environmental loads and finding a method to incorporate these loads to find the fatigue damage. Fatigue damage is generally determined in time domain. Cyclic loads varying with time is used for this assessment and the damage is computed on the basis of stress and strain. This analysis is advantageous when the load or the structural response is not linear. Random cyclic loads, when being assessed in time domain require large amount of data. This is not feasible and therefore, spectral fatigue analysis is preferred. In this approach power spectral density (PSD) functions are used for modelling the load and response of the structure. Lastly, spectral fatigue analysis of the ILT requires input from FEA analysis. There are various software packages generally used for FEA analysis. It was found that limited study has been conducted for determining which software package gives more accurate results of the stresses. The findings of the this thesis include the methodology for computing fatigue life for an ILT, determining fatigue life of an ILT using this methodology and to find which FEA software provides better results for stresses used to compute fatigue damage.","FEM analysis; Spectral fatigue analysis; Internal lifting tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

According to several climate change scenarios, flooding events as a result of intense precipitation are expected to continue into the future becoming more frequent and severe. Therefore, it is essential that engineers design and manage transport networks as efficiently as possible under adverse weather conditions in order to build more resilient transport systems. To do so, professionals need to understand and analyse the impacts of flooding on transport networks. Modelling the impacts of flooding events on the road network is nowadays possible by the use of integrated simulation techniques that combine a flood simulation model with a microscopic traffic model. With these modelling techniques, the geographic location, severity and other impacts of flooding on the road network can be predicted and studied. Nevertheless, in order to perform a consistent traffic simulation under flooding conditions, a thorough analysis of driving behaviour under such conditions needs first to be accomplished, which is a research field that has been scarcely investigated thus far. Therefore, the main contribution of this thesis is to provide a systematic methodology for studying driving adaptation effects under flooding conditions at two complementary levels, namely microscopic and macroscopic level. This consists on a multilevel approach that uses microscopic traffic data of vehicles driving through flooding to extend the study to a macroscopic level. A video analysis procedure called the `The 3-Step Video Analysis Approach´ (3SVAA) is developed by the author to extract microscopic traffic parameters from video recording of vehicles driving under different flood depths. This methodology is implemented through an empirical study that analyses two videos of vehicles crossing waterlogged stretches part of the A94 and A93 major roads in Scotland (UK). First, the 3SVAA is introduced as a suitable data collection technique to extract microscopic traffic variables (i.e. vehicle's speed, time headways and spacing) from video recording of vehicles driving through flooding. More specifically, these parameters are obtained from the vehicle's trajectories in the space (m)-time(s) diagram, which is the main outcome of this video analysis approach. Subsequently, by applying a multilevel analysis, the study can be extended to a macroscopic level by correlating macroscopic variables (i.e. average speed, flow and density) with their microscopic counterparts through the fundamental relationship of traffic flow. This allows to estimate part of the fundamental diagrams of vehicles travelling under different flood depths, and therefore to study flood impacts on free flow speed and capacity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

For example, in a performance-based design approach it could be specified how many lanes must be available during the lifetime of a bridge given a certain earthquake intensity.The problem with this approach is that it is not specified what the probability must be that the performance criterion is satisfied. This raises the question whether the design codes are acceptably safe or not. Focus is laid on the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC), in which a total resistance factor approach is used. Because the total resistance factor in the CHBDC is a multiplicative factor, lower resistance factors lead to stronger foundation designs. The goal of this thesis is to calibrate the design procedure in the CHBDC for geotechnical systems under seismic loading, by finding a relationship between resistance factors and the lifetime probabilities of failure of said systems. The resistance factor can then be fine-tuned to a lifetime probability of failure that is consistent with the lifetime probability of failure targeted in static design. As an example problem, the bearing capacity of a shallow foundation on a clay with a pseudo-dynamic earthquake load is tested. The research question that is answered in this thesis is: ""What should the resistance factors for geotechnical seismic design be in order to achieve a target lifetime probability of failure that is consistent with static design targets?'' Not every possible combination of soil strengths and forces on the superstructure can be taken into account, and therefore the random finite element method is used in a Monte Carlo simulation. Thousands of realization sare performed for each resistance factor, design return period, and ""actual''return period that the designed foundations are tested against. By seeing how many realizations of the Monte Carlo simulation fail given a certain earthquake intensity, the conditional probability of failure given that earthquake intensity can be estimated. The total lifetime probability of failure can then be estimated from the conditional probabilities of failure with the total probability theorem. As part of a parametric study, the lifetime probabilities of failure are estimated for six different scenarios, each of which has different sources of uncertainty.  The resulting lifetime probabilities of failure are interpolated in order to find a resistance factor that targets a lifetime probability of failure consistent with static design targets. Currently, the resistance factor that the CHBDC recommends for geotechnical systems under seismic loading are defined as the static resistance factor for that geotechnical system incremented with 0.20, meaning that compared to static design, weaker foundations are designed for seismic load cases. The resistance factor found in this thesis is closer to the resistance factor for static design than to the resistance factor for seismic design. It should therefore be considered to lower the seismic resistance factor to the value of the static resistance factor so that a sufficient lifetime reliability can be targeted.","Seismic engineering; Resistance factor; Shallow foundations; Probabilistic analysis; Calibration; Bearing capacity; Monte Carlo Simulation; random finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

Poor air quality can be hazardous to people doing any outdoor activities. So being able to make accurate, short term air quality predictions can be very useful. However, making these predictions has proven to be quite difficult, since there are a lot of different physical and chemical processes involved in the emission and transport of the various aerosols that contribute to air pollution. So instead of the more traditional Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) we will be using neural networks in order to make predictions of one of these aerosols, PM2.5. In particular, we will be using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. In addition, we will include the simulations results from a CTM, LOTOS-EUROS, as input data to the LSTM network to improve the performance of the neural network. One of the main drawbacks of the LSTM approach is that whenever the PM2.5 concentration changes a lot, the predictions made by the LSTM network take some time to change as well, causing a visible time delay when looking at the measurements and predictions in the same time series plot. We will also try a simpler type of neural network, a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and compare its performance to that of LSTM. We found that using the simulation data does indeed improve the LSTM network. Not only in terms of the loss function used by the neural network and, but in particular in the amount gross overestimations by the network, which we use to quantify the LSTM time delay problem. We also found that FNN outperforms the LSTM approach, in particular on samples of high PM2.5 concentrations, which we argue is primarily caused by a low amount of samples in our dataset.","PM2.5 predictions; LSTM; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last decade, several 3D concrete printing techniques have been developed and extensive research has been conducted on suitable concrete mixes, the printing process and the material and mechanical properties of the finished product. However, certain challenges have remained unresolved. Two of these challenges are the low tensile strength and the limited ductility of the printed concrete. As concrete is a brittle material that is weak in tension, traditional structural concrete elements make use of steel reinforcement to ensure tensile strength. The incorporated steel rebars are designed to take over the tensile stress when the concrete cracks. With the linear elastic and eventually plastic behaviour of steel in tension, the steel provides a ductile behaviour to the rein- forced concrete. This ductile behaviour is required to comply with modern building regulations, as it ensures structural integrity and safety by timely warning in case of overload. However, for printed concrete the incorporation of steel rebar reinforcement is not evident.<br/>The use of Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) in the field of digital concrete printing is one of the many possible ways to incorporate reinforcement into printed structural concrete elements. However, just like regular printable concrete, the bond between subsequently printed layers has shown to be a point of concern. The research presented in this master thesis focusses on the interlayer bond of these printable SHCC’s and more specifically on developing improvement methods for this interlayer bond. To better comprehend the origins of problem a thorough literature study was performed on the following topics: printing facilities, 3d printing compatible mix designs, (printable) SHCC, anisotropy and research on related interlayer bond improvement methods. On the basis hereof an experimental research was designed and conducted on various methods unrelated to the SHCC mixture and their effect on the interlayer bond. The methods can be divided in three groups: nozzle types, surface modification by brushes and incorporation of vertical steel reinforcement. In total 7 parameters were designed and tested: three nozzles, two brushes and two steel reinforcements. Tensile interlayer bond tests were performed to assess the influence of the parameters on the interlayer bond strength. To make sure that the overall strain hardening capacities of the material were not negatively influenced by the interlayer bond improvement methods the research also included compressive tests in two directions and uni-axial tensile tests parallel to the printing direction. Finally, the research was extended with a concise CT scan analysis on porosity and reinforcement bonding. Results show that the type of nozzle has significant influence on all mechanical properties. Sur- face modification by brushes tend to result in SHCC elements that have higher interlayer bond, but a reduced strain-hardening capacity. Specimens with interlayer steel reinforcement completely lose strain-hardening capacity in printing direction. In general, it is concluded that there is potential in designing methods to improve the interlayer bond of printed SHCC.","3D Concrete Printing; Strain hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC); Interlayer Bond; Tensile strain capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Requests may share a vehicle and may be transferred from one vehicle to another at any node during their journey. In this thesis, we describe a heuristic solving moderate to large instances of the static heterogeneous DARP-T in which the requests have demanding time constraints. The heuristic builds a solution in a constructive greedy randomized procedure and subsequently improves it with a destroy and repair procedure. The heuristic is tested on instances we randomly generated containing up to 1000 requests traveling between any two of the 100 most populated cities in the Netherlands inside a four-hour timescale.

This master thesis specifically focuses on the buildings because it is uncertain which adaptations are necessary to ensure thermal comfort when the supply temperature decreases. Especially in existing buildings, since they were originally designed for high operating temperatures. A case study was conducted by studying the performance of a non-residential building under different simulated scenarios to enable lower operating temperatures in the heating network. The objectives of the research are two: 1) to develop of a protocol for data collection and selection of promising adaptations that facilitates a case study on this topic and 2) to compare the observed effects of the different possible adaptations on the required operating temperatures in this case study with the results of the few other studies available. The most interesting results derived from the case study are that it is possible to lower the peak power, and thus the operating temperatures, in the current situation of the selected building, without any adaptation, from 78/70oC to 63/55oC. Assuming that the mass flow is decreased in order to achieve a bigger temperature difference between supply and return, operating temperatures can be 70/50oC. Mass flow control through radiators should then be implemented in order to obtain the lowest possible return temperature for a given supply temperature. During the implementation phase of the geothermal project, the implications of this measure need to be studied. When heat losses are small, smart settings in the building management system prove successful to lower the supply temperature further. In the controls and operation scenarios, adjusting the room temperature setpoints and the heating schedules enables even lower supply and return temperatures, 50/35oC. In old, poorly insulated buildings, minimal renovations in the buildings’ envelope are crucial (and often sufficient) to enable low temperature heating. When the building without renovations was simulated, it was not possible to lower the operating temperatures; instead, the required temperature increased to 90/70oC.<br/>Changes in the energy system, such as the installation of radiators designed for lower temperature heating, also enable supply and return temperatures of 50/35oC. The case study building has a ventilation system with heat recovery and pre-heating of air to 19oC. A scenario is simulated with a system with only heat recovery. The ventilation air is introduced in the room at lower temperatures, and the heating system takes over the heat demand. For the same operating temperatures, 70/50oC, the heat recovery scenario suffers a decrease in the thermal comfort. Seeing the effect of the heating through ventilation air in lowering the supply and return temperatures, a central ventilation system with heat recovery and pre-heating that can operate at low temperatures can represent a good alternative to other decentralised adaptations in the energy system, such as changing radiators. The protocol for data collection and selection of promising adaptations created during this research facilitates the first stages of a case study, by providing an inventory of the main elements for the data collection and their implication in lowering the operating temperatures in the heating network. It also presents a list of possible adaptations to enable low temperature heating. Future case studies could focus on fixing thresholds for the properties of the envelope that limit the lowering of the supply and return temperature. Further research could also continue exploring the optimisation of schedules and room temperature settings to lower the temperatures in the heating network even more, considering the possibility to use the thermal mass of the building as passive storage. Generalisations from case study findings are necessary to start developing one common standardised procedure, with recommended tools and guidelines for simulation as well as practical tests. The standard procedure at building level ought to be included as part of a holistic district level and building level approach in order to facilitate the transition to more efficient and sustainable heating networks.","geothermal energy; low temperature heating; Building renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A simulation model is created to look at the influence of different aspects of such an Automated Guided Vehicles system. The model uses several design parameters and KPIs to determine the level of influence. Important aspects of this research are: the charging process of the AGVs, influence on pick-up points (parcel collection) and drop-off points (parcel destinations) and multiple types of AGVs on the same map. The AGVs will be modelled by an A* algorithm and uses grid-routing (either X or Y -movement at the same time). These kind of AGVs are controlled by a centralized robot control system. The task allocation the AGVs is done by a market- auction-based algorithm. <br/><br/>The first test set consists of a map of 1000m2 to operate at a throughput of at least 1600 parcels/hour. Here the placement of the pick-up points on all sides of the map is more efficient than on either one or two sides. Though the placement of two sides is further used as it is a more probable solution due to the use of large truck-bays and smaller vans in terms of a parcel sortation center. A linearity is found when adding more AGVs to the system. This is in between 5-50 AGVs for the 6 and 8 pick-up points with a ratio of 44.62 parcels/hour per additional AGV. Linearity is decreased due to more queueing and re-routing by congestions to 39.86 parcels/hour per additional AGV for 10 and 12 pick-up points. The charging process reduces the throughput with at least 7.54 % on a 16 hour simulation run. This is with a ratio of 5.71 AGVs per charging point. Using a higher ratio leads to AGVs shutting down due to low battery charge states.<br/><br/>Another test case is analysed with a 3000m2 area and the demand of achieving a throughput of at least 6000 parcels/hour. This is achieved by using 170 AGVs on a width of 75m and a length of 40m area. Even a small analysis is done in the use of 6 kg and 32 kg AGVs on the same working area. From which, a throughput of 1000 parcels/hour is gained by using 15 6 kg AGVs and 25 32 kg AGVs. The throughput is lower compared to using 40 32 kg AGVs: 1400 parcels/hour. Loss in efficiency could be considered compensated by the reduction in terms of AGV purchase costs.<br/><br/>This research has no optimization process, more potential is possible if an optimization is done with a more elaborate/complete (design) plan. This optimization could lead to more efficiency and more insights of an AGV parcel sortation system. Finally the possibilities of multiple types of AGVs on one map can be further investigated, with additional task allocation schemes or a more elaborate research in the pick-up points process.<br","AGVS; parcel sortation system; multi-type agv; agv charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It was found that the qualitative behaviour from the MPM model and the experiments were in agreement but the quantitative behaviour showed some discrepancies. These discrepancies could be caused by the fact that, in the MCSS model, the stiffness is constant and independent of stress which it is not in reality.

As a consequence, valuable information is hard and expensive to acquire. This thesis proposes to study the surface precipitation phenomenon as an easier alternative to understand creep-cavity precipitation. Surface precipitation have only been studied in binary steels, therefore, the thesis focuses on the influence of the addition of a second self-healing element by studying the time evolution of gold tungsten containing iron based steels.

Such spaces are often referred to as shared spaces and can often be seen in public areas near train stations, shopping streets and educational institutions. Such spaces are said to enhance safety and resolve spatial limitations of the space while the users are seen to exhibit interesting and complex behaviours as they freely interact with different modes approaching from various directions. This creates a need to collect data and understand the behaviour of people within such spaces. <br/>Many studies focusing on shared space interactions are limited by the current methods of data collection and data extraction. Other studies on people movement also face similar issues. Current data extraction approaches using cameras include repetitive and labour-intensive tasks which makes them costly and inefficient. Thus, this study focuses on automating the data extraction approach to obtain the ground-plane trajectories of people using the data recorded from a 3D-stereo vision camera. The data processing framework was divided into three main stages, (i) agent detection, (ii) ground-plane representation and (iii) agent tracking. The agent detection uses a neural-network-based detection model to detect people on the visual video which is then paired with the depth data to represent people on the ground plane. Each person is represented as a single point on the ground plane for every frame of the video. These points were then inputted into a tracking model to provides trajectories of people on the ground plane. Overall, this research integrates the recent state-of-the-art technologies into a single framework to automate the data extraction process and tests this framework in a real-world setting (behind the Amsterdam central station’s shared space area). For each stage, the advantages, challenge and recommendation for further improvements have been made. By automating the data processing of real-world datasets (including pedestrians and cyclists), This study reduces the cost and provides an easy way to collect and process data on real-world movements of pedestrians and cyclists. This will encourage urban planners to better understand people’s movement within their spaces and facilitate data-driven design approaches in the future.","Pedestrian; Neural Networks; stereo camera; object detection; Object Tracking; Cyclists; Shared space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous real-world problems can be modeled as MILPs, such as production planning, scheduling, network design optimization and many more. MILPs are, in fact, NP-hard. State-of-the-art solvers use the branch-and-bound algorithm, an exact method that, in combination with a diverse mixture of heuristics, can tackle a fair range of practical problems. This algorithm sequentially partitions the search space using linear relaxations, thus creating a search tree. The exploration ends only when a solution, together with its proof of optimality, is found. The tree’s size can vary dramatically depending on the approach that is used to create it and explore it. One of the most influential decision-making strategies within the branch-and-bound algorithm is the branching rule, i.e., the criterion that is used to subdivide the search space. Currently, there is no mathematical understanding of this complex process. For this reason, all widely accepted branching rules are based on hand-crafted strategies which have been shown to perform well in practice. The work presented in this report is part of a blossoming line of research in the intersection of Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning. Specifically, we take further steps in the direction of branching rule discovery through machine learning techniques. In contrast to previously proposed methods which relied on supervised learning, we take the novel approach of leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Our goal is to achieve a data-driven acceleration of the tree search. In this thesis, we lay the fundamental groundwork for the integration of RL into the branch-and-bound process.

Machine replacement is a complex investment decision that requires the estimation of future cash flows and other parameters. The non-deterministic character of future cash flows has given rise to stochastic models, that take into account this uncertainty. This study has applied a theoretical stochastic asset replacement model in practice. It was found that the stochastic replacement model can be used on real data by performing a weighted least squares (WLS) regression. Decision-makers should however be aware of the model assumptions and limitations of the model. The replacement decision-making process can be automated using a Python script that is provided in this study. However, the CMMS that was used in the case study needs to be upgraded to have additional features. When one wants to perform an analysis of assets on a system level, the expected replacement year value can be used. Until now, the probability distribution of the expected replacement year had to be computed by means of Monte Carlo simulation. In this report, a closed form solution is used for the expected replacement year distribution when operating cost follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). With this contribution, decision-makers in engineering asset management now have the opportunity to rapidly analyse and perform probabilistic computations on the expected economic life of deteriorating machinery on system levels, such as geographic systems or weather systems. As only few studies on stochastic asset replacement are empirical, a second important contribution of this study is the application of the model in a case study. The case study concerns HVAC systems of petrol stations in the Netherlands. The paper describes how to perform a weighted least squares (WLS) regression so that model parameters can be easily estimated for real cases.

Furthermore to show what is the added value of the hydrodynamic input used in time domain investigations using 2 different integration schemes. Ultimately identify what is the impact on the mooring arrangements and what it needs to be done to ensure safe offloading operations.<br/>During the offloading process (18 to 24 hours), the transfer equipment needs to accommodate the relative motions between the two vessels. There are several parameters which might influence the operations, which are dependent on the location (i.e. environmental conditions) and on the mooring system (i.e. vessels size, draft, mooring arrangements, etc.). <br/>The side-by-side mooring system analyzed consists of a turret moored FLNG and various size of off-take carriers. A sensitivity analysis is done with respect to the physical parameters (i.e ship dimensions, loading conditions and separation distance) and modelling parameters (i.e parameters dependent on damping factor) in order to determine the effects on the first and second order quantities using frequency domain analysis. This represents the input for time domain numerical investigations in order to assess the relative motions and line tensions under certain environmental conditions.<br/>It is known that the diffraction-radiation tools overestimate the results in the gap region. This is an effect of using potential flow which do not count for viscous effects. To overcome this problem and to describe in a realistic mode, multiple methods or numerical techniques has been proposed. With this regard a detailed numerical investigation has been carried out to conclude what is the impact of varying the dissipation factor (i.e between 0 and 0.4) on first and second order quantities.<br/>Traditionally, the relative motions are determined using experimental tests which might be time-consuming. In particular for sensitivity analysis, numerical investigations are preferred in order to shape a main conclusion. Ultimately some of the results can be validated thorough experiments.<br/>The hydrodynamic interaction revealed important aspects, especially with respect to the off-take carrier. If the carrier is smaller the impact is higher due to the presence of the FLNG. Such that the carrier rolls significantly when there are head or following seas. Furthermore decrease in heave motion of the FLNG at the resonance frequency due to the roll of the carrier has been noticed. The same phenomena occur for heave of the carrier. Thus, this represents a strong coupling between heave-roll motion of the two vessels. Another important aspect revealed is with the respect to the shielding effects under beam conditions. In general FLNG is slightly influenced by the presence of the carrier. In particular, it can be noticed only when it is in ballast condition due to the fact that the draft and thus the displacement of the carrier is considerably higher. <br/>The sensitivity analysis points out that the modelling parameters (i.e dissipation factor) does hardly influence the response of the vessels even if it is considered or not. On the other hand drift forces are highly dependent on these parameters as a consequence of sharp changes of the wave elevations between the vessels. Such that if there is no dissipation factor to damp the wave elevation the resulted forces are extremely high compare to the cases where the dissipation factor is different than 0. This occurs only at the wave gap resonance and towards higher frequency region when diffraction effects are important. This is emphasized by the time domain analysis which prove that under the sea-states close to the gap resonance the lines and fenders tension reaches extreme magnitudes. Outside the gap resonance the relative motions and tensions are not influenced by the variation of the dissipation factor.<br/>The moored system (i.e FLNG-LNGC or FLNG-LPGC) is governed relatively by long crested waves. Thus it is expected to have higher line loads under these sea-states. The actual mooring design shows that under squall conditions (i.e Tp of 14s) the mooring lines exceeds the safe working limit for the FLNG-LNGC, while for FLNG-LPGC exceeds the minimum breaking load. In terms of relative motions for the same environmental conditions, the criteria is not satisfied. <br/>The proposed optimization of the mooring lines does bring reduction in the mooring line tensions, but not enough to drop below safe working limit for FLNG-LPGC configuration. On the other hand for FLNG-LNGC, the line tension is within the limits, but the relative motions still exceeds the criteria. Therefore choosing the optimum mooring configuration is a trade-off between line stiffness and location of the connection points of the mooring lines which sometimes may lead to unpractical solutions. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-31","","","","","",""

This gentrification is initiated and facilitated by the private developer and the local authority and causes indirect displaces of the original residents out of their neighbourhood and out of the city. In order to cope with displacement, this research aims towards more inclusivity in London and explores how this inclusive urban development can be supported in the London urban planning system.

This Neighbourhood Planning approach is explored as tool to implement inclusive urban development in the London planning system resulting in an inclusive derivative of the Neighbourhood Plan; the Inclusive Neighbourhood Plan. The Inclusive Neighbourhood Plan stimulate and encourage inclusive urban development in areas with high risk of gentrification and comes with a an ‘Inclusive Pattern’ toolbox and a clear and understandable ‘step-by-step roadmap’ to make a faster and stronger Inclusive Neighbourhood Plan (see booklet B).

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Within the coming years it is expected that PV installations could be established on every possible surface and terrain, within the urban environment. Due to the complex morphology of buildings in urban environments,systems will likely be more susceptible to partial shading compared to other conventional PV systems. In particular bifacial PV modules are highly susceptible to shading since they rely on irradiance on both the front and the back surface. To better estimate the irradiance received by such systems, particularly in urban environments, much research is conducted to develop fast and accurate simulation tools. The research described in this report investigated the different simulation frameworks that have been developed for modeling bi-facial PV systems, and develop a new simulation framework capable of simulating irradiance within urban environments. Available models capable of simulating rear irradiance differ in input variables considered,simulation time required and accuracy of predictions. Empirical models, for example, can result in inaccurate predictions since not all variables affecting rear irradiance are considered. Only the 3D view factor, back-ward and forward ray tracing methods fulfill the requirements to simulate the backside irradiance/irradiation when the aim is to perform simulations in more complex urban environments. Out of the existing simulation models tested, the backward ray tracing model performed within the Radiance software proved to be the fastest simulation tool for modeling yearly irradiation or a single irradiance measurement incident under free horizon conditions. Time of use (TOU) simulations, however, results in longer simulation time for backward ray tracing performed in Radiance, since a ray tracing simulation at each time instance is required. To calculate the irradiance a receiving surface receives in an urban environment a method is worked out based on view factors and ray casting. Within the software Rhinoceros a CAD design of the surrounding environment is created, while the plug-in Grasshopper is used for the ray casting and mathematical calculations. Through a series of sanity checks, it was determined that the developed methods are reliable for calculating irradiance/irradiation when the aim is to perform simulations in more complex urban environments. It was also identified how different sky models can result in large differences in irradiance simulated. Sky models such as Isotropic, Hay and Davis or simplified Perez underestimates the irradiance, when receiving surfaces are tilted in comparison with the Perez luminance distributed sky model. The model was validated using monitoring station measurements and compared with simulations performed with other ray tracing models. DHI, DNI measurements obtained from the Solys 2 are used for replicating the irradiance measured at the dual-axis and single-axis tracker. Since their orientation was fixed throughout the measurement period they are referred to as POA 1 and POA 2 respectively. With POA 1 and 2 having a 90 and 30 degree tilt respectfully and an azimuth of 67 and 180 degree respectfully. Making POA 1 the front/back side of a typical (bifacial) east-west configuration and POA 2 the front of a tilted (bifacial) module. Two measurement days are considered, a fully overcast day and a clear sunny day. For the overcast day, an relative RMSE value of 23.09% and 11.7% are achieved for POA 1 and 2. For both cases the irradiation was mostly underestimated, considering the negative MBE and positive MAE. On the clear sunny day, relative RMSE values of 20.35% and 5.26% are achieved for POA 1 and 2. The model again mostly underestimates on the sunny day. A simple DHI correction with the factor 1 divided over the SVF at the Solys 2 is performed in order to investigate the impact of potentially corrupted DHI measurements on the irradiance simulations. With relative RMSE value of 19.96% and 5.2% recorded for POA 1 and 2 on the overcast day. While on the sunny day relative RMSE values of 19.38% and 3.77% are achieved for POA 1 and 2 respectively. Only slightly changing the model predictions. When compared to ray tracing models the model performs slightly better than the forward ray tracing model. A possible reason why the forward ray tracing was underestimated was proposed to be due too the small aim area used. However increasing the aim area would require a larger number of rays to maintain the same accuracy which results in longer simulations.Possible improvements to the model could be, adding reflected irradiance term on reflecting surfaces and the Perez luminance distribution sky model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

During these procedures the need can arise to transport tissue. Think of a biopsy or the removal of polyps. This calls for a tool that can transport tissue and is also flexible such that the tool can be introduced via natural occurring body orifices. Currently either suction based techniques or forceps are used for these procedures. However, both show suboptimal behaviour. Friction-based transport, which is based on the egg laying principle of parasitoid wasps, is not prone to these sub-optimal behaviour modes but is not yet used in flexible systems. Methods: A mechanical analysis was conducted to generate an overview of the challenges that arise in flexible friction-based transport. This resulted in a list of requirements based on which possible concept solutions were analysed. Themost promising design for a flexible friction-based transport mechanism has a flexible shaft that consists of a number of wire ropes in combination with ring magnets. This shaft was manufactured and validated by transporting gelatin tissue phantoms with different material properties with the shaft in straight and in a curved position. After validation of the flexible shaft, an ergonomic handle was designed resulting in the final prototype. This final prototype was also tested by transporting gelatin tissue phantoms. Results: From the results can be concluded that the flexible shaft is able to transport tissue phantoms with different material properties while in straight and curved (R=59mm) position. The final prototype is showed that continuous transport was possible from the tip of the flexible shaft to the end of the handle with the shaft in straight and in curved position. The position of the shaft (straight vs. curved) did not result in a significant difference in the transport rate. Discussion and Conclusion: It can be concluded that friction-based transport is possible in a flexible tool. The mean transport rate in straight position ( 2.3 § 0.29 mm/cycle) is comparable to the transport rate of a rigid friction-based transport mechanism with comparable dimensions. This new flexible friction-based transport mechanism shows great potential to be beneficial for a number of medical procedures.","Flexible; Friction-based; Transport; Bio-inspired; Minimally invasive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The government made a turn from all determining body, to a cooperative partner and later even to an organization that’s outsourcing most of the construction and maintenance work to second and third parties. Changing the working methodology requires a change in the contracting strategy. Nowadays, the contract of choice for maintenance used by governmental and semi-governmental organizations is the performance-based maintenance contract (PBMC). There are many risks and important factors that influence the outcome of the use of PBMC in a negative way. Organizations that use them seem to overlook those negative influences and just focus on the potential cost savings. This results to a contract that hasn’t really been updated since it was first introduced. This leaves a situation where the effectiveness of the contract form is less than optimal; the contract does not deliver its full potential and the writers of the contract have no standardized way to approach the PBMC. The goal of thesis is to therefore find a structured way that can assist the contract design teams in making informed decision when drafting a PBMC. In order to find that structured way, the ingredients that would make up the structure had to be found. To achieve that, a literature study was performed in which all the criteria that would influence the outcome of a PBMC where gathered and categorized into five main decision criteria: predictability, plannability, measurability, responsibility and criticality. Next up, the parameters of the PBMC had to be found. These parameters would enable the user of the method to change the way an object would be outsourced based on the five main decision criteria. The parameters that where found are: size/scope, contribution of the contractor and the performance requirements. In order to provide the user with sensible information about a certain object to base their decisions on about the way of outsourcing, a trustworthy and function information gathering tool/method was needed. Within the area of reliability centered maintenance (RCM), the failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) method was found to be very useful to gather the required information to base these decisions on. Another method that was found to be useful was the risk allocation matrix by Brommet. This method was created to give the user insight in possible outsourcing and payment solutions for DBFM contracts, but a redesign of the original matrix proved just as useful in making suggestions about outsourcing and payment methods for PBMC. All this information led to the creation of the decision-support method. This method, which contains 7 steps, was created to help contract design teams in making their initial decision about the way a certain object should be outsourced. The first step is designed to find the necessary information and prepare the risk allocation matrix to make it usable for this specific case. Steps 2 to 7 are designed to give a step by step answer on how to interpret each parameter and to reach a decision on how to outsource a certain part of an object. These steps are repeated for every single part of the object until a suggested outsourcing decision is made for every single part. The decision-support method is tested twice on a real case. During these case studies improvements were made to the initial model. Eventually the method is presented during an expert meeting within Rijkswaterstaat and another set of improvements was implemented. It can be concluded that the method can be successful in helping the contract design team is making a PBMC. Both by using the entire method of utilizing parts of it during the contract design process. The method helps the user to think of more options and assists in weighing these different options against each other. Although, the methods needs further testing and can definitely be improved. The potential of a method like this was definitely recognized during the expert meeting. The last part of the thesis is therefore dedicated to the limitations of the method at this time and the future research and improvements that can be made.","performance-based maintenance contracts; PBCM; decision-support method; infrastructure; contracting; outsourcing; Maintenance; reliability-centered maintenance; RCM; FMECA; six-stage model; contribution of the contractor; risk allocation matrix; decision criteria; civil infrastructure; Infrastructure maintenance; Performance requirements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Machine learning is not as much in the spotlight now since the rise of blockchain technology, but the field is still relevant and used widely. The field concerns itself with ‘teaching’ computers to make choices or recognize data by repeating experiments or looking at data, and then making changes to itself to achieve better results. Now consider the field of optimization. It is not as well known outside of the mathematics community but incredibly important nonetheless. It has a miriad of uses: flight scheduling, ambulance placement and route planning are a minimal selection of all the problems that Optimization gets used in. Optimization is about solving problems as quickly and optimally as possible, looking at ways to speed up the process or finding the solution with the lowest cost. Both fields have an extensive range of methods and applications but have not been combined a lot before. This report takes a versatile topic within machine learning, namely deep learning and combines it with a classic problem from Optimization. This model was first proposed in 2017, meaning that is a very young line of research. This report will further explore this crossover and look into the performance and possible applications. There will first be an introduction to both fields to make the report understandable for students from either mathematics or computer sciences faculties. The model will then be established and explained in detail. There will then be time devoted to looking into applications of the model and seeing how they perform in experiments. Lastly the results of the experiments will be discussed and their implications.","Deep Learning; Deep neural networks; Optimization; Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The boundary layer or wake flow of the fuselage is ingested by the propulsor. Previous research shows that ingesting the boundary layer can lead to beneficial savings in terms of power compared to a compared to a non-BLI propulsor. Traditional thrust-bookkeeping methods are not suitable for BLI systems because of the ambiguity between thrust and drag of BLI systems. In order to analyse the performance of such integrated systems the theoretical framework developed by Mark Drela is used: the Power Balance Method (PBM). Furthermore, the classical definition of propulsive efficiency, also named ""Froude"" efficiency, is not valid for these systems, thus a relatively new propulsive efficiency definition is used. The wind tunnel tests were carried at the Low Speed Wind tunnel (LST) from the German-Dutch Wind tunnels (DNW) located in Marknesse. Four different configurations were tested in the wind tunnel: i) isolated propulsor, ii) isolated propulsor including an upstream strut, iii) BLI configuration and iv) Wake Ingestion (WI) configuration. The isolated propulsor, simply a propulsor in free-stream flow, is used as a reference to compare with the BLI system. The unaccelerated condition at which these systems were tested is at Mach number M = 0:176. The mechanical flow power, jet dissipation and propulsive efficiency are quantified experimentally by using a five-hole probe. Other relevant physical parameters are also measured such revolutions per minute (RPM), thrust and body drag. The designed fuselage is axisymmetric simplifying the measurements and computations. The results from the experiment reveal that BLI systems have power savings around 29% 2:9% when using the electrical power as a reference compared to the non-BLI system. For WI the power savings are slightly lower 24% 2:9%. Moreover, the power savings have also been computed using the mechanical flow power, but a larger variance has been observed in the results from 29:25% up to 56:27% for the BLI case. The flow specially at the outlet plane is shown to be asymmetric between the starboard and port sides. Furthermore, the jet dissipation decreases by 27% compared to a non-BLI system. The slow moving wake flow of the fuselage is re-energized leading to a decrease in jet dissipation. The propulsive efficiency increases between 8% to 10% for both BLI and WI configurations compared to the free-stream propulsor.","Boundary layer ingestion; Propulsive efficiency; Wind tunnel testing; Wake ingestion; axisymmetry; ducted fan; five-hole probe; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This report proposes that the resolution can be enhanced by placing a substrate with a film underneath the dipoles. This report specifically looks at the effect on the near and far field using a coupling of the field radiated by the dipole and a guided mode in the film. In an integral over reflected plane waves, in case a guided wave occurs, the integrand has a singularity which has to be dealt with using the Cauchy Principle value technique. Other singularities are dealt with using multiple first order Taylor expansions. With the singularities dealt with, a Matlab function has been constructed that can compute the reflected field of a single dipole. The substrate underneath the dipole has a significant effect on the total field, both in the near and far field areas. Due to the reflection, the polarizability is represented more in the intensity and can be determined more easily. Although the influence of the film on enhancing the resolution requires to investigate to what extent two dipoles can be distinguished better when a film is present, due to lack of time, this report considers the computation of the field of a single dipole only.

In recent years, many commercial wearable devices have been used for recording and supervising motion data information during sports.

This thesis project presents work special related to tennis stroke detection and classification. An automated and comprehensive tennis stroke recognition and classification method based on the inertial measuring unit sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) and machine learning algorithm (Support vector machines) was proposed in this study. Seven tennis players with a different level of tennis skills were tested and recorded using a self-made IMU sensor system with four sensors (forearm, upper arm, trunk, and pelvis). Video footage from Playsight was manually notated as the golden standard for stroke type identification. SVMs was constructed to train the classification model to classify true shots to eight types of tennis strokes from the IMU signals. Across leave-one-out seven-fold cross-validation, the SVMs classification models were trained with data from a single IMU sensor on the forearm and upper arm with the prediction accuracies of 0.69 and 0.70 respectively. And further, both SVMs models were trained by enlarged training data, resulting in improved prediction accuracies of 0.75 and 0.77. Noticeably, the best prediction accuracy was achieved by training the SVMs classification model with fused data from the previous two sensors and with the enlarged training data. The final prediction result was 0.79. Even though there exist deficiencies such as skill level different of subjects, insufficient training datasets which may lead the results of validation and prediction less credible, the IMU sensor and SVMs machine learning algorithm still played well in the tennis stroke classification task. And we expect to have better accuracy results by feeding enough training data and using data-fusion combination of different IMU sensors to the upper extremity to SVMs classification model in future work.","Inertial Measurement Unit; Activity Recognition; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a new technology aiming at converting wind energy by flying crosswind patterns with a tethered aircraft. One of the main challenges of this technology is the launching and retrieving of the aircraft. A promising solution is the use of a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system in the form of multiple electrically driven rotors. Contrary to other approaches, such as a rotational and catapult assisted take-off, no detailed studies on a VTOL system for AWE have been conducted so far. The goal of this research is to investigate the opportunities and limitations of a VTOL system as a take-off system for a rigid-wing AWE system (AWES), by designing and simulating a VTOL system for the AP2, an AWES prototype of Ampyx Power B.V. <br/><br/>The main research question to be answered by this research is how such a VTOL system can be designed. After having conducted a thorough state-of-the-art analysis (aka. literature study) the main research questions remain and are refined as: 1. What VTOL concept is most suitable for AWE applications? and 2. How do the aerodynamic forces of the AWES effect the VTOL system design? These are addressed and thoroughly analyzed in this report.<br/><br/>The proposed and applied design methodology is based on the mass estimation of the VTOL system and its components: motors, battery and rotors. The sizing of the motors and battery is done by calculating the power and energy demand during take-off. Rotor mass is estimated using a statistical model. To calculate the required power, a blade element momentum model (BEM) combined with generalized momentum theory (MT) is used considering both inflow velocity and angle. A flight mechanics model is derived to calculate the required thrust and aircraft attitude. This model considers propulsion, gravity, and aerodynamic forces. <br/><br/>A multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) framework is developed to ensure consistency between the above-mentioned models and to calculate the minimum VTOL system mass for certain wind and operating conditions. A Simulink model of the VTOL system is developed using a multicopter flight path controller and a 2D dynamic model. This simulation model serves as a dynamic feasibility check on the VTOL system design and is used to iterate on assumptions taken in the design model.<br/>One of the main findings of this research is that by tilting the rotor depending on wind and flight conditions the minimum VTOL system mass is obtained. The VTOL system mass is estimated at 4.3 kg at wind speeds below 4 m/s and decreases to a mass of 2.1 kg at 10 m/s wind speed. However, for a fixed rotor tilt of -30 degrees (knee-sitter concept, newly introduced in this report), the VTOL system mass is only 100 grams higher for speeds between 5 and 10 m/s. Because a fixed rotor does not require any tilting mechanism, it can be concluded that this concept is most optimal in terms of mass for a direct take-off approach. For the tail-sitter and quad-plane concepts, the VTOL system mass increases with wind speed.<br/><br/>A dynamic simulation has proved the feasibility of the sizing results for the tail-sitter, quad-plane and the new knee-sitter concept for a wind speed of 5 m/s and 10 m/s and a target elevation angle of 41.8 degrees. These simulations have shown that, under the assumptions of the simulation, the maximum motor power (from sizing model) is sufficient to successfully fulfill the take-off phase. It is found that the maximum motor power is only used to accelerate the rotor initially. It is not required in the transient flight phases. Furthermore, it is found that the additional power and energy, required for acceleration and transient phases is sufficiently low compared to the safety factor of 1.5 which has been taken into account in the preliminary sizing model.<br","AWE; VTOL; multicopter; Take-off and landing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

First, an accurate burnout point location and  velocity of the launch vehicle will facilitate the estimation of its trajectory during the following phases of ballistic flight and the impact location. This has important implications for safety purposes. The first stage of many launcher systems such as the Russian Soyuz or the Chinese Long March rockets commonly impact on land, sometimes on populated areas. Furthermore, the proliferation of suborbital rocket launches presents a hazard if regulations are not properly followed. Therefore, it becomes critical to estimate the impact point of any vehicle that reenters the lower layers of the atmosphere beforehand, during the boost phase, in order to prevent personal and material damage. Second, a critical aspect in any space mission is to insert the payload into the required orbit. An accurate tracking of the launcher system during the boost phase allows carrying out early orbit determination in order to successfully complete the payload insertion. In this Master Thesis, an analysis and performance comparison of different tracking algorithms for launching vehicles during boost (e.g. launcher systems or suborbital rockets) has been carried out. This type of tracking problem has several difficulties that must be overcome. First, the unknown thrust profile – thrust magnitude and orientation – of a launching vehicle makes difficult to develop motion models that can accurately describe its behavior. Second, the observations of the plume of the launching vehicle obtained from two line-of-sight passive sensors located in geostationary satellites are used. The way these observations are obtained does not allow to accurately measuring the initial state and trajectory of the vehicle, complicating the initialization and the trajectory estimation processes of the tracking filters. Finally, the nonlinearities present in the system and measurements models of the tracking filters compel us to devise linearization schemes or the implementation of alternative filtering methods.The work presented in this document has been developed at the Military and  Security department of Airbus Defense and Space, as a continuation of an ongoing project. To solve the aforementioned difficulties of the tracking problem, a tracking system – EKF-Tool – was developed at ADS previous to the start of this Thesis. Nevertheless, this tool shows several limitations that hinder its performance, even preventing from successful tracking. In this Thesis, the limitations and potential areas of improvement of the EKF-Tool have been analyzed. Based on the results of this analysis, an alternative tracking algorithm – PKF-Tool – is introduced with the aim of overcoming the limitations of the EKF-Tool. The tracking performance of both tools has been tested using several indicators: stability, consistency, credibility, accuracy, precision, and versatility. ","tracking; Launch Vehicle; Kalman Filter; Ballistic; Passive Sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-01-16","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Additive manufacturing (AM) or more commonly known as 3D-printing offers a paradigm shift in FGMs and engineering design due to its ability to produce components with complex geometries and functional part optimization. This study aims in investigate the concept of microstructural grading enabled via 3D-printing process and its feasibility to tailor site-specific fatigue behaviour. Non-graded and graded specimens of Inconel 718 featuring a range of microstructural gradients were produced by selective laser melting (SLM). In the current work the grain size, grain orientation and precipitates, resulting in distinctly different properties, were used to develop microstructural gradients. Post-process heat treatment in terms of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and aging was also investigated. Microstructural and elastic properties as well as in-depth fatigue crack growth behaviour were characterised and compared with conventionally manufactured wrought Inconel 718. Fatigue crack growth in FGMs under cyclic loading was investigated via novel experiments and FE approach. Results from homogeneous specimens were used for estimating spatial property distribution and crack-extension effect in the graded specimens. Hence, for the graded material a constant ΔK procedure was designed to investigate the change in crack growth rate as a function of different gradients. Additionally, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Potential Drop (PD) were conducted to validate the constant ΔK tests. It was found that fatigue behaviour of the individual microstructures was primarily affected by the grain size, grain orientation and heat treatment. As opposed to the general trend, fine grained material (range of 10-70 µm) had a better fatigue crack propagation resistance than coarse grained (100 – 500 µm), which was attributed to the high compressive residual stresses developed during the 3D-printing. With respect to the wrought material, the 3D-printed material with fine grains showed higher ΔKth and lower da/dn values. The crack growth rate in the graded material at a constant ΔK was found to change from one microstructure to the other following the same trend as the individual microstructures. The effect of grain orientation was found to significantly affect the crack growth rate, with grains elongated parallel to crack growth showing the larger and more continuous crack growth gradient. Additionally, in the heat treated (HIP+H/T) graded material, the difference in properties between the two gradients was almost entirely diminished, indicating the necessity to optimize heat treatment regimens more suitable for developed herein FGMs. The current study not only delivered fatigue parameters and FE model for various graded and non-graded 3D-printed Inconel 718, but also successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using 3D-printing process to design microstructures and alter the fatigue behaviour in FGMs components.","functionally graded materials; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue; 3D Printing; Selective Laser Melting; Additive Manufacturing; Inconel 718","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-17","","","","","",""

Within Europe one of the biggest impacts of this traffic growth, is an increase of air travel delay. As it happened during the summer of 2018, where demand from aircraft intending to enter an air sector was not complemented with capacity to safely accommodate it. Incentivised by this event, in this article the problem of predicting a class of measures for demand-capacity balancing, known as Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) regulations, is investigated. A Random Forest model was trained on public ATFCM notification messages to predict the amount of ATFCM regulations over different European air sectors for varying prediction horizons. In addition to the predictive model, in this paper a new way to estimate the maximum prediction horizon is proposed. Using the Hurst exponent, the time-scale at which random behaviour is initiated is found. Comparison of the proposed method with the prediction horizon obtained from the largest Lyapunov exponent indicates that the method is a valid technique for estimating the prediction horizon. By extending the prediction horizon of the model, it is found that the proposed method can reasonably estimate the prediction horizon above which prediction accuracy starts to degrade. <br","air transport; demand regulations; tactical phase; machine learning; hurst exponent; prediction horizon; long-range dependence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Laminar airfoils are a promising technology to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses caused by the aerospace industry. The transition scenario in airliners is dominated by stationary crossflow vortices whose evolution is strongly nonlinear. This transition is preceded by the eigenmode growth of instabilities, rise of secondary instabilities and development of turbulent spots that eventually lead to a fully turbulent boundary layer. Exponential growth starts at infinitesimal amplitudes at which linear methods, e.g. the Orr-Sommerfeld or Linear Parabolized Stability Equations (LPSE), can be exploited to assess the growth of instabilities. As the energy of these instabilities increases, interactions become important and a nonlinear method capable of calculating wave-triad interactions should instead be used to correctly predict their evolution. This thesis concerns the development of a tool capable of solving the Nonlinear Parabolized Stability Equations (NPSE) and introduces a new method for the introduction of harmonics during the simulation that follow from nonlinear interactions. This method accounts for nonparallel and nonlinear effects in an Inhomogeneous LPSE (ILPSE) framework by modeling the interactions as a forcing term in this equation. The amplitude of the mode prior to its introduction is modeled via the nonlinear estimation of the growth rate. An investigation in mode introduction schemes proved that the introduction of modes severely affects the results from stability analyses.

This research makes use of basic statistical concepts to obtain reference values for a possible quantification of this uncertainty. The problem used as basis for the analysis is the determination of the hydrostatic pressure which leads to the failure of the central compartment of a Manatee class submarine, by means of non-linear analysis with imperfections included. To generate a set of possible result outcomes, key parameters used in the construction of a model are varied in order to ensure the production of both model-form and solution approximation errors. The parameters varied are four, namely (1) the in-plane integration scheme, (2) the order of the shell elements (3) the small displacements assumption and (4) the mesh size. The produced variation is then grouped in sets related to three different possible analyst’s levels of expertise and the uncertainty is quantified for the data both within and in between groups. The analysis show that only a small uncertainty can be expected in the results from non-linear models constructed by Expert Performers (with the 95th quantile being up to 3.94% larger than the estimated average), but larger scatter is present if outcomes from Advanced Beginners are considered (the maximum 95th quantile in non-linear results is 10.30% larger than the estimated average). If no information is provided on the expertise level of the analyst who produced a model, from comparing the results in between sets, an uncertainty of up to around 12% might be expected for the pressure which induces yield.

This results in a research gap regarding increasing transparency in the reverse SC. This paper investigates an approach to increase transparency in demand by prediction the arrival times of shipments in the reverse SC based on transport times. The transport times from two customers have been collected and analysed. The analysis showed the presence of different transport behaviour depending on the process which included inefficiencies and waste. Based on the analyses different methods to predict the transport time have been formulated and evaluated. The results show two methods superior to the others which are the median and decision tree. Furthermore, the research indicates the accuracy of predictions increases with more available data and stable processes. The results show to be insufficient to accurately predict the majority of the shipments and therefore require further research.","Reverse MRO SC; Aviation; Short term forecasting; Transport time prediction; Arrival time prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

In order to adopt wind energy as a well-established source of renewable energy, the costs of (offshore) wind energy should be lowered. This can be achieved by increasing the energy production or by lowering the maintenance and initial costs. In search of lowering the costs, the wind industry is pushing towards the boundary limits of design. The use of multi-objective design is needed for exploring those limits, for which the field of control and structural engineering get together. Currently, little research is conducted of combining controller and structural design in the wind turbine industry. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of optimizing the support structure design and the controller design into one single optimization routine. The method describes the use of nonsmooth H<sub>∞</sub>-synthesis. The modelling principles of the turbine makes use of different approaches. A simple finite element model of the wind turbine tower is constructed. The wall thickness of the tower sections is extracted as a tunable parameter, through an affine representation of the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). In this thesis, the Controller Structure Optimization (CSO) for the offshore wind turbine combines the design of a load reducing Rotor Speed Controller (RSC) and wall thickness reduction. In theory, the bandwidth of the RSC is limited by the first tower bending mode. Therefore, the bandwidth of the designed controller is chosen well below the first eigenfrequency. It was found that the limitations do not influence the solution. The limitations of the proposed method are bounded by the weight functions, which impose a limit on the performance. Furthermore, it was found that the CSO framework can minimize the wall thickness of the tower elements, and simultaneously design a suitable RSC for tracking a rotor speed. The results are verified in high-fidelity wind turbine model, where the control-relevant subjects are addressed and specified. It was found that by addressing multi-objectives, we can design a controller with rotor tracking abilities and load reducing properties. Hence, the proposed CSO framework, can simultaneously design controllers and alter the structure and thereby increase the overall performance of the system. <br","Offshore Wind Turbines; Control systems; Robust control; Controller Structure Optimization; Sensitivity Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Esposito, R. (graduation committee); Blom, C.B.M.

Cause of these earthquakes is the extraction of natural gas. In this region, most of the building stock comprises out of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. Multiple experimental campaigns are performed since 2014 to investigate the structural integrity of these type of structures. Both static and dynamic, full-scale and smallscale, experiments are executed to identify both in-plane and out-of-plane failure mechanisms. Strengthening, or retrofitting, of these already existing structures, is of interest and different researchers propose multiple techniques. From the literature, it is found that the application of strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) results in the required improved structural performance of the retrofitted masonry. The SHCC material is characterised by high ductility in the range of 3-7%, tight crack widths of around 60 μm and a relatively low fibre content equal to 2% (maximum by volume). In this experimental campaign small-scale, both inplane and out-of-plane (i.e. shear strength and flexural strength, respectively), experiments are performed on masonry samples retrofitted using a single-sided applied SHCC overlay. Different thicknesses of this overlay, masonry surface preparations, and overlay curing conditions are considered. With the help of these experiments the material properties of retrofitted masonry are investigated. From the initial shear strength experiments, it is concluded that the retrofitting approach did not work as intended. Results of all the different specimen examined shows similar capacities to the non-retrofitted masonry triplets. With the help of digital image correlation, it is shown that for all of the retrofitted specimen, the overlay material is not activated during the tests. Additional experiments and numerical simulations are performed to investigate the several parameters possibly influencing these experiments. The bond strength of the interface between the SHCC and the masonry substrate is determined to be too low. This is one of the main factors resulting in the absence of cracks in the retrofitting overlay. Additionally, the high cracking strength of the SHCC mixture considered, and the applied pre-compression, have influenced the cracking behaviour of the retrofitting overlay. Besides the shear strength of the retrofitted masonry material also the flexural strength is investigated with multiple out-of-plane four-point bending tests. Retrofitted masonry beams are used for these experiments. The plain masonry beams are not able to carry their self-weight, therefore all of the additional capacity is accommodated to the applied overlay. The experimental results are governed by shear failure. For eight out of ten specimens debonding of the masonry units is prevalent. Two of the retrofitted masonry beams showed flexural failure. A thicker overlay will result in higher flexural strength. Again, the bond strength between the overlay and the masonry substrate seems to be governing. No numerical analyses are performed to analyse these experiments in more detail. From this research, it is concluded that a single-sided SHCC overlay can be a very attractive method for retrofitting unreinforced masonry. However, both the interfacial bond strength and the material properties of the SHCC material must be taken into account. The bond strength must be sufficiently high, and the cracking strength of the overlay material sufficiently low, for the overlay to be activated. With the help of numerical simplified micro-models, the requirements of both parameters can be estimated.","Strain hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC); Unreinforced Masonry; Retrofitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Model validation tries to answer the question whether the model predicts the behaviour of the physical system sufficiently. This study evaluates if and how a dynamic power system model of the Dutch power grid can be validated using PMU measurements. For this, two approaches to validation of dynamic power system models are compared. They are validation using System Wide Simulation and validation using Hybrid Dynamic Simulation. Both approaches use measurements of disturbances in the power system as a basis for the comparison of the measured and the simulated behaviour of the system. With System Wide Simulation, comparison can be done using measured voltage magnitude, active power flow and reactive power flow. With Hybrid Dynamic Simulation, comparison can be done using measured active power flow and reactive power flow. Identification of model inaccuracies is limited by inaccuracies that are the result of the simulation approach. Inaccuracies are introduced by poor representation of the pre-disturbance operating conditions of the model and poor representation of the disturbance in the simulation. System Wide Simulation is more strongly affected in both cases and is therefore less accurate than Hybrid Dynamic Simulation. System Wide Simulation can be used to gain rough insight into the validity of a model. For accurate model validation and subsequent calibration however, System Wide Simulation falls short, and Hybrid Dynamic Simulation is required. Hybrid Dynamic Simulation however requires PMU measurements to be taken in specifically targeted locations.","power system stability; power system dynamics; model validation; PMU; phasor measurement units; Synchrophasor; System Wide Simulation; Hybrid Dynamic Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

The timing and structure of the controllers are usually designed optimally based on average historical demand patterns at the intersection. Under the premise of performance quality assurance, both fixed-time and vehicle-actuated controllers can accommodate a certain degree of demand fluctuations. As a matter of fact, the demand change can be considerable over the years, which could exceed their capacities in adapting such degree of demand change, and thus the signal controllers should be regularly updated to fit the latest demand. To some extent, how much demand change can be adapted by both types of the signal controllers determines how frequent should the controllers be checked and improved. However, only qualitative comparison of the capabilities in demand adaptation between fixed-time and vehicle-actuated controllers are made in most of existing literatures, according to which vehicle-actuated controllers are expected to have higher capabilities in accommodating demand changes. In this research, a quantitative analysis and comparison were made for the fixed-time and vehicle-actuated controllers at a right-turning channelized intersection under various demand conditions. Since no useful studies could be found to predict the demand changes towards a specific intersection at current phase, the extra demand that could be accommodated by vehicle-actuated controllers were investigated instead. And it is found that the vehicle-actuated controllers can serve a 19% to 204% of more demand compared with the fixed-time controllers in scenarios defined in this research, according to which the redesign frequency can be further determined for both types of controllers to maintain comparable operation performance.","Traffic Signal Control; Fixed-time Control; Vehicle-actuated Control; Redesign Frequency; Isolated Intersection","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","CIE5050-09",""

It was found that flow for both phases is easiest near the percolation threshold, where water progresses through a set of isolated clusters and gas has one major cluster that spans the entire lattice. It is predicted that liquid bridging is most problematic near or in the primary gas backbone due to lamellae mobilization.

In an effort to accelerate the energy transition a group of policy-maker from McKinsey developed a tool named marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) capable of illustrating the relationship between the cost-effectiveness of different abatement options and the total amount of GHG abated (Bockel et al, 2011). Even though the MACC has become popular for government reports and environmental analysis of abatement options through their abatement cost it lacks to analyze the options beyond the financial perspective. In 2016, Chappin published the introduction of the Y-factor method with the aim of solving the why factors that were hampering the pursual of implementing the abatement options. The method relies on the use of grading each abatement option in a scale of 0 to 2 through 12 socio-technical factors that are divided into four categories: multi-actor complexities, physical embeddedness, behavior and the cost &amp; financing. This new method is a more robust approach than the MACC and it helps in providing new insights across different categories. The Y-factor is a relatively new method that has been furtherly assessed by Arensman (2018), Cheung (2018), and Soana (2018). This master thesis follows in the method of the Y-factor and goes a step beyond in proving its reliability when applied to a case-study, in this case applying the Y-factor for Mexico. The main research question is What emission abatement curve can capture the complexity of reducing GHG emissions in Mexico? For the construction of the emission abatement curve this research focuses on 20 abatement options that are relevant for the country. These options were selected through a process to provide diversity in the sector and reflect the reality of the biggest GHG emissions contributors of the country (energy creation, transport sector). Through a preliminary scoring based on literature review including government reports, scientific and news articles a preliminary Y-curve was constructed. The validation of the emission abatement curve was provided by contacting different experts in the country. This validation relied on interviews made to provide insights of the current situation of Mexico further understand what is hampering the implementation of the abatement options. To remove subjectivity for the validation each of the abatement option was graded by 2 or 3 experts’ interviews reducing personal bias and increasing result accuracy. The validated Y-curve results had interesting insights when comparing to the initial MACC developed by the US government for the low emission development program in Mexico and presented by Rebolledo et al (2016). The energy sector had the highest scoring abatement options on average which included renewable options such as Geothermal, Wind-Energy, Small Hydroelectric while also including fossil-based options that have become a priority for the new government administration Coal CCS for new plants. From all the options the highest ranked option according to the Y-score was the Coal CCS retrofit with a score of 22 out of 24. This means that this is the least convenient 6 option to be pursued according to the grading across the four categories. It was also interesting to note how the transport sector with options such as modal shift freight transport, transport policy changes, hybrid and electric vehicles, among others conform a highly diverse group each with different goals and widely different factors that obstruct its pursual. A key area is how the transport sector is dependent on a lot of different actors for any structural change or policy implementation meaning that these options are some of the most difficult to follow specially in the cities. Results of the Forestry &amp; Agriculture cluster can be misleading if only the McKinsey data is available given the peculiarities of how the plot areas of land are owned in the country making it a unique situation that is hard to conceive in different countries. A general link between Mexico’s current affairs and the abatement options selected are explained to provide valuable information on the country and possible pitfalls when dealing with similarities in other countries. At the end of the report a recapitulation of the process and the main steps of the thesis are provided, as well as, concluding remarks for each chapter are mentioned to highlight the most important aspects of them. Valuable suggestions given by the interviewees on how to improve the Y-factor method have been highlighted, as well as the limitations of the study and how it can be improved. The societal and academic relevance of the project, as well as the limitations of the study are addressed and given an opinion of the added value of using the Y-factor for future research purposes is given. Concluding, the Y-factor approach adds value to decision makers and serves its main purpose of understanding the factors that hamper the abatement option implementation while also helps in unravel the complexity associated with such abatement options to a better overall understanding.","Y-factor; energy transition; GHG emissions reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(ZEF) is a start-up who aims to design a sustainable methanol production micro-plant, using solely air and solar energy as an input. A subsystem that has yet to be designed just upstream of the alkaline (KOH) electrolyser, is the so-called degasser. The purpose of the degasser is to remove a residue of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) present in the feed water for the KOH electrolyser. The presence of this CO<sub>2</sub> is caused by it being absorbed together with water, in the direct air capture (DAC) subsystem. It is important that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the feed water is minimized since it is known to react with KOH, decreasing the performance of the reactor. The aim of this thesis, is to develop a method to minimize the concentration of carbon dioxide in the feed water, which is feasible for the ZEF micro-plant. A literature study was performed based on which is concluded on the feasibility of three different degassing methods: membrane permeation, distillation and stripping. It was decided to further investigate the efficiency of a stripping device, by making a numerical model using Matlab and validating this model with experiments. For the base case model, a bubble column in the shape of a cylindrical pipe operating in the Taylor flow regime was used. The bubble column had an inner diameter of 6 mm. Operation at steady state, at a pressure of 50 bar and a temperature of 50 °C, resulted in a required length of 65 cm. It should be noted here, that the liquid flow rate was equal to that aimed by ZEF, but the gas flow rate was about three times as high. A sensitivity analysis was performed in which the temperature of the system was changed. As expected, the required length of the bubble column decreases with increasing temperature. A sensitivity analysis on the influence of recirculation of the gas phase, showed that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the gas phase is of no limiting factor in the stripping process, so that with the gas flow rate of ZEF, recirculation can be an interesting option. Different setups were tested to validate the model with. However, since none of them showed a steady state behaviour, the model could not be validated with these experiments. The setup was changed slightly in order to perform batch experiments, so that the continuous system (based on theory) could be compared with the batch system (based on experiments). Results showed that both the batch and continuous mode are feasible for the ZEF micro-plant.","Taylor bubble flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-15","","","","","",""

A big potential for saving mass can be found in part joining. Currently, most parts are joined by mechanical fastening. However, mechanical fastening requires labor intensive work and results in a weight increase especially for composite parts that, due to the mass saving they allow, are increasingly used in the aerospace industry. Induction welding of thermoplastic composites shows great potential to limit this mass increase and it can vastly reduce the amount of work that is needed to join parts while improving the working conditions on the shop-floor. A characteristic of induction welding is that the heating rate goes down with increasing distance to the inductor. This often leads to fully melting the top plate across its thickness. This results in an imperfect weld as pressure is required for proper consolidation which leads to a damaged surface. Therefore, the challenge is to find a way to selectively heat the weld zone, without using a metallic susceptor that can lead to an unreliable joint. Accordingly, the aim of this thesis is to find how induction heating can be used to selectively heat the weld zone of multidirectional carbon fiber laminates with and without using a carbon fiber susceptor material. To this end, three sub-questions are answered. Can specific plies in multidirectional CFRP laminates be heated by manipulation of the magnetic field? Can a carbon fiber material be used as susceptor material in order to increase the temperature at the weld interface? Is it possible to weld parts with lightning strike protection? Using an infrared camera and fine wire thermocouples of type E to measure the temperature profile across the thickness of the test parts, a dependency of the heating rate on the orientation of the magnetic field was discovered for all parts that were tested. This dependency can indeed be used to selectively heat plies in a specific orientation within the laminate. Also, the possibility of using susceptors made of carbon fiber to increase the temperature at the weld zone was shown. To this end, susceptors were made of fabrics and of thin-ply material. Further research has to be done to improve these susceptor materials. An increase of the heating benefit they deliver could enable them to be used for more efficient welds in the future. Finally, by clamping lightning strike protection (LSP) onto the test parts, the temperature profile of parts with LSP was imitated. Striking was that the heat generated in the two CFRP parts went down when the LSP was added. No peak temperature was measured at the side of the LSP but this could probably be explained by the poor contact between the thermocouple in the test part and the LSP. It is recommended to further investigate this topic by consolidation of the LSP onto the test part.","Induction welding; Magnetic field orientation; Carbon fiber susceptor; Lightning strike protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Numerical methods tend to be more conservative when analysing soil behaviour during deep excavation, whereas for practical and economic reasons this is not favoured. The inverse analysis allows for the identification of the soil parameter set that can provide the measurements observed in the monitoring when it is applied in the model. When performed in a probabilistic concept, it reduces parameter uncertainty and enables the stochastic prediction of future soil behaviour. In this thesis, capabilities and limitations of difference advanced constitutive models are investigated. The Generalized Hardening Soil Small strain model (GHS) presents a positive aspect in modelling soil behaviour during deep excavation with its various stress/strain dependency settings. Because of the uncertainties originating from the size of the domain and limitations of site investigation, the soil parameters can only be shown as probability distributions. In order to make that distribution more accurate, comparative selection of several inverse analysis optimization algorithms is performed. Thereafter, choice of the relevant parameters is done based on the conducted sensitivity analysis and engineering judgement. Having the most competitive optimization approach selected, remote scripting with Python is used to utilise Finite Element (FE) modelling in the 2D Plaxis software. The input parameters are iteratively updated with response observation (diaphragm wall deflections) using the Ensemble Kalman filter optimisation algorithm based on a chosen excavation stage. The re-calibrated parameters are checked with the data, which was used to create synthetic measurements made using the same FE, to perform reliability assessment of the developed Python-based algorithm and investigate its capabilities and limitations. The further development of the presented optimisation method is expected to increase certainty in setting alarm thresholds in the applications of the Observational Method.","Optimisation Algorithms; Kalman Filter; Ensemble Kalman filter; Plaxis 2D; Python; Inverse Analysis; Material Model; Deep excavation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Dutch government has set goals to limit the primary extraction by half in 2030 and to be a fully circular economy by 2050. To be able to achieve this without reducing our standards of living, the only way is to extract the materials we need from the urban mine. Knowledge of the urban mine for the vehicles in our society is incomplete, and this research aims to contribute by studying the material stocks and flows for the most important road, rail, air, and water vehicles by weight in the Netherlands. An inventory is made for the materials in these vehicles between 2000 and 2017, and several sustainable transportation developments are identified which influence the material composition: (i) vehicle electrification, (ii) more effective utilisation of the vehicle fleet, (iii) lifespan elongation for vehicles, (iv) capacity enlargement of vehicles, and (v) modal shift towards low emission modes of transportation. These developments are categorised according to typologies from socio-technical transitions analysis which allow for the quantitative results to be placed in a socio-technical context and to be better interpreted. These ’transition pathways’ are then compared to a reference pathway. Bottom-up, stock-driven, prospective, dynamic material flow analysis was conducted based on exogenous driving factors describing the required transportation service for passenger-, freight-, sea- and air transportation in passenger-kilometres and ton-kilometres. These driving factors were based on the WLO-low projections for the future of Dutch transportation. Outflow was modelled using Weibull distributions based on statistical data for the demographics of vehicles. The historical stock of materials in vehicles in the Netherlands was found to have grown from 28 megatons in 2000 to 36.3 megatons in 2017. Ships contribute two thirds to total mass, cars a quarter, and the rest is in order of reducing mass: road utility vehicles, bicycles, transit vehicles, and aircraft. Ferrous metals contribute most to the total mass (82%) followed by Polymers (5.6%), Copper (3.4%), and Aluminium (3.4%). A small but important contribution is made by Critical Raw Materials, which only contribute 0.8% but the total mass of 74 thousand tons is significant. Of all studied developments, lifespan elongation reduces the primary material demand most by around 40% and the available material from the urban mine, but vehicle stock size is not influenced. Improving the effective utilisation of vehicles does reduce the stock size significantly (by 20%) and primary material demand is reduced by 35%, whilst the amount of material available from the urban mine is reduced by only 10%. Electrification of the vehicle fleet and vehicle capacity enlargement increases the vehicle stock mass by 11% because of the introduction of heavier vehicles. The primary material demand increases strongly by 43% and the materials available from the urban mine are increased by 35%. Important steps required to continue to develop the understanding of the urban mine for the circular economy, are to interpret which proportion of the material outflows are available for reuse, and for which parts of the inflows secondary materials can replace primary materials. Other important objectives are to expand the knowledge for material content of objects in society, and the knowledge on the lifespan of materials and objects in society, because these limit the interpretation of the results the most.","Urban Mining; Circular Economy; Stock Modelling; Flow Modelling; Material Flow Analysis; Industrial Ecology; Vehicle; Dynamic material flow analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/grimelda/urmive Repository link Repository of thesis research","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

From the overview it was concluded that little information is present about the exact cause of excessive bleeding. Two possible causes were identified, excess pore water pressure in the surrounding soil caused by the pile installation and concrete stability, these are further researched. Comprehensive measurement data of the hydraulic head in an intermediate confined sand layer, during the installation of displacement piles, showed a consistent trend. During the descending phase a large increase in the hydraulic head was measured which can be described by volume displacement in the sand layer. In addition, a cumulative effect in the hydraulic head was found at the start of withdrawal of the temporary casing as the excess pore water pressure, resulting from the volume displacement, was not fully dissipated. During withdrawal, two additional pore water pressure increments can be distinguished. The direct increase starting from the onset of withdrawal has been interpreted as being caused by the reaction force of the machine on the ground resulting from the pull up force on the casing necessary to get the casing in motion. <br/>Unfortunately, no conclusive cause was found for the second increase in hydraulic head regarding the processes that take place during withdrawal. This calls for further research as the hydraulic head after withdrawal will influence the interaction between the fresh concrete and the surrounding soil. Then a literature study on (excessive) bleeding in cement based materials was performed to assess how concrete stability influences the initiation of bleeding. The literature study showed that in order to capture the full bleeding phenomenon three processes can be distinguished.

More than a third of this group are refugees, often living in refugee camps.  NGOs try to deliver all necessary aid to these camps, while facing limited access and resources. Therefore, they want to optimize the results of the aid they deliver. The structure and layout of a refugee camp cannot simply be adapted, as it has evolved over time. However, this path-dependent nature of the camp expansion has not been studied from the perspective of the refugees yet. This study combines the process of camp expansion with the location decisions for healthcare facilities in expanding refugee camps. In an agent-based model, the camp expansion is simulated according to the settling preferences of refugees. These preferences are proximity to roads, to other shelters and to healthcare facilities. The locations of healthcare facilities are determined using two optimization algorithms. By using predictions about future camp expansion based on the settling preferences of refugees, the healthcare providers can adapt their locating decisions to the settling preferences of refugees. Simultaneously, the placement of new facilities designed for expected camp expansion can affect the settling choices of refugees. The success of the optimization is measured in the resulting accessibility of healthcare facilities in refugee camps. First, it is found that the facility location optimization improves when future camp expansion is taken into account, if refugees can choose a location to settle upon arrival in a refugee camp. On the contrary, if refugees cannot choose a location to settle, predictions about camp expansion should not be included. Second, in case a space restriction of 45m<sup>2</sup> surface area per person is maintained in a refugee camp, it is recommended to locate healthcare facilities using an algorithm that minimizes the travel distance between refugees and healthcare facilities. However, if the available surface area per person is significantly lower than 45m<sup>2</sup>, it is recommended to locate healthcare facilities in a refugee camp using an algorithm that maximizes the coverage ratio of shelters in the camp. Finally, when shelters are spread evenly over the camp, the possibility to locate healthcare facilities in strategic places enhances. This improves the accessibility of healthcare facilities for all refugees. <br","Facility location models; Refugee camps; Agent-based simulation; Camp expansion; Settling behavior; Path-dependence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Koster, R.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Hyperloop concept is a new method of transportation. Con side ring this, it still has a vast amount of challenges to tackle and overcome. One of these challenges is the boarding security system, on which this research is focused. The Hyperloop is a tube-based transport method. The pods in which passengers travel have to be entered via certain access points, since the tube is in near vacuum state and can not be entered everywhere along its length. To ensure security and safety of the system's users, a boarding security system is required. In this report, the aim is to create the beginnings of a design of such a boarding security system. Several already-existing transportation methods, which can be compared to the Hyperloop in one or a number of ways, were analyzed for their boarding security systems. Their boarding processes, risks and measures were noted. This was done by arranging each of the systems risks, related to boarding security, and combining these with their respective measures, costs and placement. The transportation methods which had the highest risks, also had the most and most extreme measures to combat these respective risks. The Hyperloop is a closed system. This enables it to be considered a high-risk system, mainly because emergency exits and access for help are hard to realize. Another aspect which increases risk, is the high velocity at which the Hyperloop is expected to operate. This high velocity can accelerate and multiply the resulting damage in case an accident happens. The most significant analyzed transportation method (in terms of amount of terrorist countermeasures) was the airplane. At an airport, a combination of cameras, active personnel (such as guards and camera surveillants) and extensive security checks are implemented to maximize security. To custom fit a security system to the Hyperloop, the actual properties of the Hyperloop system itself have to be determined. Therefore, a certain variation of the Hyperloop was chosen out of several to further use in this report. The chosen variation has four key features; the tube is placed above ground surface level, the pods are sized to fit about 20 passengers, the transportation system can be used without reservation and the pods enter a pressurization room (locked and entered by gates) to make it possible for travelers to enter. The risks of this specific system were determined to mostly be hijackings and bombings, this was done by analyzing terrorist attack statistics. Before determining the boarding security system's elements, limitations were set. These limitations limit (and change) the security measures, by implementing other factors that should be considered. This is an important part, since an overflow of security measures can increase overall system costs and therefore degrade user experience. These limitations were costs, time delays and differences in laws and culture per country. Costs were chosen to not be varied, since the overall security costs per ticket price are but a small portion of the expected overall ticket price (about €10 per flight per person for air travel, which will be used as a simplification). Two significant limitations are time delays and regional differences. Time delays reduce travel flow. Regional differences, like terror attack probability per nation, influence the required anti-measures. These two limitations are combined to create two versions of the boarding system. One version is automated, which costs less time but is possibly less safe. The other one is a partially automated system with manual additions, which takes up more workforce and time (e.g. by also performing checks by hand) but the re fore increases security by broadening the overall security process. The implemented system will depend on the specific region. The boarding security system consists out of the following components: - Luggage and passenger check, which includes metal detectors, x-ray scanners and possibly explosive detection devices. - A well-ordered, structure d boarding procedure which enhances the capability to maintain an overall view on what is happening and what the passengers are doing. This means a mostly guided system, initiated once the traveler enters the station facility. The guiding of the travelers is to mainly happen via the station's layout; the positioning of gates and rails, which indicate the path passengers are to follow. This makes it easier for the personnel to spot extraordinary activities. - A team of personnel to inspect the camera footage, perform checks in manual regions and operate as security guards and first-aid helpers. As one can tell, the defined boarding security system above seems to resemble that of an airport. However, a key difference is that air flights are reserved. The Hyperloop, according to the assumed system used in this report, is not. Therefore, the 3rd point of the boarding security system (well­ordered boarding procedure) is of great importance. By increasing the structure in the system, it becomes easier for the personnel to focus on their respective function which can increase efficiency.","Hyperloop security","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

After the release of Bitcoin in 2008, many developments have significantly increased the performance of distributed ledger technology. Nevertheless, the first truly scalable ledger has yet to be deployed. All of them have issues with scaling in either the throughput, the number of nodes which can validate transaction or both. The concept behind a distributed ledger is that the integrity of the ledger is a shared responsibility. However, as soon as new technology emerges, also misuse surfaces, especially if there are financial gains involved. The general solution, to prevent such abuse, in distributed ledger technology is through the use of global consensus. If the majority of a network is honest, and we require a majority vote on the validity of a transaction, no malicious transactions will succeed. A downside of requiring a majority vote is that every node eligible to vote must contain full knowledge on all previous transactions. This work argues that the requirement of global consensus is a major limiting factor when it comes to the scalability of current ledgers. The goal of this work is to design a scalable distributed ledger whose security does not rely on global consensus. It proposes a novel algorithm that guarantees security, even under adversarial attack, by up to a third of the network exhibiting byzantine behavior. It does so using Trustchain, a pair-wise ledger designed by the Delft University of Technology, and `Fair Witness Selection Protocol', a newly designed publicly verifiable witness selection algorithm with an indicated message and communication complexity of $O(log^\star(n))$. A mathematical lower-bound is given on the security level of the algorithm, and the security is reduced to the security of the underlying hash function. Several experiments were executed on the DAS-5 supercomputer to confirm the scalability of this work. These experiments show that the throughput of the network scales linearly, and has been tested up to 2500 nodes (simultaneously acting as validators and clients). To the best of the author's knowledge, it is the only ledger that has no theoretical limits on the number of clients, number of validators, or throughput. A peak-throughput of 7025 tx/s has been observed at a network size of 280 nodes. Furthermore, the total transaction time remained roughly constant at about 15 milliseconds regardless of the network size.","distributed ledger technology; Security; Global consensus; scalability; trustchain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results suggest that security and privacy can strongly affect purchase behaviour, under the circumstances that privacy and security related information is available and communicated in an understandable manner that allows consumers to compare devices. Moreover, the results show that a description of security that focuses on gains is more effective in nudging consumers towards buying more secure devices.

(mentor); Hu, Mingming (graduation committee); Vahidi, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2020","The use of concrete, the world’s most applied construction material, has significant environmental impact in its sourcing and end-of-life stages. Closing the concrete loop prevents devalorization of concrete (aggregates) and has environmental benefits. In the European Union, the recently published Green Deal provides additional stimulus to the circular economy ambitions of its member states. In the Netherlands, information systems that store data on material stocks and flows, known as material passport systems, are considered vital in the transition to a circular (construction) economy. However, the digital representation of our physical world is only as good as the translation into digital data. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology bridges the gap between the digital and physical world. Therefore, this thesis assesses the opportunities and challenges of a proposed RFID-based Integrated Material Passport System (IMPS) for concrete (aggregates) in the Netherlands. The development and diffusion of this innovation were analyzed using Geels’ Multi-Level Perspective framework. A mixed-methods approach was applied to assess the Dutch concrete chain’s perception of such a system, and test the performance of an RFID material passport for concrete on a lab scale. The ambition and need to develop information systems for a circular economy is shared by the public and private sector; the majority of respondents (79%) think it is important to receive more information from the concrete chain, especially information regarding the concrete’s composition, and environmental performance. Moreover, 85% of the respondents were interested in an information system for concrete that provides them with this information. However, the intra-sectoral information infrastructure is currently insufficient for the required digital communications. Although the RFID-based system tested in this thesis showed opportunities for real-world applications, its performance is currently insufficient in terms of resistance to external forces. The development of RFID technology and an IMPS requires changes in economic incentives, policy, and technological performance. The development and communication of knowledge are considered the most crucial factors for developing and diffusing the IMPS in the Netherlands. Developments should focus on gathering lead users, research institutes, and investors, in a ‘coalition of the willing,’ for experimentation with decentralized information systems, and RFID technology. Regarding the MPS, a sector-wide approach for the normalization, sharing, and security of information is required. The focus of the approach should be on information logistics and access, rather than information registration. However, for the transition from the EoL to the sourcing phase, additional objective quality information registration is required. Although new technological innovations allow us to close the concrete loop further, the majority of secondary materials exits the cycle to road construction activities. While it has value as a road-base, the application of secondary concrete currently prohibits its re-introduction into the concrete chain. The current demand for concrete outweighs all secondary concrete supply. Taking the national infrastructure budget into account, construction activities will increase in the next five years, meaning the Netherlands will require additional virgin concrete resources in the coming years. These background activities provide opportunities and urgency for the development of innovative methods for the transition to a circular concrete chain and a circular economy.","Circular Economic Transition; Concrete; Information Flows; RFID; valorization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

As a first step, a literature review was carried out to identify the potential of auxetic metamaterials as a solution direction for pressure to strain conversion. From considering three optimal case scenarios for solution directions to create strain in a fiber, the approach of auxetic metamaterials stood out. High axial strains and a linear straining behavior, which is important for the read-out of the sensor, were expected. Auxetic Chiral structures were designed and fabricated and their effective Poisson ratios were experimentally evaluated. It was found that the boundary effects that are introduced during experiments influence the behavior of the auxetic structure, especially on the unit cells close to the boundaries. A region was found where the unit-cells behave as theory describes and the boundary effects are dissipated. Additionally, it was found that for the an-isotropic Meta Tetra Chiral structure the Poisson ratio is influenced by applied strain. The isotropic Anti Tetra Chiral structure did not show strain dependent behavior. The relation between pressure to strain conversion and the effective properties of auxetic structures indicated that an-isotropic effective properties are preferred. Using this finding Re-entrant Honeycomb structures were designed for high pressure to strain conversion. From measuring the force input and output while deforming the structure, the expectations were verified. In this research it was found that auxetic metamaterials with an-isotropic effective properties, such as Re-entrant Honeycomb structures, are an effective intermediate for converting pressure from the fluid domain to strain in a fiber.","Metamaterials; Auxetics; Sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-20","","","","","",""

This metal is a main component in batteries, and therefore, demand for cobalt is expected to increase in the coming years. This paper explores future scenarios for the cobalt system, in light of its role in the low-carbon transition. The future of cobalt is characterized by deep uncertainty: it involves uncertainty on how the system is structured, on the values of variables influencing the system, and on the desirability of outcomes of interest. Therefore, this research uses Exploratory system dynamics modelling and analysis as the method, since it allows to explore an ensemble of models, each with different values for the input variables. The results show that cobalt is likely to remain a critical material for the electric vehicle transition, although the demand for the metal could vary greatly, depending on the size of future batteries and how fast the average oregrade of cobalt will decline. The demand scenarios in turn influence the development of industrial and artisanal mining, and recycling in the cobalt system. Depending on the collection rate of batteries and other cobalt-containing goods at the end of their life, recycled cobalt could account for a significant part of the demand. The by-product nature of cobalt makes future industrial mining dependent on developments in the nickel and copper markets. If the demand for cobalt increases sufficiently and its price levels go up, cobalt could become a co-product for nickel and copper. With regards to scarcity and sustainability of the cobalt system, this research examines the influence of the assumptions of the two opposing paradigms in the literature on these two concepts: the Fixed stock paradigm and the Opportunity cost paradigm. While the Fixed stock paradigm warns for eminent physical scarcity, the Opportunity cost paradigm places its trust in the regulating capabilities of the price of metals, the signal for economic scarcity. This paper argues that the continued discussion on the paradigms, divert the attention from the externalities of mining. Cobalt resources are not likely to soon be depleted, but externalities of mining could continue to increase. More cooperation between scientists of both paradigms could help to increase understanding of metal systems, and to produce better advice on policies for decision makers to cope with the externalities. Increased research into understanding how externalities of mining could be mitigated is therefore recommended.","Energy transition; Cobalt; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many parts of the world, especially in less developed areas, societies lack knowledge and data to predict future flood events. By predicting a future flood event, an organization creates a time frame in which it can implement a mitigating action that reduces the financial damage inflicted. In recent years, development in new measuring techniques has significantly lowered the cost of collecting data and information on different aspects of the hydrological cycle. These developments enable organizations in regions restrained of knowledge and data to establish methods to analyze aspects of the hydrological cycle and thereby predicting the probability of a flood hazard several hours or days in advance. This thesis explores various possibilities of designing and implementing an \ac{EWS} for the \ac{BRT} in Dar es Salaam. The EWS design is based on the forecasting requirements, investigated with the BRT-system. Several operational forecasting methods are available. The EWS designed in this thesis makes use of rainfall data obtained from rainfall stations located in the Dar es Salaam region, installed and managed by the \ac{TAHMO}. This forecasting data is chosen because it provides the needed lead-time with the lowest margin of error. This forecasting data is processed and analyzed by the designed EWS and subsequently produces a probability level on a flood event. It thereby provides an advice on if the BRT-system should implement a mitigating action based on the principle of pursuing an optimal economic outcome. The designed EWS produces the flood probability in real-time, updated every hour with a lead time of one hour. This time frame enables the BRT-system to implement a mitigating action, thereby reducing the inflicted cost. <br/><br/>The probability level of a flood event is determined by training the EWS with historic flood and rainfall data. In addition, the implementation of both a hydrological and relational model in the EWS was tested. The results show that the hydrological model is the better option. The results also show that the implementation of an EWS ensures a decrease in financial damage endured by the BRT-system. The produced outcome of the EWS was validated by a 'leave one out' method. This validation was done by consecutively leaving one flood event out of the historical data frame and analyzing the variability of the resulting outcome. Finally, the designed EWS is best implemented in the BRT-system alongside the EWS-systems currently in place. <br","Watermanagement; EWS; Early flood warning system; flood control; Flood management; machine learning; Tanzania; Dar es Salaam; Msimbazi river; warning system; World Bank","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","TU Delft",""

For the adaptive reuse of a building, it is required to analyze, meticulously, the existing structure. Unreinforced masonry structures are indicative of the Dutch built environment. For the assessment of their structural capacity, the European Standard EN 1996 is, currently, applied. Masonry walls of high slenderness, often, comprise the structure of existing buildings, in the Netherlands. It has been noticed that the EN 1996 norm underestimates the vertical resistance of slender walls. This study attempts to extend the applicability of the EN 1996 norm to slender masonry walls, since the norm serves for the assessment of existing structures. Particularly, the research objective is to find an appropriate verification method for existing slender masonry walls, in one-way bending. Literature research is, initially, conducted, with respect to alternative formulas for the calculation of the vertical resistance of slender masonry walls. The formula in the EN 1996 norm and the alternative formulas are reviewed, considering a case study. The case study is one of the slenderest interior masonry walls, that form the structure of a relevant existing building block in Amsterdam. The latter was constructed in the late 19th – early 20th century. The engineering firm STRACKEE BV Bouwadviesbureau provided the technical drawings of the building block. Reference values for the vertical resistance, of existing slender masonry walls, are necessary to develop an appropriate formula for their verification. Therefore, the next step of the research is the numerical analysis. The response of slender masonry walls, subjected to combined vertical and lateral loading, is estimated according to the results of FE analysis. The case study is the reference for the geometry of the FE model. Indicative, for the construction period, properties of masonry are the input for the initial material model. Further, models of slender masonry walls with different geometrical and material properties are analyzed. Specifically, a parametric study is done, to define the influence of geometrical and material properties on the vertical resistance. Based on the FE analysis results, a new formula is proposed. The formula estimates the vertical resistance of existing slender masonry walls, subjected to combined vertical and lateral loading.","Unreinforced Masonry; Buckling; Lateral Loads; Existing Buildings; EN 1996; Analytical Solutions; Finite Element Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

X!Delft is an organisation within the valorisation centre of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), responsible for setting up partnerships with industry in favour of knowledge and technology transfer. X!Delft intends to create an ‘innovation ecosystem’ in which TU Delft, companies, and startups work together on “new inventions” (van Wijnen, 2019). However, stimulating collaboration between multiple companies in such an ecosystem proves to be challenging. Hence, the ecosystem is now predominantly used for company-specific challenges. To encourage working as an ecosystem, it is essential to understand the partners’ needs upon entering a partnership with X!Delft. This enables the creation of a relevant value proposition, describing how X!Delft’s service offering adds value to its partners.A way to incorporate the needs of partners into a relevant value proposition is by means of Design Thinking (DT). DT is a human-centred innovation approach suitable for understanding and providing for people’s and companies (latent) needs (Hooge et al., 2012; Carlgren, 2013). To discover what incentivises companies to opt for a partnership with X!Delft, seventeen semi-structured interviews and three creative sessions were conducted. The research uncovers a shared driver across the industry partners of X!Delft, namely the sense of suspense. Suspense is defined as “a feeling or state of anxious or excited uncertainty about what may happen” (Oxford University Press , 2019). It complements literature’s description of ‘uncertainty’, by adding a factor of excitement and wonder, triggering an impulse to act. (Lehne &amp; Koelsch, 2015). In order to understand how to manage suspense, the pragmatist inquiry proved to be useful (Lorino, 2018). In this inquiry, one moves from an uncertain situation towards a future ‘belief’, by combining experimentation and reasoning. Similarly, design practices are beneficial to coming up with future-focused solutions when considering situations of uncertainty or ambiguity.This resulted in the proposal of a new approach, PACES. The approach structures and expands X!Delft’s services so they “Preserve And Cultivate Effective Suspense”. This ‘effective suspense’, which incentivises engagement in a learning process, is cultivated in six phases: perceiving, perspective, predicting, paraphrasing, probing and proving. PACES stimulates collecting information continuously (perceiving) and sharing insights, increasing the collective knowledge base (perspective) to generate plausible predictions. These are then made actionable (paraphrasing) based on the strategic intent of individual actors, ensuring company-specific impact through the development of experiments (probing) followed by implementation projects (proving). A first ideation step is performed to translate PACES into services, complementing X!Delft’s current service offering. These services aim to incentivise participation in shared knowledge creation, hence enhancing collaboration in the innovation ecosystem. It is suggested to implement these shared services gradually - first stimulating collaboration in the first phases, and slowly moving to the last phases, where most of the knowledge creation takes place. In conclusion, some direction for future research and further development of PACES are given.","value proposition; university-industry collaboration; Design Thinking; suspense; organisational design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In this thesis, we create a taxonomy of five reasons why API producers misuse the deprecation functionality found in open-source software by analyzing 763 methods. Using this taxonomy, we create alternatives meant to help API producers avoid deprecation misuse by introducing five new annotations meant to be specific in API abnormalities. To test this proposed alternative, we conduct a user study. However, as no current experimental settings fit our needs, we create an experimental platform, RESPIRED, publishing it to improve the state-of-the-art in software engineering experiments.

In today's economy and society, the Taxi Dispatch Problem and other transport problems can be found everywhere. Not only in transporting people, but also in food delivery from restaurants and package delivery for all kind of companies. Even though the applications are different, they still have something in common: serving as much as requests as possible, because that means the highest income. In this thesis, we consider the problem in the actual taxi field. A taxi driver often chooses to serve the passenger that is closest, because he makes no money while the taxi is vacant. However, for companies such as Uber, this is probably not the best solution. They have an overview of the locations of the taxis and passengers, and therefore, are able to make an optimal assignment between the taxis and requests. Sometimes, waiting a little longer for new requests leads to an even better solution. Trying to optimize the problem for the long-run and predict where passengers appear and where taxis end up is perfectly suited for Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfield of Machine Learning. To be able to solve an optimization problem such as a Taxi Dispatch Problem, there needs to be a goal. For a company, this is maximizing the income or profit, and a popular way to do that is by minimizing the travel time. This thesis takes a different approach by looking at the problem from the passenger's perspective, as satisfied passengers lead to more passengers. In this thesis, the goal is to find an optimal policy for assigning taxis to passengers such that the total waiting time over all passengers is minimized, by using Reinforcement Learning. In order to do that, we formulate the problem in terms of the elements of an RL problem, with the RL method Q-Learning as the learning algorithm and ϵ-Greedy as policy.

Many sandy beaches are eroding as a result of human-induced factors. Currently, the preferred coastal protection measure in the United States are beach nourishments. In Europe, there also is a general shift from hard to soft coastal protection measures. However, beach nourishments are not a long-term solution. Recently, in the Netherlands, a new concept called a large-scale (mega-feeder) nourishment has been introduced (the Sand Engine). Numerous studies on this new concept have been conducted. However, not for a mega-feeder nourishment nearby a tidal inlet system. About 10\% of the world's beaches consist of barrier islands. Emphasizing the importance of investigating the development of a mega-feeder nourishment nearby a tidal inlet system, under various hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore the research question is as follows: “How does a nearby tidal inlet system influence the development of a mega-feeder nourishment?” The research question is answered by investigating the effects various hydrodynamic conditions have on the development of a mega-feeder nourishment nearby a tidal inlet system. This is done for fixed morphodynamic features, such as the dimensions of the tidal basin and the dimensions and orientation of the tidal inlet. The only variable morphodynamic feature is the alongshore position of the mega-feeder nourishment. Four distinct hydrodynamic scenarios are modelled to investigate their effects on a mega-feeder nourishment. The tidal range (η), significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period(Tp) and peak wave direction (Dp) are varied. This resulted in the following hydrodynamic scenarios: <br/>•Mild wave conditions: (η = 1.5m; Hs=1.0m and Dp=0°); <br/>•Oblique wave conditions: (η = 1.5m; Hs=1.0m and Dp=-45°); <br/>•Storm wave conditions: (η = 1.5m; Hs=variable and Dp=0°); <br/>•High tidal range: (η = 3.0m; Hs=1.0m and Dp=0°). <br/>These hydrodynamic conditions and their effect on a mega-feeder nourishment are modelled by utilizing a process-based numerical model called Delft3D. In Delft3D, two locations of the mega-feeder nourishment per hydrodynamic scenario are evaluated. A mega-feeder nourishment is placed at an alongshore distance of 2 kilometers and 5 kilometers from the tidal inlet. This to get insight in the tidal flow nearby a tidal inlet and up to what alongshore distance this tidal flow affects the development of a mega-feeder nourishment. The hydrodynamic conditions were simplified, meaning steady wave characteristics and a single M2 tidal constituent. Using real time-varying hydrodynamic conditions yields similar results compared to the simplified hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, simplifying the hydrodynamic conditions is justified. The results show that there will be additional erosion near a tidal inlet if the mega-feeder nourishment is located inside the influence of the tidal inlet. The influence is the alongshore distance where the currents owing to the tidal inlet (residual currents) still affects the total alongshore sediment transport (larger than 50 m³/6y/m). The alongshore distance of the influence increases with an increasing tidal range (tidal prism). However, there is no shoreline retreat owing to the tidal inlet at the location (2km from the tidal inlet) of the mega-feeder nourishment over a time period of 6 years. Only the adjacent coast on the inlet-side of the mega-feeder nourishment erodes significantly more than without a tidal inlet, with an increasing magnitude in the shoreline retreat towards the tidal inlet. Hence, it is expected that if the mega-feeder nourishment is placed close to the tidal inlet (i.e. several hundreds of meters), then the influence of the currents owing to the tidal inlet will enhance the shoreline retreat at the location of a mega-feeder nourishment. To conclude, the tidal inlet does influence the development of a mega-feeder nourishment nearby a tidal inlet (order several hundreds of meters). However, this is not necessarily seen in the retreat of the shoreline but instead in deeper depth contours. The governing process in the sediment transport at a mega-feeder nourishment is the incident wave angle for small tidal ranges (η &lt; 1.5m) and mild wave conditions (Hs &gt; 1m). However, for a large tidal range (η &gt; 3.0m) the residual currents owing to the tidal inlet will become the governing process.<br","Coastal Engineering; Mega nourishment; large-scale nourishments; Delft3D; Morphology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The lack of long-term success can partly be contributed to a mismatch between farmer realities and technology packages, national irrigation management and development aid policies. In order to better design and promote adoption of water transport technology alternatives, it is important to create a clearer understanding of the full spectrum in which farmers operate and make farming and investment decisions. This study therefore analyses the diversity in decision-making variables influencing the adoption of water transport technologies, and considers the implications for policy &amp; technology developers, researchers and development facilitators. Following the Q-methodology, four different factors of participants with respective sorting characteristics were identified. Thereafter the study reviews how conventional ways of grouping farmers in policy and development programs hold up against the statistically formed factors. The results show that the definitions used in the conventional way of grouping are inadequate in dealing with the subjectivity surrounding adoption of water transport technologies in Malawi. With this new appreciation for the heterogeneity of farmers comes an understanding that technologies, policies and programmes must move away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to more targeted, tailor-made approaches that are more likely to facilitate efficient, sustainable and long-term uptake of water transport technologies. Policies and technology packages do not have to be tailor-made on individual scale, but should recognize the idea that there are many different kinds of farmers that base their decision-making on different variables. Recognizing this and translating it into contextualized support and technology packages can more effectively encourage uptake of water transport technology by farmers. Also, the study shows that Q-methodology can act as an useful tool to better understand farmer decision-making, feeding policy and technology discussions and development. The research seeks to contribute towards the understanding of farmer decision-making and improved action around implementation of water transport systems.","Malawi; Q-methodology; Farmer decision-making; Farmer typology; Water transport technology adoption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides information about tissue morphology by measuring backscattered light and has the potential to enhance optical images with quantitative optical parameters, without the need to remove and process specimens. It is, however, paramount for clinical application to accurately describe the relation between the retrieved optical properties and structural tissue properties. Multiple studies are devoted to describing this relation and to build on a theoretical framework enclosing the correlation between OCT-derived properties and the pathological state of the tissue. To entirely understand the governing physical process, it is necessary to simplify tissue structure. Much work has been devoted to the analysis of mono-disperse (e.g., single particle size) discrete random media. Towards a more realistic model of tissue containing multiple particle sizes, bidisperse (e.g., two particle sizes) systems are of interest. Though, for a medium composed of bidisperse DRM, experimental validations of theoretical derivations are lacking. This study therefore focusses on the experimental validation of theoretical predictions of the attenuation coefficient, attained by combining Mie Theory with the Percus-Yevick structure factors, while only assuming single scattering events. Three different samples series are measured composed of respectively 490 nm and 700 nm, 490 nm and 910 nm and 700 and 910 nm mean diameter silica beads, variating the volume fraction and relative number density. It is found that for lower concentrations the predicted attenuation coefficient is in agreement with experimentally derived values. Nonetheless, multiple scattering is presumed to be affecting the estimated attenuation coefficient for higher volume fractions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The offshore wind turbines producing this energy keep increasing in size and, as a result, the monopile foundations are becoming larger and heavier. The traditional jack-up installation vessels have limited crane capacity and many of these vessels are unable to install the XXL monopiles. Therefore, the offshore industry is currently investigating a new installation method using a motion-compensated gripper frame on floating vessel with a dynamic positioning system. The gripper frame is attached to the vessel and encloses the monopile with a ring to keep it vertical during the installation. In addition, the gripper frame compensates for the vessel motions such that the vessel motions do not influence the monopile motions. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of such a motion-compensated gripper frame and to determine what control settings minimise the monopile inclination and the force exerted on the monopile. The system is composed of three main bodies: the vessel, the gripper frame and the monopile. The monopile and PID controller, which controls the amount of force exerted on the monopile to keep it vertical, have been modelled in the frequency domain to gain insight in the effect of changing the control parameters. To model the dynamics of the coupled system an OrcaFlex model has been set-up. The system has been tested for various values of proportional and derivative gain, kP and kD respectively, in various wave conditions. First the perfect control system is tested, where the force to keep the monopile vertical is applied instantly and the vessel motions are fully compensated. However, as the real world is never perfect, the system tested for sensor lag and imperfect motion compensation as well. The results are judged based on three criteria regarding the maximum monopile inclination, actuator force and actuator stroke. Resonance is observed in case a value of kP is selected such that the natural frequency of the monopile and controller matches the wave forcing frequency. Adding derivative gain kD limits the monopile motions and force exerted in this case. To limit the monopile motion the proportional gain should be selected such that resonance is avoided. Two different control settings are investigated and it has been found that a relatively high value of kP of 10,000 kN/m in combination with a kD of 11,000 kNs/m is a suitable setting based on the three criteria. Furthermore, bow quartering waves is the favourable wave direction compared to head waves for the system considered in this thesis, as the force on the monopile is more evenly distributed over the actuator in x- and y-direction. Introducing a sensor lag into the system results in higher monopile motions and forces on the monopile. If the sensor lag exceeds 0.3 s it leads to instability of the monopile for both settings. The effect of not fully compensating the vessel motions is found to be limited due to the fact that these motions are slowly varying. The results of this work contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of the system in various wave conditions. Furthermore, it provides insight in the effect of sensor lag and imperfect motions compensation, contributing to the design of a motion-compensated gripper frame for the installation of XXL monopiles.","Monopile Installation; gripper frame; motion compensated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-05","","","","","",""

In literature, horizontal collaboration is identified as one of the most promising solutions to this problem. However, collaboration is not often encountered in trucking industry, since carriers are hesitant to join collaborations. This is caused by a fear of sharing information and an uneven distribution of requests between carriers. Furthermore, the amount of collaborative gain remains still unclear when dealing with a dynamically changing environment, which is often present. This work aims to fill this knowledge gap. Firstly by developing a vehicle routing problem (VRP) model, which includes dynamic requests, horizontal collaboration and customer satisfaction. Next to that, a solution method is developed which is based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). The performance of the implemented method is evaluated with a computational study of 10 instances. The performance is compared with a full information (FI) method and another dynamic method (SI). The FI method evaluates the same instances, with all information known beforehand, thereby acting as a lower bound. The newly developed solution method has shown to perform 39% worse compared to full information, while being able to deal with dynamic requests. The SI method shows an increase of 60% in routing costs when compared with FI.<br/> Next the development of the model and solution method, the implemented method is used to investigate the collaborative gain for four levels of collaboration in a dynamic environment. The level of collaboration is expressed by the number of requests that is reassigned between carriers. The results show that up to 23% collaborative gain can be realized in the dynamic setting.","Collaborative gain assesment; Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem; Horizontal collaboration; Multi Objective Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

In contrast to uni- and bidirectional flows, for which many researches have quantitatively studied the pedestrian flow characteristics, only little research has been done to intersecting flows. The purpose of this research is to gain insight into how the flow capacity of a pedestrian intersection at a railway station is influenced by several factors and to explore methods that can estimate the flow capacity of a pedestrian intersection. A theoretical framework has been constructed that shows the hypothesized causal relations between the research topic - intersection flow capacity - and several variables that describe the context of this study. Furthermore, three capacity estimation methods were proposed to estimate the flow capacity of a pedestrian intersection. According to the field study, the second and third method both seem suitable for capacity estimations, even though the intersection flow capacity (according to the traffic flow principles) could not be estimated in this study.

State-of-the-art haptic gloves are broadening the workspace and degrees of freedom for hand motion in VR, adding force and vibrotactile feedback to the user's hand and fingers. The effect of each feedback modality to task performance remains unclear. In the current proof-of-concept study we added high-frequency vibrotactile actuators onto a resistive force-feedback glove, to illustrate how our proposed analysis method might contribute to the field of human factors studies. We aim to identify improvements to a haptic glove by isolating the contribution of both haptic feedback modalities, that is the force and vibrotactile feedback. Haptic gloves are used to train the fine motor control skills for assembly operations, allowing the users to grasp objects in an natural manner. By tracking the Finger Indentation -- the distance that a fingertip travels into the virtual surface of the grasped object -- we can capture the grasping realism achieved by each haptic condition. This approach allows us to explore the differences between expected physical world behavior and corresponding behavior in a virtual environment. To determine if our proposed metric provides insights into human behavior, we perform a within-subject comparison of a simplified assembly task in virtual reality with 3 participants. Participants are asked to perform a pick-and-place task for 4 conditions: no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, force feedback, and combined feedback. Performance is judged by analysing task completion time, finger indentation, and subjective measurements. The results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that the combined feedback condition performs better in terms of lower thumb indentations and higher usefulness and satisfactory scores than the no feedback and vibrotactile feedback conditions. It is notable that the vibrotactile feedback condition did not seem to out-perform the no-feedback condition. Regardless, the finger indentation metric seems to be a valid method to compare feedback modalities for grasping performance in a full-sized human factors study.","Tactile Feedback; Vibrotactile feedback; Ungrounded Haptic Device; Haptic Feedback; Grasping; Virtual Reality; Virtual Reality Gloves; Haptic Gloves; VR Assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

It is this absence of agency that condones extensive littering and the almost absolute obliteration of the remaining historic urban fabric for parking lots and generic contemporary housing. This attitude can be ascribed to the fact that architecture was central to the conflict fought in the Kosovo war, as a marker and legitimization of a fabricated ethnic identity, but more significantly it reaches back to the communist era and to the time when Kosovo’s public realm was passed from one totalitarian regime to another. The question thus becomes; how can architecture unwind this historical way of dealing with public space and through citizen engagement bring forward a discourse on agency and belonging in one’s urban environment. What role can the architect play here? How can he or she justify his or her presence? And what is the best approach? As Kosovo’s large population of young people begin to see public space in a new light, public attitudes that once deemed common spaces as the responsibility of the government are fading away.

This ideal wave climate is altered to research the influence of the mean wave direction, directional variation and the sequence of waves (seasonality). The study showed the sandbar breakwater concept to be mainly influenced by the mean wave direction and to lesser extent by the directional variation and the seasonality.

This is needed since there is a lack of surgery<br/>assistants, while graduate students need to wait on average six months to start their work in a hospital. To match quickly and sufficiently, the hard-skills as well as soft-skills of the student need to be known. To achieve this, universities need to provide OKademy with each student’s soft-skills. However, this takes an excessive amount of effort for the universities. To let the universities benefit from this idea, OKademy wants to have a system which keeps track of the soft-skills and matches students in groups for assignments, thus being beneficial for universities and hospitals. To help Okademy achieve its goal we developed a system that can be used by universities to help the students keep track of their soft-skills. The same system can be used to form theoretically well-functioning groups. These groups should be generated using an optimization algorithm that approximates the best groups regarding the soft-skills of students. In this system, students, referred to as ‘members’, and instructors, referred to as ‘hosts’, can register. Members can be assigned into groups and hosts can create or modify groups and courses accordingly. Members can, after registration, fill in their top 10 soft-skills with a corresponding automatized grade. Based on these skills, they will be assigned to groups for a course created by a host. A course will go through multiple phases. When all groups have completed the assignment, a member is able to give feedback to five random soft-skills of their group members and recommend a new one if desired. Based on this feedback, their soft-skill grades will be adjusted. The possible combinations of groups can be extremely large, therefore, it is not feasible to blindly search for the best group formation. Our algorithm will use the idea of genetic algorithms to explore the search space and approximate the best group formation. The the final product consists of a web application in which the multi-objective group formation optimization algorithm is implemented. To work in a structured manner, we used the Scrum method. Meetings with our client and coach were held every week. The system has been tested by functionality tests, user tests and unit tests, ensuring a functional system. OKademy will use this system in collaboration with universities and hospitals to solve the problem.","Genetic algorithm; soft-skills; group formation; profiling tool; Multi-Objective Optimization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","TI3806",""

However, there was hitherto no standard procedure to conduct model verification, and limited studies were found related to the verification of cyclist simulation models. To fill this gap, this study develops a verification framework for traffic simulation models based on the methodologies used in the literature. It also briefly discusses the difference to verify a cyclist simulation model. The framework is assessed by applying to a case study of the cyclist-queue-formation simulation model. The results prove the applicability of the framework to verify a cyclist simulation model. The organised structure of the framework provides a systematic measure for the verification of traffic simulation models.

This thesis investigates what lessons for third-party water diplomacy can be drawn from the water narratives of the Central Asian governments. This question is pursued through a discourse analysis of government publications. This analysis reveals that four distinct discourses can be identified in the Tajik and Uzbek government narratives, which can be classified along two axes: upstream-downstream and international-domestic. The first distinction is to be expected, but the second warrants a closer look. A comparison with publications by governments engaged in regional water diplomacy shows that the Central Asian government discourses aimed at international audiences skew much more closely to the stated priorities of mediators and donors than their discourses for domestic consumption do. This implies that water diplomats should be careful in taking the narrative of Central Asian governments at face value and should pay close attention to their domestic narrative in order to carry out successful mediation.","Water diplomacy; Discourse analysis; Central Asia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A proposedsolution can be found in the usage of high-rise buildings. Nowadays there ismore awareness for the environment, thus this research tries to reduce theenvironmental impact of a high-rise building by optimizing the material used inload-bearing structures. This research aims to give designers and engineersmore insight into the added value of structural optimization; in particular forthe material usage in the load-bearing structure of high-rise buildings. Theresearch objective is formulated as follows: What is the optimal topology for a reinforced concrete load-bearingstructure, situated at the perimeter of a high-rise building when optimizingthe material use?  A building isclassified as high-rise building when its roof is 70 m or more above groundlevel and accommodates work and/or living space. In literature the distinctionis made between three sorts of optimization: size, shape and topologyoptimization. Topology optimization has the most freedom, therefore it is morelikely to find a novel structure which minimizes the material use as much aspossible. In specific the Ground Structure Method (GSM) is used. The initialground structure is constructed by creating members between all nodes (fullconnectivity) which are located in the design space. The cross-sectional areasof the bars are the design variables in the optimization. An option is that thevariables turn to zero, thus elements are deleted resulting in less material.The conventional GSM starts with the full connectivity as initial groundstructure, deletes elements and calculates the new load distribution until athreshold is reached. In the end the load-bearing structure will consist ofcolumns, braces and beams, which are located at the perimeter of the floorplan. Literature indicates that (high-rise) buildings which are mainly loadedby horizontal loads would be optimal if they contain arches in the load-bearingstructure, or resemble the so-called Michell truss. However, the influence ofthe vertical load is often not taken into account, therefore this isinvestigated with the help of a parametric study. To compare the results withreality, a case study (Boston &amp; Seattle, Rotterdam) is investigated.   The core of the research is the furtherdevelopment of the optimization code, based on the GSM, written by He et al.,where multiple load cases and demands for the material strengths are implemented.In contrast to deleting elements, the code uses an adaptive ‘member adding’scheme, which is firstly proposed by Gilbert and Tyas. This scheme solvesproblems faster than the conventional GSM, up to 8 times, and is able to solvelarge problems. This code is extended during this research with new functionswhich implement demands for fire, second-order, buildability, flexural bucklingand stiffness. Also it is possible to add self-weight to the optimization. Thestiffness is implemented by adding a constraint to the displacement of the topof the building, wherefore a recursive resizing algorithm is written based onthe article of Chan. Thus the extended code exists of two optimizations, firsta strength optimization and afterwards a stiffness optimization. The code iswritten in Python and for the purpose of post-processing exporting the data toExcel and Abaqus is possible.  With thehelp of the extended code, two design spaces are investigated. One design spaceis smaller, such that the computational time is low and many variations can beexamined during the parametric study on the total vertical to total horizontalload ratio (v/h-ratio). The other is based on a case study for comparison witha realistic situation. The verification of the code shows that the extrafunctions work properly for the investigated problems. If the functionsconcerning the stiffness optimization, inclusion of self-weight, fire,buildability and second-order are used, the extended code becomes unstable andthe computation time increases enormously when optimizing the case study.Therefore it is chosen not to include during obtaining the results. The resultsof the parametric study shows an expected pattern for the load-bearingstructure, for a v/h-ratio below 4. The pattern consist of arches, originatingfrom the Michell truss. The optimization of the case study, subjected to onerealistic load combination, showed no clear pattern for the load-bearingstructure. Post-processing steps, based on engineering judgement, are taken toclarify the solutions, which showed that the columns above the supports shouldbe large in comparison to the other elements and that the arches are the mostoptimal structure. Therefore an “optimized” load-bearing structure consistingof arches is proposed. The analysis of the “optimized” load-bearing structureshows us that most of the elements meet the strength requirements. To find theoptimal solution an iterative process would be needed, because increasing thecross-section of an element will decrease the stress but increase thestiffness, thus attracting more load.   Thedifference between the optimized load-bearing structure and the originalload-bearing structure of the case study is that the optimized uses archesinstead of (punched) structural walls and uses less material (±3%). From thepost-processing of the results it is concluded that increasing the strengthratio (compression to tensile) to 1.0, decreasing the total v/h-ratio orignoring the rigid-diaphragm working of the floor help clarify the results ofthe optimization.   This research extendsthe current literature with extra insights in the use of the Ground StructureMethod in an optimization code. Also, it confirms that the arches (originatingfrom Michel Truss) is an efficient manner to transfer the loads to thesupports. However, more research in the influence of the supports, the designspace and the material type on the clearness of the optimal solution is needed.  The advice for designers and engineersis to see what the possibilities are for arches to use in their load-bearingstructure, because these are efficient in transferring the loads so materialcan be saved. The current version of the code needs to be made more userfriendly, stabler and faster before it is recommended to be used by designersand engineers. The extended code is a first attempt to implement multiple rulesfrom the Eurocode in a optimization code.  ","Optimization; High-rise buildings; Ground Structure Method; Recursive Resizing Algorithm; Reinforced concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","Related dataset 4TU.ResearchData https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:d5a42352-a417-4082-aa0f-87047812bfed","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Due to increasing water consumption and stress on natural water resources, enhanced treatment of wastewater and reuse of water are becoming more important. Treated municipal wastewater has potential to be used for irrigation purposes, but pathogens are a major concern to protect environmental and human health. Therefore, an advanced treatment step is required to reduce the levels of microorganisms, nutrients and suspended solids. This literature review focusses on electroflotation (EF) as disinfection method of secondary municipal wastewater treatment. EF is a combination of electrocoagulation (EC) and dissolved air flotation (DAF). In EC treatment, a sacrificial metallic anode releases metal ions (usually iron or aluminium) into the solution while hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas are produced at the cathode. Coagulants are created in situ by the hydrolysis of these metal ions to hydroxides that can destabilize pollutants. DAF is an adsorptive bubble separation process where generated gas bubbles (of 10-100 µm) separate the impurities by flotation. This paper outlines the processes involved in EF technology and its applications in (waste)water treatment. Therefore, the processes of EC and DAF are discussed first. Influencing parameters such as electrode material, pH, retention time, charge dosage, charge dosage rate, bubble formation and size are discussed, as well as pollutant removal mechanisms. The main mechanisms responsible are charge neutralization, adsorption, sweep coagulation, microbial destruction by the electric field and deactivation by free radicals. The conclusion is drawn that the hybrid EF technique, which has been implemented in different water treatment processes, promises to increase removal efficiencies compared to single EC and DAF treatment, but the full potential of EF as a tertiary treatment step for secondary municipal wastewater effluent is yet to be fully realized. The process needs to be empirically optimized, a challenging task due to the involvement of complex chemical and physical processes.","electroflotation; disinfection; wastewater; effluent","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The boxwing aircraft, sometimes named a PrandtlPlane (PrP), is an unconventional aircraft. An instance with redundant controls is designed within the PARSIFAL project. This specific aircraft is designed for commercial transport in the shortrange segment (a 4000 km design range) and for a high passenger capacity (up to 308 passengers). Because of the beneficial induced drag characteristics inherent to the boxwing configuration, the PrP represents a possible solution towards the sustainable future of aviation. To investigate the potential of the PrP as an alternative to conventional commercial aircraft, the mission performance assessment of the aircraft has been split into two components. The first part of the assessment covers the comparison between the performance of the PARSIFALdesigned PrP and that of a competitor aircraft with a similar design range, the A320, while allowing only nonredundant controls. The second part of the assessment involves the quantification of the PrP’s performance when allowing redundant controls in the form of Direct Lift Control (DLC), enabling the aircraft to increase its net lift without a change in pitching moment. Analyses of the PrP and its competitor aircraft for various ranges have shown that the PrP outperforms its competitor in terms of relative fuel consumption. When flying its minimumfuel mission, the PrP’s competitor consumes less fuel in absolute terms. Nonetheless, because the PrP carries more than twice as many passengers, it consumes up to 14.5 % less fuel per passenger per kilometre. In other respects the PrP’s performance is inferior to that of its competitor. The 5400 km maximum range of the PrP is considerably lower than its competitor’s maximum range of 6200 km. Moreover, at a fueloptimal Mach number of approximately 0.7 the PrP cruises appreciably slower than the cruise Mach number for which it was designed, unlike its competitor. In general, the PrP flies its trajectories much slower than its competitor at an approximately 10 % lower average velocity in the minimumfuel missions. If both time and fuel are considered equally in the cruise altitude optimisation, the design altitude of 11 km is deemed appropriate. If only fuel consumption is considered, the PrP would benefit in fuel economy from lowering the initial cruise altitude at the cost of increased mission time. At an optimal altitude of 9.3 km, the PrP would consume 2.2 % less fuel than at its design altitude of 11 km at the cost of even slower flight. The sensitivities of the PrP’s mission time and fuel performance to changes in its design Zerofuel Mass (ZFM) have been investigated. Keeping the Maximum Takeoff Mass (MTOM) constant while varying the ZFM, design mission simulations were run for the PrP for several objective functions. It was found that when flying for minimum fuel, a 1 % increase in ZFM incurs a fuel consumption penalty of over 1 % through a nearlinear, direct proportionality. Likewise, the mission time varies nearly linearly with the ZFM; a 1 % increase results in an approximate mission time increase of nearly 0.5 %. The incremental aerodynamic lift and drag due to control surface deflections for DLC were modelled using a flatplate approximation. With this approach, the projected missionlevel benefits of using DLC are marginal. On the design mission, the results indicate an increase in fuel economy of 0.6 % on the minimumfuel mission and negligible temporal gains on the minimumtime mission. It is however emphasised that numerical uncertainties due to the discretisation of the problem pollute all obtained solutions to some degree, such that appropriate caution should be exercised when interpreting these results in an absolute sense. In future research, a grid refinement study would be a valuable addition to quantify and bound these uncertainties. It is deemed equally important to look into a more sophisticated way to model the control surface aerodynamics necessary for assessing the benefits of DLC. A broader recommendation pertains to future research on boxwing aircraft aerodynamic design. The current research has indicated that the optimal trajectories for the PrP result in very distinct flight profiles when optimising for different objectives. Therefore, it would be interesting to see how the aerodynamic design could evolve, such that flying for fuel economy wouldn’t require such a compromise in temporal performance and vice versa.","Optimal Control; Trajectory optimisation; aircraft flight performance; aircraft; Mission Analysis; unconventional configuration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Some of these buildings are located at seismic zones, while unreinforced masonry structures are vulnerable to seismic loads. To assess the existing masonry buildings and to design new masonry structures, nonlinear seismic simulations are conducted with macro modelling or micro modelling approach. The macro modelling approach, which smears out the details of the bricks and joints as a homogenous material, can efficiently and robustly model complete masonry structures. A commonly used orthotropic constitutive model is the Engineering Masonry Model of the DIANA FEA, which is based on the Total Strain Method that eliminates the mapping-back process in conventional elastoplastic constitutive models. The micro modelling approach, which explicitly models the bricks and joints, can better represent the mechanical behaviours of masonry. However, most of the constitutive models used in micro modelling are based on elastoplasticity that usually causes numerical difficulties due to its mapping-back process. The lack of a robust constitutive model has severely hindered the application of this accurate analysis approach.<br/><br/>So, this thesis proposes a sub-increment based iterative constitutive model for interface elements, based on Multi-surface Plasticity Criterion. This model aims to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the constitutive model used for micro modelling. It eliminates the conventional mapping-back process in elastoplastic constitutive models by introducing the ideas of sequential uni-axial loading algorithm and an extra damage iterative calculation algorithm. These algorithms are robust even when the stress state is at the corners of the yield surface. The model also introduces the concept of sub-increments to consider the path dependency in plastic process. All the formulations of this constitutive model are derived based on a simple mechanical model. Formulas and examples are provided for obtaining the input parameters from material tests. The proposed constitutive model is tested on a single integration point level and found to be stable and reliable. It is further applied on the component level, by modelling three masonry walls of different dimensions and boundary conditions, under cyclic loading. For the verification of these wall models, the numerical results are compared with the experimental results in terms of force-displacement curve and crack pattern. Finally, the thesis presents a brief study on parameter sensitivity to provide guidelines for the level of accuracy needed for each input parameter, in order to get satisfactory numerical results.<br/><br/>The constitutive model is found to be robust for all the wall analyses conducted, without encountering divergence. The comparison between numerical results and experimental results shows that this constitutive model can cover the majority of shear and flexural failure mechanisms and mimic the crack patterns well. It is capable of modelling shear failure with high accuracy. It can also model flexural failure well with a few parameters calibrated. The fact that the model is little sensitive to parameters that are hard to be measured from experiments, such as tensile strength and tensile fracture energy, ensures its feasibility in engineering practices.<br","Finite Element Method; constitutive model; interface element; masonry; discrete crack model; mirco modelling; cracking-crushing-shearing; cyclic loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Katsifodimos, Asterios (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","For decades the idea of re-usable software has been seen as the holy grail of software development. But up until recently, there was more discussion about software re-use than actual software re-use. Even though most software uses the same blocks of code over and over again, almost all software is built from the ground up. Today, this situation is completely different. Nowadays, almost every application re-uses software in the form of software dependencies. However, this re-use pattern is starting to become unchecked. The shift to re-usable software has happened so quickly, the risks associated with choosing the right dependencies are often overlooked. In the current research, there exists a gap in the balance between re-usability and usability. This work tries to fill that gap. People have tried solving the problem of software re-use, but it has proven to be a hard problem. There needs to be a trade-off between re-usability and usability. This thesis focuses its work on developing a framework that continues the progression in the develop- ment of re-usable code. This is achieved by enabling trustworthy code and providing runtime support. A key property is permission-less code execution at near-zero cost. The concept, called FBase, sets out to achieve the balance between re-usability and usability by limiting the granularity of re-usable modules to a distinct set of four component types. To further enhance the us- ability of FBase, an ecosystem was proposed to mask the negative effects that are associated with re-usability. Previous attempts at solving the re-usability problem have mostly focused on a technical level in contrast to FBase which also incorporates social and policy aspects. By integrating sub-systems into an ecosystem it improves the usability of the framework. A proof-of-concept implementation is created to support the eval- uation of the concept. To be considered successful, FBase needs to perform properly on a technical and functional level. The evaluation showed that FBase can be used in a non-trivial use-case, by creating a fully functioning example that demonstrates the composition and construction of an application with interchangeable trust models. It was demonstrated that real-world practical problems can be solved using this framework. The main advantage that the framework provided in the use-case was the introduction of modularity. On one hand, it has the benefit of flexibility and variety in use. On the other hand, modularization improves the manageability of maintenance for complex software like Tribler. One of the disadvantages that followed from the use-case was the increased time that modules on FBase took to develop the application compared to implementing it in a monolithic architecture. A second more general disadvantage is that the module interconnect limits the complexity of the interaction between mod- ules. This disadvantage did not limit the development of this use-case but changes the way applications need to be developed. To test the robustness and flexibility of the framework, an experiment was performed to try to create a proof-of-concept prototype of an Android application that could run the same stack of code to extend the ecosystem to mobile platforms. FBase delivers a concept that complies with the requirements that were set out and offers a balanced ap- proach of re-usability and usability. In essence, FBase is a platform for building applications consisting of re-usable code. This makes it similar to Python with the Pip dependency manager or NodeJS and its depen- dency manager NPM. However, these existing platforms make use of centralized approaches and do not solve the trust aspect of using external dependencies in contrast to FBase.","Trust; Modular architecture; Reusability; Usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

This practice is slowly being implemented in various engineering fields, with architects often being pioneers. Various methodologies have been written about the subject, but often only from an architectural point of view.<br/>The classification presented in this paper provides a different perspective on the<br/>subject. It is structured like a toolbox, containing a clear classification of the technical working principles that plants use to generate motion. With the working principles abstracted, it is no longer necessary to dive deep into the inner workings of plants.<br/>The Scopus and Web of Science databases have been systematically searched for<br/>compliant plant movements. Plants mainly move by reallocating water, either actively via osmosis or passively via hygroscopic tissue. In compliant plant mechanisms, these basic movement initiators bring about deformations of plant parts. These movements are classified according to their goal: does the plant move quasi-static or dynamic? And does the plant only use a mechanism or does it rely on the gradual storage and fast release of elastic energy as well? Quasi-static movements are often only mechanical and reversible, while dynamic movements rely on energy storage and are often irreversible due to their failure-based release. A bilayer structure in one form or another is present in almost all mechanisms, proving its large adaptability to various circumstances. This<br/>adaptability is achieved by the various configurations of the two layers, including<br/>fibre-orientation and cellular set-up.<br/>Existing bio-inspired devices are classified according to the same system. This<br/>enables identification of plant mechanisms that are already suited for implementation and exposes plant movements that are not yet used in the human world. Additionally, a lot could be gained from copying mechanisms on a cellular level rather than on a macroscopic level. Most importantly, a change in mindset needs to happen in order to fully benefit the intricate mechanisms that the plant world has to offer.<br","Compliant Shell Mechanisms; Morphing Structures; Bio-inspired; Plant Mechanisms","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Herrera, Javier (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this thesis, the performance of three different station-keeping methods applied to Sun-Earth L2 halo orbits is investigated. In order to evaluate these methods, first a framework for accurate satellite dynamics was developed. This was done by starting off at the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, and extending that to a more accurate model in the Roto-Pulsating Reference Frame (RPF). The dynamics in the RPF were implemented in a propagator, written in C, which forms the basis for any analysis that has been done for this thesis. The propagator includes real planetary ephemerides from JPL, perturbations from all solar-system bodies and Solar Radiation Pressure and has functionalities for orbit generation, STM propagation, reference frame transformations and manoeuvre calculations. The three station-keeping methods that have been investigated in this thesis are: Optimal Continuation Strategy (OCS), Discrete-time Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) and Fuzzy-logic Sliding Mode Control (FLSMC). All of these methods were implemented in C, within the developed propagator and were tuned using an optimization library for C. After the implementation of the three methods, a performance analysis was done, applying the methods to a Sun-Earth L2 halo orbit in a Monte-Carlo simulation, taking into account uncertainties in the orbit determination process, the perturbations and the manoeuvre execution. The total ΔV, as well as the number of manoeuvres, for the three methods were calculated, and subsequently compared against eachother. This was done for a time span of 500 days with a minimum manoeuvre interval of 12 days. The resulting comparison and the result of this analysis clearly shows that the DSMC and FLSMC perform much better both in terms of total ΔV as well as in the variance that arises from the Monte-Carlo simulations. The FLSMC provides another significant, yet smaller, improvement when compared to the DSMC, which was theorized by Lian et al. The fuzzy-logic layer that is implemented makes for smoother behaviour when the actual orbit of the satellite is close to the desired reference orbit, where the normal DSMC exhibits more chattering around the reference orbit. It is clear from this analysis that the proposal of Lian et al. to add this fuzzy logic layer does contribute significantly to the performance of the method and that FLSMC is a potent and efficient method for halo orbit station-keeping, provided a good reference orbit is chosen for the method to follow. The analysis performed in this thesis was restricted to Sun-Earth L2 halo orbits but all techniques mentioned and developed within this research can easily be applied to halo orbits around any of the collinear lagrange points in any three-body system, with only minor changes.","Station-keeping; Halo; Astrodynamics; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Wind power has proved to play a critical role in this transition. To speed up this transition, the wind industry must keep innovating. The major part of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) is installed by a jack-up which not only has its limitations from an engineering point of view, such as water depth, soil characteristics and lifting capacity but also from a financial point of view. To overcome these limitations, this research aimed at developing an innovative concept design for the installation of offshore WTGs. <br/>A vessel dynamic analysis showed that the Mighty Servant 1 is the most suitable Boskalis vessel to install WTGs from. The same dynamic analysis also highlighted that a motion compensation system is required to mitigate wave-induced dynamics and enabling WTG installation in floating conditions. After developing multiple concepts of motion compensation systems, a multi-criteria analysis in the form of an analytic hierarchy process is performed. It is found that the most promising concept should rely on hydraulic actuators. To find the optimal values of the design parameters of the chosen concept, a kinematic multi-objective optimization is carried out by means of a genetic algorithm. The optimal set of design parameters is selected by taking advantage of the Pareto front, which is computed by using three chosen performance indexes. A model is developed in MATLAB and Simulink to simulate the dynamics of the motions compensation system. The simulated results showed that a controller which uses velocity feed-forward and position feedback is the preferred way to go. The results also highlighted that the required amount of hydraulic power has a great impact on the economic feasibility of the system. Therefore, to reduce the hydraulic power and guarantee the feasibility, a passive system based on a hydraulic accumulator is added. Based on the results of this research, it can be concluded that the next generation offshore wind turbine generator can be motion-compensated with hydraulic actuators including hydraulic accumulators. Further research could be carried out by assessing more installation phases in combination with a wider range of load cases.","Offshore Wind Turbine; Kinematic Optimization; motion compensation; Floating installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-05-08","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In september 2017, it was hit directly by a hurricane called Irma, causing widespread damage to the island. As many other Caribbean islands, St. Maarten is highly depending on tourism as an income, which with drawled in the aftermath of the hurricane. Since the 1960s, its nature, better known as ‘sea, sand &amp; sun’, created a high economic value. Old plantations, salt winning, fishing and cattle slowly disappeared to maximize the tourism. Additionally, the island has become one of the most dense islands of the world. The development of the mass tourism has caused destruction of habitats, intense use of land, decreasing biodiversity and the pollution, forming huge threats for the ecosystems. We could say that St. Maarten’s biggest product is in danger. However, the natural environment of the island has already shown that it’s highly resilient and could solve many sustainable challenges for the mankind.

How to enable and encourage them to participate in the discussions around their care?<br/>It focuses on the not yet existing (July 2020) context of the Child Brain Lab, a clinical research project that is being set up at the Sophia Children’s Hospital. Here, child patients will undergo a wide variety of tests related to their brain that will take up several hours of their time. Their test results will then be discussed by the clinician and the child-patient family. Without the right supporting design, the Child Brain Lab (CBL) is subject to many of the issues that child patients generally face: Not being able to comprehend the conversations between parents and doctors, not getting the chance to voice their own needs and opinions and suffering anxiety about if, how and why clinical tests will be conducted. This project started with a broad context analysis. This included reviewing the literature, observing consultations, and interviewing a variety of healthcare professionals and child patients. This analysis revealed many possible reasons why child involvement is often limited. For example, it was found that by default, the child patients themselves typically take a rather passive role in discussing their care. These insights were then translated into design drivers that inspired several iterations of design ideas. Consequently, these ideas were used to learn from by discussing them with all main stakeholders of this project. This sparked a second iteration of design drivers that ultimately lead to the brain puzzle concept.<br/>The brain puzzle concept is a collection of avatar-based, personalized puzzle pieces the child patient collects as it goes through the CBL. Each piece comes with a different function and serves a different phase of the CBL experience: The first type of pieces shows the sequence of tests that will be conducted while the second type shows which brain functions those tests investigate. Before the consultation, the child patients also receive an indication of their test results in the form of stickers, which can be placed on the corresponding puzzle piece. With these stickers, both the clinicians and the children can indicate which part they want to discuss. These pieces are then brought to the consultation as a discussion tool and to structure the conversation with more regard for the child’s perspective. To evaluate this concept, a prototype was made and evaluated with child-patients, their parents, and their clinicians in over 17 interviews. The results show that the participants were unanimously positive about the overall design and they would like to see it being implemented. Especially parents and clinicians indicated that the concept would playfully guide the children through the CBL and enable them to discuss what they want to discuss. This thesis concludes by listing areas for improvement of the concept and discusses those in the broader context of informing children about their test results.","Design for healthcare; Value based health care; Child involvement in healthcare; Playful Interactions; patient experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In order to propose a more efficient, standardised and economic modelling approach, a partnership between RIVM/RWS and the 3D Geoinformation Group at TU Delft was launched in 2017, aiming to generate these height lines automatically from the available datasets, namely AHN3, BAG, and BGT, which are publicly available via PDOK for free. However, it was then proposed to prove that the paths between receiver and source points can be directly generated from a TIN without creating the height lines. The following report provides proof of concept to the hypothesis: ‘Using a TIN directly allows automated 3D noise modelling according to the guidelines of CNOSSOS-EU’. A code was written to generate the paths between receiver and source points using an LoD2 TIN. The paths were then checked visually and were fed to test_Cnossos software to prove their validity.

Post-socialist countries went through the period of transitioning to free-market and democracy, and this process resulted in hybrid institutional, social, and urban forms. As the global pressures intensify, countries need to employ development mechanisms that will ensure a more sustainable future and slow down the process of global warming. Transitioning to sustainability planning is becoming more urgent, as scientists warn that scenarios for the future in which the business-as-usual approach is carried out bring disastrous consequences to our environment. Many post-socialist countries, such as Serbia, are caught in a path-dependency ideology, trying to position themselves in a global economic network, thus ignoring the social and environmental issues. Current development in Belgrade is shaped by market-driven mega projects that are a result of public-private partnerships. There is also a lack of participation in the planning process, which is institutionally allowed. This leads to the development of the most attractive locations which are predominantly located at the riverfront. This kind of ad hoc development does not follow a comprehensive strategy and leads to fatal consequences such as – loss of biodiversity, social stratification, endangered heritage, loss of sense of place and ultimately: unsustainable development of the riverfront. This thesis provides an overview of the consequences that led to the present state that the country is in regarding urban planning and development. The goal is to examine the implications for transitioning to sustainable urban development, starting from the actual conditions of the Belgrade riverfront territory and the planning procedure in place. Urban planning is a political process that has certain values embedded in it. Instead of adapting the values to the existing procedure, the values should shape the process. The current government has a strong agenda which many citizens protest against and this is why the proposed framework for transition is meant to serve as a starting point for moving towards a comprehensive sustainable planning and development process that would provide real results in the actual state of the riverfront. The framework that is proposed is an altered urban planning process that approaches the riverfront territory holistically, through different scales. This has to be done through a participatory process in which the acceptance of limits, protection of existing qualities and regeneration play an important role. These guiding principles are applied to environmental, social and economic dimension to provide a comprehensive urban planning approach for the sustainable riverfront.","Post-socialist transition; sustainability strategy; Riverfront","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","44°48'25.5""N 20°26'32.2""E"

The passport visit plan conducts a holistic experience for visitors that it facilitates preparation before arriving, enriches interactions along visiting, and values takeaways to promote further communications between visitor and Liquid Studio by the ending. The project is initiated as: Creating interactive smart visit experience for inspiring studio visitors among multiple technology showcases around Demo Theme Park in order to promote new business possibilities. Analysis To build a tangible basis for further design processes, a research phase was initiated for gathering valuable insights around the Theme Park exhibition visiting context. It includes analysis on both internal and external perspectives for conducting design challenge statements with its context scope. Conceptualization Base on insights from analysis phase, a design goal is proposed as “Design an explorative, collaborative, and discoverable mixed-reality journey for Liquid Studio in-house visitors to enhance the sense of consistency during visiting tech demo exhibition”. Ideation, Conceptualization and Design activities were conducted accordingly. The ideation was also considered as a reflection for better preparation on later processes where the scope of the design was setted as to design a overall journey experience. A number of sub-concepts were generated which was then modularized into functional features and consisted into a 9 step journey flow. The flow was then used for validate whether the modules are useful along the journey or whether any part is missing. Storyboard was made for concept evaluation sessions for participants to walk through the journey along the storytelling. The sessions were executed for insight gathering that finally to conduct a journey solution that fulfils the design goal. Final Design According to the finding from analysis and conceptualization, the final design was conveyed with a concept overview, a journey flow and a journey map. To validate whether the design could match with the design gaol, two prototypes were made for user/visitor tests separately for the journey carrier, which is an AR (augmented reality) mobile application, and the using scenario as the participants are not able to visit the exhibition on-site under the corona situation. The final evaluation was addressed, and as a result, the design fulfilled the properties as desired quite well in general. As the project is part of the long-term development of the demo Theme Park for Accenture Liquid Studio, recommendations were made for later developments. As currently it is processed and proposed theoretically, it will need more insights from in field context researches.","Museum Experience; Exhibition; Augmented Reality; Mixed Reality; Interaction Design; Visitor Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In 2017, hurricane Irma passed the north coast of Cuba and destroyed the primary sea defense in front of the CTE, causing major damage to the plant. The power plant is renovated, and a new and improved sea defense is currently being constructed. <br/>The goal of this report is to answer the following question: to what extend is the power plant protected during extreme weather conditions and what improvements are needed to ensure that the power plant can remain operational during these extreme weather conditions? <br/>To determine what the hydrodynamic and meteorological effects are of a extreme weather event such as a tropical cyclone, a synthetic tropical cyclone is created. This synthetic hurricane must generate large significant waves in combination with a big storm surge, to have severe impact on the CTE. It must also have a significant probability of occurrence. To determine this normative synthetic hurricane, multiple synthetic hurricanes are simulated in Delft3D and XBeach and their corresponding return period is determined. As Irma significantly damaged the CTE, this hurricane is taken as the basis for all synthetic hurricane combinations. The hurricanes each vary from Irma in maximum wind velocities, forward speeds and their tracks. <br/>To simulate the physics of hurricane Irma, a spiderweb grid is created at the locations of the hourly best track of Irma. This is then used in the Delft3D model as input for the pressure and wind fields of the hurricane. The output of the Delft3D model is validated with recorded data of observations stations in the Gulf of Mexico. Recorded water levels and wind speeds of buoys near Key West are used for validation. XBeach is used to simulate the nearshore physical processes. XBeach can more accurately predict wave propagation and includes higher order processes in its simulation. As input for the XBeach model, the output of the Delft3D model is used.<br/>After running all the synthetic hurricanes in Delft3D, the five resulting normative hurricanes are run in XBeach. The synthetic hurricane that creates the largest significant wave heights at the project area is taken as a basis for the final design. This normative hurricane gives a maximum significant wave height of 8.8 m with a corresponding storm surge of 1.61 m at the location of the CTE. <br/>With these values a research on the current defense wall is done. Ultimately for a part of the sea defense an adjustment on the existing defense wall is proposed. A second but lower vertical wall with a bigger bullnose is placed in front of the existing one. This creates a triangular shaped stilling basin, from which the water can flow out at the seaside of the wall. For the other part of the sea defense no adjustments on the wall are proposed but an improvement of the existing drainage capacity is proposed. The existing drainage channel, which lies behind this section, is widened and deepened. Additionally, a drainage wall is built around the powerplant, which diverts the overland flow caused by intense rainfall into the drainage channel. <br","Tropical Cyclones; DELFT3D; Spiderweb; Sea Defense; Cuba","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","MP304","23.1, -82.38"

Intermittent water supply (IWS) is inherently inefficient. These systems foment health hazards and are expensive with an inherent low return on investment. Various causes and effects with positive feedback loops exacerbate intermittency. And building more robust IWS systems does not help because of rapid system degradation and high socio-economic costs render them unsustainable. Continuous water supply (CWS) systems are superior in every respect. Therefore, I view transitioning from IWS to CWS as the optimal choice for urban water districts. The general strategy to make this transition is to increase production and sharply improve the transmission capacity and efficiency of the drinking water system, the so-called supply-side approach. But because the supply side approach does not factor the underlying causes of IWS-- leakage and variable pressure levels, I used a demand-side approach for this study and designed a novel method, based on leakage theory with the application of district metered areas (DMAs). We tested this method on a case study performed in Accra, Ghana. The method is essentially a set of requirements and boundary conditions used to facilitate the transition from IWS to CWS from a demand-side perspective. A decision tree gives insight into the causes of IWS per DMA and the interventions required to reduce intermittency. Based on the foregoing, water engineers can build strategies to roll out a demand-side CWS systems in DMAs for an entire region. In our Accra study, we tested three DMAs using this approach with a focus on supply security. Data from those DMAs was collected and a top down NRW assessment was performed. We selected one DMA to collect and analyse flow and pressure data (minimum night flow, non-revenue water, billing, intermittency level, average zonal pressure). Furthermore, the supply conditions and proposed intervention (pressure adjustments) were hydraulically modelled for the district. Based on the DMA data, a transition strategy was developed for the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. We also assessed the applicability of the demand-side approach to other areas through a survey among water supply specialists. The study shows that gains in water savings at the DMA level to more than justify the costs of transitioning to CWS. In cases of high pressure and high real loss volumes, pressure management improves supply conditions for customers. And, after attaining CWS, water recovered from loss reductions can be redistributed into neighboring districts, increasing their water availability. Because hydraulic pressure dependent demand (PDD) modelling cannot model leakage accurately, it was not possible to evaluate leakage reduction interventions. And it was not possible to create a working hydraulic model to assess the effect of this DMA approach for the entire Accra metroplex because of limited data availability at a district level, leakage parameters that were difficult to verify with field measurements, and the lack of a proven hydraulic PDD software able to distinguish between domestic demand and real losses. In conclusion, the developed method looks promising. But two factors limited fully exploring its real-world application: (1) the absence of mature modelling software; (2) detailed water district data. Developing a working hydraulic modelling software was beyond the scope of an MSc. thesis. But such hydraulic modelling software should be developed to help water utilities with limited technical and human resources improve services. Further research is required into leakage component modelling and validation from field measurements, after which interventions can be more properly and easily applied.","Intermittent Water Supply; Pressure Dependent Demand; Transition; District Metered Area; Continous Water Supply; Ghana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Hekkenberg, R.G. (mentor); Duinkerken, M.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The shipping industry needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. In order to achieve this reduction, the shipping industry will be faced with stricter regulations that are currently unclear. The lifetime of a ship is about 25 years. As a result, it can be interesting to already take a possible refit to an alternative fuel into account, when designing a new ship. This study investigates which aspects of the ship’s design can be prepared for a refit to an alternative fuel, regarding a general cargo ship that starts sailing on LSFO and MGO. Due to the uncertainty in the future regulations, two possible scenarios are described. These scenarios are based on current regulations, known future regulations, the goals of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy and a well-to-tank (WTT) analysis. The first scenario allows carbon-neutral fuels and the second scenario only allows carbon-free fuels. Hereafter, different fuels are identified to be applicable in these scenario’s. Then the most relevant aspects of the fuels that have an impact on the design of a ship are identified. These are the way the fuel should be stored, the volumetric and gravimetric energy density of the fuel, including the system and finally the applicability of the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-Flashpoint Fuels (IGF code). Based on these aspects, the fuels are compared with each other and a qualitative matrix is formed which shows how difficult it is to refit a ship from one fuel to another. The three most promising fuel refits are selected for a further conceptual design. The most manageable fuel switch in the carbon-neutral scenario is a switch towards hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and the easiest in the carbon-free scenario is a switch to ammonia. Methanol is also selected, because, in the carbon-neutral scenario, it is relatively easy to refit to, and in terms of emissions, it does better than HVO. To evaluate the possible design options for an easier refit, a reference ship is used as a starting point. The properties of this ship are also used to define the starting requirements for sailing on LSFO and MGO. Subsequently, a design spiral is used to adjust the design of the reference ship, to prepare it as far as possible for the selected refits. It has been concluded that it is relatively easy to prepare the ship sailing on LSFO and MGO for HVO. Due to the lower energy density of HVO, it is recommended to decrease the sailing range after the refit, so that no further adjustments have to be made to the design of the ship. The ship’s range will be reduced by 8.6%. Because the ship has overcapacity, this has no impact on the sailing profile. For methanol, cofferdams could already be placed in relevant tanks. Double pipes can be laid to these tanks or a double duct can be installed. Unlike MGO and LSFO, methanol can be stored in double bottom ballast water tanks, so for example, cofferdams can also be placed in ballast water tanks. By preparing the ship, space will be lost due to the preparations, in order to meet the initial requirements, the ship must be 2.3 [m] longer. If there is refit in the future, the ship will not yet meet the requirements for methanol. In order to meet the refit requirements, the ship will have to surrender 40% of its range. Furthermore, 1.4% of the cargo capacity will have to be surrendered. It was concluded that, starting from LSFO and MGO, there was no point in preparing the ship for ammonia, because there are too many differences between the fuels. It could be interesting to build a ship for LNG in the coming years and then see if it can be prepared in the design for a refit to ammonia or hydrogen.","Alternative fuels; General Cargo Vessel; GHG emissions reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-09","","","","","",""

The social benefits, which include increased safety, mobility and productivity, are the main factor that drive this growth. One of the most difficult problems that vehicle engineers must solve to develop autonomous vehicles is the motion planning problem. They must solve the motion planning problem for environments ranging from unstructured to structured, such as parallel parking up to high-speed highway driving. Current literature presents many implementations that solve either the structured or unstructured planning environment or a small range of environments. Yet, the generic implementation of a single motion planning method, that can plan in the full range of environments, is still an open question.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","This thesis is centred around the problem that heart failures become more common when other dis-eases could be treated better. Although surgery could fix the immediate effects of heart failures, therecovery after the surgery is hindered by the heart not being able to pump enough blood. There aresolutions available but they are not implemented due doing more harm then good to the heart. Thisthesis will look into a way to aid the recovering heart by applying a compressional force to the outsideof the heart. Previous attempts on fixing this problem could not follow the motion of the heart closeenough due to the lack of actuation resolution, i.e. the local differentiation of the actuation applied tothe heart. This caused damage to the heart muscle, which in the end causes death due to too littleblood flow.Due to lack of actuation resolution of the previous solutions, the focus of this thesis will be on the dis-tribution of the actuation and not the actuation to the heart itself. A baseline for the requirements wasneeded to make an informed decision about the different solutions to distribute the actuation. This wasdone using a MatLab script. This gave the actuation characteristics of a compression of 20 percent witha pressure of 20 [kPa] when a compression jacket of 5 [mm] thickness around the heart is used. Therelative high compression together with the pressure directed the solution for such an actuator towardsfluids.Common fluid actuators that would have a high local differentiation in actuation require lots of pumpsor lots of valves, both of these options have as a downside that they take up to much space. That iswhere smart fluids have an advantage by decreasing the size of a pump or a valve by including thefluid in the active volume. Two of these smart fluids that seem promising are; Ferrofluids and magnetorheological fluids. Ferrofluids are activated by a magnetic field and will cause a change in internalpressure similar to how gravity affects internal pressure in a fluid. The only difference is that it couldbe about four to five orders of magnitude stronger over small distances of about a tenth of a millimetre.The magneto rheological fluid changes its viscosity in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fieldwith the change being related to the strength of the applied field.The thesis will discuss the use of Ferrofluids as an active fluid in a pump, and magneto rheologicalfluids, MRF, as the active fluid in a valve. Ferrofluids are not feasible to be used as individual unitsas they barely meet the requirements of 20 [kPa] of pressure with the flow rate needed to actuate thejacket, without taking the fluidic losses of such a jacket into account. Whereas the MRF based valvecould achieve a pressure difference of 20 [kPa] over the valve, without being of the limits of the op-erational value of the fluid. This is enough to have both a fully opened valve and a closed one usingthe pressure needed from the requirements. Therefor the thesis recommends the further research intoimplementing a full actuation system for a heart assist device using valves based on MRF.","Magneto Rheological fluids; variable valve; MRF; fluidic actuators; Ferrofluids; FF; pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","","","","","",""

This transition is one of the major challenges our society faces during the coming decades. Development of high-efficiency photovoltaic solutions at reasonable costs will help accelerating the transformation of our energy system. In this respect, perovskite solar cells are very promising due to their outstanding opto-electronical properties and low-cost fabrication. Obtaining a complete understanding of the device physics and charge transfer mechanisms inside perovskites is crucial for further device improvements. This thesis focuses on the notorious hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells. So far, this remarkable phenomenon has usually been explained using ion migration, despite the lack of clear experimental evidence. We implement a simulation platform of perovskite solar cells to analyse the charge transfer mechanisms among energy states including those with energy within the forbidden bandgap. We evaluate transient behaviour and identify the limiting physical mechanisms. To explain anomalous hysteresis in perovskite solar cells we use a novel approach in which charge accumulates near the material interfaces due to defects with relatively low capture cross-sections. Defects in lead halide perovskites create shallow sub-gap energy states, that act as charge carrier traps. Near the interfaces, this leads to accumulation of trapped charge carriers, effectively screening the electric field inside the perovskite layer. This reduces the device performance. A slow release of trapped charge due to low capture cross-sections results in hysteresis in the current-voltage curve at commonly used scan rates. TCAD Sentaurus is used as a platform to simulate J-V scans of a planar non-inverted architecture based on the archetypal perovskite MAPbI3, with TiO2 as electron transport layer and spiro-OMeTAD as hole transport layer. This thesis presents a systematic study of different trap distributions, both in the spatial and energetic domain. The capture cross-sections, densities, energy levels and locations of traps are varied and also the effect of scan rate is analysed. This work analyses both tail state defects and deep defects, based on reported values in literature. It is found that defects near the ETL/perovskite interface potentially cause anomalous hysteresis in the current-voltage curve. These defects have their transition energy around 0.25 eV and are possibly attributed to iodine interstitials.","Perovskite solar cells; Modeling; Hysteresis; Sentaurus TCAD; Defects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-17","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Currently, the construction industry needs a huge input of raw materials that is not only causing waste problems but is also decreasing environmental quality. A large part of construction and demolition waste (CDW) is being downcycled, losing economic and material value. This creates not only a need but an opportunity for a construction and demolition (C&amp;D) industry based on circular flows and biobased materials. The goal of this project is to produce a vision with strategies for the implementation of circularity along with the resolution of spatial conflicts in different scales.An overview of the spatial, technical and economic needs of the C&amp;D industry and its externalities in urban environments was made. This resulted in the understanding of the spatial conflicts currently taking place between these two spheres of development and the potentials that circularity will have on jobs and consumption patterns. From this, a proposal for a circularity model with three components was formulated: an open network with a central production hub and peripheric logistic hubs, an open program for these hubs that adapts to current and future needs, and open edges that create interactions with their built and social environment.","Province of South Holland; circular economy (CE); construction and demolition waste; construction hub; open scales; urbanisation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Embedded devices are ideal malware targets for several reasons. Firstly, Internet-connected devices are inherently more exposed to remote exploitation. Furthermore, embedded systems are notoriously difficult to update, regularly leading to unpatched vulnerabilities. Last but not least, many such devices operate in a mostly unattended fashion, which means that the timely discovery of compromise is unlikely. Hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. Hardening of the already deployed embedded devices that are connected to the internet is examined in this research. A method capable of automatically generating and enforcing security configuration based on the embedded system’s set of functions has been designed and implemented. The proposed system is dynamic, automatic, and seamless. Hardening level of such devices is measured through recognized security benchmarks. The objective is to harden the product as much as possible while maintaining its full functionality. This study concerns embedded systems using custom Linux-distribution software. The thesis was conducted in cooperation with Atos. OpenScape Business series X (OSBiz X) was used as a case study. OSBiz X is an embedded system used as a telephony center, with more than 150.000 systems already deployed worldwide. Implementing the system described above on OSBiz X significantly increased the hardening-level of the product while its functionality remained intact. Due to the case study’s scenario results, Atos plans to integrate the proposed system into the next version of OSBiz X’s official release. Finally, ongoing research about other internal organization’s products that could greatly benefit from this approach is being conducted.","embedded systems; IoT; hardening; security; Linux","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Running experiments has shown an immense impact to the revenue of companies in industry, however this type of experimentation comes with a lot of pitfalls, of which some that can invalidate the entire experiment. This thesis describes the impact these pitfalls have on the work of experimenters at ING, a global bank, by performing informal interviews with practitioners and performing a survey with 52 participants. Next, building on existing solutions, a set of solutions is proposed to solve these pitfalls. To determine if these solutions solve the problem and will help the experimenter, these solutions are validated in the same survey. This thesis shows that experimenters are well informed about the existence of pitfalls and believe that almost all should be resolved, with the exception of competitor safety, which is believed to not be important. There are many promising solutions to these pitfalls which experimenters rate as helpful. The best rated solution was ”Enforcing the correct experiment duration”. Almost all respondents perceived the solution to (slightly) help the experimenter in performing their experiments. Finally, this thesis creates a roadmap for evaluating these solutions in a real-world scenario.","Continuous Experimentation; A/B Testing; Experimentation; Pitfalls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""
