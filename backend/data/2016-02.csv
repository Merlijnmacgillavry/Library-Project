(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor)","2016","This graduation assignment aimed to improve product launch from within PSL through analyzing PSL’s innovation process and evaluating the existing structure. The research was conducted through observation, interviews, and creative sessions. Many areas of improvement were identified. PSL does not have a product manager, thus no one is responsible for communicating the product story across departments and product stages. A team called PAT (product advisory team) was created to advise decisions on product development. The role and responsibility are not agreed upon within PSL. This ‘decision making’ team is composed of market specialists. When the ‘market’ is leading, innovation is inclines to more incremental. Within PSL innovation process, there is only one stage gate. Designers present the design to the PAT after the product’s detailed rendering is created. This costs PSL designers higher investment of time and more commitment. The new innovation processes changes the linear process to a circular process. One additional stage gate is added before the current decision making stage to validate the product’s strategic-fit. A stage is added at the end to re-evaluate all products within the catalogue. PSL’s strengths are identified to being flexible Structurally. Due to their close ties with Chinese manufacturers, they were the “go-to” for customization. These existing strengths were not used to it’s greatest potential. PSL’s electronic products require more explanation, it’s functionality and unique selling points were not easily conveyed to PSL’s clients. To improve the product story’s communication inside of PSL, small incremental changes were designed throughout the innovation process such the a product overview poster and storyboard. This report also proposes a new strategy and strategic activities. Currently PSL customizes by putting 2D logos on products, the concept is to take customization to the next level; through collaboration with 3D printing and standardizing product customization, secure PSL in the future promotional market while expanding markets by creating new potential buyers.","New product innovation process; Product launch; organisational structure; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Multi-axial stress state is the stress state where several stress components exist. Multi-axial fatigue assessment is very challenging due to complex stress state and component geometry. Many multi-axial fatigue assessment criteria simplify the complex multi-axial stress into an equivalent uniaxial stress. Critical plane method which bases on observation of fatigue cracking initiation and propagation behavior of smooth specimens is widely used. The critical plane is usually determined by maximizing the amplitudes and/or values of some stress components, and the parameters obtained on the critical plane are used to analyze fatigue strength. For uniaxial loading, rainflow counting method can be used to evaluate the complex variable-amplitude stress history. However, this method cannot be applied to non-proportional multi-axial stress state. The so-called Path-Dependent Maximum range (PDMR) method is proposed by Zhigang Wei and Pingsha Dong to evaluate complex multi-axial stress history. This method uses the calculated effective stress range at mapped normal-shear stress space to evaluate the fatigue damage. The aim of this thesis is to explore the feasibility by applying PDMR method to determine equivalent stress amplitude for critical plane method. PDMR matlab algorithm is programed based on publications in literature. Several experimental results related to high cycle fatigue strength for smooth specimens, subjected to proportional or non-proportional loading with different mean stress values and various stress ratios, are analyzed by employing the proposed PDMR based critical plane method and other criteria available in the literature, such as Findley, McDiarmid, Matake, Dang Van, Papadopoulos and modified Carpinteri-Spagnoli (C-S) criterion. The proposed method shows a good estimation capacity as compared to the aforementioned criteria. Fracture plane orientation determination method is proposed based on observation of plotted equivalent stress amplitude on each material plane calculated by PDMR method. This method shows better estimation capacity than average maximum principal stress method used in modified C-S criterion for the experimental data examined.","PDMR; Critical plane method; Fracture plane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Structural design and analysis","",""

(mentor); Garsadi, R.

For this purpose water quality and flow measurements from the raw water intake, flow measurements along the transportation to the treatment plant and the water quality at the treatment plant were done to obtain an integral view of the current situation. The raw water intake from Cikalong area in the south of Bandung was observed in this project. It comes mainly from the outlet discharge of PLTA Cikalong, the hydropower plant (3000L/s – 8000L/s with better water quality), and alternatively from Cisangkuy River (500L/s). The contribution of these two sources, along with their water quality and the efficiency of presedimentation tanks, were investigated through field measurements and historical data observation. This study gives the indication that the quantity of water is generally sufficient but it needs some mechanisms to have a daily constant flow. A seasonal cycle storage mechanism and presedimentation tanks behaviour are recommended as an alternative solution and a consideration. The new transmission pipeline, Pipa Baru, was focused for research in this project. This pipeline had three main problems which included the occurrence of bursts, never functioning at full capacity, and lacking accurate flow measurements. These problems were tackled through field measurements and simulations. For the first two problems, the results showed that air stagnation may be the cause of the problem. The accuracy of flow measurements can be overcome by more training and calibration of the SCADA, the online measurement device of the plant. Concerning the water quality, even when most of the times the effluent of PDAM Badaksinga Treatment Plant meet the environment and legal standards, the system is not robust and vulnerable to any change in the influent due to the lack of monitoring, therefore the frequency of monitoring should be increased, moreover online devices should be installed. Furthermore, the removal of certain parameters should be studied in the future and special attention should be given to the PAC dose to know the exact amount of aluminum that is dose in order to enhance the performance of the following units (sedimentation and filtration) and consequently to produce a better and safer water quality. It should be noted that the expertise of the operators is an advantage, so that training should be given to the operators in order to update the knowledge. Furthermore, in relation to the operation and equipment more improvements, investments and preventive maintenance need to be done to enhance the performance of the complete water supply system of PDAM.","Bandung drinking water treatment plant; PDAM Badaksinga; raw water intake; transmission pipeline; water quality","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Result 2 - RVO/FDW Bandung Water Supply Upgrading Project","Multidisciplinary project","-6.890831, 107.611367"

(mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (mentor); Santoni De Sio, F. (mentor)","2016","Bitcoin is a peer to peer decentralized virtual currency, released online through a research paper in 2008 by the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto . Around the world, many countries have cautiously taken minor initiatives to address the regulatory issues, due to its rising popularity. The regulation is not seen as complete, due to the nascent and novel outlook of bitcoins, requiring time for analysis and empirical evidence. The main research question that needs to be answered, is how can governance ideas be conceptualized to support technological decentralization while protecting against illegal activities? To answer this question a literature review is performed across academia, digital media and conferences/ independent authors. From this study, ideas for frameworks are consolidated, to effectively regulate bitcoins through coalitions, analyzed with game theory. This is complemented with a theoretical understanding of the technical, political, economical and ethical issues surrounding the bitcoin ecosystem. The thesis is broadly divided into seven chapters, where initially an introduction is presented which presents the structure of the thesis, along with the research problem and its motivation. This is followed by an exploration of bitcoin's current framework, which forms the most important theoretical part of the thesis. Here, its system design, strengths, challenges and solutions to regulatory issues are detailed. Also, how bitcoin is being perceived globally across twenty nations, is presented. Being an economic system, there has been reasonable skepticism, as to its validity as a money system. This is presented in the next chapter, where its economic structure is first explored, which is followed by an analysis of bitcoin from the perspective of both Austrian economics and Keynesian economics. Further, to understand the overall validity of a new system, the ethical impacts must be considered. This has been analyzed through two frameworks in this thesis. Firstly, as a large social experiment and secondly through a standard ethical impact assessment. Also, bitcoin has always been portrayed in the popular press, as promoting only decentralization. This is critically analyzed, from classical ideas of noted humanitarian M.K Gandhi and British economist M.F Schumacher. As a follow up, a modern exponential technology framework presented by Singularity University, is offered as a comparison. It is observed that bitcoin excels in the material aspect of decentralization (while requiring centralized intermediaries), but struggles in the spiritual aspect, as detailed. The major regulatory solution offered in this thesis, is through coalitions among stakeholders. For clarity, seven crisis situations are highlighted with the different payoff's (relative power) among the different members assigned, with proper reasoning and a demo game explained. Finally, conclusions and favorable recommendations are drawn , along with sections on research limitations, future research and reflections. Also, an appendix section on the major digital media outlook, is presented for two years (Aug'13- Sep'15), to explain its popular portrayal and the opinion of the general audience. Overall, it can be said that it is still early days for bitcoin and there are major critics in every domain. Consistent issues with taxation, anonymity tools like TOR promoting illegal activities, its inherent economic value and price volatility exist. The internet as an information medium, is probably the only suitable precedent for bitcoin which has been far more successful than anticipated. The benefits of bitcoin from exponentially lower transaction fees, global banking outreach, framework for decentralized asset ownership transfer and its ability to impact the Monetary Policy of ruling governments have been appreciated. Further, as a practical lesson, policy makers could see mainstream bitcoin as promoting a balance of centralized and decentralized intermediaries. Any effort at promoting an extreme ideology could have long term negative effects. Also, offering technologies like bitcoin a fair trial run would be far more appropriate than inviting legally controversial use. With over hundred competing digital currencies, the question is certainly not if, but when they would be competitive with fiat currencies.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Peer to Peer (P2P); Colored Coins; Game Theory; Coalitions; Appropriate Technology; Technology Decentralization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Innovation","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Stappers, P.J. (mentor); Clavel, K. (mentor); Will, N. (mentor)","2016","Delft University of Technology is playing a leading role worldwide in the development of open and online education. The university started to offer online education since 2012 and in September 2015, the first 60 online students followed paid online courses. The university expected to accommodate two thousand paying online students in 2017. In order to create an excellent student experience for these online learners, a “warm touch” is proposed by the university corporate offices (from the presentation, “TU Delft Online Learning”, 2015). To comply with the goal of the university in providing better online education for the growing number of audience worldwide, the client of this project, the TU Delft library, wants to contribute to the online learning experience of this new customer segment. The goal of the assignment is to create a “warm touch” which shows the hospitality of the university and makes the online learners feel being part of the TU Delft community. The “warm” is further defined by research on students’ needs and wishes in the online learning environment. Interviews with different stakeholders were carried out to understand (1) the experiences and needs of online students and (2) the process of delivering an online course. A service blueprint was made to show how the learners interact with the current course system (front end) and how the stakeholders are involved in supporting the system (back end). Based on this service blueprint, four opportunities were identified for the library to provide their service for the online learners. This project focused on the direction of how the library can enhance the online learning experience by facilitating the interaction between the online learners during the course. User research was carried out to gather insights from the online learners and define the “warm touch”. Observations were conducted on the current forum of four ongoing online master courses in September 2015. It is shown that online learners were open to talk about who they are and they showed interest to each other’s professions and motivations. There is a need for seeking connection and recognition. However, the TU Delft online learning platform did not provide a space encouraging these discussions. Thus, the design goal is to create a warm environment which they can share their personal luggage. The interaction qualities in the warm environment includes (1) belongingness and support; (2) self-expression and appreciation and (3) curiosity. Based on these insights, the following concepts were created: (1) Talk of the week; (2) Co-note and (3) Give a hand. People who had online learning experiences were invited for individual sessions. The aim of the session was to gather more insights on their online learning experience and evaluate if the concepts meet the design goal. The third concept “Give a hand” was selected to be further developed because it enables the learners to express their feelings and emotions and encourages them to help out other people or ask for advice. With all the insights gathered from the evaluation, the final design of an online course platform came to form. This course platform creates a welcoming feeling for the learners and gives a sense of togetherness in the beginning. The user profile evokes curiosity about other learners and broader knowledge. After completing the course of the week. It enables the learners to express their feeling about the course and connect to other learners The design was prototyped and evaluated with the users and the stakeholders. The user evaluation was conducted with six people who had online learning experiences to understand if the design meets the design goal and gather further recommendations. The evaluation consisted of two parts: an individual user testing and a group session. The design received positive feedback and the results of the evaluation gave a lot of rich insights into the design of how the learners connect to others. Another evaluation was held in the Extension School with other stakeholders in the online education. All the suggestions was collected and recommendations for the further design was made. Recommendations for the library and the roadmap of implementation were proposed in the end of this project.","online learning; design for interaction; experience design; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

This master graduation project aims to improve understanding of how knowledge integration can support Philips’ innovation processes. This research is relevant as existing research has studied innovation processes in a different context, and because this study relates different ways of integrating knowledge to different innovation processes. In this explorative case study at Philips Design five workshops are analyzed and fifteen pre-, and post-workshop interviews are conducted. Moments in which knowledge is integrated during the workshops are identified and coded to allow for qualitative and quantitative analyses. This study finds that the occurrence of three different knowledge integration activities, ‘Transfer’, ‘Transform, and ‘Transcend’, are distributed differently across different phases in the innovation process. Furthermore, this study identifies how knowledge integration is influenced by experts, facilitators, and workshop elements. In contrast to earlier studies, I conclude that there is not one type of knowledge integration activity that is most preferable, but that the knowledge integration activity should be aligned with the phase of the innovation process. In addition, this study adds value to design practitioners as it identifies opportunities for stimulating knowledge integration during workshops, and describes outlines for developing relevant tools that support innovation processes.","Knowledge integration; Digital innovation; Workshops; Knowledge; Strategic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Visser, P.J. (mentor); Bisschop, F. (mentor); Yuan, J. (mentor)","2016","People all around the world live and work in low-lying areas. Low-lying areas have to be protected against high water levels in rivers and at sea by a water protection system (e.g. by dunes, dikes and barriers). Dikes are an important component within water protection systems. Generally, dikes are described as elongated naturally occurring or artificially constructed (earthen) structures, which prevent flooding of the hinterland. Dikes are mainly found along seas, estuaries, rivers, canals, lakes and water courses. Many dikes contain sand cores, which are covered by a protection layer (e.g. clay, asphalt etc.) to prevent erosion of the core. Unfortunately, there are times that one of the many known failure mechanisms of a dike causes (local) dike failure, exposing the sand core to the water (Rijkswaterstaat, 2006). A so-called initial breach is formed. Once the sand core is no longer fully covered by a protection layer, the sand core start to erode and the core is prone to fast breaching (Visser, 1998). The water flowing through the breach is eroding the sandy sediment and the breach keeps growing, which can have significant economical consequences and can also lead to loss of human life and animal life. Several options to retard the breaching process have been investigated by Lemmens (2014). Based on laboratory experiments, especially a mixture of sand and bentonite (in the core of the dike) seems to significantly slow down the breaching process. Thus far, this theory has only been tested for relatively low flow conditions in the order of 1 m/s. However, during the breaching process high flow conditions in the order of 2-10 m/s can be reached (Visser, 1998). In this study it has been investegated how bentonite would reduce the erosion velocity of sand under high flow velocity conditions. Erosion experiments were carried out in a tilting flume. In these tests, the volume percentage of bentonite additive, the diameter of the sand and the mean flow velocity were varied. All erosion experiments were performed under supercritical flow conditions. Falling head tests were executed to determine the effectiveness of adding bentonite to the core of a dike. Adding a certain amount of bentonite to sand certainly yields a high decrease in permeability. It appears that the most significant decrease in permeability happens with bentonite contents up to 6% of the volume. Results from the direct shear tests show no significant differences between sand mixtures and sand-bentonite mixtures with a bentonite content up to 10%. Hence, sand-bentonite mixtures with a bentonite volume content up to 10% still show sand-like behaviour. This indirectly indicates that the strength characteristics of a dike core will not be altered. The observed behaviour in the experiments enhances the development of an adapted erosion function. The erosion function of Van Rhee (2010) - including the effect of dilatancy and the permeability - has been adapted to the experimental data of the erosion tests to get reasonable accurate model results. The adapted erosion function has been implemented in the BRES-Visser model. The BRES-Visser model - which decomposes the breaching process in five different phases as proposed by Visser (1998) - calibrated with data from the Zwin’94 experiment, has been used to model the performance of the bentonite additive in the core of a dike. The effectiveness of the bentonite measure has also been tested in the Borssele case study. To conclude, sand-bentonite mixtures are able to significantly reduce the erosion velocity. The effects of dilatancy and a decrease in permeability have a large impact on the erosion velocity. This is already noticeable at very low percentages of added bentonite.","Erosion at high flow velocities; flume experiment; breach development in sand dikes; BRES model; Sand-bentonite mixtures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering - NUS","",""

(mentor)","2016","Radiative heat transfer plays an important role in many industrial applications, particularly when high temperature heat transfer is involved. Many theoretical analysis and experimental investigations have shown the occurrence of interactions between radiation quantities and turbulence, mainly due to the non-linearity between radiative heat transfer and the temperature field. Turbulence Radiation interactions (TRI) are characterized by the effect of turbulence on radiation and vice versa the influence of radiation in the modification of the turbulence field. While the first effect of TRI has been extensively studied, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of radiation on temperature variance is still lacking. In addition radiative heat transfer, and thus TRI, present largely different effects based on the optical thickness of the participating media. Therefore, a thorough study regarding the impact of the optical thickness of the flow in characterizing TRI is required. The present work consists of an investigations of TRI in a non reactive turbulent channel flow based on three optical depths (? = 0.1,1,10). A Finite Volume Method for radiative heat transfer has been implemented and coupled with a DNS code for turbulent channel flow. A fictitious fluid has been simulated with both grey properties and variable absorption coefficient based on the Planck mean absorption coefficient of water vapour. The effects of radiation on the thermal fluctuation field are described and discussed. The results show a strong impact of the optical thickness of the media on the temperature fluctuation field, depicting a transition in TRI behaviours. While for a low value of optical depth (? ), a dissipative effect of TRI on temperature variance is reported, for high optical thicknesses the appearance of large thermal structures in the core of the channel is observed. In particular the distinct and contrasting role of absorption and emission in modifying temperature variance is highlighted and analyzed. In addition the study of TRI is parametrized on the Planck number.

(mentor)","2016","At present, on the aviation market a need exists for lighter and more efficient aircraft than the ones dominating the airspace today. Beside the reduction in operating costs and air pollutants of these new generation aircraft, this reduction in fuel use can result in several advantages with respect to the performance of the aircraft like increased range, increased payload capacity, decreased of take-off field length and decreased take-off noise. The present thesis is an effort to contribute to this reduction of fuel use by performing a gradient-based aerostructural wing optimization of a modern high-speed transport aircraft, the Airbus A320, for minimal necessary fuel weight while maintaining its range specification. The novelty of this work is the use of the Individual Discipline Feasible (IDF) architecture instead of the traditional Multidisciplinary Feasible architecture. Using the IDF approach the disciplines within the aerostructural optimization are completely decoupled. The consistency of the system as a whole is maintained by the use of equality constraints to equate the output of one discipline to the input of another. No coupled sensitivity information is required because of this decoupled system. This makes the system not only simpler, but also provides more freedom in software choice for the disciplinary analyses. Furthermore, the time to perform optimization is reduced as the work of making the system consistent is removed from the computationally expensive individual disciplines and put it in the hands of the cheap optimization algorithm. The CFD solver SU2 is used within the aerodynamic discipline to deform the grid, calculate the flow properties and gain sensitivities of lift and drag with respect to surface perturbations of the wing. The Euler model is used and the viscous drag component is calculated using a separate estimation. For the structural discipline the FEMWET software is used, providing the structural data including the static aeroelastic deformation of the wing. The optimization design variables are selected to be the angle of attack, the exterior shape of the wing, being the airfoil and planform shapes, and the thicknesses of the equivalent panels representing the internal wing box. The problem is constraint by compression, tension, shear, buckling and fatigue failure modes. Moreover it is constraint by a minimum aileron effectiveness and a maximum wing loading. The aerodynamic analysis is performed under cruise conditions while the wing structure is analyzed under the critical load cases of the reference aircraft. The optimization algorithm chosen is the Sparse Nonlinear Optimizer, based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming optimization algorithm. The optimization resulted in a reduction of the aircraft fuel weight of 11%. This has been achieved by reducing induced drag through an increase in span and an improved lift distribution, by reducing wave drag by improved airfoil shapes and by reducing wing structural weight by a reduction in wing sweep.","aerostructural; MDO; wing; optimization; SU2; FEMWET","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor); Kaelen, J.W.E.N. (mentor); Veerbeek, N. (mentor)","2016","The aviation industry is known for its rapid growth, and fierce competitiveness. To keep up to the competition, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) needs to extend its infrastructure, resulting in the development of the new A-Pier. The development of the new A-Pier provides an opportunity to KLM to implement improvements in apron design. Safety is highly prioritised in the turnaround process at the apron. At the same time, an aircraft at the ground does not generate any profit, in fact it only costs money. To reduce operational costs the turnaround time needs to be reduced. This results in the following problem statement: How can the new aprons of the A-Pier be arranged in order to increase safety, be efficiently suitable for wide and narrow body aircraft, decrease turnaround time and fulfil the needs of the distant future? A lack of space at the apron is seen as the main occasion of safety issues and inefficiencies. These issues are caused by increasing aircraft sizes, larger gatehouses for CSNS and a raising demand for quick turnarounds. Quick turnarounds result in more ground support equipment that is simultaneously in operation at the apron. This led to the following hypothesis: The lack of space at AAS is the main cause of safety issues and inefficiencies. To provide an answer to this question, the project is divided in two phases; an analysis phase and a design phase. The analyses phase has been carried out by following the deconstruction steps of the VIP method. Three separate researches (observations, interviews and benchmarking) were conducted to answer the hypothesis. During the design phase, continuous iterations between the logistically desirable and the technologically possibly, were made. Therefore the steps of the Basic Design Cycle were followed. As final step, an implementation plan has been written. This is done according to the theory of Operational Excellence and a practical implementation of this theory, named Fitness Factory. The observations indicated redundant driving movements at the apron by the transporter and re(coupling) of dollies and baggage carts. This decreases transparency at the apron. An interview with business unit managers has been carried out, to obtain in-depth knowledge about the operation. The respondents stated that behaviour of operators is of more influence on the improvement of safety than the available space. This is indicated by examples such as parking discipline and speeding. Some respondents referred to behaviour as culture, because the shown behaviour became accepted. Next to that the respondents pointed out that there exist many inconsistencies in apron arrangement at AAS. A qualitative benchmark study added up to these findings. Top?views of several (competitive) airports were retrieved through Google Maps. The actual surface area of the WB aprons at AAS, are on average larger than at other airports. But compared to other airports, the aprons at AAS are less transparent due to inconsistencies in apron design. The benchmark also showed that the reachability of the aircraft is compromised by a lack of service roads at AAS. The findings of the three researches have led to the refutation of the hypothesis. AAS does not face a lack of space but a perceived lack of space. The perceived lack of space is caused by the combination of inconsistent apron design and the behaviour of operators which compromises the comprehensibility of the aprons. Note that inconsistency in design and behaviour amplify each other, as undesired behaviour triggers safety issues that are solved by introducing incremental changes. This introduces new inconsistencies in procedures or apron design. To turn the tide, standardisation of apron design and accompanied procedures and equipment is required. In order to aid operators in working safe and efficient and to maintain transparency at the apron. The existing conceptual drawing of the A?Pier has been evaluated. The substitution of height restraint non?motorised equipment into service roads, as shown, is a first step. But service roads on their own will not solve the identified problems. Service roads do increase the reachability, which decreases risky manoeuvring actions, and thus increases safety. But without the area to preposition dollies and baggage carts, the transparency remains low and the perceived lack of space will just increase. Therefore, the assigned racking area under the pier body should be utilised differently. By using the racking area as a feeding buffer for both the in- and outbound process, the aprons will become more transparent. The buffer functions as a push-pull interface between the baggage basement and the cargo facilities. This enables to dispatch the load based on the actual turnaround status. In return this requires additional operators to control the buffer zone and to bring the load to the apron. Considering the theory of Operational Excellence this is a logical step, because a proper mix of buffers should be used to deal with variety in the processes. The sandcone model explains how each addition should add to the foundation, safety, and subsequently provide benefits to reliability, flexibility and eventually efficiency. Hence that, the service roads and buffer zone enables all this. Due to the gained transparency at the apron, manoeuvring actions are reduced, which increases safety. The pull based process enables to maintain transparency at the apron, because unused dollies and carts are not parked at the apron anymore. This allows operators to drive the same route to the aircraft each time. It also eliminates waiting times for operators before they can drive to the desired spot, increasing the efficiency. The buffer concept has been further developed. So called ‘scan lanes’ can be added to the buffer. These scan in the incoming load of the buffer. Based on the load sheet the load is automatically assigned to a buffer lane. The system could also determine if it is more efficient to split a load among lanes. This enables to optimize the release of loads to the apron. Decreasing the driving movements between the buffer and apron and at the apron itself. The scan lane is beneficial to the safety and efficiency at the buffer and the ground handling process at the apron. Hence, the steps of the sandcone model. The scan lane also allows to partly eliminate the introduced occupancy of the buffer. Further improvement to safety and efficiency can be made by implementing autonomous driving vehicles. Several working principles of autonomous vehicles have been considered. Due to the congested and uncontrolled environment at airside, autonomous vehicles based on a LIDAR system are favoured. These systems are currently expensive but will become affordable in the near future. Also the reliability of these systems and accompanied software will increase. Besides a LIDAR system allows to implement additional functionalities. These are called ‘on?the?go prioritising’. Based on the three?dimensional image of the system the status of the turnaround can be monitored real-time. This allows the vehicle to make rational decisions that increase the responsiveness. The implementation of the scan lane and autonomous vehicles largely depends on expensive software development. It is questionable if these costs are justified by gained savings on accidents. An implementation plan has been made according to theory of Operational Excellence and Factory Fitness. This plan divides the concept in a pilot phase, three implementation phases and a future phase. The pilot is needed as a proof of concept and to obtain tacit process knowledge. The plan describes how each phase adds to the layers of the sandcone model. The last phase explains how this eventually enables to reduce process time. But this does not decrease turnaround time. Before this concept is able to decrease turnaround time the processes below the wing need to become part of the critical path. According to the Theory Of Constraints this will occur in the future. Actually, there are some situations in which this is already the case. Therefore it is relevant to be able to reduce process times of processes below the wing. Beyond all, the concept provides the means to directly increase safety and efficiency at the apron. Further research should prove if the technological additions are financially feasible. Above all tacit process knowledge from the buffer can be obtained. This knowledge can be used to set the focus on possible improvements, to attune the process of the baggage handling in the basement, with the turnaround process. Overtime this allows to completely eliminate the buffer, and enable a just in time delivery of load from basement to apron. But for now the focus should be on direct improvement to safety. Achievable by implementing a combination of service roads and a feeding buffer under the A-Pier.","Apron Design; Turnaround; Ground Handling; KLM; A-Pier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

For that purpose, an exhaustive computational MHD analysis is a necessary step. This master thesis investigated the possibility of using PLUTO to estimate the ideal-MHD of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber. PLUTO is a freely-distributed and modular code for computational astrophysics that, although not originally programmed for engineering applications, has demonstrated great adaptation capabilities: implementing the boundary conditions to effectively emulate a magnetic flux compression reaction chamber has eventually been possible. Besides, the attained results are in accordance with theoretical projections and previous numerical analyses. However, the outcomes pointed out that ideal-MHD could be an over-simplified model: relativistic conditions, that are not properly reproduced by the ideal-MHD equations, have been identified in several locations of the computational domain. In addition, some aspects of the real system physics have yet to be thoroughly investigated as well as mathematically described. Therefore, further investigations are required. According to this research, no other computational analyses of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber (i.e. the latest and most promising magnetic flux compression reaction chamber concept) have been found in the literature. Therefore, the results hereby reported contribute to the body of knowledge of plasma physics and nuclear fusion applied to space propulsion.","nuclear fusion; plasma; reaction chamber; magnetic flux compression; computational mhd; mhd; rmhd; numerical analysis; computational analysis; magnetic nozzle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","SSE","",""

(mentor); Elkhuizen, W.S. (mentor)","2016","Fine art has been with us for centuries. The first known paintings have been made about 40,000 years ago on cave walls. Paintings represent a very fundamental human need to creatively express ourselves. Fine arts still plays a pivotal role in cultural and creative expression. The interest in the paintings of old, as well as the paintings of today, remains unparalleled. It is no wonder that museums across the world continue to be visited by millions of people. New production methods have created the possibility to print a painting including its texture and structure. These reproductions are hard to distinguish from the original in specific viewing conditions. They are therefore easily considered a threat to original works of art. There are a number of questions that arise with this new technology that this thesis tries to answer: What is the added value of 3d printed reproductions for museums? How can a 3d printed reproduction be put to a new use? How can this technology help in improving the experience of fine-art? The purpose of this thesis is to design a new museum exposition setup using 3d printed reproductions. Analysis has shown that there are a number of great benefits to 3d reproductions. They can be used in almost any environmental condition and they have a short production time. They are able to be touched as these reproduction use a special material that does not damage on touch. Analysis has also shown that most users spend little time looking at paintings when visiting museums. Most visitors do not know how to look at a painting. It is possible to conclude that 3d reproduction can play a major part in filling the information gap in museums. A design goal was formulated to design an exhibition setup using 3d reproductions that provides specific information about the content of the painting and technique of the painter. Due to a different set of physical and visual characteristics new possibilities of interaction with a painting have been researched. The final design is an exhibition setup that allows users to touch the reproduction. It is an interactive exhibition setup where users can receive information on the part of the painting they touch. This stimulates visitors to look at the details in the painting and gives them a structured way of analysing a painting. The light is dynamic; it follows the hand of the user. The frame incorporates LED’s that create grazing light at the location of the hand. This means that the perception of texture and relief improves and enables the 3d reproduction to be used to its full extend. Of this design a prototype was build and a user test was held to validate the design. The interactions that occurred were the intended interactions. The lighting for some people was sub-optimal and a redesign of the lighting system was made.","smartframe; design; paintings; exposition; 3d-printed; fine-art; reproduction; exposition setup; lighting design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); De Schutter, B. (mentor)","2016","Current autonomous steering controllers are designed based on either optimal control strategies or on average human driver steering behavior. Individual drivers may wish to steer differently than those controllers do. Such conflicts can be mitigated by customizing individual steering behavior. This thesis aims to develop a method to individualize human-like steering controllers, using a parameter estimation technique for a human-like steering model based on a global optimization algorithm. With this technique, the accuracy of estimated parameters is investigated in order to help to understand the nature of driver steering behavior. A linear human-like cybernetic steering model inspired by human physical steering control actions is used in this thesis. In this steering model, seven parameters relate vehicles states to steering activity, of which the parameter values can be interpreted in a physically meaningful way. Preliminary research has demonstrated that this model structure enables parameter estimation of model parameters. But the current implemented parameter estimation technique of the steering model still needs requirements on initial guesses of the parameters and the accuracy of estimated parameters is under-investigated. In this study, parameter estimation of the steering model is investigated by formulating an optimization problem to minimize the prediction error. To deal with the nonlinearity of the optimization problem, a genetic algorithm is complemented with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This thesis presents the parameter estimation process in two steps. In the first step, the steering model generates a data set by simulating it with known parameters. This data set is used to estimate the steering model parameters and the results are compared with the known parameter set. Accurate parameter estimation results could not be reached in this first step, which is shown to be caused by over-parameterization of the steering model. Two parameters in the neuromuscular system of the steering model are then simplified to mitigate the over-parameterization problem and the other five parameters are remained. These five parameters can be estimated accurately by examining the metrics of VAF and Euclidean distance after the model simplification. In the second step, a simulation data set from a different validated human-vehicle model is used for parameter estimation to demonstrate the algorithm. It is shown that with the simplified steering model, the proposed parameter estimation technique can estimate consistent parameter values with good VAFs. A cross-validation test is also implemented to give the corroborative evidence to indicate over-parameterization of the steering model.","Parameter estimation; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor)","2016","Athletics is the sport that arguably requires the highest number of sundry, dedicated products in the world - a complete competition requires at least 55 different pieces of equipment. These products have to uphold the highest standards, sometimes literally; however, every single product has its shortcomings that reflect back on the quality, speed, and atmosphere of a training or competition. This graduation thesis explores how designers should manage athletics product design, and redevelops one of those products. Research will show that the process of acquiring athletics equipment is tedious and complicated. The end users, being mostly the officials, trainers, and athletes, only have limited involvement and influence in this process, mainly due to local governments having vested interests in the accommodations, and building processes put out to contractors and consultants. While this is not necessarily destructive, it does introduce stakeholders with interests different from or even opposing to those of the end users. Analysis amongst 111 of these users, focusing on the equipment at an athletics accommodation, is disconcerting; not one product is not mentioned as having been problematic in use. Although not all equipment issues have the same amount of influence, it shows potential space for designers to jump in and redesign the products. The research exposes a number of user requirements that need to be addressed on top of the already extensive list of IAAF-regulatory requisites. The take-off board is selected as most suitable product for redesigning. Not only does it yield top results in the user survey, but it is also an athletics-specific product that is extensively used in training and competitions, has additional requirements by other stakeholders, and is simple on first glance but complicated when looking below the runway surface. The redesign will tackle several issues, most notably the painstaking process of switching boards during a competition, and the current system for detecting foul jumps. A prototype is constructed to test the design, and two characteristics specifically: can users properly operate the mechanics, and does the product feel trustworthy? The user tests will confirm the improvements made to the product, and provide pointers towards the final product design. The program of requirements is set alongside the product, validating the design. In conclusion, the thesis will provide designers with advice on how to develop products for the athletics market taking into account all stakeholders, based on the theoretical and practical outcomes of this project.","athletics; long jump; triple jump; track and field; sports; design; take-off; board","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Based on the recently developed mimetic spectral element method, we propose an effective numerical scheme for solving three-dimensional periodic incompressible Euler flows, which spatially preserves mass, kinetic energy and helicity. Preserving multiple integral invariants numerically will significantly contribute to the stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme. We start from the introduction of differential geometry and algebraic topology with which we then set up the mimetic spectral element method (the mimetic framework). With the mimetic spectral element method, physical variables can be expressed in more physical forms and the discretization error will be eliminated as much as possible. After that, we turn to Euler equations. We first rewrite Euler equations as inner oriented Euler equations and outer oriented Euler equations in terms of differential differential forms. Meanwhile the conservation laws of mass, kinetic energy and helicity based on these new forms of Euler equations at the continuous level are proven. Then, according to expressions of kinetic energy and helicity in the mimetic framework, we convert the inner oriented and outer oriented Euler equations into two weak forms and then spatially discretize them using the mimetic spectral element method in a unit 3-cube ([-1,1]^{3}) domain equipped with a cell complex given by the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre grid. Afterwards, interactions between the two spatially discretized weak forms and discretizations of time derivative terms are constructed, which eventually gives rise to a solvable, mass, kinetic energy and helicity spatially preserved, fully discretized system. The scheme then is tested with a periodic flow. In summary, the mass conservation is automatically achieved by taking the divergence free flow condition exactly into account. In addition, with proper discretization of the momentum equation and vorticity equation both kinetic energy and helicity are spatially preserved at the discretization level.","mimetic; Euler equations; conservation; discretization; mass; kinetic energy; helicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

A socio-hydrological study was carried out to determine the extent to which sorghum, the dominant rain-fed crop in Sudan, is susceptible to this climate variability and how this susceptibility is spatially distributed over the region. A simple 1D soil moisture balance model was developed to generate approximations of the reduction on the relative yield of rain-fed sorghum. After the model was developed, farmers were interviewed in order to identify their perception of crop yields over the same specific period of time. The main outcome of the farmers’ interviews was crop yield ratings. Together these two variables show that the severity of climate variability on rain-fed sorghum yields varies latitudinally across the country, and diagonally (NW-SE) along Al Khartoum, Al Jazirah, and Al Qadarif states. The interview results show a clear distinction between the villages with regards to how farmers rated their crop yields over the years, which coincides well with the biophysical products from the model. An observed difference in distribution concerning the intermediate susceptibility values of the two data sources can be explained with the capital indicator being influential on farmers’ crop yields. It is thus capital that enables farmers to cope with climate variabilities. The model outcome shows different biophysical susceptibilities for each 5 km2 and reveals that the northern states will generally remain more susceptible to crop failure than the southern villages given the lack of precipitation that reaches these areas. Even though the study did produce some conclusions, there is still room for improvement. Socio-economic indicators can be further investigated considering their influence on crop yields. Together with an improved model these indicators have the potential to form a very powerful tool in predicting food security issues before they arise.

(mentor); Schiele, A. (mentor); Smisek, J. (mentor)","2016","When tasks need to be performed in remote, potentially inaccessible and/or hostile environments for humans, it is often more convenient to send a robot. Such environments are often only partially known, and therefore not suitable for fully autonomous robots to operate in. In these situations teleoperation can be used, which combines the problem solving capabilities of the human with the precision and durability of the robot. Robots are extremely good at performing accurate precision motions, whilst humans are best at making complex planning and decisions. Having even partial knowledge of the environment allows the provision of guidance to the operator via haptic forces. For example, this haptic guidance can assist an operator with accurate alignment of a connector for a complex connection mating task. It has been shown that haptic guidance, which is based on models of the environment, can improve task performance. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted assuming that the intended goal of the operator is known to the support system a priori and that the environment is perfectly known. In the context of space robotics, there are often multiple tasks available in the environment and the task the operator intends to execute is not known a priori. Without a goal, the support system is not able to provide the operator with haptic guidance. Moreover, due to the unstructured nature of the environment, uncertainties can result in a mismatch of the models with respect to the environment. This results in an error in the haptic guidance that is provided to the operator. The goal of this thesis is twofold: Firstly, when multiple possible goals are accessible in the environment, assistance can only be provided when the intended goal of the operator is known to the support system. Since the intention of the operator is not a physical signal that can be interpreted by the support system, it can not be communicated with the support system without performing additional actions. The operator is for example able to specify the intended goal to the support system by using a GUI or through speech. However, by utilising the control inputs of the operator to predict the intended goal, these additional actions can be skipped, which results in a more natural, seamless and faster teleoperation system. In this thesis, several prediction methods are validated and compared in simulation and by using real teleoperation data. Secondly, depending on the magnitude of uncertainty the task performance can be reduced. In order to robustify the task performance of precise manipulation tasks in the presence of uncertainty, an outer admittance loop has been implemented on an impedance controlled KUKA robot. The outer admittance control loop changes the set point of the impedance controller based on contact forces and torques. This method is implemented and validated on an experimental setup by doing peg-in-hole insertion experiments. Moreover, from this method information about the environment can be extracted in order to update the models that are used by the support system online, resulting in improved haptic guidance provided to the operator. It has been concluded that memory-based prediction methods pose as a feasible method to predict the intentions of the operator in a teleoperated reaching task. Moreover, robustness to uncertainty is not increased by making the slave more compliant. However, pseudo-admittance control poses as a feasible method to robustify task performance against uncertainty of the peg-in-hole task and can be used to reduce uncertainty by using estimated information of the environment. For future research, both methods should be validated in a human-in-the-loop study, on a teleoperation system where the operator is provided with haptic guidance, so the effects on the prediction method and the force feedback can be studied.","teleoperation; haptic shared control; uncertainty; error; assembly; haptic guidance; impedance; admittance; control; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Parker, J. (mentor)","2016","The purpose of this thesis is to develop a methodology to design trajectories in order to achieve high ecliptic inclinations for the purpose of solar observation. Solar observatories have been launched since the dawn of the space era, and are still being designed today, however the solar poles have seldom been imaged. This is partly because gaining high ecliptic inclinations requires extremely high amounts of energy. The 1990’s Ulysses probe was the only spacecraft to ever do this, at the cost of a complex mission, involving limited payload and short observation times. Several studies have been done to address the issue, some proposing to use low-thrust propulsion and others multiple gravity assists of the inner planets. The mission presented in this thesis will use both to reach as high inclinations as possible while maintaining short times of flight and short orbital periods. Low thrust trajectory simulation is a very prolific area, and can be done in a number of ways. Since this research was performed at the University of Colorado, a low-thrust trajectory tool was already made available. This is modeled after the Sims-Flanigan approach, which approximates low-thrust trajectories with a finite number of small impulsive ?V maneuvers. A large drawback of the tool is that it necessitates initial conditions to allow the optimizer to converge. The bulk of this research consisted in devising multiple gravity assist strategies and constructing methods of providing such initial conditions. The chosen gravity assist strategy consists of two phases. The first is the approach phase; here the spacecraft makes multiple transfers between Earth and Venus, with the final objective of increasing relative velocity at the arrival planet of the sequence. The initial conditions are provided using a novel version of the Gravity Assist Space Pruning algorithm. This analyzes the multiple gravity assist sequence one fly-by at a time, sequentially pruning away infeasible transfers, which reduces the bounds for the next leg. Next is the resonance phase: the spacecraft makes multiple resonant fly-bys of the arrival planet, gradually increasing inclination with each pass. Initial conditions here are provided using an original method which models rotations of the V? vector on a sphere, whilst representing fly-by maneuvers and resonances as parametric circles on the sphere. The final results analyze and compare five different gravity assist scenarios, ultimately selecting a simple Earth-Venus transfer, followed by 4 resonant Venus gravity assists.

(mentor); Pisanò, F. (mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor)","2016","Drilling in the complex and rough conditions in the Arctic areas is challenging. The challenges include harsh environmental conditions, spill recovery, high operating cost, relatively high risk, limited choice of drilling units, international (environmental) laws/regulations etc. The existence of recoverable oil and gas resources have been known for decades, but only in recent years oil companies began drilling operations offshore in the Arctic areas. Existing drilling units for the Arctic region are not optimized for the year-round operation. Oil companies and operators are interested in developing a new concept for drilling operations in the Arctic areas. In shallow waters, an option is to drill with a gravity-based structure. Huisman Equipment has developed a mobile-gravity-based unit, called the ""Arctic S"". The Arctic S is a circular drilling unit which, in addition to the floating mode, can be positioned at the bottom of the sea in shallow waters. The unique shape of the hull makes Arctic operations in deep-water depths possible in combination with moorings and dynamic positioning. In gravity-based mode, the Arctic S will be positioned on the bottom of the sea. The Arctic S can operate from a draught of 12 till 29 meters. The oil companies are interested in a solution which would allow to operate at water depth up to 40 to 50m. The aim of this research is to investigate the possibilities for the Arctic S to operate in a water depth up to 40 to 50m. One of the most obvious options is to design a substructure with a footprint function, for example a pedestal or template. The soil-foundation capacity must be sufficient to resist the forces which are originated from ice-loadings and the gravity forces of the Arctic S. It is important that the structure is stable under typical ice loading conditions. To improve the stability of the structure, a subsea template could be used which would also increase the operating water depth. The project aims to provide a conceptual design of a new solution for the Arctic S unit and then to explore the interaction between ice loadings, gravity-based-template and foundation. This investigation consists of two parts. First part is to design a substructure for the Arctic S which makes it possible to increase the operational water depth. Different aspects are considered, including specific locations, mobility, safety, construction, installation and decommissioning, etc. Second part is the soil-foundation capacity analysis. According to FEM analysis the soil-foundation capacity and the maximum foundation capacity are determined. The FEM analysis were carried out using PLAXIS 2D and PLAXIS 3D. Based on the results from the FEM analysis, the feasibility of the foundation for this concept can be assessed.","soil-foundation interaction; plaxis; ice loading; Gravity Based Structure; FEM-analyses; arctic; design; foundation capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Bottom founded structures","",""

The main issue that hampers the design of antibiotics is a lack of appropriate tools to study the molecular biology of C.difficile in great detail. Insight into the function of DNA replication genes and the protein they encode might eventually lead to the development of specific inhibitors that can be exploited as drugs. By means of CRISPR-dCas9 system, we designed and engineered a construct that is capable of targeting specific replication genes and silence those genes. Our design is composed of a nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein and a customized single-guided RNA (sgRNA) with a 20-basepair complementary region to target replication genes in C.difficile. Co-expression of dCas9 and sgRNA can efficiently block transcription by interfering with DNA replication process. We developed a set of conjugative plasmids that carries appropriate Pveg-sgRNA targets to repress CD0001 (dnaA) and CD1214 (spo0A) genes in C.difficile. We also built a construct with dCas9 and its inducible promoter (Pcpr) that can be conjugated into C.difficile.

These breakwaters are required to protect ports, banks and habitat areas from significant wave action. Moreover, upcoming Design & Construct contracts drive contractors to perform the consideration of alternatives and design themselves. Therefore, knowledge about the design of breakwaters is highly preferred in those cases. This leads to less of outsourced work and reduction in engineering time. In 2013, contractor Hakkers designed and constructed a small-scale breakwater in IJburg, Amsterdam. The constructed breakwater was built in inland waterways where the magnitude of the boundary conditions are limited (for example, small water depth and wave heights). Compared to coastal areas with more significant boundary conditions, this leads to less detailed structures without crown wall or multi-layers, to breakwaters with smaller dimensions and to other breakwater alternatives (for example, synthetic and reef breakwater). The goal was to develop a comprehensive method for a quick selection of a breakwater alternative in Dutch inland waterways. The method had to provide knowledge about breakwater designs and support a factual assessment of breakwater alternatives. Furthermore, the EMVI (Economical Most Beneficial Registration) tender approach would be included as well, since it is more frequently applied to civil engineering projects. This implies that the focus is on an effective breakwater and an efficient design procedure.","breakwater structures; method of consideration; inland waterways; decision making; the Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

They can lead to fatal accidents but still many people do it. Instead of banning smartphone activities in the car it could be better to allow the driver to be connected in a safer and more responsible manner. The conflict between the need for safety and being connected forms an important problem in the design of in-car interfaces that should be solved wisely by taking all factors into account. This project aims to create a solution that avoids critical situations and improves the safety of the interaction.    An analysis of the context, user needs and safety issues is done to get a full understanding of the problem. This analysis provided some key insights. The driver needs its full focus for the driving task nevertheless the workload and required attention of the driver depends on the situation, which varies a lot along the trip. Integrating some of the smartphones functionalities in the car its infotainment system provides opportunities for safer interaction. Nevertheless, secondary tasks while driving are never completely safe. The driver, while paying attention to the road, may get many notifications from various media and simultaneously get information from other in-car systems. Drivers have a lot of difficulties to resist the temptation to message and act responsible.    The designed solution called Sophia is a partner for safer connected driving. It is a next generation assistant for in the car that aims to reduce the of information overload towards the driver. This is done by tailoring the timing and hierarchy of information form the car and the user’s smartphone and to the situation. There is one place in the center of the head up display with the most important information that adapts to the situation. Incoming messages can be delayed in difficult driving situations and appear through any sound to ensure the system does not trigger the driver engage in the messaging activity like a sound would normally do. The user can interact with Sophia in a natural way by using voice or use the simple and familiar buttons on the steering wheel.    The interface was prototyped to evaluate and refine the design. A user test was done in a driving simulator to evaluate the design in a realistic setting while the user is occupied with the driving task. The interaction proves to be an improvement to the use of a smartphone. The active behavior of Sophia requires additional research to check whether it achieves the desired effect and further design it for additional situations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The superiority of ACM’s in terms of strength, ductility, and durability marks it as high potential replacement of traditional concrete. The growing expansion of ACM applications and technical experience gained in the last two decades in counties including Japan, Germany, Austria, Australia, USA, Denmark, Canada, France, and the Netherlands results in new frontier of cement materials used in infrastructure. The economic feasibility of ACM’s has been demonstrated in footbridges, outstanding bridges, and large pre-cast series. Furthermore safety and durability of ACM’s, especially of Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been proven encouraging further research efforts. This research is one part of an ongoing research under the supervision of Professor D.A. Hordijk at the Technical University of Delft on the application of ACM’s in infrastructure. The biggest potential for new infrastructure with ACM’s is in precast girders and thin plates. Throughout utilizing the excellent properties of ACM’s like UHPC, a new lighter- weight, durable, efficient, and adaptable superstructure has been developed in this study to replace the existing traditional design of bridges in the nearby future. One example of the approach taken in this thesis is the benefit of long life-cycle. Due to dense matrix, which prevents the ingress of detrimental substances apply UHPC selectively in the superstructure where it required to sustain high level of durability. Another example of the mindset of this thesis is lightweight design, means material distribution follows the forces distribution. In this thesis the outcome of an extensive material study was an overview of the ACM’s properties, time depended behavior, non-linear behavior, design standards, and field of application. Based on the material study different parameters are analyzed to enhance the understanding of the behavior of structure with ACM. It has been found that structural elements from UHPC are far more efficient then their corresponded traditional concrete structures. The maximum crack size is significantly lower, the slenderness is much higher which result in higher efficiency and reduction of the dead loads. Also the shrinkage and creep of ACM’s is studied. The time-depended imposed deformation of UHPC elements (plate, flange, truss member) with different sizes cause stresses in the model ends up as transverse cracks when the deformation is restrained. Based on the drawn conclusion of the parametric study, the design stage of the new ACM superstructure was initiated complying with requirements & boundaries according to the NEN norms and SETRA (French recommendation for UHPC). The new superstructure is 35% lighter than traditional solution, with efficient material distribution, built only from concrete, with elegant simple solutions. The low reliability of the fibers as replacement for reinforcement well-thought-out in the design. Some suggestion for future research in the field of modular adaptable superstructure have promising potential as far as applying ACM’s.","Advanced Cementitious Materials; Ultra high performance material (UHPC); Strain hardening Cementitious concrete (SHCC); Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC); Concrete truss; hybrid superstructure; Topological optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","For the purpose of flow analysis, the blade of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) can be divided into the root, mid and the tip regions. The flow in the root region is very complex and is affected due to the rotation of the blade and separation due to the presence of very thick airfoil sections and the higher angle of attacks. Hence, a detailed knowledge of the flow characteristics in the root region is needed to accurately create models that will represent the flow characteristics at the root. There exists an imbalance between the number of studies conducted to analyse the root region of the HAWT blade when compared to the tip region mainly because the contribution of the power production from the tip region of the blade. As the aerodynamic forces in the root regions are not as high as the forces in the tip region, there is a lower contribution to the aerodynamic forces from the root regions. The thesis attempts to simulate the flow in the root sections of the blades by means of simulations and experiments and also look at the effects of spoilers on the root sections of the blade. In order to create a model that can accurately represent the root flow, it was hypothesised that beheading the tip sections of the blade and then scaling it would lead to higher Reynolds numbers in the root span which would resemble closely the actual flow. It was seen that 37.5% of the span could be removed from the tip without any significant effects on the pressure distribution on the inner sections. Other designs such as variable tip shapes were also simulated. The blade was then scaled according to the wind tunnel specifications. The experiment design and the design of the blade was done by using the unsteady three dimensional panel code (UMPM) from TU Delft and the lifting line free vortex code (AWSM) from ECN. A model was then created based on the results of the simulation and the effects of the spoilers on the performance output are tested with wind tunnel experiments at the open jet facility of TU Delft (OJF). A parametric study was carried out to study the influence of spoiler location on the performance. It is seen that the addition of spoilers to the existing blade increases the performance of the wind turbine.","Windenergy; flow control; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-24","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Sudmeijer, K.J. (mentor)","2016","Interplanetary missions use gravitational slingshots around planetary bodies to adjust their heliocentric velocity or inclination for quite some time. The momentum exchange that can be achieved during a so-called gravity assist is limited by the mass of the planetary body. To overcome this limitation, an aerogravity assist was proposed, a maneuver where, in addition to the gravitational forces, use is made of aerodynamic forces to increase the bending angle of the velocity, hence increasing the momentum exchange. To investigate how efficient an aerogravity assist can change the interplanetary orbital inclination and velocity, a simulator was developed that is capable of simulating both the gravitational and aerodynamic forces on a vehicle during an aerogravity assist. It was determined that waverider is a type of vehicle suitable for aerogravity assists due to their large lift-to-drag ratio, which reduces the energy dissipation in the atmosphere. The aerodynamic characteristics of a number of waverider shapes were evaluated, after which the one with the largest lift-to-drag ratio was selected. Furthermore, a numerical optimization algorithm was used to develop a reference trajectory planner. Finally, a guidance algorithm based on the tracking of drag accelerations was developed and tested to investigate if the found trajectories would still be feasible under the influence of uncertainties and perturbations. The angle over which the trajectory is bent is a measure for the effectiveness of the aerogravity assist. Using the reference trajectory planner, the maximum possible atmospheric bending angle was investigated for an aerogravity assist at Mars and Jupiter for different initial velocities. From this analysis, it was concluded that extremely high velocities were involved in the aerogravity assist at Jupiter, which resulted in large mechanical and thermal loads. These loads would limit the achievable bending angle when the velocities become too large. For the entry velocities investigated, the velocity bending angle could be increased by 10% for high entry (80.0 km/s) velocities and up to 143% for a relatively low entry velocity (68.0 km/s). For an entry velocity of 80.0 km/s, the initial heat-flux peak exceeded the imposed constraints, which prevented the optimization algorithm of finding any solutions. The maximum velocity bending angle that could be achieved at Jupiter was 125.1 degrees at an entry velocity of 68.0 km/s. At Mars, although the heat loads were still larger than for an Earth entry, it is believed that thermal protection systems can be designed that could handle the heat loads. The velocity bending angle could be increased by 490% to 818% depending on the arrival velocity, with a maximum velocity bending angle of 178.5 degrees at an entry velocity of 9.0 km/s. To investigate the effect of an aerogravity assist on an actual mission, two existing missions has been selected: Rosetta for Mars and Ulysses for Jupiter. Although both spacecraft did not have an aerodynamic shape, which means an aerogravity assist could not have been performed during the actual mission, it has been assumed that these vehicles would have had the geometry of a waverider. During the investigation of Rosetta swing-by at Mars, a reference trajectory was generated to investigate the amount of velocity decrease that could have been achieved using an aerogravity assist. It was determined that the reduction in velocity could be increased by 167% with respect to a gravity assist: from 2.3 km/s for a gravity assist to 6.2 km/s for an aerogravity assist. For Jupiter, it was investigated if the orbital inclination could be changed using the aerodynamic force only. As the entry velocity exceeded 80.0 km/s, the heat flux constrained was removed from the trajectory optimization to allow the optimization algorithm to find solutions. It was possible to change the orbital inclination by 54.2 degrees, but at an extremely large heat load of 40,620 W/cm2. This reconfirms that even though orbital inclination changes are possible using aerodynamic forces, Jupiter is unsuitable for aerogravity assists due to the high velocities and large heat loads associated with an atmospheric maneuver at this planet. Finally, using the aerogravity assist trajectory found for Rosetta, which was generated generated with the reference trajectory planner, the guidance algorithm was tested. The guidance algorithm was capable of tracking a drag reference under the influence of uncertain initial flight-path angles. The maximum offset in velocity bending angle occurred for a steep entry and was 1.06 degrees while the maximum offset in hyperbolic excess velocity occurred during a shallow entry and was 1.88 m/s. Furthermore, the tracking was also successful when a more accurate atmosphere model and perturbations were taken into account. For this analysis, the maximum offset in velocity bending angle and hyperbolic excess velocity were 1.24 degrees and 2.14 m/s respectively.","astrodynamics; aerogravity; gravity; assist; optimization; hypersonics; waverider","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-24","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","Space Exploration","",""

(mentor); Popov, M. (mentor); Ndreko, M. (mentor)","2016","High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission system technology has recently attracted a lot of attention within the power system community. Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) HVDC is the state of the art HVDC transmission technology, which contains hundreds and even thousands of submodules. It is the modularity, scalability and efficiency that are the most striking advantages of the MMC HVDC next to the reduced harmonic content of the output currents and the smaller AC filter size. The Electro Magnetic Transient (EMT) type simulation of the MMC HVDC transmission system faces the challenge of large computation time. In tackling that problem, the efficient model offers great improvements in terms of simulation time duration without compromising the accuracy. One of the grid code requirements which is under discussion and is being proposed nowadays involves the control of the negative sequence current components by means of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC systems during asymmetrical faults. The VSC HVDC system should be able to withstand the negative phase loading during asymmetrical faults without tripping the converter. This negative sequence component can be controlled with the enhanced control scheme which is known as Negative Sequence Current Control (NSCC). It allows negative sequence currents in VSC HVDC either to be suppressed or injected depending on the choice of Transmission System Operators (TSO). Suppression or injection of the negative sequence current demonstrates a different response to the power system performance during asymmetrical faults. This MSc thesis discusses the NSCC implementation using the efficient model of MMC HVDC transmission in the PSCAD / EMTDC. This thesis shows that the suppression of the negative sequence current (it is commonly applied by vendors) by the MMC HVDC converter leads to reduced negative sequence current components. With only the positive sequence current present, three phase currents appear as balanced during asymmetrical voltage conditions and so the converter is able to withstand the asymmetrical current fault. However, although this is beneficial from the power electronic component perspective, it has the drawbacks firstly of the double frequency power oscillations in the DC link, and secondly of the increased overvoltage which occurs because of the rise in the negative sequence voltages. Furthermore, the fault currents at the converter terminals appear to be very low in the steady state values range. As an alternative approach, the injection of negative sequence current is studied here. The motivation for the negative sequence current injection is either the enhancement of AC system protection schemes or the suppression of double frequency harmonics in the output power during faults. These are the different ways and methods that are evaluated in this work. The adequate injection of the negative sequence current during asymmetrical faults shows improvements in the DC voltage and power ripples in different case studies. Both the NSCC suppression and the NSSC injection in relation to the MMC HVDC are tested in the point to point MMC HVDC, 3 terminal MTDC and 9 bus AC grid connected Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) with point to point MMC HVDC connection. In the 3 Terminal MMC HVDC applications, NSCC implementation shows optimal effects in the terminal where the single line to ground fault is applied. In the point to point MMC HVDC interconnection with 9 bus AC system, NSCC shows its effect in every section of the AC system. Moreover, the effect of NSCC is strongest near the MMC HVDC terminal in which NSCC is activated.","Negative Sequnce Current Control; MMC; VSC; HVDC; Transmission System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

(mentor)","2016","This dissertation presents an ultra-low power (ULP) phase-domain RX architecture for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications. By 2020, there will be up to 10 to 100 billion wireless sensor devices connected to internet-of-things (IoT)[1]. With the increasing demand on prolonging the battery lifetime, the power consumption of the RF transceivers for such applications has been dramatically reduced in the past few years [2][3]. However, the cost of replacing/recharging the batteries will become a bottleneck for massive deployment of the remote wireless sensors. Therefore, continuous innovation on power and supply reduction of the IoT RF transceivers is needed to extend the battery life time or one step further to achieve complete autonomous operation using energy harvesting. A phase-domain single-channel RX, proposed in [4], transforms the analog-I/Q signal processing into digital-phase processing by combining a phase-rotator based phase tracking loop and the sliding-IF architecture. It demonstrates an approximately 40% power reduction compared to the conventional Cartesian RX architecture. However, it still requires multi-phase generation hardware and suffers from the image rejection issue. The proposed direct frequency demodulator (DIFDEM) RX has a zero-IF architecture and uses minimum possible analog circuitry, which allows it to avoid image issue and achieve low power consumption simultaneously. Instead of phase rotator, the DIFDEM RX uses digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) as a feedback element in the phase tracking loop. Further, to meet tight adjacent channel rejection ratio (ACR) and frequency tolerance specifications of the BLE, DIFDEM employs a 3rd-order elliptic filter and an automatic frequency noise cancellation (AFC) loop. Post layout simulation results indicate that DIFDEM RX can achieve -89 dBm sensitivity and -20/-30 dB ACR at 2/3 MHz, while consuming <1700 µA current at 0.85 V supply. It also meets the BLE frequency tolerance specification of ±150 kHz.","ultra-low power; Bluetooth low energy; receiver; GFSK demodulator; phase-tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering","",""

In combination with the increased awareness for sustainability, the interests in the coastal zone become integrated and complex. Integrated Coastal ZoneManagement (ICZM) becomes increasingly important to satisfy the diverse societal needs in the coastal zone. Along sandy shorelines multi-value sand nourishments are therefore potentially valuable and feasible solutions. An example of amulti-value sand nourishment is the Sand Engine in theNetherlands. This innovative 21.5Mm3 mega nourishment was developed in line with the Building with Nature (BwN) design philosophy. To create value with multi-value sand nourishments for other endangered coastal zones in the world, a design methodology for multi-value sand nourishments is necessary. In this research a design methodology is developed that integrates the socioeconomic environment in order to design sand nourishments for the societal needs and determine their feasibility. To create optimal values for society with sand nourishments, the physical and the socioeconomic environments are integrated in the design cycle. The physical environments of sandy shorelines provide functions, and the desired values depend on the socioeconomic environment. To create an overview of the potential values of sandy shorelines, functions categories are defined: culture, economy, food resources, infrastructure, nature, safety, tourism & recreation and water resources. Sand nourishments aim to increase the functionality of sandy shorelines for one (or more) of these categories. In the developed methodology, the physical and the socioeconomic environment are integrated in the design cycle by quantifying the sandy shoreline function categories with indicators. In this way the functionality of the physical environment is translated to potential values for the socioeconomic environment and the societal needs are translated to benchmarked indicators for the physical environment. An application to Gold Coast’s Palm Beach in Australia illustrated that the developed methodology supports the design of multi-value sand nourishments. The most potential solutions for Palm Beach are assessed based on their feasibility in terms of finance and stakeholder commitment. At strategic level, the most potential was allocated to the solution to increase the sand buffer. At conceptual level, the concentrated nourishment was considered to be supported the most by the government and the businesses. An increased surf quality for experienced surfing, and therefore increased value for tourism & recreation of Palm Beach and the Gold Coast can be created with this solution.","Integrated Coastal Zone Management; Building with Nature; the Sand Engine; sand nourishments; sandy shorelines; design methodology; functions; values; feasibility; Palm Beach; Gold Coast; Australia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Costs associated to unscheduled and excessively prudent maintenance can contribute significantly to an airline's expenditure. Due to the complex nature of aviation related operations, reliability practices have been limited. In an attempt to improve component reliability, i.e. reduce maintenance-related costs, a new strategy was proposed which pursuits new avenues w.r.t. reliability modelling. The strategy focusses on identifying operational factors affecting component reliability and assessing whether these can be used to reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences (i.e. failures). Currently, reliability models are limited to exponential distributions, which assume hazard rates remain constant throughout the component's operational life. Studies have shown that time-independent Proportional Hazard Models (PHMs) could improve overall reliability, however, due to poor data, this was not verified. In this solution, the benefits of both time-independent and -dependent PHMs are assessed. Furthermore, underlying hazard functions were supplemented by introducing: normal, log-normal, logistic, exponential, Weibull, and gamma distributions. To address repairables, restoration events were simulated using Kijima type II General Repair Processes (GRPs). This project would not have been possible without the cooperation of QantasLink that supplied the data required. Results obtained from analysing historical data of the top ten components w.r.t. unscheduled removals indicated that adopting new maintenance schedules, derived from the proposed reliability models, could reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences by approximately 37% while limiting the increase in Mean Time Till (next) Repair (MTTRep). The variables identified by the solution were validated using literature, however, due to variable reduction and data limitations, the exact nature of component failures is yet to be established. Undeniably the potential benefits of adopting the proposed strategy are extensive. Nonetheless, numerous assumptions were introduced to overcome challenges imposed by the complex nature of the data. To overcome these challenges, recommendations and suggestions were proposed for the future development of airline reliability practices.","Reliability Modelling; Predictive Maintenance; Airline Operations; Decision Support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Operations","",""

The main barriers of zero-energy refurbishment of existing nonresidential buildings appear to be financial rather than technical, next to a number of other extrinsic factors that do not stimulate such an investment. While a business case for new zero energy buildings is believed to exist, controversial opinions can be found with respect to refurbishment of large buildings. The present research aims at identifying the factors that affect the feasibility of the zero energy refurbishment of existing commercial buildings, while suggesting a number of ways to create the business case addressing the Dutch market. Through the analysis of case studies and interviews to real estate investors, the research identified the financial and technical barriers encountered today to undertake deep energy retrofit. Subsequently, the design interventions needed to refurbish a Dutch office building and meeting the net zero energy target were evaluated using a software complying with the Dutch standards NEN 7120. A risk analysis, with Monte Carlo simulations, showed the influence that some design aspects, energy price and landlord-tenant agreements have on the business case. The study has concluded that a business case considering the energy savings alone is hard to convince investors. However when the design provides additional benefits, such as increasing the property value, the refurbishment can become feasible.

Understanding the behaviour of the cone resistance in layered deposits and correcting the cone resistance is believed to help finding a solution. In this research numerical models are presented to simulate the cone resistance in deposits with multiple layers. Using numerical models a range of correction factors is determined for different soil compositions, concluding that correction factors for the cone resistance depend mainly on the ratio of characteristic resistances of sand and clay. Physical modelling has been performed for validation of the numerical models and for correction factor determination. Layered samples were artificially built and tested using a cone, which besides measuring cone resistance also contained a friction sleeve and an u2 pore pressure transducer. Cross-sections have been made of tested samples to obtain an indication of the penetration process. Since a limited amount of test results were obtained complete validation was not possible in this research, although the available test results could considerably well be simulated using the numerical models.

(mentor)","2016","Urban freight distribution problems vary in nature and can be characterized as economically, environmentally or socially grounded. Urban freight distribution operates in urban areas were space is in short supply. These residency areas are the homes of many people. Since most vehicles still drive on conventional energy sources, greenhouse gas emission is a big problem in cities. Safety and noise issues regarding old vehicles operating in urban areas also have a negative impact on liveability of cities. The social need to sustain urban freight distribution and to develop and improve the urban freight distribution system in high-density urban areas is large. The concept of sustainable developments can be divided in three principles, which include economic growth, social equity and environmental protection. The context of urban freight distribution is rather complex. This complexity is created by the multi- actor context of urban freight distribution and the fact that stakeholders do not always carry (social) cost and benefits both. Cargo owners and distributors are at the centre of the system and possess a high degree of power to influence the UFD system and therefore cannot be left out of the process. Overall, they have a neutral attitude towards sustaining urban freight distribution (which is the main goal of the problem owner, the municipality of Delft). Their attitude is neutral since they cannot earn money directly in operating in a sustainable manner. This makes it difficult to implement solutions, create sense of urgency to activate involved stakeholders to make a change. ‘Maatwerk Distributie’ (MD) has developed a Last Mile Scan (LMS). This is a calculation model that is developed to calculate and predict cost structures of last mile trips in urban areas. The main purpose of development is to gather information for both the municipality of Delft as well as participants of the LMS, which are freight carriers. The research objective is: to identify the needs of stakeholders involved in the urban freight distribution system of Delft and to conduct a validation study on the LMS calculation model to be able to provide recommendations to the municipality of Delft on how to improve usage and extent lifespan the LMS model in order to sustain UFD in Delft. This thesis seeks to answer the main research question: How can data and information collected by the LMS be of extended usage to the municipality of Delft to serve the purpose of improving urban freight distribution taking into account all stakeholder interests such as economic inefficiencies, (greenhouse) emissions, noise nuisance, air quality, safety and congestion issues? The conceptual framework developed by Sargent describes the process of how to get from one entity to another (R. G. Sargent, 2005). This conceptual framework is an approach that could be applied and help in building valid and credible simulation model. This framework is used as guidance in the validation process of the LMS model. In order to ensure the LMS is validated properly the four phases of the validation process of the framework are conducted. These phases are conceptual model validation, operational validation, computerized model verification and data validity. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. Sensitivity analysis can support validation of a model. The LMS model uses different variables and constants to estimate and give an indication of cost of a specific shipping. The black box and the CRD are conceptual models developed to conduct conceptual model validation. The relations between variables used by the model are logic. Although only the direction of the relation is evaluated at this stage, the LMS model seems to be fairly reasonable, but simplified representation of the real situation. Total distance of a trip is calculated using an API tool developed by Google. This application ensures a high accuracy of distances since it uses precise coordinates to calculate covered distances. The formula used for calculating distance per stop is plausible because distance per stop can be calculated by multiplying the number of stops times an average distance per stop. Total time is dependent on driving and unloading time. Driving time is dependent on average velocity of a vehicle and total distance covered. The general dimension of velocity is kilometre per hour; velocity = distance / time; time = distance / velocity. This relation is correct. Unloading time is dependent on the amount of small and large packages delivered multiplied by a constant ‘average unloading time’ per package/pallet. Unloading time can be estimated by using a constant average time for unloading small/large packages because every unit takes time to deliver. Total costs are calculated and dependent on total time multiplied by cost per hour and total distance multiplied by cost per kilometre. This is a plausible method. The formulas to calculate distance, time and cost of a last mile trip and relations between variables used to conduct these calculations are plausible. The benchmark methodology and strict rules that Research Company Panteia practise ensures data collection is done properly and is significantly reliable. Input data on assumptions like velocities of vehicles and cost per minute and kilometre seems correct. Data collected throughout field research is less reliable. It is difficult to state that these assumptions correspond with real world values, because background information on scope of the field research is not available and unknown. Constants are still assumptions and not valid as truth-values. Operational validity is impossible due to a lack of real data, which makes it impossible to crosscheck output of the LMS model with real data from the field. Freight carriers themselves do not know the cost of the last mile. This validation step cannot be conducted. In the sensitivity analysis, all output variables are higher in case of scenarios where constants are higher. This means that all hypotheses are correct and that the LMS model gives the expected results in light of sensitivity of changing different assumptions. This argument strengthens validity of the model because, the model generates realistic and logic outputs when varying input variables and constants. Overall, concluded from the validation process the LMS model is a reasonable representation of the problem entity and conceptualization and computerized model verification phases have been conducted properly. Data validity is not valid (yet) and should be improved on certain assumptions and the scope of the field research that supports these assumptions can be more extensive. Field research methods are basic and the actual size of the research is too small to gather a significant and crucial amount of reliable information and data. Operational validity is impossible due to a lack of real data and lack of knowledge of freight carriers on the exact cost of their last mile trip. Therefore, the LMS model cannot be labelled as valid because not all validation phases are successfully completed. The majority of trips, around 75%, cover a smaller distance then 10 kilometres. This means that the most last-mile trips do not cover a large distance. The average time of all trips is 100 minutes. This is relatively long since the average distance covered in 100 minutes is only 8,59 kilometres. The cost of all trips is distributed evenly between 0 and 100 euro. The centre of gravity lies between 10 and 35 euro. The average cost of all trips is 36,56 euro. All scatterplots of output variables cost, time and distance show expected relationships and results. The structure of the LMS model is linear based. All formulas between variables used in the LMS model are linear. Outcomes of graphs of the relationships between distance, time and cost show linear featured as well. These types of relationships are in line with expectations and therefore strengthen validity of the LMS model slightly. Interesting output variables that are not directly calculated by the LMS model yet, but can be created by applying a simple mutation of output variables of the data sample. These mutated variables can be seen as criteria or key performance indicators to see how different freight carriers are performing. KPIs that are explored in this paragraph are cost per unit; cost per minute; cost per kilometre; cost per m3. The trend line of total cost of PostNL is a significant steeper linear relationship as the trend line of total cost LMS. This implies that as shipping load increases (packages + pallets) alternative shipping method PostNL is more expensive in comparison to a shipment conducted by a freight carrier internal. The intersection is interesting and lies at a shipping load of 5 units (packages + pallets). In the majority of cases (data points) a shipping load of 5 or smaller (relatively smaller shipments) are cheaper to be shipped by an alternative shipping method (PostNL). In majority of cases, larger loading ratios (relatively larger shipments) benefit to be executed by a freight carrier internally. Distributors can be classified based on all parameters in the LMS model or parameters not yet present but easily created by a simple mutation. The possibilities are endless since all attributes and KPI’s can be used as inputs and/or evaluation fields both. The right setting for the municipality is probably a combination of economic and environmental parameters. A conclusion drawn from the cluster analysis is that clusters with a large shipping load score well on environmental aspects (defined environmental key performance indicators). In addition, these groups of carriers also score well on economic aspects (defined specific economic key performance indicators) concluded from the cluster analysis on economic aspects. This strengthens the conclusion that smaller shipments perform less good in general (both in economic and environmental terms) and can better use an alternative shipping method. The practical usability of the cluster analysis is three-folded. The analysis gathers detailed knowledge on available data derived by the LMS model. This information can be used to develop custom policy for specific freight carriers that are performing undersize. The results can contribute in mediating cooperation between involved freight carriers because cluster analysis provides them with specific knowledge on their performance on economic and environmental indicators. The main goal of the municipality of Delft is to increase awareness among distributors and to mediate between (smaller) freight carriers and a larger and cleaner central distributor. This approach can contribute in achieving a sustainable urban freight distribution system. The focus of the LMS model is too narrow, since it addresses one group of stakeholders only. The rate of success or the potential improvement that can be achieved by cooperating is relatively low since other stakeholders do not see the benefit of the LMS model. Distributors think in means of an entire supply chain from origin towards destination. This perspective is geographically larger and can have one or more last-mile regions in it. The LMS calculation model has a last-mile perspective. Another shortcoming was data availability during the development phase. Development of the LMS without accurate data or field research with a significant level of detail or size is difficult and can result in a too simplified model. During development, arbitrary decisions on assumptions and how to structure the LMS model had to be made. These decisions have not always resulted in finding the right level of accuracy of output variables. The deterministic nature of the model can be seen as a shortcoming of the model. In a real world, every trip differs from another. Another debatable characteristic is the linearity of the model. The model does not take into account the theory of economies of scale. Shipments above a certain amount are therefore biased. The first recommendation is that data availability and the amount of data collected can be increased significantly by making it compulsory for freight carriers to participate in the LMS. This can be done to introduce a system that freight carriers need to have a certificate to operate in the urban area of Delft. All stakeholders receive a certificate if they provide the municipality with information by participating and filling out the last mile scan. The LMS model should be improved and extended on the following aspects: improve the usability of the LMS, include stochastic inputs (further research is needed), include environmental aspects, extent output variables (KPIs) with specific defined cost parameters, extent output variables with total cost of an alternative shipping method and include benchmark results. The usability of the LMS is an important factor that ensures collected data is gathered more. The interface needs to be user friendly and attractive to increase the amount of freight carriers completing the scan. The interface should be improved significantly. This can be realized by development of an application that can be used on smartphones and simultaneously develop a new website. This can result in higher degree of usability and an increased benefit to freight carriers. The deterministic nature of the model can be upgraded by using stochastic input variables instead of deterministic set values in order to move towards a better representation of reality. This can be reached by replacing assumptions and constants into stochastic input variables. Future research needs to be conducted to explore stochastic distributions of used assumptions from the LMS model. Applying footprints to carriers by including environmental aspects. This provides the municipality of Delft with information on performance of individual freight carriers on aspects other than economical. Information on vehicle types should be extended by year of built since this is an important factor that is needed to estimate environmental performance. Footprints should be created as output variables in the LMS model. These footprints are exhaust per stop and exhaust per unit. General total emission parameters that needs to be included are: CO, NOx, NO2, PM10 and PM2,5. Finally, the outcome of the LMS model needs to be extended significantly by including more detailed key performance indicators. Conducting a few simple mutations can compute specific cost KPIs. This information is crucial for both freight carriers as the municipality of Delft since total cost, time and distance does not give them enough insight on level of performance. Specific cost output variables are cost per minute, cost per unite, cost per kilometre and cost per cubic. The alternative shipping method (conducted by PostNL) should be defined as output variable. The cost of this alternative needs to be visible to freight carriers so they can compare outcome of the LMS model (estimation cost of last mile trip) with an alternative shipping method directly to create a sense of urgency. Finally, all these KPIs should be compared using a benchmark methodology to provide freight carriers not only with information on individual performance but also give them knowledge on performance relatively to similar freight carriers.","urban freight distribution; transport cost; last mile; multi-actor context; validation study; freight carriers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","MSc System Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

Especially in the conceptual design phase, lots of man-hours are consumed by making the same calculations over and over again, for different concepts. Often, an existing gear is therefore used as initial starting point, to simplify the design process. This results in little technical progress. Additionally, integration between the different disciplines involved is sub-optimal which can lead to inconsistent results. In this thesis, an optimization framework is described that can do the preliminary design of a landing gear fully automated. It ensures that communication between disciplines is respected by adding a top-level optimizer which is in charge of changing the design variables. The realization of this framework greatly reduces the repetitive tasks in the design phase of a landing gear. This makes the design phase less limited to traditional architectures while leaving more time to evaluate non-standard solutions that may be lighter, safer and/or cheaper.","MDO; optimization; landing gear; aerospace engineering; MDF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-10","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

The global financial crisis has not only exposed weaknesses in the financial sector, but also once again put the spotlight on the inequality that is existent in many parts of the world. Since, there has been growing interest in sustainability and realising social impact through many ways. This also brings up additional complexities though. Questions as, who is paying the bill and how do we measure social impact that has been realised become more important than ever, but are also much harder to answer than the comparison of the profits of traditional companies. SIBs provide a solution of bringing stakeholders from both the public and private sector to not only achieve, but also scale the social impact they deliver. So what are they? This thesis takes the definition that has been stated by Gustafsson et al: a Social Impact Bond is a model in which private investors put up capital to fund a social intervention and governments repay the investors only if an agreed-upon outcome is achieved [33][p.4]. It then goes through a design process to design, test and redesign an evaluation tool for Social Impact Bonds.","Social Impact Bonds; Responsible Innovation; Evaluation; Social Entrepreneurship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics & Innovation","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","During rough wave climates, vessel motions prevent people to be transferred safely form and to an offshore structure. The Ampelmann system is a ship-based, self stabilizing platform that actively compensates all vessel motions to make acces to offshore structures safe, easy and fast. The Ampelmann system uses a Steward platform to compensate ship motions. The platform consists of a rigid base frame and a rigid top frame connected by six hydraulic actuators in parallel. The system actively compensates for 5 DoF (surge, sway, heave, roll and pitch), which are measured by an Octans motion sensor. The aim of this master thesis research is to find a algorithm which predicts real-time short-term vessel motions. A pure time series forecasting approach was followed and both linear as non-linear models purposed. Real vessel motion data is used to compare the models. The linear AR and ARMA give stable results, where the AR model surpasses the ARMA model in performance. As non-linear model a Wavelet Neural Network is trained, which improves the prediction compared to the AR model, when the data is re-sampled. The prediction model could be used to improve the compensation done by the Ampelmann system in several manners. For example the delays in the system could be decreased or MPC could be applied.","Ship Motion Prediciton","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-10","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Conrol","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis is focused on autonomous trajectory planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR), commencing from far-range rendezvous and up to a point just before docking. Unlike typical rendezvous missions, the target in ADR is not designed for rendezvous and capture; it is usually uncooperative and possibly tumbling. If the satellite is unpassivated, then there is the added risk of explosion, while the presence of large appendages can make the satellite fragile. A case in point is Envisat, European Space Agency's largest satellite (about 8000 kg) that went defunct in 2012 and is currently, their prime concern for ADR. Most past and current technology for guidance is based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) equations, which are limited in terms of application - they use linearized dynamics, need circular orbits, employ impulsive burns, and require the user to provide some initial guess for the solution. Realistic final approach involves a number of trajectory constraints, like those on docking axis alignment, approach cone angle, keep-out-sphere, station-keeping and hold points, which are hard to include with CW-equations. Further, there is a need to make the system autonomous so that it can handle off-nominal situations as well. Convex optimization problems are a class of problems that are nearly as easy to solve as linear problems, but are more general in their scope of application. They can handle some non-linear constraints, be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to give global minimum. Inspired from the recent development of convex-optimization based trajectory-planning technique by Liu (Autonomous trajectory planning by convex optimization, PhD thesis, Iowa State University, 2013), a guidance algorithm is developed for the Envisat mission. In comparision with Liu's algorithm, it shows faster convergence (upto 5 times faster), improved accuracy (by an order of 2), and low computational cost (upto 40% in specific cases). Additionally, a method to automate the problem formulation in conic form is provided, so interfacing software can be skipped and the problem can be solved upto 9 times quicker. The guidance algorithm is able to handle all constraints of the Envisat mission, with the exception of forced motion constraint inside the keep-out-sphere. An alternative formulation is suggested which is moderately successful. The algorithm is also able to generate solutions for various attitude scenarios of Envisat. However, it is found that the method is not reliable, as some times feasible problems are found to be infeasible, or the solution is over/under estimated. Also, despite the improvement in accuracy, it still deviates substantially from the computed path, and needs a path-tracking mechanism. A PID controller is found to be sufficient for this purpose. A novel work-around to include perturbations was successfully demonstrated as well. To summarize, although the convex-optimization based guidance method has very specific advantages over CW-equations, there is a lot left to be improved with respect to robustness and autonomy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

As automation has become increasingly available, MPC is being considered even for smaller plants and the gas-to-liquids (GTL) pilot plant of Shell in Amsterdam became a relevant candidate for the implementation of model predictive control. The implementation of MPC to this experimental unit will reduce the time per experiment, which leads to faster catalyst testing. In this work a linear MPC controller was developed based on first order models that were identified through parameter estimation. The developed MPC controller uses four inputs to control twenty-two outputs by determining the optimal future path for the reactor. To determine this path, models for the different input-output relations are required. Using experimental data retrieved from steptesting, these relations were determined through system identification methods. A first principles reactor model was adapted for for the pilot plant to investigate the quality of the parametric estimation model. The implementation of MPC on the pilot plant resulted in better tracking of experimental operating conditions as well as faster and smoother changes between experimental conditions, including condition changes with large moves for several of the controlled variables. As a result of the implementation of MPC, the different experimental conditions per catalyst can be reached and completed faster, while the resulting data is more accurate. This improves the confidence in the acquired data and eliminates non-value added time between experimental conditions, accelerating the deployment of new GTL technologies. In summary, MPC has increased the speed and accuracy of catalyst testing.","MPC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Systems & Control","","Systems & Control","",""

A human-in-the-loop experiment with sixteen participants was performed, where participants were trained, and later tested, in solving aircraft conflicts of different geometrical orientations. Objective performance data of trainee solutions showed slightly better performance and longer response times for the group training with the SSD. Subjective behavioral analysis recorded more goal-orientated behavior opposed to task-oriented behavior, hinting at a higher situation awareness and a more critical decision-making process, especially in near perpendicular and unequal arrival conflict types. Whether this behavior, with more reflection during decision-making, could be valuable for a deeper understanding and improvement in the learning process is yet to be tested, as the longer response times contradict with the decisiveness expected from operational air traffic controllers.

(mentor)","2016","Structural blast analysis is usually done with two load levels for different design stages; the Strength Level Blast, SLB, and the Ductility Level Blast, DLB. Strength Level Blast is the lower magnitude overpressure (with a higher frequency of occurrence and lower consequence) and Ductility Level Blast is the higher magnitude overpressure (with a lower frequency of occurrence and significant consequence). The objective of this thesis was to try to find an estimated relationship between the linear elastic analysis using Strength Level Blast pressure, and nonlinear plastic analysis using Ductility Level Blast pressure by making an analogy to the procedures of seismic design of structures. For that, four hypothetical methods were introduced and examined to find the one that can provide a better estimated relationship. Furthermore, four SBM topside modules with 22 blast directions were analyzed. Firstly, linear elastic analyses, by means of redundancy analysis, were performed to find the Strength Level Blast capacities. Secondly, nonlinear plastic analyses, by means of static pushover analysis, were performed to obtain the pushover curves. Subsequently, several important parameters that were required for finding the Ductility Level Blast capacities were obtained from the pushover curves, namely, ultimate limit capacities and their respective displacements, the reserve strength ratios and the ductility ratios. In the next stage, the four proposed methods were tested by means of introducing four hypothetical methods each with a different reserve capacity factor, Cr; next, the Strength Level Blast capacities were scaled with these factors to obtain the Ductility Level Blast pressures. These four methods were Displacement Ratios Method, a comparison of ISO 19902 for Earthquake Assessment of Fixed Offshore Platforms for Blast Assessments, the Energy Equivalence Method and the Behavior Parameters’ Method.  Displacement Ratios’ Method assumes the Cr value to be based on the ratio of the ultimate deflection of the structure to its deflection under the Strength Level Blast pressure. Thus, this method assumes that the structure will continue to behave linearly up until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached, which in turn will be the Ductility Level Blast capacity of the structure.  The method described by ISO 19902 for earthquake assessment of fixed offshore platforms assumes the Cr value to be based on the two scaling parameters; the first parameter was the same as the previous method, and the second parameter takes into account the energy absorbed by the structure after the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached.  The Energy Equivalence Method, the Cr value was obtained by comparing the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached with the energy that would be absorbed if the structure was assumed to behave linearly until the Ductility Level Blast capacity was reached.  The Behavior Parameters’ Method the Cr value was also obtained by equating the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached; however, this method simplifies the area under the graph into two sections; first section in the elastic region, the second section in the nonlinear plastic region until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached. Next, this energy was expressed in terms of the Reserve Strength Ratios and Ductility Ratios. In this method the structure was also assumed to be behaving linearly until the Ductility Level Blast capacity has been reached. Finally, after finding the Ductility Level Blast pressures for every module and direction, the Cr values were arranged based on the direction of loading to longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions, for the small and large modules, in order to find which method had the least scatter for the Cr value. The most desirable results, with the least deviations, were obtained were from the Energy Equivalence Method. In addition, the obtained Ductility Level Blast pressures were compared with the nonlinear dynamic capacities for every module and direction. The main criteria in this comparison was having the calculated pressure less than the calculated dynamic capacities. It was observed that the Energy Equivalence Method gave the most suitable results in this comparison as well. The minimum value of Cr from the Energy Equivalence Method that were concluded were 4.0, 4.0 and 3.6 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the large modules respectively; also, 5.2, 4.3 and 4.3 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the small modules respectively.","Structural Steel; Blast Analysis; Ductility Level Blast; DLB; Strength Level Blast; SLB; Progressive Collapse Analysis; Pushover Analysis; Structural Steel Linear and Nonlinear Comparison; Elasto-Plastic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

As a result of centrifugal forces in the rotating lubricant flow, low pressure regions occur in the bearing chamber. It is expected that vapor starts to form above a certain rotor speed. The formation of gaseous lubricant is presumed detrimental to the operation of the bearing. The specific case in this research is the turbine bearing of a commercially available Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), operating at rotor speed up to 430 Hz. The ORC is a thermodynamic process, applied to recover energy from waste heat. In the machine of the case study the cycle medium is toluene. For technical reasons toluene is also used in the turbine bearing for lubrication purposes. In order to model the flows and heat transfer in the bearing, a two dimensional CFD model is created. The model output is validated against experimental data. After analysis of the results, a clear operating limit is found at 450 Hz. At this condition just outside the normal operating regime of the turbine, vapor formation sets on. Design changes proposed by the company are taken into account as well. The main alteration, moving the feed hole of the bearing chamber inward, proved to be effective. Simulation results show that bearing pressure at high speed is increased by more than 1 bar. The limit of the rotor speed in the alternative design is above 500 Hz.","bearing; turbine; lubrication; cavitation; tilting pad; ORC; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process & Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Structural optimization, first introduced by Schmidt in 1960, is a rapid growing factor in the development of new aerospace structures. This growth is established by the increase in numerical modelling techniques, cheaper computer power, the increasing cost of production and competition between companies. The combination of both structural optimization and finite element software allowed for the rise of new and more efficient optimization methods provided that the software can performsensitivity analysis. Many programs used in industry today such as BOSS Quattro , PASCO and VICONOPT restrict themselves to basic optimization methods. The goal now is to develop an optimizer for stiffened panels, using a combination of FEM and a more advanced optimization method. Interior point methods have been proven to be more efficient than primal-dual methods for solving sub-problems. Therefore Mehrotra’s predictor-corrector interior point method is used in the version of Zillober. To reach convergence convex approximations are required. The conservative approximation from Fleury’s ConLin provides the basis of many other more advance approximation methods. Therefore this method is chosen to form the initial optimizer. A 2D The FEM model is established using shell and bar elements for the panel and stiffeners respectively. This allows for easy adjustment of the geometry without the need to change the model itself. The bar element properties are defined by the PBAR card rather than the PBARL card in NASTRAN. This avoids the input of fixed NASTRAN specified cross sections with limited design freedom. The sensitivities with respect to stiffener properties are extracted from NASTRAN. These are then converted to the required sensitivities using analytical equations. With all the necessary information available, the inner loop of the optimization process is initiated. Approximations of the constraints, objective and sensitivities are produced. Based on the approximations, the predictor step establishes a maximum step size, which is then adjusted by the corrector step to a more feasible one. This is done iteratively until the duality gap is below a specified limit. Finally a new outer iteration can start if no convergence is reached. Three goals were achieved by analysing of 11 test cases. First the optimizer shows that it can handle different property sets for the stiffeners within the same panel. Secondly, the optimization works for different cross sections. Finally, when performed for similar panels with a different amount of stiffeners, an optimal number is found. The optimization is performed for minimum weight while limited by stress, buckling and design constraints. The results indicate that for 8 out of 11 cases convergence is reached within 12 cycles. Due oscillatory behaviour two other cases converged relatively slow and one did not converge at all. This happens due to the incapability of the optimizer to consider new buckling modes establishing with the adjustment of the parameters. In the end however all three statements were proven outside of the three oscillating cases. For the model that was defined, the optimal amount of stiffeners is 7. Additionally I-beam stiffener provided the most consistent performance with respect to convergence. Finally for this case, although optimizing for different stiffener properties per panel lead to a small reduction in weight, it is not worth the computational effort. So it can be concluded that the optimizer works. On top of this the restrictions on the cross-section defined by NASTRAN were eliminated by extracting a different set of sensitivities and adjusting them using analytical equations. This leads to an optimizer, which can perform size and shape optimization by use of NASTRAN analyses, analytical transformations and an interior point optimization method.","structural optimization; stiffened panel; interior point method; conservative approximation; sequential convex programming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Body-powered hand prostheses are characterized by low weight and low cost compared to externally powered prostheses. They also provide force and position feedback, allowing for accurate and fast position and force control of the prosthesis. Body-powered hand prostheses are often rejected on the basis of low efficiency. The high forces needed to operate these prostheses lead to discomfort, fatigue and ultimately rejection. The main problem is that these prostheses require too much force to be operated comfortably. This thesis approaches that problem by introducing a power-assistance unit to a body-powered hand prosthesis. By providing additional power via an actuator, the physical load on the user is reduced and force and position feedback is maintained. A 3D model of the concept was designed to give an estimate of a hand prosthesis in terms of weight and size. A proof-of-concept prototype was built to verify the power-assistance functionality. The 3D model showed that it is possible to fit a sufficiently powerful actuator and power supply in a body-powered prosthesis, without exceeding the weight requirement. Testing of the prototype showed that an electric motor can supply sufficient torque to meet the pinch force requirements without hindering proprioceptive feedback. With power-assistance the load on the user can be almost halved, allowing the user to perform most activities of daily living without experiencing fatigue. The concept of implementing power-assistance in body-powered hand prostheses shows to be a feasible and promising approach to the problem of high load requirements of body-powered hand prostheses.","design; Power-assistance; Proprioception; Prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

Data aggregation is a vital building block for WSNs that enables rapid gather the information held by the network nodes. A continuous study of different approaches to retrieving aggregates is being carried out by the researchers of the field since the emergence of WSNs. This study has resulted in a plethora of aggregation protocols, each with their own advantages and flaws. Recent efforts have given us Chaos, a very powerful tool able to perform network-wide data aggregation. In contrast to its predecessors Chaos performs aggregation with a topology-agnostic communication primitive, embracing pure wireless broadcasts to create extremely fast and energy-efficient aggregation rounds. Although Chaos outperforms other solutions in terms of time and energy efficiency, it also has significant shortcomings. Specifically, in order to operate properly, Chaos imposes strict restrictions on the network composition, which prevent it from adapting to the dynamic nature of WSNs. Additionally, Chaos needs to reserve a portion of space in every transmitted packet whose size is proportional to that of the network; making its scalability questionable on larger networks. In this work we identified the above shortcomings along with their causes, which reside in the core mechanisms Chaos employs, and in the natural phenomena that govern its behaviour. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new coordinating data structure based on order-statistics theory, and a flow control technique to avoid congestion. Re-building the core mechanisms of the protocol around these proposals lead to a topology-agnostic primitive that is not only highly efficient (like Chaos), but also more able to cope with the practical challenges and needs of sensor network applications. Our evaluation, performed on two different testbeds, shows that our protocol (i) is more scalable; (ii) is highly tolerant to network dynamics; (iii) allows the retrieval of more types of aggregates; and (iv) reduces the aggregation latency (by up to 15%) while attaining a comparable reliability.","WSN; Data-Aggregation; Neighbor-Discovery; Chaos; Synchronous; Flooding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","The introduction of intelligent meters - smart meters - to the electricity infrastructure should provide the grid intelligence the ability to cope with challenges and changes; thus, it is named smart grid (Verbong et al., 2013). We have learned that the smart grid system is a complex product system because its technologies, components and interfaces are interdependent; hence, the smart meter as its key node is a complex product (Ligtvoet et al., 2015; Suarez, 2004). However, the societal rejection of smart meters detains the introduction of smart meters in the Netherlands. Societal rejection results from a lack of consideration of social ethical values and conflicting values in society (Künneke et al., 2015). The research objective is to determine the most important values for the social acceptance of smart meters and formulate design requirements that facilitate its social acceptance in the Netherlands. We have reviewed social acceptance literature, finding multiple studies (Künneke, Mehos, Hillerbrand, & Hemmes, 2015; Ligtvoet et al., 2015; Narayanan & Chen, 2012; Shin, Kim, & Hwang, 2015) stating that a complex technology such as the smart meter should be assessed from multiple perspectives. We build our concept on the social acceptance concept of Wüstenhagen et al. (2007), adapting the dimensions to socio-political, market and household acceptance, which represent the important stakeholder groups for smart meters. Literature regarding each group of stakeholders’ acceptance was analyzed to derive and define their values, namely energy policy, network economics, technology management, technology acceptance, applied ethics and ethics of technology literature stream (see Appendix 1). Our multidisciplinary approach to analyze the acceptance and selection of a complex technology is a first notion and our theoretical contribution. This framework for the social acceptance of smart meters enables utilizing experts representing and possessing insights into the group of stakeholders to evaluate the importance of the values. After a qualitative validation of the values, the best-worst method (Rezaei, 2015) was utilized to evaluate the importance of the values, which is a first notion to measure the importance of the values with this method, our methodological contribution. Three experts performed the qualitative validation of the values. The evaluation of the values with the best-worst method was conducted with ten experts for smart meters and showed privacy as the most important value for socio-political and household acceptance, as well as cost-effectiveness for market acceptance of smart meters. Due to different regulation about privacy, there was no socio-political acceptance for smart meters (Bellantuono, 2014; Cuijpers & Koops, 2013; Ligtvoet et al., 2015). Several scholars have stated that for end users of smart meters, privacy is particularly important (AlAbdulkarim et al., 2014; Cuijpers & Koops, 2013; Darby, 2012; Verbong et al., 2013). On the other hand, cost effectiveness depends on the size of the market (Erlinghagen et al. 2014), the installed base of smart meters (Van de Kaa et al. 2011), which requires the acceptance of the end users and their importance for privacy. The value hierarchy approach enables to formulate design requirements based on values. We demonstrate how design requirements can be formulated based on the value privacy. These design requirements should foster the social acceptance of the smart meters, although it is limited due the conflict with the other important value of cost effectiveness. Hence, the design requirements should be analyzed and evaluated with the other important values by the groups of stakeholders for acceptance. Further studies should segment the groups of stakeholder (e.g. different end user groups) to analyze their important values, which enables creating service and incentive mechanisms for a particular group of stakeholders. Moreover, other complex products and other regions should be analyzed with our multidisciplinary approach, which would enable us to generalize our approach.","smart meter; social acceptance; VSD; BWM; technology selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

These floods are the result of the extremely large catchment of the Kilimanjaro region in combination with large peaks in precipitation during the short and the long rainy seasons. The river bordering the area of interest cannot handle these quantities of water which results in the flooding of large plains. The local self-sustaining communities cannot harvest their crops during these seasons complicating their living conditions. Furthermore, essential facilities such as schools and medical care become unreachable during the floods and they lead to diseases being spread and an overall reduction of sanitation. Apart from their negative effects they also have positive outcomes however. The floods decrease the salinity of the soil of the agricultural land by flushing it, thus making it more fertile Last year a group of students from TU Delft came to the Lower Moshi area to investigate the cause of the flooding and come up with solutions. The report from the previous group is referred to as the prefeasibility study. This year the client, FT Kilimanjaro, made the request to work out their solutions in more detail and come up with a cost estimate. The goal of this project is to improve the welfare in the Lower Moshi area by developing a technical solution that prevents the short rain flooding and regulates the long rain flooding which is socially acceptable, feasible, and durable.","","en","student report","Delft University of Technology","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering, Construction Management and Engineering, Watermanagement","","","","-3.60431178, 37.3349762"

(mentor); Gerber, M. (mentor)","2016","The continuous development of power electronic converters has opened new opportunities for the More-Electrical Aircraft (MEA) concept, where the conventional power sources (pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical) are replaced with electric sources to support secondary loads in the aircrafts. It is expected that more efficient, lighter and lower maintenance solutions can be obtained with high power density power electronics. In order to obtain optimal designs for power system integration, new methodologies employing multi-objective optimization have been reported. However, the application of multi-objective optimization is more powerful with multi-domain modeling, which is not always a straightforward task. The reason is that power electronics design is a complex design problem, mainly because of the multi-disciplinary nature of its physical aspects (domains), including electric circuit behavior, thermal performance, electromagnetic compatibility issues and packaging constraints. Therefore, a subsequent modeling effort for the power electronics design is necessary to fully exploit the advantages of optimization techniques. To obtain a comprehensive insight in the system behavior, the mutual dependencies of the power electronics' design domains need to be characterized and quantified. This thesis investigates into the interdependencies between the design domains of an inverter for aerospace applications. In this thesis project a design methodology is developed based on the multi-domain approach. The converter design is treated as a system in a top level design aspect, leading to the selection of a topology, modulation and control strategy. In addition, the circuit level design is effectively decoupled into the electrical, EMI, thermal and mechanical design domains, which are treated independently. The boundaries of the design levels and domains are determined and the links between the design domains are established though their mutual dependencies. Based on this methodology, a design framework for an aerospace inverter is realized in software using analytical modeling. This framework is used to investigate the mutual dependencies of the design domains and the impact of the design choices on the inverter performance. The interdependencies of the design domains are manipulated using design variables, similar to an optimization problem, by employing parametric sweep. A high efficiency and high power density aerospace inverter is designed, according to the specifications of Aeronamic B.V. and aerospace regulations.","multi-domain modeling; aerospace; inverter; design domains; boundaries; interdependencies; power density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The increasing airtraffic demands on aircraft capacity, sustainability and profitability, require the investigation of unconventional aircraft configurations with high aerodynamic efficiency, as the commonly applied fuselage-wing-tail configuration shows to reach an optimum in that respect which cannot be further improved using current technology. The application of the box wing system, following from the Best Wing System theory presented by Ludwig Prandtl in 1924, theoretically results in an aircraft configuration generating minimum induced drag, named Prandtl Plane. A balanced performance analysis and comparison is performed in this research, in terms of fuel burn, structural weight and cost benefits, to indicate the types of missions in which the Prandtl Plane could provide a superior alternative to conventional aircraft. For the purpose of this research, the Initiator has been used as the design and analysis environment. Methods applied specifically for the design and analysis of the Prandtl Plane configuration have been implemented in the tool, to compare the performance with respect to conventional aircraft, in the high subsonic transport category. Parametric studies have been performed on the wing design variables to assess the sensitivity of the Prandtl Plane performance. The aspect ratio of the total wing system showed to have the largest influence on the aerodynamic performance, where a large AR results in high aerodynamic efficiency, however at the same time this yields a high wing weight. Three comparison studies have been performed between a PrP and conventional aircraft, designed using the Initiator to perform a single aisle - medium range mission typically covered by an A320-200 (144 pax, range of 4,000 km), a twin aisle - long range mission typically flown by an A340-300 (270 pax, 10,500 km) and finally a high payload - low range mission (514 pax, 2,500 km) for which no conventional aircraft are specifically designed, but large aircraft such as the A380 are exploited. On each of these missions, the PrP design shows lower induced drag during cruise, as expected, and a lower fuselage weight due to distributed bending loads from the double-wing system. An a single aisle – medium range mission this results in 8% savings in fuel burn, on the long range mission in 10% savings in fuel burn and 9% on DOC. Due to a smaller wing span, the capacity of this type of Prandtl Plane can be increased further without exceeding the dimensional constraints on wing span, and could therefore be a competitor of the A380 which currently marks the maximum capabilities of aircraft in terms of maximum range and payload capacity, due to span restrictions imposed by gate dimensions on existing airports. Prandtl planes with a higher passenger capacity could be exploited on existing routes, while meeting identical airport restrictions.","Prandtl Plane; box wing; initiator; conceptual aircraft design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

In this way the risk posed to vessels and the negative environmental impact of marine litter is reduced. Nowadays, these vessels are usually only deployed after complaints on excessive amounts of marine litter. In this paper an innovative routing method is proposed to sweep marine litter in a port area proactively. This routing method makes use of input from a prediction model considering the location and accumulation of marine litter. The routing method is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model.

(mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor); Vargas-Luna, A. (mentor)","2016","The current vegetation monitoring method of Rijkswaterstaat is a manual, time consuming and costly method and therefore only is performed once in six years. The vegetatielegger is a map, which shows the standard situation of the vegetation types that are allowed at any location in the river foreland area of the Netherlands. No rougher vegetation is allowed than displayed in the vegetatielegger. However, vegetation grows and new, rougher vegetation forms within those six years between monitoring cycles. So, to ensure the conservation of the situation as given in the vegetatielegger, a new, faster method had to be designed. This research designed and automatic post classification change detection and tested it on a representative test site. The object based classification used is a kNN-classifier and a region growing segmentation. The object-based approach ensures a classification that is well comparable to the polygons of the vegetatielegger. The classification is done with summer aerial photographs as well as with winter satellite images. The aerial photographs have a higher resolution than the satellite images, but in the winter satellite some vegetation classes are better distinguishable. The six classes that are classified are: water, built-up, forest, grass, tall herb vegetation and trees. Aerial photographs give a high overall accuracy for the classification; satellite images score better on tall herb classification accuracy. All generated results have a higher accuracy than the current classification method. The change detection is generated taking into account the Rijkswaterstaat rules for change in the forelands: only changes to a rougher vegetation type of more than 500m2 are important. The satellite image classification generates more accurate change detections than the aerial photographs.","classification; vegetation monitoring; river forelands; change detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); La Rocca, G. (mentor)","2016","Continuous innovation is very important to stay competitive in today’s world. Automotive manufacturers are an excellent example of this evolution when looking to new vehicle concepts. But also behind the scene, they have to be innovative in order to be able to keep up this progression. Aerodynamics has a large influence on the total performance of the car, and therefore fulfils a very important role in this innovation story. Aerodynamics is absolutely not straightforward which makes it on the one hand difficult to deal with and to estimate it influences, but on the other hand, this creates an improvement potential. Today’s passenger cars are already aerodynamically optimised to a fairly large extent, meaning improvements become rather marginal. To be able to keep this tendency of improving in the future, the aerodynamic design process has to be adapted. The focus of this work will be on the reduction of the air resistance of cars, which has a large influence on its top speed and fuel consumption. Especially the latter is very important today and will even gain more importance for future cars. Earlier research has shown that 70% of the reduction of the air resistance and the corresponding Cx value is done during the preliminary aerodynamic design phase. This phase is characterised by a high design freedom and a low level of detail of the corresponding design. Due to this, this early phase invites for shape optimisation of the basic aerodynamic shape having much more potential to achieve a lower Cx value. At the end of this phase, all fundamental parameters, dimensions etc. that define the final car will be fixed in order to begin the further detailed design during which detail optimisation is only possible anymore. This fundamental difference between the early phase and subsequent detailed design is responsible for their difference in influence on the final achieved Cx value and reduction. In order to achieve a successful aerodynamic design in terms of air resistance, the importance of that early design phase cannot be underestimated. To prevent aerodynamic improvements from stagnating, this preliminary design phase has to be fully exploited. Those preliminary phase can be split into three specific sub phases, namely the initial phase, preliminary studies and concept phase. In the first, the high level targets of the car design will be determined, which the final design should comply with. After this, as much as possible information and knowledge about the design has to be gathered during the so called preliminary studies. This knowledge will be used to formulate thoughtful concepts for the subsequent concept phase where they will be assessed and developed further until one final design concept remains which should comply with all the earlier defined high level targets. The quality of the information and knowledge gathered during those preliminary studies is therefore critical for a comprehensive final design. This is valid for the whole aerodynamic design and by extension also the total car design. But as already said, this work focuses on the design of the car exterior in terms of Cx value. It was observed in this work that the current situation has potential for improvement. More specifically, it was noticed that the aerodynamic department is occupied mainly with detail optimisation instead of the more favourable shape optimisation during those preliminary studies. The reason for this is due to a combination of their minor influence on the car exterior design compared to the aesthetics department and the current process flow during those studies. This current process flow is very inefficient and contains too much time-consuming and repetitive manual work. This combined with the short timespan of those preliminary studies lead to a limitation of the gathered knowledge of the car exterior design that is investigated. This is the main reason why the aerodynamicists are currently doing mainly detail instead of shape optimisation. For the latter, more investigations of higher quality (higher order) are required, which the current inefficient process flow does not allow for. Therefore, the aerodynamicists are limited to detail optimisation because of this, which is explained more into detail in this work. Thus, adapting the current process flow to allow the aerodynamic department to do shape instead of detail optimisation was found to be the main solution to improve and further reduce the Cx value and prevent it from stagnating in the future. The current process flow of those preliminary studies was analysed in this work and a suggested methodology that could accomplish those improvements was formulated based on this. The main difference of this methodology compared to the current situation is the implemented closed-loop instead of the open-loop modelling of the aerodynamic behaviour during those preliminary studies. This requires a fully automated process flow, which is missing in the current situation. In order to be able to also work out this suggested methodology to a fully working process flow, an automated generation of the geometric variants have to provided. This was achieved by developing a parametric geometry model capable of instantly delivering the required geometric variant without human interaction. The parametric model is an approximation of the real car exterior geometry, but its accuracy was proved with relevant CFD simulations. The closed-loop surrogate modelling is realised by using a MATLAB-based toolbox, called SuMo-toolbox, which is implemented in the software framework of the developed methodology. A secure shell connection between this software framework in MATLAB and the Linux machine, on which the simulations are done, assures a stable and fully automated process flow. After this working out of the presented methodology, a reality-based use-case was done to estimate its potential for improvements compared to the current situation. Promising results were already obtained which also confirm the promised theoretical improvements in praxis. Also conclusions and recommendations for future work or alternative implementations and extensions of this methodology are formulated in this work. This work was meant as an initial step and incentive to apply this methodology in the current industry. Before this could be possible, further research and work has to be done to make it practically implementable. This new process flow means a drastic change of the current one. It is typical for large companies to be unwilling to take this step. But if this methodology could be further developed so that it could fulfil its supposed role, namely improving and further reducing the Cx value of cars, it will become an important tool in the (near) future for manufacturers to become or stay ahead of their competitors. Certainly in today’s world of increasingly strict economics, its role cannot be underestimated.","aerodynamics; automotive; preliminary design; car; air resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-10","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In this research we studied the behaviour of dredged glacial till in the creation of a landfill. An experimental approach is used where we primarily focussed on the settling and consolidation characteristics. Till is in general a well graded, non sorted material and segregation during dredging and transportation can be expected. The aims of this research were to classify the fine-grained till slurry, to determine the consolidation related soil parameters and to validate the parameters, approach and assumptions made by the client who previously performed research on the same material. The researched also focussed on the expected segregation within the fine-grained slurry and on the environmental conditions (sea-salt environment). Additionally, multiple landfill scenarios are discussed. The dredging process is simulated by immersion and wet sieving and the fine grained slurry (<0.063mm) forms the base of all tests. In this slurry, all particles are disintegrated. A segregation is made within the fine slurry, at a level of about 0.0085mm, to investigate the different fractions. The grain size distribution of the bulk shows a well graded material containing 50% fines. The atterberg limits are relative low, the plastic and liquid limits are in the range of 10.6% to 18.8% and 19.8% to 38.5% respectively with the lowest values for the samples with the highest grain sizes. The column settling test showed that the void ratios after one week of free settling in a sea-salt environment vary between 1.7 and 5.9 with the highest value for the finest grain size. However, the result of the latter test result shows that settling has not yet finished at the termination of the test (after 7 days). The executed one-dimensional compression tests (oedometer tests) show that the coefficients of consolidation cv vary between 10E-9 and 10E-6 m2/s with the lowest values for the fines material. We see a gradual increase in cv value with increasing stress. The compression ratio CR shows a decrease with increasing stress and is 0.25-0.14 for the finer material and 0.12-0.06 for the coarser material. The coefficient of secondary compression Calpha also decreases with increasing stress and is for all samples in the range of 0.009-0.001 with the lowest values for the coarser material. The amount of disintegration and segregation of the particles determines which grain size dominates and controls the consolidation of the soil. In case the particles do not disintegrate during dredging, a scenario with coarser material should be investigated. In this scenario, the data from the client is very conservative. A scenario with full disintegration and segregation during dredging and transportation leads to a combination of coarser and finer material in which the most fine material controls the consolidation. In this scenario, the data from the client is progressive in terms of the expected consolidation period and gives a good estimation of the total settlement. Modelling the compression parameters in a simplified geometry in D-Settlement led to a shorter consolidation period and less settlement for the coarser particles compared to all other fractions. The most fine grained material, led to a considerable longer consolidation period and more primary and secondary settlement. However, the most settlement can be expected at very low stress levels because the oedometer results show that at a stress level of 0.3kPa, the void ratio has already decreased to 1.5 in case of the most fine material and to 0.8 for the coarser material. The 'immediate' settlement in the lower stress regime is not modelled in the described model and does not obey the compression parameters mentioned above.","till; self-weight consolidation; landfill; reclamation; segregation; dredging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Geo-Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Scaffolds for bone regeneration have been investigated as bone substitutes in critical sized bone defects. It is known that the architecture of these scaffolds is important for the bone regeneration process, which depends on cell response and vascular ingrowth into the scaffold. With advanced fabrication techniques, such as selective laser melting, it is possible to manufacture complex geometries. In this study, Ti6Al4V scaffolds based on four different minimal surfaces, primitive, I-WP, gyroid and diamond, with different porosities were evaluated. Of these scaffolds, the morphological and mechanical properties, and the permeability were determined with micro-CT, static compression tests and fatigue tests, and permeability experiments and computational fluid dynamic simulations. Porosities of 71.3-49.2%, 65-44.3%, 65.6-52% and 59.7-44.2% were found for the primitive, I-WP, gyroid and diamond scaffolds, respectively. It was observed that the permeability depends on the shape of the unit cell as well as on the apparent density of the scaffold. Permeability values of 5.48 10-11-6.10 10-9m2 and 1.29-6.96 10-9m2 were obtained from the laminar experimental and computational approaches, respectively. The static compression tests showed that the mechanical properties, such as the plateau stress, quasi-elastic gradient, plateau end stress, and the yield strength depend on the type of unit cell and the porosity. The lowest fatigue lives were found for the primitive unit cells, while the I-WP scaffolds and the diamond scaffolds with the lowest and highest apparent density, respectively, were still intact after 106 cycles. The results in this study suggest that some of the scaffolds evaluated would be suitable as scaffolds for bone regeneration.","bone regeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-02-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical engineering","","Tissue biomechanics and implants","",""

(mentor); Pérez Garza, H.H. (mentor)","2016","The choice on which cantilever to use for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) depends on the type of the experiment being done. Usually, the cantilevers have to be exchanged when a different stiffness is required and the entire alignment has to be repeated. In the present work, we have developed a method to adjust the stiffness of the AFM cantilever in situ, without having to exchange the cantilever. The adjustment is achieved by changing the effective length of the cantilever by electrostatic pull-in. By applying a voltage between the cantilever and an electrode (with an insulating layer at the point of contact), the cantilever snaps to the electrode, reducing the cantilever’s effective length. The working principle of this concept is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept experiment. The electrode was positioned close to a commercially available cantilever with a robotic nano-manipulator. To confirm the change in stiffness, the resonance frequency of the cantilever was measured for varying electrode positions. The results match the theoretical expectation. For the cantilever that was tested, we obtained stiffness tuning from 0.2 N/m to 27 N/m, covering two orders of magnitude in one cantilever. This proof-of-concept is the first step towards a micro fabricated prototype, that integrates the electrode positioning system and cantilever that can be used for actual AFM experiments.","stiffness; cantilever; AFM; probe; adjustment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-08-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","This research aims at improving the synergy between 3D printing and topology optimisation. 3D printing, more formally known as additive manufacturing, forms an object by constructing successive layers on top of each other. This procedure of manufacturing offers new possibilities due to the improved design freedom. Topology optimisation is a mathematical design tool that finds the optimal material distribution for a specified problem. Usually the generated optimal designs have a complex shape which are difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing techniques, and post-processing of the design is necessary in order to obtain a manufacturable design. Additive manufacturing makes most of this post-processing redundant due to its unprecedented manufacture abilities. However, despite the greatly improved design freedom, certain geometric restrictions are encountered in popular additive manufacturing techniques like selective laser melting (SLM). Among others, designs need to be self-supporting or overhang-free in order to guarantee a successful production. The best way to deal with this is to incorporate an overhang restriction directly into the topology optimisation, such that optimal designs are generated that also comply with this manufacturing constraint. An overhang constraint is formulated based on the gradient of the density field. The gradient of the density field is used because it is particularly suitable for incorporating the part orientation in the build chamber of the SLM machine into the optimisation. Besides this, it allows for an arbitrary critical angle and is easily extended to 3D. This constraint is implemented in an existing topology optimisation algorithm and tested on numerical examples. Various implementations are tested and compared. Furthermore, a novel method is devised to efficiently include the build orientation into the optimisation. By numerical examples it is shown that this method results in optimal structures and corresponding build directions that are free of overhang.","topology optimisation; additive manufacturing; overhang; manufacturing constraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2016","The main focus of this research was testing of dowel-type connections using slotted-in steel plates in laminated bamboo loaded parallel-to-grain. Since laminated bamboo is a relatively new material, a proper design standard and design formulas have not yet been established. Strength testing of this material is currently being done by a number of research institutes. Those researches have already resulted in a range of properties and strength parameters. To analyse the possibility of calculating laminated bamboo connections with these already obtained strength parameters using timber design principles, this research focussed on strength testing of a variety of connections and comparing the obtained test results to expected capacities calculated from such timber design formulas. To calculate the expected capacity, design formulas from EC5 were used. From EC5 also the spacing requirements (end, edge and dowel spacing distances) were adopted into the test piece design. Several connection variants were designed and tested. These variants all made use of one dowel of a constant steel grade and dowel diameter. The connection variants were designed such that results were obtained in every failure mode. This thus included testing of three variants of one slotted-in plate (modes 1, 2 and 3) and six variants with two slotted-in steel plates. Of these six variants three displayed failure mode 1 in the middle member and three displayed mode 3 in the middle member (and 1, 2, and 3 in the outer members). This variety in test specimens made it possible to not only compare the measured capacities to design codes but also to compare the capacity and behaviour of connections with multiple slotted-in plates to that of connections with only one slotted-in plate. To make the best use of the available material and have as little wasted bamboo as possible, the test specimens were equipped with equal connections at both ends. So that when loaded, actually two results could be obtained. One of these results was the capacity of the connection that failed. The other result was the knowledge that the other connection was, at least, stronger than the measured capacity. The use of such symmetrically loaded specimens however also causes the average of all measured capacities to be somewhat lower than normal, since half of the fabricated connections were stronger and are still intact. To overcome this, a method was devised which was adopted into the result analysis and by which the measured capacities were adjusted so that a representative value for all connections was obtained. From the comparison of the adjusted test results and design codes then was concluded that all of the tested variants had a capacity that was well above the EC5 value. This confirmed that the design of connections in laminated bamboo can safely be done using the design principles of EC5 for timber. Although further research is necessary to determine the necessary minimum end and edge distances for laminated bamboo. The benefits of using multiple slotted-in plates were investigated in three ways. Final recommendations are to investigate a possible effective number of slotted-in steel plates by also testing connection variants using three slotted-in plates. Of course in this further research extensions can be made by testing multiple dowels or dowel diameters, different materials or even more specimens to reduce the natural variation in test results to get a more accurate number of effective slotted-in plates.","bamboo; dowel type connection; slotted-in plate; Eurocode 5","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the summer of 2016 heavy lift transport company TPI will transport a topside from Busan, South Korea to the Gina Krog field in Norway. For this voyage TPI selected their second largest vessel, the TPI Mega Caravan as heavy lift transporter. Since 2010 the Dutch based engineering company Hydrographic and Marine Consultants (HMC) were hired by TPI to simulate the voyages of the TPI fleet. The objective of this thesis is to: Simulate the voyage of the Mega Caravan from South Korea to Norway with a focus on the structural responses of the vessel during the voyage. The voyage is simulated in Safetrans, a simulation software program which can be used to derive both the hydrographic data of a voyage and the motion responses of the vessel. In this software the vessel is modeled as a rigid body. To determine the structural responses during the voyage, a finite element method model of the vessel is created in FEMAP. In this model the bending moments of the vessel due to vibrations of the hull are analyzed. The analyzed structural responses are caused by wave bending moments and slamming. Wave bending moments When a ship is located on top of a wave, or between two waves, with a wavelength corresponding to the length of the vessel this can result in large tensions. As ships are flexible, they will deflect to the shape of the wave. When the crest of the wave is amidships, the midsection of the vessel is pushed upward. This causes large tension in the deck and compression in the keel of the vessel. This phenomenon is called Hogging. When the bow and stern of the vessel are pushed upward the vessel deflects the other way around. There will be a large tension in the keel and compression in the deck. This phenomenon is called Sagging. Slamming Wave slamming is an impulsive load caused by sudden impact of waves onto the vessel. This phenomenon occurs when the bow of the vessel is emerged and “crashes down” with an impact against the next wave. The vessel can start to vibrate due to those slam impacts, which is called Whipping. The input data to simulate hogging, sagging and slamming in the FEMAP model is gained from Safetrans. The result of the FEMAP analyzes showed concerning bending moments due to hogging and sagging. Safetrans is able to calculate the maximum slamming pressure during the voyage. However, the program gives no information about the time duration of the impact and the exposed area. This is why Safetrans is not the optimal software to simulate slamming. With some assumptions the slamming pressure is applied to the FEMAP model. The analyze showed that the influence of slamming on the bending moment is small compared to the other loads. However, it is recommended to research the combination of slamming and wave bending moments.","Ship vibrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Dredging and Offshore Engineering","","Floating Structures","",""

This critical density is used to update the target density in the ALINEA algorithm. In an attempt to improve the ramp metering algorithm, next to the Parameterschatter, also a gradient method is used. The gradient method tries to tune the parameter gains in the ramp metering algorithm. In this thesis a variation on the normal ALINEA is used, a so-called Proportional-Integral(PI)-ALINEA. This PI-ALINEA has two parameter gains which will be updated towards the current situation on the freeway.

(mentor)","2016","Due to the awareness of climate change, more sustainable and efficient ways of transport are needed. The most polluting road transport mode in the European Union are the long-haul tractor-trailer combinations. This study will investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of three vehicles in a platoon subjected to cross wind conditions. The effect of front- and rear drag reduction devices is investigated numerically. The frontal edge radius is considered the front drag reduction device while the rear drag reduction device is represented by a boat tail. ANSYS Fluent was used to solve the RANS equations that were closed with the SST k-omega turbulence model. The GETS model was used to analyse the aerodynamic characteristics of a simplified heavy-duty vehicle. The geometry was meshed and a mesh sensitivity study showed the asymptotic behaviour of the drag as a function of mesh size. It was shown that the frontal edge radius influences the flow behaviour largely. For the radii of 0.54 m and 0.27 m, a large thrust force on the frontal edges decreased the drag of the front part of the vehicle significantly such that the drag contribution of the front part was lower than 15% of the total drag while the pressure drag at the rear delivered around$70% of the drag. Halving the frontal edge radius to 0.135 m, caused the drag contributions of the front and rear part of the vehicle to be about 45% of the total drag. Adding an inward deflected tail increased drag drastically by increasing the base pressure. Adding a cross wind component to the incoming flow increased the drag and gave a side force. The inter-vehicle distance had a large influence on the drag of the individual vehicles. At a very short distance, the lead vehicle experienced a very large drag reduction because of the presence of the high pressure region in front of the middle vehicle. This lead to a large reduction in pressure drag. When the distance is increased, the drag goes asymptotically to the value in isolation. The trailing vehicle showed opposite behaviour. The drag of the trailing vehicle was increased when the inter-vehicle distance decreased due to the fact that the streamlines were deflected inward after the middle vehicle and they experienced a deceleration due to the concave trajectory of the flow arriving at the frontal surfaces of the trailing vehicle. This lead to a decreased thrust force on the frontal edges of the trailing vehicle. For the lowest inter-vehicle distance, the trailing vehicle was positioned inside the near-wake of the middle vehicle and the drag decreased again. The middle vehicle experienced a combination of the effects on the lead and trailing vehicle, its drag remains fairly constant except for the closest distance where the negative effect on the frontal part started to decrease. These trends are similar for all platoons, the amount of drag increase or decrease however was determined by the geometric variables and the cross wind condition. The drag reductions of the different vehicles in the platoon were mainly determined by the frontal edge radius. The relative drag reductions on the lead vehicle were higher when the frontal edge radius was larger, since then the pressure drag at the rear represents a larger portion of the total drag. The drag decrease in drag counts however only slightly changed. For the large radii, the trailing vehicle experienced a drag that increased up to a value above that in isolation when the inter-vehicle distance was decreased. A trailing vehicle with the smallest frontal edge radius, 0.135 m, experienced a drag reduction. The combined effects of the lead and trailing vehicle caused the drag reductions of the middle vehicle to increase for a lower frontal edge radius. The drag reductions decreased when tails were added or deflected inwards. A tail on a specific vehicle mainly influences the vehicle driving behind the tail. Deflecting a tail decreased the drag reductions caused by the slower incoming flow field, i.e. the lower dynamic pressure experience by the following vehicles. Deflecting a tail on the lead vehicle inward has the same effect on the middle vehicle as increasing the inter-vehicle distance, it decreases the influence of the lead vehicle's wake on the middle vehicle. For a frontal edge radius of 0.27 m, the total drag reduction of a following vehicle was decreased when the tail was deflected from 0° to 6°, but it was increased when deflecting the tail from 6° to 12°. Decreasing the frontal edge radius to 0.135 m gave different results. The total drag of the following vehicle was increased when the tails of the vehicle in front were deflected more inward. Overall, the drag reductions obtained in a platoon were not much affected by the applied cross wind conditions. It is shown that the lead vehicle of a platoon redirects the flow such that the middle and trailing vehicle experience a significantly lower side force. The side force of the lead vehicle itself is not changed significantly. When inward deflected tails are applied to the lead and middle vehicle, the side force reduction on the following vehicles is diminished but still significant. The final results showed that the platoon with the worst performing vehicles in isolation, the `nnn' configuration with R = 0.135 m, experienced the largest drag reduction, namely 29%, corresponding to 1223 drag counts. If this is extrapolated to a vehicle with an initial drag coefficient as high as a real heavy-duty vehicle, this could lead to a fuel saving of 2.48 L/100km. Considering the absolute drag coefficients, the platoon with the best performing vehicles was still the optimal platoon with the lowest drag coefficient, namely the `t12t12t12' platoon with the largest frontal edge radius. This aerodynamic analysis investigated the effect of the drag reduction devices in a platoon of bluff bodies subjected to cross wind conditions. It was shown that the frontal edge radius can determine whether the following vehicles experience a drag reduction or a drag increase. Tails reduced the drag of the individual vehicles but did also decrease the drag reductions experienced in the platoon. The drag reductions were still present under cross wind conditions. Considering the set-up of platoon formations, vehicles with the most streamlined front should be placed as lead vehicle. Vehicles with large tail angles should be used as trailing vehicle.","Platoon; Bluff bodies; Cross wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Mulder, I.J. (mentor); Schuurmans, T. (mentor)","2016","This graduation project involved the development of a three-day training for social business development for Kenyan entrepreneurs. The project is carried out for ProPortion, a creative agency based in Amsterdam that realizes social business. Social businesses are a companies that aim to solve social challenges through a for-profit approach and ProPortion focusses on social challenges in effect people in developing countries. The project came forth out of an opportunity identified by ProPortion in Kenya, where an emerging group of Kenyan entrepreneurs expressed interest in growing the social impact of their companies. However, the different context of the target group required a new form and focus for ProPortion’s service. As a result, the initial graduation assignment asked for a broad scope towards developing a new social business development service for Kenyan entrepreneurs. In the initial phase of the project relevant elements in the field of social business are explored and defined, resulting in an understanding of the evolving role of business in society. Field research in Kenya led to the identification of three target group segments: the socially engaged for-profit entrepreneur, the philanthropic entrepreneur and the start-up social entrepreneur. Each type of entrepreneur expressed different perspectives and challenges concerning the creation of social impact with their business. A common mindset towards social business is that it involves ‘giving back’ to society in a way that costs a business money. Therefore, the direction for the new service focused on understanding how to create a connection between profit and social impact for a company. Through generative research in Kenya a service concept is developed in form of an intense three-day training called ‘The Impact Bootcamp’. The Impact Bootcamp offers a program for purpose-driven entrepreneurs to grow the social impact of their company. The bootcamp takes place in an inspiring location outside the city and is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer learning between the entrepreneurs. Besides growth of the social impact of the company, the Impact Bootcamp also aims to allow like-minded entrepreneurs to connect, bond and collaborate. A recent development in the field of business strategy is the concept of Creating Shared Value, developed by leading business strategist Michael Porter. Shared value describes how a company can develop activities that create value for both the business and society. One of the activities developed for the Impact Bootcamp is designed to increase the understanding about shared value by exploring to what extent the current activities of a business create shared value. For this activity a template is designed that is part of the facilitation materials of the bootcamp. The facilitation material for the bootcamp is combined in the Impact Workbook and is designed to enable peer-to-peer learning in a way similar to interviewing. Each activity is done together with a different entrepreneur while continues to follow their own individual process. The Workbook guides the participants through the activities of the bootcamp and gathers the results in one overview. Finally, the design of the bootcamp is made tangible in the development of a pilot for the Impact Bootcamp, scheduled to take place in April 2016, two months after the completion of the graduation project.","social business; entrepreneurship; peer to peer learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

However, manually designing robots with mechanical properties that implicitly compute and execute a specific task is very hard and time consuming. To assist designers, a platform that automatically designs dynamical mechanisms is needed. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are suggested as invention machines for similar domains and seem promising for automatic mechanism design. However key obstacles are the representation of dynamical mechanisms, operators for sexual reproduction and maintaining population diversity. We present a robot genome based on graph theory that is as compact as possible, has no genetic multiplicity and is completely closed. We define a sexual operator that is able to merge both topology and parameter data from two parent-robots to form a child-robot that is essentially a mixture of both parents. And we investigate which of the most commonly used methods for diversity maintenance improve optimization performance for dynamical mechanism design best. We demonstrate that our new representation and sexual operator enables automatic design of dynamical mechanisms. Specifically, we showcase automatic design of two-dimensional mechanisms (with a single degree of freedom) that track a straight line (Roberts mechanism) as well as an ellipse by virtue of their kinematic and dynamical properties. The best optimization results are obtained by maintaining diversity with a combination of the island and the diffusion model. We demonstrate the practical value of the evolved mechanisms by extracting design principles and by redesigning a mechanism to include mathematically hard-to-formulate objectives such as aesthetics and symmetry.","dynamic; robot; task specific; mechanism design; genetic; evolutionary; algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Design","","BioRobotics","",""

(mentor); Rutgers, P. (mentor)","2016","The starting point from this project was the plan of Leapfrog 3D Printers to start selling packages aiming on specific user groups. For this project the focus was on the architecture industry and the content of the package could become anything from adjustments to the printer to some sort of service. As a start, an analysis was performed on Leapfrog as a company, 3D printing and the architecture industry. Based upon their specifications Leapfrogs printers are among the best within their segment. However, this comes with a price, the printers are also relatively expensive compared to its competitors. A user experience test with Leapfrog its Creatr HS was executed with a group of inexperienced participants. It turned out that it was quite hard to get started with the 3D printing process without significant knowledge. To completely master the technique one need to learn a lot, until know mostly via trial and error. The Creatr HS on its own did what it is supposed to do, however can improve on user friendliness in several areas. Multiple architects were interviewed to get an overview on the architects design process. Many of them had eliminated model making from the design process because of the time it takes. They however all acknowledged the value of model making. 3D Printing can be valuable for architects in the design process. For some who already make models it can be an addition to the techniques they are currently using, they could use the technique really at its qualities to create complex object. For others, it could become the first step back to model making, the printer could make entire models for them without the need of putting much time on the manual model making. From these conclusions three design directions were generated and with these the ideation phase started. The design directions were used to explore possibilities. Clustering generated ideas led to four concepts of which the training and tutorials cluster was chosen to continue with. 3D printing is a skill with a relative steep learning curve. As a beginner you have to take into account quite a lot which can easily go wrong without the right guidance. This is one of the main reasons why people, and thus also busy architects, do not start with 3D printing or quit with it after a while. The training and tutorial cluster takes the user by the hand in this process. It was chosen to develop the concept in an online environment, in this way the content is easy for Leapfrog to keep the content up to date and improve it through the feedback of the users. Furthermore, the step to expand the courses to other target groups is small. An ideal concept was developed which was then translate to a feasible version, to let Leapfrog be able to implement it on short term. An interactive prototype was made to show the future vision for the architectural package. By offering three ways to get to the lessons an architect can pick the way that suits him best. Hereby, he is not obliged to follow an entire course, with possibly many unnecessary lessons, which can take a lot of valuable time. The first way is a structured one, following lessons from a to z. Within the explore section of the future vision architects can browse to a gallery of architecture related pictures which are coupled to lessons that relate to the pictured building. The troubleshooting section of the concept approaches the lesson from the other way around. When an architects get stuck somewhere in the process of 3D Printing he can go through this section to find the way a solution. For the feasible version, Thinkific was found as the most appropriate Learning Management System for the demands Leapfrog had. Within this environment the courses were set up and lesson were worked out. The lessons aim to teach the architect about 3D printing related skills through the use of architecture related examples. The lessons within these courses were built up based upon ‘Gagne’s 9 events of instruction’ to make sure the structure was consequent throughout all lessons. For every lesson there was sought for a balance between theory and practice in order to support all learning styles. The package structure and developed lessons were evaluated in a user test. Several architects were asked to follow two lessons and give feedback on them. Improvements in the design were made based upon the findings from the test. The most important adjustments that had to be made were about writing efficiency and making illustrations more clear. To conclude, the feasible concept is a proper first step into a new area for Leapfrog. Writing lessons however is a discipline on its own on which Leapfrog will need to keep improving. Further research on learning styles and ways to serve user groups in the most optimal way could help to further improve the concept towards the future vision.","3D Printing; Architects; E-learning; learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Horst, A.Q.C. (mentor); Jonkers, H. (mentor); Peters, P. (mentor)","2016","The motivation to adapt a building in terms of an upward vertical extension lies within the need for urban renewable programs. Although this practice has significant supports to make the built environment more sustainable, there are also barriers which invariably concern costs. In the case of vertical extension projects, the constructional and structural implications are greater than for other renovation projects. Hence, the major objective of this study is to identify the design parameters that outline the optimal vertical extension in building renovation with respect to costs and environmental impact, and alongside, to compare the design options of reuse and vertical extension and demolition and new structure. For these purposes, a crossed research was carried out, including a literature review, the analysis of existing case studies, interviews, and at the end a comparative analysis, based on the design of a new case study. First, the literature review presents the 'state of the art' of vertical extension projects from the structural engineer's standpoint. Then, the first list of critical design parameters were identified, on the basis of the analysis of the case studies and the interviews. The last part of this thesis, consists of the investigation of a new case study, an existing vacant building in the Hague, called Astoria. A preliminary structural design was carried out for different scenarios of vertical extension, which were defined with respect to the extent of interventions in the existing structure. Then, a global cost analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment are performed for both design options, presenting the results in comparative graphs. As a result of the structural analysis, the foundation and the shear concrete core were figured out as the critical structural elements during the vertical extension. Moreover, environmental impact and costs analyses highlighted the addition of 4 storeys as the optimal vertical extension for Astoria; further vertical extension requires interventions in the existing structure, which makes the project economically unviable. Concluding, this research indicates five principal design parameters that define the optimal vertical extension, namely, the municipal policies, the foundation of the existing building, the absence or not of testing methods, the floor system of the new block, and, last but not least, a feasibility study, which reveals the relationship between value and costs. For future projects, it is advised to introduce these parameters in the initial design stages, as a quick scan, in order to investigate and optimize the possibilities for vertical extension. As an outcome of the Astoria comparative case study, it is further suggested to introduce vertical extension as a normal practice in building renovation, regarding the multiple benefits and perspectives that have been revealed for both developers and society on the basis of environmental impact and construction costs.","vertical extension; design parameters; LCA; environmental impact; existing structure; reuse; construction costs; structural assessment; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering","","52.0703047, 4.321442"

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Metrikine, A.V. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (mentor)","2016","As part of the Afsluitdijk project the discharge capacity, which is currently facilitated by two sluice complexes, is increased to cope with future sea level rise. It was decided to realise this by an innovative solution: the pump gate. The steel lifting gates, each containing three pumps, will be implemented in the existing sluice complex in phases, expecting a total of thirteen by the year 2050. This concept provides the possibility of pumping when necessary without hampering the discharge capacity during gravity flow, in which case the gates are lifted. The gates were designed to withstand quasi-static loads. Mainly due to the presence of the pumps, which have a high weight and require limited vibrations, the dynamic behaviour of the gate may lead to more strict design requirements. Two reference designs are investigated: the regular, and flood defence pump gate. The latter is designed to act as part of the primary flood defence, and is therefore significantly more robust. The analysis of the pump gate is limited to three components: the gate structure with its supports, pumps, and fluid. Standard expressions for the hydrodynamic pressures do not apply to the pump gate and surrounding fluid, mainly due to the three-dimensional vibration shape of the gate and the presence of the pumps. General methods or numeric models to quantify vibrations are not readily available for a continuous system with interacting gate, pumps, and fluid. In this thesis, a method is developed to determine the dynamic behaviour of gate-fluid systems confined by sluices. This method is based on a frequency domain semi-analytical coupled modal analysis, able to directly solve the behaviour of gate and fluid for the linearized equations. Several fluid schematizations are found in literature taking surface waves, compressibility, or neither into consideration. The validity of these schematizations was investigated for a wide range of water depths and excitation frequencies. Distinct regions were found in which these physical processes do or do not have an effect on the hydrodynamic mass. The so-called `transition region' is characterised by the absence of both compressibility and surface wave effects. The hydrodynamic mass is therefore frequency-independent in this region and no hydrodynamic damping is present. The response of the pump gate reference designs is quantified by a three-dimensional plate model, based on previously described method. Both designs have considerably higher eigenfrequencies than those corresponding to regular wave excitation. For the Den Oever case, the quasi-static approach therefore suffices when considering wave loads. This is not the case for excitations originating from the pumps, which relate to a wider and higher frequency range. As a consequence of the preliminary design phase, exact pump specifications are not available. Results are therefore based on a pump envelope of possible excitations and presented as risks. These apply to the Den Oever gate designs, but are also relevant to the pump gate concept in general. Three response amplitudes were quantified: the gate's deflection, pump vibration velocity and the resulting fluid pressures. Furthermore, based on the amplification of the static deflection an estimation of the maximum stresses is made. For both designs maximum deflections were less than a millimetre, which is negligible considering the dimensions of the gate. This is explained by the relatively small amplitude of the pump excitation forces compared to the total of static loads. Nevertheless, a significant deflection amplification (dynamic/static) is found. When internal stresses are amplified similarly, a risk of fatigue and even direct failure exists for the regular pump gate design. The more robust flood defence pump gate design reduces stresses to acceptable levels. Vibration velocities of the pumps were compared to ISO limits for non-rotating pump parts. For the regular design at several frequencies these limits were exceeded. The robust design is able to limit these velocities considerably. Most concerning is the magnitude of the pressure fluctuations in the fluid. For the regular design, pressure head amplitudes at the suction side up to 0.5 metre were found. This leads to an increased risk of cavitation, and therewith damage and a reduced efficiency. Furthermore, total head fluctuations over both sides of the pumps can be in the same order as the static pump head. This is expected to lead to an unacceptable reduction in efficiency. The robust flood defence pump gate does reduce these fluctuations over the first range of the investigated excitation frequencies (< 250 rad/s), but for several frequencies leads to a larger response at higher frequencies. %This is likely due to the closer overlap of the structural and fluid eigenfrequencies in that case. %High pump excitation frequencies can therefore be very harmful. The dynamic behaviour of gate and fluid should therefore be considered in further design of the pump gate. Concluding, the dynamic behaviour of the pump gate designs should be considered in further design phases, since several risks were identified. The combination of a robust gate design and limited high frequency pump excitations may lead to an acceptable design.","Fluid Structure Interaction; Vibrations; Gates; Pumps; Pump gate; Afsluitdijk; Den Oever; Structural Dynamics; Fluid Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","52.938758, 5.050762"

(mentor); Van der Male, P. (mentor); Van Baalen, L. (mentor)","2016","The latest Conference of Parties at Paris resulted in an important agreement that 27 percent of the total European energy consumption has to come from renewable energy in 2030. Offshore wind energy is an important resource for renewable energy. The shortage of shallow water areas pushed offshore wind farms into deeper waters. Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) become more economically viable in deeper waters than bottom founded wind turbines. The goal of this research is to explore multiple installation methods for the pull-in of a dynamic power cable into a FOWT and to compare them with respect to workability determined by different limitations. The FOWTs transfer its energy using dynamic power cables. The dynamic cable configuration used in this research is a pliant wave supported by distributed buoyancy modules (DBMs). The properties of the dynamic cable and the configuration have been chosen in cooperation with cable supplier JDR. For the FOWT a design of a vertical axis wind turbine combined with a tri-pod substructure is used. VBMS\'\ Ndurance is chosen as reference cable lay vessel (CLV) for the installation. The first method is pull-in of the dynamic cable in a pre-installed FOWT. A CLV performs the pull-in directly after laying of the dynamic cable towards the FOWT, with the tether supporting the dynamic cable configuration being installed afterwards. The second method is a post-lay pull-in of the dynamic cable into the FOWT with aid of the CLV. The third method is a post-lay pull-in of the dynamic cable from the FOWT only. In the last two methods, the dynamic cable is picked after wet storage on the seabed. The difference between these methods lies in the shape in which the dynamic cable is wet-stored. The DBMs and tether are already installed during the wet storage period of method two and three. In addition, free lay of the dynamic cable and overboarding of it prior to the pull-in operation is modelled as a reference case. In the first two pull-in method the dynamic cable transfers from the CLV towards the FOWT using a winch control system. The system controls the pay-out and pull-in rates of the winches on the CLV and FOWT, respectively. The system ensures a minimum seabed clearance and avoids that the cable configuration becomes too tight. Ansys AQWA and OrcaFlex are used to model every aspect of the different methods and operations. In addition, an external Python script is used to control the rates of the winches. All dynamic cable analysis are performed using a regular wave approach with three different wave heights and periods for every direction, distributed uniformly in 30 degree bins. The results show that all pull-in methods are suitable to install the dynamic cable into the FOWT. Based on these results the third pull-in has the highest workability. This is explained by the fact that the pull-in is performed by using the FOWT only. Therefore only the FOWT influences the cable motions, whereas in the other methods also the CLV adds to the dynamic cable behaviour. The FOWT has a more stable motion behaviour in environmental conditions compared to the CLV. For this reason the interaction of the cable with the seabed is reduced and a higher workability is obtained. Cable compression is a limitation which is a common issue in cable installation analyses. In this research it is the most common failure mechanism for all methods in environmental conditions. A correlation between compression and large vertical cable accelerations is found in the free lay model and the pull-in method 1. These vertical accelerations are mainly caused by the buoyant cable section which lies in the splash zone. Compression in the two post-lay methods is caused by interaction with the seabed during recovery of the cable. The buoyant part of the cable is modelled with the DBMs uniformly distributed. At the transition point, where the cable diameter changes due to the DBMs, problems with exceeding of the maximum curvature are found, since the cable has no contact with the chute. Avoiding of exceeding of this maximum curvature is possible by introducing a structure which supports the DBMs at the stern of the vessel.","FOWT; Floating Offshore Wind Turbines; Dynamic power cable; Subsea cable; Wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Bottom founded structures","",""
