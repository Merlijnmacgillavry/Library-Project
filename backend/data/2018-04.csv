The capability of creating a sustainable manufacturing strategy for spare parts or tools would significantly improve both mass budget and costs. Therefore, additive manufacturing (3D printing) in space is seen as an enabler of future scenarios that explore beyond the current boundaries we have. This work assesses the change in material properties when recycling 3D printed parts, specifically made from the engineering thermoplastic polyether ketone ketone (PEKK). Mechanical and thermal material characterization is done on PEKK on a powder, filament and 3D printed level before and after recycling. Another challenge when embarking on a deep space mission is space radiation, both from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and from solar particle events (SPE). Therefore, this study aims at understanding how PEKK could prove to be a passive radiation shield during storage. This was achieved by simulating the interaction of particles with the shielding materials in a Monte Carlo simulation using FLUKA. Two potential future scenarios are envisioned and worked around: a cis-lunar station and a lunar base. To conclude, this complete ecosystem is assessed from a system engineering perspective, providing an answer as to whether this approach is effective and how it could be optimised.<br","3d printing; additive manufacturing; recycling; radiation; shielding; polymer; engineering thermoplastic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In recent years, the traditional approach of downscaling the feature size and increasing the operating frequency of the devices to improve the performance is slowing down due to the reaching of physical limits. Different solutions have been proposed to increase the performance such as using multi-core platforms, able to work in parallel. However, this introduced other issues such as a high latency and power dissipation due to the long communication distances. To overcome this, 3D Stacked ICs have been proposed, allowing for shorter vertical interconnects and higher transistor density. With the introduction of 3D stacked ICs (3D-SIC), the manufacturing processes and its test flow become more complex. As each chip requires to be tested prior to deployment, its crucial to find optimal test flows.<br/>Developing an effective test strategy for 3D SICs is a complex task. During a 2D process, there are typically two test moments (i.e., wafer test and packaging test). However, for a 3D process, the number of possible moments grows based on the number of dies in the stack as many partial stacks test can be performed. In addition, also the interconnects between the stacked dies can be tested, as they play a crucial role in determining the correct functioning of the device. Testing such a partial stack may reduce the cost as it prevents good dies being stacked on them, but on the other hand may increase the total cost due to extra test costs. To help making such decisions, appropriate cost models are required. They are tools used to estimate the cost of a test flow typically applied at an early design stage. The information obtained from them can then be used to optimize the process in question and reduce the cost. <br/>In this thesis, the functionality of 3D COSTAR is extended. 3D COSTAR is a tool developed with the goal of modeling the complete 3D SIC supply chain, including design, manufacturing, test, packaging and logistics. This thesis first presents a test flow optimization algorithm. It is used to evaluate and find the best test strategy, i.e., the highest fault coverage at the lowest cost. Second, a stacking order analysis is performed in which the impact of different stacking orders is evaluated. The goal is to evaluate whether a different stacking order reduces the overall cost. We evaluated both extensions using three case studies. Overall, lower cost solutions were found across all three cases. With respect to test flow optimization, cost reductions of 4%, 6% and 27% were obtained for the three case studies. With respect to stacking order analysis, a cost improvement up to 16% was realized. <br/><br","Stacked-ICs; Cost modeling; 3D COSTAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-30","","","","","",""

But as these markets are governed by people and depend on the behavior of people directly, they are susceptible to challenges from the social, economic and cultural norms around the people. One of the example is the cultural discrimination in energy trading noted by some researchers and practitioners in rural India, where people do not prefer to trade energy and goods with different castes, especially lower castes. This creates an unfair market for the poor and lower caste producers, and thus this thesis aimed at modeling such markets through agent based modeling, and introduce different automation mechanisms, namely local mediation, and bid splitting to prevent the effects of discrimination in energy trading. Local mediation allows introduction of a mediator who prevents from direct trade between people and thus prevents any discrimination, bringing in some sort of anonymity. The other mechanism of bid split allows splitting the bids by producer and consumer into small chunks, such that 2 producers in market with 1 and 100 units of energy to trade would look like 101 producers in market trading 101 units of energy. Evaluating the results of these mechanisms on increase of social welfare, efficiency, market access and reduction of inequality has shown that the bid split helps in reducing the discrimination, and so does the introduction of mediation (where the mediator does not discriminate). The former has much more significant effect on the market access, and the validation of the model has helped derive some policy recommendations for implementer in the energy industry and governance field e.g. on the load management for the devices.","agent based model; Energy Market; Decentralized; Social inequality; India","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in general, reset controllers do not have the same steady state properties as linear controllers, like removing steady state errors. In case of model mismatches and disturbances, this may cause limit cycles (persisting oscillations) in the closed response when (constant) references are tracked. The occurrence of these limit cycles is very unwanted in mechatronic precision systems, since the response does not converge to the desired set-point.<br/><br/>To avoid / remove limit cycles in the response, some reset control methods are currently available. Examples are PI+CI controllers, reset controllers that reset to non-zero values and reset controllers with (adaptive) feedforward. Although the existing methods can be used to overcome the limit cycle problem, they are often dependent on the model of the system or are a trade-off between linear and nonlinear control. Hence, the existing methods are not very robust in general or do not use the full advantage of reset control. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a simple and robust fixed instant adaptive reset controller is developed for a minimum phase SISO system that can be stabilized by standard PID control. The presented adaptive reset algorithm detects if a limit cycle is present and adapts the after reset value in an iterative way until the limit cycle is removed. Although no mathematical proof is given, the idea behind the presented method is explained. Simulations and measurements are performed to show that the algorithm is able to get rid of limit cycles caused by model mismatches and constant input disturbances. Furthermore, it is shown that the adaptive algorithm can be applied to zero-crossing reset as well.<br","Reset control; Adaptive control; Iterative Learning Control; Limit cycles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are different rowing styles and techniques between rowers. Making rowers row in synchrony, while important for the boat performance, is not easy. Rowers have their own signature rowing curve, of which only few aspects can be changed. The signature rowing curve can be based on the oar angle or the relative displacement of the rower. The latter is assumed to be constant for changes in the rigging setup and therefore preferred.<br/>The data used in this study comes from a woman’s double, the rowers of which are members of the KNRB. In the boat measurements are done on the gate and foot forces, as well as the oar angles, the seat displacement and boat accelerations. <br/>From the free body diagrams of the different parts of the system, a one-dimensional rowing model is derived. The model is driven with the measured forces on the rower and the oar angles. It can be validated with the measured boat accelerations. The distribution of the masses in the system are slightly changed. All drag force on the system is assumed to be viscous and is assumed to be proportional to the square of the boat velocity. The lateral forces on the blade and the oar deformation are neglected.<br/>The relative motions of the rower are best predicted with the forces acting directly on the rower, after a compensation of the measured foot force. The best fit for the boat accelerations are found by combining the system acceleration with the relative accelerations of the rowers. <br/>With the assumption that the rower can be modeled as a force constraint model, the rigging setup of the modeled boat is changed. The blade forces have a leading role on the resulting boat motions when changing the rigging parameters. However the blade forces might not be realistically modeled. Changing the lever ratio of the oar, by increasing the inboard length leads to a bigger covered oar angle and a higher boat velocity, but a lower work per stroke applied on the handle by the rower. Moving the footstretcher towards the bow of the boat shifts the oar angle and leads to a higher boat velocity and lower handle work per stroke as well. Changing individual rigging parameters did not result in big differences between the rowers. <br/>No indications of improved synchronization between the rowers are found and the energy balance of the system is disrupted. The model simplifications of the blade forces may not be justified.

This model is created using literature and a single case study conducted at KLM Engineering &amp; Maintenance Engine services (KLM E&amp;M ES). The model is tested using a data set consisting of all the quality measurements registered during the repair process for two quality contributing modules within the engine. The main research question this thesis is attempting to answer is: How can the quality performance of the engine MRO process steps be used in order to improve the stability of the engine quality output measured in Exhaust Gas Temperature Margin? This research begins with determining how the quality performance of the total engine is influenced. Then, the research is focussed on the gas flow path clearance. Each engine is built up out of sets of fanblades in the compressor and turbine modules. The quality of the engine is measured in degrees of EGT Margin (EGTM) and has a direct relationship to the Time On Wing (TOW) of the engine on the aircraft. Deterioration of the EGTM is mainly caused by increases of the fanblades tip clearances and deterioration of the seals that need to be matched to the casings for each individual set of fanblades. The researched is supported by the case study at KLM E&amp;M ES and is scoped to investigate the CFM56-7B engine used in the Boeing 737 aircraft type and focusses only on the compressor part of the gas turbine consisting of two modules, the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) and Low Pressure Compressor (LPC). In 2017, the quality performance of KLM E&amp;M ES was 67%. For the current state at KLM E&amp;M ES there is a high fluctuation in the delta contractual and actual EGT Margin. Hence, the match between EGT Margin that is agreed on and delivered is unstable. In 73% of the cases where a quality contract is made with the customer, there is an over performance in terms of degrees EGT Margin. The current state quality is controlled by the engineering department which creates a Bill of Work (BoW) where four types of repair possibilities are identified per engine module in order of EGT impact: Full overhaul, Performance restoration, Minimal overhaul or the part is serviceable removed and later assembled as whole. Since the BoW is the only type of quality control within the process, the contractual value cannot be set to a higher standard that can be monetized. This research helps to identify steps within the process where measurements take place that can help to estimate the total EGT Margin contribution value to the engine as a whole. This way, the EGT Margin level can be determined based on the in situ measurements and the goal is a closer match to the contractual EGT Margin values with the actual ones. This research is concluded with a future state analysis where a Matlab model of the Low and High Pressure Compressors is created. The Matlab model is based on the Engine Service Manual and Workscope Planning Guide with the goal to simulate the impact of decreases in variance of the fanblades sets. The model is validated and tested using the KLM E&amp;M ES case study with the actual handwritten quality performance registrations on piece part level. For the HPC, the limits of fanblades repairs has a bandwidth of 5 microinch in which the repair is considered serviceable. This 5 microinch influences the EGT Margin with 3,7 degrees EGT Margin potential for the HPC. When the lowest blades within a set are replaced, the maximum potential EGT margin that can be gained is 1.6 degrees EGTM. The Matlab model shows that the largest potential EGT gain is in stage 8 of the High Pressure Compressor. The variance at KLM E&amp;M ES is the highest in stage 8 and 9. The decrease of the variance can result in a potential of 11 weeks Time on Wing. This research ends with recommendations for further research. A similar study is needed on the quality contribution of the combustor and turbine assy’s. Finally, this research can be continued in order to create a model for EGT Margin estimation for the CFM56-7B engine. A hypothesis for continuation of this research is formulated as follows: The quality of the CFM56-7B engine in terms of EGT Margin can accurately be predicted using the repair step measurements of the combustor, compressors and turbines.","KLM; Lean; Six Sigma; Aircraft; Quality; TAT; TAT45; Engine; Combustion; High Pressure Compressor; Low Pressure Compressor; Tip Clearance; Fanblades","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the search for new forms of renewable energy production, an interesting option is to make use of the energy stored in the ocean in tropical areas. The sun heats up the surface water in these areas to a point it is feasible to generate electricity, using the temperature difference between the hot surface water and the cold ocean water at around 1 [km] depth. This form of renewable energy production is called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). As the water temperature in these areas is quite constant, the electricity generation is quite constant as well, which is a big advantage as no inefficient energy storage or unsustainable base load generation is needed. To make OTEC power generation more economically attractive, design optimization and technology up-scaling need to be done, lowering the costs of the components and making sure the components work as efficiently as possible. A crucial component is the condenser. In the condenser, heat is transferred from the working fluid in the cycle (most commonly ammonia or ammonia-water) to the cold water. The working fluid is condensed, which can then be pumped around. The process of pumping the water up from 1 [km] depth is a costly operation (Kirkenier, 2014) and the condenser itself is a significant part of the cost of an OTEC-plant. It is relevant to gain more insight in the transport phenomena in the condenser by executing experiments, so the cost can be reduced. The experimental set-up is a small scale OTEC cycle prototype (OTEC-demo), located in the Process &amp; Energy laboratory at the Delft University of technology. For this research, a gasketed plate heat exchanger is added to the set-up, which can be used as a condenser. On the gasketed plate heat exchanger it is possible to apply some modifications and to change the number of plates, as the heat exchanger can be disassembled. Nine miniature temperature sensors are placed along the flow direction of one of the heat transfer plates for local temperatures measurements. For future research on the flow patterns in the condenser, a transparent corrugated plate was designed and fabricated for visualization purposes. First, the plate was designed with 3D CAD software. Then, the plate was constructed by milling, at the central workshop of the Delft University of Technology. A single phase convective heat transfer coefficient correlation and a pressure drop correlation for the cold water side in the condenser were proposed, by executing experiments with water on both sides of the heat transfer plates in the gasketed plate heat exchanger. In order to research the influence of the vapour quality and the mass flux on the convective heat transfer coefficient on the working fluid side, ammonia-water mixture condensation experiments were executed. During the experiments, the measured cold water temperature profiles were linear for all the set mass flows. This means the convective heat transfer coefficient did not change much along the flow direction of the plate, which can be explained by the small change in vapour quality during the ammonia-water mixture experiments. The convective heat transfer coefficient on the working fluid side increases for increasing mass flux and also increases for increasing vapour quality. The results of these experiments were compared to the theory. A numerical condenser model, which can predict the measured data, was developed. The numerical condenser model is a modification of the numerical condenser model by Goudriaan (2017) and Kuikhoven (2017). By comparing the results of the experiments to the results from the model, the assumptions made in the model can be validated. The model can predict the cold water inlet temperature and the working fluid outlet temperature of the experimental data within an accuracy of 4%. However, this only applies to the measured range of experiments. More experiments are required to propose correlations that are valid in a higher range of mass flows and vapour qualities. Furthermore, pure ammonia experiments were executed. The results were compared to the ammonia-water mixture experiments. The convective and overall heat transfer coefficients decreased for increasing mass flux during the pure ammonia experiments, while the convective and overall heat transfer coefficients increased for increasing mass flux during the ammonia-water mixture experiments. More experiments are needed to investigate this phenomenon. The pressure drop of the pure ammonia flow is slightly higher than the pressure drop of the ammonia-water mixture, due to the lower density of pure ammonia.","Energy; OTEC; Condenser; Experimental; Heat exchanger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In this research two acoustic analogies, the linearized Euler equations and Lighthill’s equation are evaluated. These equations describe the propagation of acoustic waves. Both the linearized Euler equations and Lighthill’s equation use a right hand side source term that is determined by a fluid solver. When coupling the fluid solver with an acoustic solver for a low Mach number aeroacoustic problem, a difference in spatial and temporal scale can exist for the fluid and acoustic calculations. This research is based on aeroacoustic solvers in which the spatial grid for the acoustics and the fluid is exactly the same. Due to this condition it is shown that the ratio between the fluid and acoustic time step is governed by the inverse of the Mach number to ensure that both the Courant and acoustic Courant numbers are smaller than one. In the case of low Mach numbers (M &lt; 0.1) this results in a time step difference between the acoustic and fluid simulation of at least a factor 10. Due to the time step difference, the source term in the fluid solver is not updated for every acoustic time step and hence the accuracy of the acoustic result is reduced. To remedy this decreased accuracy one could solve for the source term at every acoustic time step. However this leads to lengthy computations. The objective of this research is thus to improve the efficiency of the fluid acoustic coupling by increasing the acoustic accuracy for non-matching time steps in the fluid solver and in the acoustic solver. This research objective can be fulfilled by improving the source term transfer from the acoustic solver to the fluid solver by higher order temporal interpolation between different source levels. Furthermore the source term can be reconstructed at the nodes by implementation of a higher order time integration method in the fluid solver. In this research is investigated whether the improved temporal transfer and reconstruction of the source term can lead to an increased time step difference between the fluid and acoustic calculations for which an acceptable acoustic accuracy can be obtained. The approach taken in this research is based on firstly quantifying the effect of keeping an analytic monopole source term constant for multiple acoustic time steps. To adequately describe how the source term is updated, a source term Courant number is derived. This number is defined as the time interval between source term updates multiplied by the summation of the convective velocity and the speed of sound and divided by the spatial acoustic step. Then the source term levels are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials, to assess the improvement of the acoustic results. Furthermore this known analytic monopole source term is reconstructed by solving an ordinary differential equation that has the monopole as its exact solution. Both the spectral deferred correction method and the backward Euler method are used to solve this equation. The spectral deferred correction method is a higher order method that uses iterative low order substepping over Gauss Lobatto quadrature nodes. Using Gauss Lobatto quadrature allows for exact integration of the integral in the Picard formulation. In the last part of this research the spectral deferred correction method is implemented in an incompressible, transient fluid solver to construct higher order source terms. Lagrange interpolation is used to interpolate the source terms at the Gauss Lobatto node locations, to improve the source term transfer to the acoustic solver. The results from this research show that a large distortion of the acoustic results take place when the source term Courant number exceeds one. For the source term transfer to the acoustic solver, interpolation with Lagrange basis functions over Gauss Lobatto nodes delivered the most accurate acoustic results. In terms of higher order time integration, the reconstruction of the source term by solving an ordinary differential equation with the spectral deferred correction method showed the highest accuracy. The root-mean-square error of the acoustic result was decreased compared to a backward Euler method. The relative effect on the improvement of the acoustic accuracy proved to be highest by Lagrange interpolation over the Gauss Lobatto nodes compared to accuracy improvements at the nodes by the spectral deferred correction method. Finally based on the result from the implementation of the spectral deferred correction method in the incompressible, transient fluid solver, it can be noted that the spectral deferred correction method did not show the same error convergence as was found in the solution of an ordinary differential equation for the reconstruction of the analytic monopole. The Lagrange interpolation over the Gauss Lobatto node locations improved the overall acoustic result in the active source region of the flow. In the far field the acoustic results were similar for both zeroth order interpolation (which resembles the original piecewise constant source term) and Lagrange interpolation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jonker, P.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In computer vision pose estimation of objects in everyday scenes is a basic need for a clearunderstanding of the surrounding environment, fields of interests include; augmented reality,surveillance, navigation, manipulation, and robotics in general. Pose estimation is a wellstudied topic, however fast and robust solutions are still hard to obtain. The goal of thisresearch is to robustly and efficiently perform 3D pose estimation of multiple objects withina single RGB image in real-time (&gt;24framespersecond (fps)). To achieve this goal an existing CNN is utilized, more specifically the YOLO network is used.This provides a stable platform for object detection and classification, the network is onlyslightly modified to include pose regression. The YOLOv2 network was originally designedto generate bounding boxes around objects and classify the objects within the boundingboxes. This research shows that using a single confidence value rather than 4 boundingbox parameters is sufficient to determine the relative location of objects within the image,limiting the number of parameters that need to be trained. This has allowed to make thenetwork more efficient and to make the network focus more on training the pose parameters(azimuth,elevation and distance) rather than the bounding box parameters. Using several techniques like data augmentation, data clustering and data selection the state-of-the-art AVP of 50.1% was achieved on the azimuth estimation problem. For the full 3Dpose (azimuth, elevation and distance) problem the AVP is limited to 30.1%, with no directcomparison this is still considered to be state-of-the-art. However, normalizing the confidenceoutput of each image in the post-processing step has increased this accuracy further, improvingbeyond the state-of-the-art results. With a normalization step the AVP score has reached 63.0% and 40.4% respectively. These results show that the pose estimation problem hasimproved significantly, getting closer to a viable solution for real-world applications. However, further improvements can be made in the post-processing step, the data augmenta-tion step and the data selection step. The research conducted has shown that accuracy gainsare not only achieved through better network architecture but are also highly dependent onthe training and processing techniques used. This is evident from the accuracy increase of 38% from an AVP of 25% to an AVP of 63%. Optimizing these techniques specifically for theYOLOposearchitecture, might result in a solution that can be used in real-world applications.","Convolutional Neural Network; Pose estimation; Object detection; object classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Comfort and control of the Twinrider (the only sit-snowboard on the market) are insufficient for advanced riders who reach higher speeds and ride more bumpy slopes. The goal of this study is to design a sit-snowboarding mechanism that provides sufficient comfort and control for advanced users. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">In the new mechanism design (Snowcruiser), vertical suspension is added between the seat and the board using two mountain bike forks. Independent compression of the forks, nose/tail translation of the seat and board flex are allowed. These alterations prevent control interference, visional and vibrational discomfort due to seat tilt, vibrations or shocks on the seat. A continuous interaction of the snowboard with the surface though board flexion and less vibrations on the board also improves control. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">With a quantitative test the performance of the new design is evaluated by a straight descent from a bumpy, artificial slope. The prototype carried a dummy weight and the descent is guided by a skier. Using four accelerometers of which two were placed on the board and two on the seat, accelerations were measured. To assess the severity of these vibrations and shocks the standard BS 6841 is used. Vibration Dose Values (VDVs) for the board and the seat are determined after weighting the accelerations to the frequency and direction as described in the standard. Seat tilt and contactless distance were determined using data from high speed cameras. Setting each combination of maximum and minimum height, compression and rebound speed resulted in eight Snowcruiser models. With analysis of the variables, speed dependency is checked and an insight is gained on the behavior of the different combinations of settings. Also a qualitative test is performed in which two riders actually sit in the prototype and slide over hills while turns are made. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The measurements show that the VDVs on the seat are lower for all Snowcruiser models than for the Twinrider, indicating less discomfort. The riders of the qualitative test confirmed this by experiencing a smooth run: No shock is felt when landing after a hill. The Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (S.E.A.T.) is not lower for the Snowcruiser than for the Twinrider, so vibration isolation is not more efficient for the Snowcruiser. However, the Snowcruiser shows reduced accelerations on the board. The Snowcruiser is able to keep the seat horizontal for small inclines. The qualitative test shows that more board flexion is possible. The variable of contactless distance is strongly depending on riding speed, and therefore not a useful variable in this study. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Both tests show that comfort and control are improved for the Snowcruiser and that the goal is achieved. A height of 500mm, maximum compression and fast rebound form the most promising combination of settings. The measurement method presented in this study is a valid method for performance evaluation of comfort and control for a sit-snowboard, using the variables VDV and seat tilt.","sit-snowboarding; adaptive sports; suspension; board flexion; performance evaluation; whole body vibration; vibration dose value; seat tilt; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design | Sports Engineering","",""

Notifications from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to their customers play a crucial role in the fight to clean up the malware infected IoT devices. It is, however, difficult for the employees of abuse departments to explain how to cleanup an IoT malware infection to a non-technical customer and provide usable action steps to clean up the infection. In particular, because there is no “one size fits all” cleanup solution, due to the heterogeneous nature of the IoT devices. The abuse department of the Dutch ISP KPN would like to know how to notify customers with IoT malware infections and how to explain the cleanup of infected IoT devices to the customers. Therefore, the objective of this research is to make a recommendation to KPN on what notification mechanism to adopt by providing insight into: (1) how to increase the effectiveness of IoT malware notifications from an ISP to its customers in terms of IoT malware cleanup; and (2) how users perceive an IoT malware notification from their ISP. To this end, an experiment has been conducted with 190 retail customers with infected IoT devices to measure the difference in cleanup among IoT malware notifications sent via different channels and with different messages. To explore the reactions of the customers to the different notification mechanisms, telephone interviews have been conducted and the communication logs between KPN and the customers in the experiment have been analysed. We have compared the influence of the notification channel on cleanup and the reactions of customers by comparing customers that received: (1) email notifications; and (2) a combination of walled garden and email notifications. The different notification messages that have been compared in this study include: (1) the walled garden notification content that KPN’s abuse department uses to notify its customers with an IoT malware infection; and (2) a newly composed more actionable walled garden notification message which clearly defines the steps that need to be taken while avoiding technical terms. It is found that a combination of a walled garden and email notification with an actionable content is the most effective in terms of IoT malware cleanup. Furthermore, the walled garden notification is most effective in getting customers to read and react to the IoT malware notification, yet it sometimes results in customers having a low satisfaction with the service they receive. The more actionable notification content results in better understanding and trust from the customer compared to a less actionable content of the notification. However, customers’ understanding of the notification content and the satisfaction with the quarantine event remain a challenge.","Internet of Things; IoT; Security; Abuse notifications; Walled garden","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technology is expected to bring major benefits in terms of safety, traffic flow efficiency and environmental impact. Furthermore, by eliminating the necessity of actively steering the vehicle, automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring extra free time during the day to perform activities, as well as increase mobility of some excluded societal groups (e.g. elderly). However, taking away the burden of driving might also bring negative results. The convenience of the technology might encourage people to travel further and more often. Moreover, AVs users might transfer some of the activities from the traditional environments into the vehicle (e.g. work). The associated rearrangement of daily activity plans might have an impact on travel and residential location choices, possibly leading to further increase in overall travel distance. In such way, the expected positive impact of the technology could be compromised.<br/>For that reason, it is necessary to examine behavioural response to AVs, namely the way travel time will be used in the vehicle and its consequences for daily activity plans, travel patterns and residential location choices. In order to fill in this scientific gap five focus groups were conducted. The participants were confronted with a simplified scenario of the future after broad AVs implementation and were asked a set of questions regarding the aforementioned topics. It was found that, in contrary to the current modes, time inside AVs will be perceived not in terms of burden or opportunity, but rather in terms of pure opportunity. The participants perceive AV time as an extension of either work or private time. In context of daily activity plans it brings about a number of possible behavioral adaptations. In case of regular commuters, a willingness to use the in-vehicle time to release pressure from daily life was often identified, whereas people with less stationary jobs claim that the AV would allow them to bring more flexibility into their daily plans, or move their actual office or even the entire business into the vehicle.<br/>However, the findings regarding daily activity plans do not provide a clear answer on their impact on travel and location decisions. At the same time, a number of advantages of AVs for irregular, long travels was identified, and many participants explicitly expressed their willingness to increase the amount of such travels. The impact of AVs on residential location choices appears to be limited: although people are not willing to move because of the AV, they claim it would still play a significant role in their relocation decisions if it was necessary for other reasons. Moreover, some AV-specific phenomena were discovered, which might have an important significance on the actual AV use: namely increased pressure to perform onboard activities and feeling of “being trapped” in the vehicle. Furthermore, the participants pointed at the striking easiness of making travel decisions in case of AVs, compared to other modes. Although the results bring a valuable indication of possible behavioral adaptation to the technology, one must also take into account limitations of the study. The most important of them is the speculative, imaginary character of the focus groups discussions, simplified future scenario and subjective character of qualitative analysis. Therefore, in the future studies on behavioural adaptation to AVs it is suggested to take a more experimental path, aiming at emulating the actual AV experience as far as possible. In that way the credibility of the findings from the present study could be further validated and extended.","Automated vehicles; Behavioural response; Focus groups","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In this case, it was the Japanese on one side Australian and US forces on the other. After the war a lot of equipment was left in the jungle and because of the low population density on the island some material can still be found to this day. Planes and vehicles that were abandoned far enough from villages were able to withstand the test of time and are still hidden under the trees. In November 2018 an expedition force is heading to the island to find some of these planes. This assignment was meant as a preparation for that expedition and it was my job to find places that could be interesting to investigate closer in the field. The research question that had to be answered was as follows: is it possible to classify and link historical data to modern data. To do this I looked at old aerial photographs of the airports, and at modern Sentinel-2 and Landsat multispectral images of the area. The aerial photographs are stitched into a panorama and geolocated so that the coordinates were known. Next features like the average and gradient of surrounding pixels are computed so the image could be classified. Classifications were then performed on the panoramas and on the Landsat 8 dataset in order to create a map of the region of interest and possibly point out potential war equipment locations. The Landsat data was also used to create a heatmap to show the warmest spots in the region. These spots could potentially point to material that is warmer than its surroundings, e.g. a metal car in a grass field that has been standing in the sun for some time. The classification of the panoramas proved to be a difficult task and the final result leaves much to be desired. The classification of the Landsat 8 dataset went better and the results show a useable map. However the most interesting class in this case was the war equipment class, which cannot be validated. The heatmap could mostly be used to highlight the roads, but there are certain spots that light up and cannot be explained without field data. These spots might be interesting to check out during the expedition.","Remote Sensing; New Guinea; landsat 8; aerial photograph; Plane wrecks","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

These primary flood defences<br/>are every twelve years assessed on safety during the Dutch national safety assessment. In 2017, the new<br/>safety standards (WBI2017) were introduced. These stricter standards caused that in total 251 km of the<br/>primary flood defences was rejected on height, which includes the failure mechanisms wave overtopping<br/>and overflow. Traditionally, dike strengthening is required. However, the new Delta Plan gives also spe-<br/>cial attention to the implementation of innovative nature-based solutions, for example the integration of<br/>shallow foreshores without or with vegetation in the safety assessment. These foreshores can reduce the<br/>incoming wave load by dissipating energy through wave breaking, bottom friction and vegetation attenu-<br/>ation.<br/>(Vegetated) foreshores are also present in front of some river dikes, called floodplains. Probably, 5 to 15<br/>procent of the foreshores in the current reinforcement program (HWBP) is not or conservatively consid-<br/>ered in the safety assessment, which entails unnecessary costs (approximately 0.5 - 1 billion euros). In a<br/>quickscan of the riverine area several locations are indicated which meet the requirements as promising<br/>locations for wave reduction by vegetation. However, despite a renewed focus on building with nature,<br/>implementation of nature-based flood protections is hindered by te dike managers because of a knowl-<br/>edge gap in the effects of the variable vegetation on wave energy dissipation. The state and functioning of<br/>vegetation during design conditions is uncertain. This uncertainty is the most important reason for dike<br/>managers to hamper the implementation of a nature-based flood protection. The main objective of this<br/>thesis is to determine the reliability of willow vegetation as wave load reduction for river dikes.<br/>In order to assess the variability of vegetation on the wave damping, a field test and simulation models<br/>are used. The measurement set-up of Deltares consists of a plot of 7 x 7 meters with young willow<br/>branches and pressure transducers perpendicular to the river, which measure the (by ships produced)<br/>waves in the river Noord. Based on the field measurements, a model is developed and applied to determine<br/>the drag coefficient of willow branches. This model is an one-dimensional SWASH model which contains<br/>the bathymetry and the willow vegetation, characterised by a density, branch diameter and drag coefficient<br/>for three height ranges. These parameters provide the obtained wave attenuation by vegetation. The<br/>diameter and density were measured in the field. Therefore, the drag coefficient can be determined by<br/>calibrating the outcomes of the numerical model with the field measurements.<br/>From the field measurements by Deltares, it can be concluded that willow branches reduce incoming<br/>waves with a height higher than 0.20 meter with approximately 4 % per meter willow vegetation width.<br/>The wave attenuation depends mainly on the water depth and shape of the willows. The stiff stem of old<br/>willows damps waves less than high dense, more flexible branches above the stem, and the wave damping<br/>decreases with increasing water depth mainly when branches submerge. The field measurements are used<br/>to calibrate the drag coefficient. The 25th and 75th-percent value of the calibrated drag coefficient were<br/>calculated on -1 and 5, a large range. A negative value may not be possible, because this means an increase<br/>of the wave height by the willow vegetation. This large range in calibrated values and the existence of<br/>negative values are caused by the measurement set-up. The plot with willows was too small for accurate<br/>measurements and the crates, in which the willow branches were planted, caused distortion of the waves<br/>due to the sudden bottom elevation. Because of this, the first sensor at the edge of the crate (at the river<br/>side) has probably encouter measurement errors. Third, the angle of the incoming ship waves caused an<br/>underestimation of the calculated wave damping capacity of willows. The set-up should be improved to<br/>give proper results and conclusions about the drag coefficient of willows. The drag coefficient remains<br/>therefore uncertain and gets a large standard deviation in the second part of the research.<br/><br/>In this second part, a study is carried out to the uncertainties of implementing wave damping wil-<br/>low vegetation. A one dimensional wave model based on the wave energy balance, is created for a dike<br/>section at the Heesseltsche Uiterwaarden, alongside the river Waal. Waterboard Rivierenland suggest<br/>this floodplain as opportunity for planting wave damping willow vegetation to compensate the required<br/>heightening of the dike.<br/>In the wave model, various input parameters are required to calculate the wave damping: boundary con-<br/>ditions, dike-foreshore parameters and the vegetation parameters. These parameters have all certain stan-<br/>dard deviations or variations. First, the effect of these standard deviations on the wave damping is deter-<br/>mined, and so the overtopping discharge and required crest level. Second, a thorough analysis is made<br/>to exogenous threats which affect the vegetation parameters. For willows this could be diseases, insects,<br/>ice, animals, drought, flood, fire and storm. The effects of these threats on the vegetation parameters are<br/>estimated by the knowledge and expertise of willow experts and a literature study.<br/>It is concluded that from all input parameters with standard deviations, the variations of the vegetation pa-<br/>rameters has the largest effect on the obtained wave overtopping. The wave reduction depends mostly on<br/>the vegetation height and water depth, which was also concluded by the field measurements. Second im-<br/>portant vegetation parameter is the density of the branches or the drag coefficient, if the drag for willows<br/>can be lower than 0.4. The most relevant influential threats with a high risk and significant consequence<br/>are storms, floodings and droughts.<br/>These effects of the standard deviations of input parameters, exogenous threats and annual maintenance<br/>on the overtopping discharge (and required crest level) are used for a recommendation about the design<br/>and maintenance strategy of willow vegetation as solution. The willow vegetation should ensure enough<br/>wave damping during the total lifespan of the reinforcement to comply the safety assessment. Therefore<br/>it is recommended to extend the width of the willow vegetation with a buffer zone in which all the vegeta-<br/>tion uncertainties can be accommodated. The width of the vegetation plot is therefore the main parameter<br/>that should be assessed during inspection. Note that the uncertainties and probabilities of the exogenous<br/>threats are assumed. Further research is required to validate these assumed values.<br/>To conclude, willows can be used as wave damping vegetation at floodplains along rivers. The<br/>branches of willows will reduce the incoming waves significantly if they are not submerged. The height<br/>of the willows is therefore the most important vegetation factor and should be assessed during inspections<br/>just like the required vegetation width to ensure the wave damping capacity during the total lifespan of<br/>the dike reinforcement. The reliability of willows for wave load reduction on river dikes is sufficient if<br/>the maintainer apply the design and maintenance principles as recommended.","Wave Attenuation; Vegetation; Flood Risk; River dike; Nature Based Design Element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","BE SAFE",""

Over unswept wings, the leading cause of this is the growth of flow instabilities called Tollmien-Schlichting(TS) waves. This thesis aims to test the feasibility and performance of a designed Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller in attenuating TS waves, in an experimental setting. A modified flat-plate test setup with an adverse pressure gradient was used to generate and characterize these waves, while control was performed using a Dielectric-Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator. Embedded microphones were used to measure the pressure fluctuations within the boundary layer, while Particle Image Velocimetery (PIV) was used to quantify the flow. The performance of the controller was investigated at its nominal and off-design conditions (robustness), as well as its comparison to open-loop continuous forcing. For the nominal design conditions, a reduction in the spectral energy of the peak frequencies of four orders of magnitude are observable for the closed-loop case, two orders more than the open-loop case. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the downstream signals showed an overall maximum additional reduction of 55% of the pressure fluctuations, compared to the open-loop case. The controller was more robust at lower peak-to-peak voltages, with an overall 30-60% reduction in RMS of the pressure fluctuations, compared to open-loop forcing .This study demonstrates the feasibility of using LQG model-based techniques as a viable flow-control strategy in damping flow-instabilities, and is an option worth further investigation.","Flow-control; Plasma actuators; Tollmien-Schlichting waves; Model-based Control; LQG control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Where tracking tasks have shown the potential to quantify fine motor skills of the hand, too little is known about the ocular motor behavior during tracking tasks to make it clinically applicable. This paper therefore studies the gaze of the human eye and will quantify the ageing effect on the gaze dynamics in healthy controls, as neurodegenerative diseases can be age-related. Experiments were conducted with 40 participants divided in two groups of 20-30 yrs and 55-70 yrs old. The tracking tasks designed involved an eye-only tracking task where a target had to be followed by the eyes alone and an eye-hand tracking task involving the hand to track an element as well. As an addition to the gaze dynamics, the hand dynamics during the eye-hand tracking task has been analyzed too. Two quasi-random forcing functions of increasing bandwidth (increasing difficulty) were used, making it possible to create models for the gaze dynamics and the hand dynamics. Overall, the gaze performance of the older group was worse than the gaze performance of the younger group, apparent in a lower gain parameter \(K_g\) when changing task condition and a higher time constant in the eye-hand tracking condition for older people. The second-order model parameters did not show the expected differences. Additionaly, similar yet not significant results were found in the hand dynamics. This research was able to identify an ageing effect in the gaze dynamics and the experiments can therefore be extended to research with patients, using the generated results as normative database.","Eye movements; Gaze dynamics; Ageing; EyeSeeCam; Pursuit tracking task; Manual tracking; Cybernetic approach; System identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Weijde, J.O. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Twisted and Coiled Polymer Actuators (TCPAs) are a new type of thermally driven fiber artificial muscles with many attractive advantages, including high power-to-weight ratio, large contractions, lightweight, and low cost. However, one drawback is a low force that one TCPA can generate. To fully implement TCPAs in robotic systems, TCPAs must be combined into larger structures to achieve higher forces. A common force amplification strategy, arranging actuators in parallel, can lead to bulky structures, especially for TCPAs. This design strategy differs from that in nature. Nature arranges muscle fibers in angular orientation, which is a space-saving strategy, to build powerful muscles in a slender muscle-like form factor. Subsequently, control of TCPA structures requires a model. Closely packing multiple TCPAs potentially introduces a thermal interaction between the TCPA fibers in a structure that could affect their force production. <br/>This work investigates whether the behavior of a bioinspired TCPA structure can be predicted given a force model of single TCPA fiber. To that end, this work studies the influence of the neighboring thermal effects between TCPAs. The Joule-heated TCPAs were modeled using a Standard Linear Solid model in combination with a proportional contribution by temperature. Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of neighboring effects, by varying (1) the distance between fibers and (2) the number of fibers. Planar structures composed of up to 8 TCPAs were experimentally investigated. The scaled and geometrically-translated Joule-heated TCPA force model was used to compare the mechanical behavior of structures with different conditions. <br/>The tested structures showed no notable difference in force measurements. It was concluded that the varied number of fibers and the distance between fibers in the TCPA structures did not affect force production of individual TCPA fibers, meaning that neighboring effects can be neglected. When heated, however, the thermodynamics of the structures could not be predicted by the TCPA force model, which was estimated in a separate experiment. Adaptations to convection coefficient in the TCPA force model resulted in sufficient prediction of the TCPA structures. The difference in model convection coefficient between experiments highlighted the TCPAs' sensitivity to conditions in the working environment. It was suggested that the TCPA structures up to 8 fibers could be adequately predicted given TCPA force model estimated under the exactly same ambient conditions as used in the structure. <br/>This work provides the basis for TCPA structure modeling to promote the use of TCPAs in the wider force range robotic applications.<br","Polymer Actuator; Artificial Muscle Structure; Bio-inspired","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Various solutions to rendering these effects in real-time exist, basing themselves upon the single scattering approximation. Transparency is another difficult subject within the field of computer graphics, due to the constraint of having to somehow find the order of semi-transparent objects, or to approximate them independently of order. However, no prior research has focused on scenes in which both participating media and semi-transparent objects are present. While a technique such as Depth Peeling (Everitt, 2001) can be used to solve the problem, this method has some major downsides and often does not obtain real-time results. In this thesis we attempt to obtain faster results, while trying to pertain as much quality as possible. To this end, we take the Depth Peeling method as our reference.<br/><br/>By partitioning scenes into what we call 'depth zones' as seen from the light, we can obtain necessary color and depth information to then approximately render the required result using ray-marching. Partitioning scenes is done in various ways (uniformly, non-uniformly) and special data structures are used to store all necessary information efficiently. The combination of partitioning and data storage led to two new methods being implemented: Multisample Texture Depth Zones (MSTDZ) and histogram-based MSTDZ, of which the last sorts fragments of a scene into bins to determine where to partition depth zones in a less naive way than standard MSTDZ. Both of these methods have the ability to approximate Depth Peeling's results very well, at higher speeds and, depending on the approximation, using lower amounts of memory.<br/>A final addition was implemented which groups texels of the histogram texture used in histogram-based MSTDZ as to use smaller textures. In low complexity scenes, this gives the possibility to lower the amount of consumed memory, at the cost of time and a small amount of quality, compared to the reference method.","computer; graphics; real-time; scattering; participating; media; transparency; transparent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such activity is the logistics involved in O&amp;M. The increasing logistical costs have been a challenge which can hamper the O&amp;M market in the future.

Five times a year the RAI hosts events where the amount of exhibitors is to big to fit in the current buildings. At these moments pavilions are constructed at the Europaplein, the pavilions are there approximately 1/4th of the year. To strengthen the connection with the neighbourhood the RAI initiated project ‘De Plint’. This project is aimed at developing the borders of its property, both commercial and noncommercial for the coming years. ‘De Plint’ distinguishes two kinds of target groups, the ‘Moeters’, people who come at the RAI for their work, and the ‘Willers’ the target group who have nothing to do with the current operations of the RAI. As part of ‘De Plint’ this graduation assignment was initiated with the focus to enhance the experience of the ‘Willer’ at the Europaplein. The method used for this thesis is nudging, as Hansen &amp; Jespersen (2013) describe: ‘Ways of influencing choice without limiting the choice set or making alternatives appreciably more costly in terms of time, trouble, social sanction, and so forth’. During the internal and external analysis of the RAI, the Europaplein and nudging, the future noord/zuidlijn commuter was chosen as the target group to design for. This target group is a result of one Amsterdam’s biggest construction challenges, the Noord/Zuidlijn metro, and the 22nd of July it will finally open. This metro will bring an estimated extra 7 million visitors to the Europaplein. Interviews with these future commuters showed that there is not a uniform way of prefered traveling by metro. The only thing their trips had in common was the frustration towards people who stand just outside of the metro station entrance. The biggest challenge that the RAI faces is facilitating these people through the crowdedness of the Europaplein full of pavilions from and to the Noord/Zuidlijn entrance. If this does not succeed neighbourhoods perception of the RAI will negatively be affected. Therefor the design statement for this graduation assignment was formed: “Design a nudging strategy that enables the future commuter to cross the Europaplein at full capacity to the Noord/Zuidlijn metro entrance the way they prefer” The nudging concept that is created is 3D video mapping at the pavilions of the RAI. The 3D mapping visuals attracts the eye of all the future commuters. The commuters can decide for themselves what their planning is. If they are being nudged and curious by the 3D mapping, the commuter can sit and have a look at the visuals. In this way they nudge the people away from the walking paths in front of the Noord/Zuidlijn entrance. When the future commuter is in a hurry the nudges can be neglected and walk over an obstruction free square to the Europaplein. The visuals will show all kinds of art created by local artist to strengthen the connection with the neighbourhood.","Nudge; Nudging; Behaviour change; Noord/Zuidlijn; RAI Amsterdam; Commuters; 3D mapping; Video Mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","","52.341304, 4.890547"

This journey started off with the quest to fight plastic waste pollution of the rural areas in Kenya. After thorough field- and technological research, I developed a toolset that allows locals to transform plastic waste into products that allow for clean rainwater collection. From this experience, I drew insights, which can be applied for product design for development aid in general. These insights are formalized in a framework for designers.<br/> <br/>I came to understand that the easiest way to give locals an incentive to clean up their environment is to show the value that the plastic waste has as a resource. These resources could be used as building materials to produce products that are highly needed in the everyday lives of Kenyans, like rooftops, gutters and water pipes. The advantage of looking at local resources from waste in this way is that users have access to all resources, needs and production methods and can thus be self-sufficient.<br/> <br/>As I argue in this thesis, this approach is opposed to the way many other Western aid initiatives are tackling problems for African locals at the moment. Through introducing a seemingly meaningful product, a social problem might be successfully solved. However, after this product’s breakdown, only Western knowledge and resources can be employed to repair it. Hereby, an ongoing dependency between Western aid initiatives and African users is created.<br/> <br/>In the first chapter, I write about aid initiative in Africa and argue about their fallacies as local problems are not looked at from a local perspective. Product-based aid projects will be discussed in detail to understand what impact product design has and how it can be improved.<br/><br/>In the second chapter, I will look at the problem from another perspective. I show how plastic waste is harming the ecological system in Kenya and how this waste can be taken as resources to solve local problems.<br/>As a solution to the social needs and the ecological challenges, I propose a model of Self Sustaining Product Systems (SSPS) in chapter three. In these systems, local Africans are the both the actors and beneficiaries. The SSPS model allows for solving local problems with local resources. In order to design and implement SSPS, I introduce a framework for designers called Ripple (Resource Innovation for Products that Promote Local Empowerment) in chapter four. In the Ripple framework, I explain how to analyse, ideate, conceptualize, prototype, test and disseminate self-sustaining product systems.

This results in the charge owing inside of a region not equal to the charge owing out of that region which causes a local charge build up. These charges are known as space charges. These create region(s) of high electrical stress which can result in partial breakdown or in some cases complete breakdown of the insulation material as well. Hence, space charge accumulation in cable insulation material governs the failure behaviour and life time of the cable. <br/>This thesis look into the possibility of carrying out an off-line space charge measurements for real-sized HVDC polymeric cable insulation samples using the electrostatic probe technique. The first objective is to develop a calibrated sample using which it is possible to carry out the space charge measurement. Secondly, the possibility to convert the measurements obtained from the sample into the space charge distribution is looked into. A calibrated sample (prototype) is prepared and both the objectives are evaluated using it.<br","space charge; electrostatic probe; feasibility study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-25","","","","","",""

In dense sand with low permeability this might lead to the so-called breaching process. The creation of a steep underwater slope marks the beginning of a breaching process. <br/>Pore volumes of densely packed sand tend to increase during shear deformations. This effect is called dilation. As the grain slides over each other, the pore volume increases resulting in increased underpressures. Water, eventually, has to flow in to compensate for this underpressure. The flow rate depends on sand properties. The underpressure keeps the sand body, temporarily, stable. When enough water has flowed in and the sand has dilated enough, sand particles release at the front. This is at the start of the breaching process. This leads to a density current consisting of sand mixed with the surrounding water, which runs down the slope and might cause erosion. The steep front of the slope moves with a certain velocity, which is called the headwall velocity. <br/><br/>A breach can be stable or unstable. A breach is stable if the breaching height decreases in time and unstable if the breaching height increases in time. This work aims to improve the prediction of the stability of a breach. For this purpose I carried out a series of large scale breaching experiments. During these experiments the initial breaching height, slope angles, and sand types and varied.<br/><br/>Literature suggest that the stability of a breach can be predicted using the headwall velocity and the angle at the toe of the breach. The experiments show that this is indeed the case, but that breaches are more stable than literature suggests.<br/><br/>Therefore, to predict the stability of a breach we must know the angle at the toe, and the headwall velocity.<br/>The experiments show that the angle at the toe converges towards the angle that is predicted using equations found in literature.<br/><br/>A formula to predict the wall velocity can be found in literature. Comparison with the experiments show that this formula can predict the wall velocity when no slides are present, but at large breach heights these slides often occur.<br/><br/>The experiments show a clear correlation between the breach height, and the frequency of sliding wedges.<br/>Empirical equations following from the test data predict the percentage of the sliding wedges at different breaching heights are proposed.<br/><br/>A steady state numerical model, to calculate the pore pressure during a breaching process, was programmed in MATLAB. Using these pore pressures, a stability analysis was carried out. This analysis confirms that breaching height is an important factor for the prediction of sliding wedges.<br","breaching; process; stable; unstable; experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Currently, an increasing amount of debris is floating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) endangering space operations. To limit the contribution of non-operational satellites to the space debris problem a semi-controlled end-of-life de-orbit strategy can be employed. In this strategy the satellite is controlled from the end-of-life orbit down to low altitudes (120 to 200 km). From this altitude the satellite follows a ballistic trajectory towards the surface of the Earth. The target of such maneuver is to phase the impact probability track, with the Earth, such that the resulting impact track covers mostly uninhabited areas. <br/><br/>The objective of this thesis, is to provide insights into the effects of assumptions made in recent research of the semi-controlled de-orbit strategy. Furthermore, the extent to which the casualty risk can be reduced is investigated. Two optimization strategies are carried out. First, the control profile for the complete semi-controlled de-orbit strategy is optimized for minimum casualty risk using a differential evolution algorithm. Second, the initial state of the ballistic trajectory, at the point where the controls are turned off, is also optimized for minimum casualty risk using a differential evolution algorithm. In case similar impact tracks are achieved for both optimizations, future analysis of the semi-controlled de-orbit strategy can be performed which less computational effort. <br/><br/>Employing a semi-controlled low-thrust de-orbit strategy can reduce the casualty risk with 2 to 3 orders of magnitude with respect to an uncontrolled de-orbit strategy. Large ballistic coefficients are beneficial for the reduction of the casualty risk. Furthermore, orbits with high inclinations results in larger reductions of the casualty risk with respect to low inclination orbits. Also the results for low inclination orbits are less sensitive to errors in the re-entry state caused by imperfections in the GNC system of the satellite during the de-orbit maneuver. The lower sensitivity is the result of a better configuration of the impact track with respect to the large land masses on Earth. To find optimal impact tracks on the Earth, it is sufficient to optimize only the last 150 km of the trajectory. In case an accurate estimation for the value for the casualty risk is needed, higher fidelity models must be applied and the uncertainties in initial state at 150 km need to be investigated in more detail. The assumptions made in previous research influence the results with less than 33% and can easily be applied when an optimal impact track is sought for with low fidelity models. For investigating the range of re-entry conditions for which the resulting casualty risk is below the set requirement, some of the assumptions cannot be applied since it limits the solution space for the GNC system to target. Furthermore, in case an accurate value for the risk needs to be found, high-fidelity models are required and in that case, the effect if the assumptions is too large.","semi-controlled; re-entry; end-of-life; differential evolution; tudat; pagmo; casualty risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

To this end, the kinodynamic<br/>Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is extended to use a maneuver automaton and optimal motion primitives in its steering function. A learned cost-to-go distance metric for the state space is formulatedto efficiently calculate distance between states, which is used to search for nearest neighbors in the kino-<br/>dynamic RRT algorithm. The performance of the planner using the learned cost-to-go distance metric is compared to a minimal curve length distance metric based on<br/>Dubins Curves and the commonly used straight-line Euclidean distance metric.

The goal of this research project is to reduce door-to-door travel time for passengers (PAX) traveling within Europe by 1 hour and at least improve the overall travel experience for 70% of all PAX.<br/><br/>Earlier research has indicated that by eliminating traditional luggage actions and processes from the PAX’s journey, an average of 32 minutes can be saved. Through the introduction of a door-to-door luggage service, PAX are enabled to send their luggage ahead of their journey. Thereby, eliminating the need to travel simultaneously with their Check-In luggage and bypassing all traditional C.I. luggage processes. This research focused on which customer segment should be target, how this service could be realized from a hospitality perspective, and how a marketing strategy can be designed to drive service adoption.<br/><br/>The adoption of new product and services are dependent on certain risk and acceptance criteria (Evans et al. 2013). Through qualitative research, it was found that the most important risk and acceptance criteria related to the door-to-door luggage service, where the level of compatibility, trialability, relative advantage, financial risk and functional risk. <br/><br/>Research showed that the majority of PAX have a specific booking order when it comes to booking their trip, in which they first arrange their flight and ancillaries after which they will book their accommodation. Combining this problem with the lack of general awareness concerning door-to-door luggage services means that the chances that a PAX will book a luggage ancillary through the accommodation supplier is slim to none. <br/><br/>An analysis of the hospitality sector showed that Tour Operators are hospitality establishments that are fully vertically integrated and manage their own booking flows. Moreover, as families traveling with young children is an important customer segment for such establishments makes them the perfect hospitality business to offer the service. <br/><br/>A study in ancillary strategies identified that more expensive ancillaries can be seen as extravagant and too expensive far from the use state (Travelport, 2017). Thus, the question arises how to convince PAX to make use of a more expensive luggage ancillary, without prior experience or knowledge, and far from the use state. <br/><br/>Instead of trying to sell PAXs an expensive luggage ancillary without any prior knowledge or experience, it is suggested to offer PAXs who have bought regular luggage ancillaries with the ability to have their luggage shipped back-home on their return journey. Therefore, the initial experience with the service is seen as a priming tool to drive returning purchases for the next holiday. Thereby, creating a more loyal customer base. <br/><br/>To realize this back-home service, a new online customer journey was designed which acts as an extension of the current app and online platform of the Tour Operator. Additionally, a set of offline touchpoint were designed to approach PAXs who were not able or reluctant to make use of the online touchpoints. <br/><br/>Furthermore, to create more awareness and drive recurring sales a referral strategy was designed in which both the sender as the receiver of the referral are rewarded. Thus, stimulating further ancillary sales and create brand loyalty. To help implement both the back-home service as well as the referral strategy a blueprint explaining the necessary resources and processes is developed.<br/><br","Service design; Seamless Mobility; Aviation; Hospitality sector; Customer Journey; Check-in luggage; Reduce travel time; PASSME; Design; Marketing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","PASSME",""

Economic growth, natural population growth and the inflow of refugees from Syria cause an increased water demand in Lebanon. In the meanwhile, the precipitation rates of Lebanon are decreasing. An important water source of Lebanon is the Litani river, which is totally located within the borders of Lebanon. The water of this river is used for agricultural purposes, production of hydropower and supply of domestic water. At the moment, domestic water supply is only a small user of the water of the Litani river. However, water supply from the Litani river to the capital of Lebanon, Beirut is proposed. The Litani already nearly dries up each year and therefore the water allocation of the Litani river has to be optimised. This research aims to optimise the water allocation of Lebanon, in order to protect the country against the looming water crisis. Since the Litani is the most important river of Lebanon, the research focuses only on this basin: the Litani River Basin (LRB).<br/>Optimal water allocation is achieved when the social benefits gained from the deviation of water are at a maximum. The social benefits are described by three principles: economic efficiency, social equity and sustainability. Since the Litani river is an important source for the Lebanese economy, the economic efficiency principle is assumed to be the most important principle in optimising the water allocation.This means that the optimal water allocation is achieved when the profits from the deviation of water are maximised. In order to optimise the water allocation in the LRB, the current water allocation is needed. In this research project, first the current water allocation will be described. Afterwards,<br/>scenarios will be applied to see what the effect is on the current water allocation. The research ends with the implementation of measures in order to see their effect on the water allocation. <br/>The current water allocation is based on hydrological data of the area and the assumption that in the current water allocation everyone tries to maximise the total income of the LRB. <br/><br/>The water of the Litani river is used by three different sectors: agriculture, energy and supply of domestic water. In most of these sectors, water does not directly generate a profit. For example the agricultural sector: yields are increased by the availability of water and these yields will be sold. Formulas of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) are used in order to determine the actual yields. The actual yield depends on reference evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration and crop characteristics. 훼 is added to the equation in order<br/>to model the current situation. 훼 describes the current power of the agricultural sector. This value is based on the current amount of water flowing to this sector and the profits that are generated within this sector. The value of this objective function is limited by the hydrological conditions of the area. The current power of the agricultural sector is 0.445. Therefore, the power of the hydropower sector is 0.555. When water is used for the production of hydropower, it can be used for other purposes afterwards. A part of the water that is used for the production of hydropower is used for the supply of domestic water afterwards, therefore the domestic water sector is not included in the objective function.<br/><br/>In the current water allocation 71.7% of the water is used in the agricultural sector. The other 28.3% is used to produce hydropower. Of this water 23.4% is afterwards supplied as domestic water to the inhabitants of the LRB. The agricultural water use is mainly high in the subbasins with a high marginal<br/>value. If one extra unit of water is flowing to these subbasins, the increase in the profits will be significant. The model is based on the assumption that all individuals try to maximise the total income of the Litani River Basin and therefore the water will be used in the subbasins with the highest marginal<br/>value.<br/><br/>Two scenarios are applied to see the effect on the current water allocation: a water supply to Beirut and a flow to the downstream subbasins. Water supply to Beirut is a proposed solution in order to provide the inhabitants of Beirut with enough domestic water. The water that will be supplied to Beirut, first will be used to produce hydropower. Therefore, the minimum flow to the hydropower stations will be 93 million 푚3/year. In order to reach this amount of water, less water will be used for agriculture. This causes a decrease in the profits generated within the area. Furthermore, the Qaraoun Lake is over-exploited. In the end of the season in which hydropower is produced, the Qaraoun Lake is almost empty. In the first years, 93 million 푚3/year can be delivered to Beirut. However, the Lake has to be over-exploited to reach this amount and therefore the water could not be supplied in the last years.The demand of Beirut is too high to be supplied by the LRB.<br/>The supply of water to the downstream basins will only take place during the dry months. In the current water allocation the water level is high during these months, since the water is not used for the production of hydropower in these months. During the dry period, the demand of the agriculture in the downstream subbasins is high. During these months 10% of the water stored in the Qaraoun Lake will flow downstream. The profit will remain more or less constant, however the flow to the hydropower stations will decrease. The amount flowing from the Qaraoun Lake to the downstream subbasins is small compared to the area of the downstream subbasins and therefore the effect will not be significant.<br/><br/>Measures are proposed to see how the water allocation could be optimised. Replacing water sensitive crops by water insensitive crops is the best way to optimise the water allocation within the LRB. There are two reasons why this measure is the most effective one. The first reason has to do with the yield<br/>response factor. Water insensitive crops have a lower yield response factor and therefore the decrease in yield will be less significant when a water-deficit occurs. Furthermore, the water insensitive seasonal crops are groundnut and tobacco. These crops are profitable crops and this will positively affect the water allocation within the LRB as well. The other principles of optimising the water allocation are social equity and sustainability. It is difficult to give a conclusion about the sustainability, since the exact water levels in the Litani are unknown. However, the system is not sustainable when it has to supply water to Beirut. In order to reachthis demand, the water of the lake has to be over-exploited. A conclusion can be drawn about thesocial equity principle, agricultural water is available within the entire LRB and the agricultural profits generated per hectare are equally divided over the area. Since there is enough water available for the inhabitants of the LRB and agricultural water is available over the entire basin, the water allocation is optimal according to the social equity principle. However, when Beirut is included in this social equity principle, the water allocation will be optimal when water is supplied to Beirut as well.","Water allocation; Lebanon; Agricultural waer; Hydropower; Hydroeconomic model; Domestic supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33.569007,35.694271"

The principles are still applied today. Although it is observed that obtained results may differ from reality, when the circumstances do not represent the situation of the original experiment. To investigate this, the performance of various prediction models is analysed on a large scale laboratory test set-up. In recent publications, several researchers observed disturbances in their expected flow patterns. Described as either 'unsteady flow’, ‘instability’ or 'unexpected mechanism'. Talmon developed the theory that the occurrence of these events could be explained by transient processes in the pipe flow. It is recommended to use a test pipe with great length. To verify, by longitudinal pressure profile measurement, that equilibrium is measured, and that indicated transients are captured by the measuring system. A laboratory test set-up is provided by the CCCC National Engineering Research Center of Dredging Technology and Equipment Co., Ltd. In a joint research program with Delft University of Technology: the pressure drops for water and mixture flow over the pipeline length are analysed. This is done for horizontal hydraulic transport. The focus is on comparing test results with existing theories and find explanations to deviating results. If instabilities are observed, the gathered data can be used for further research on density waves in pipelines. In the liquid flow experiment, three prediction methods derived from the Colebrook-White equation are analysed: Darcy-Weisbach, Swamee &amp; Jain and RangaRadju &amp; Garde. Considering the pipeline to be smooth, the predicted values are similar. The difference between them is almost nil. Furthermore, the result shows good correspondence with the data acquired on the test set-up. In the mixture experiment, four prediction methods are analysed: Durand, Führböter, Jufin &amp; Lopatin and Wilson. They are compared with laboratory data of test conducted in a heterogeneous flow regime. With a velocity ranging from three to six meter per second and concentrations of: 4.4, 8.1, 12.3 and 14.6 percent. In a general approach, considering all transport velocities and concentrations. It is observed that the theoretical principle described by Durand shows the closest resemblance with the experimental data. When only the concentrations are considered, a distinction has to be made. For the two lowest mixture densities, the Führboter method gives the best fit. For the highest two, the best correlation is according to the Durand theory. The principles of Jufin &amp; Lopatin and Wilson underestimate the pressure loss. Where the difference of the former is significantly larger in comparison to the latter. For the lowest velocities of the twelve and fifteen percent slurry experiments, stationary waves over the pipeline length are observed. Due to the length of the test set-up, the transition to equilibrium flow is clearly visible. It demonstrates that longer flow loops give opportunity to conduct further research into the extent of waves.","Hydraulic transport; Pipeline; Slurry flow; Hydraulic gradient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-24","","","","","",""

The first part of this problem lies in the fact that it is never known what the future will bring. Especially when looking at a period of 30 years which is the general lifetime of a naval vessel. In practice this is partly countered by introducing a major update at the halfway point in the ship's life cycle. The other part of the problem is that the fleet capabilities need to be distributed over the different vessels and vessel types. Because having an infinite fleet size would be far too expensive, certain compromises need to be made. The main of which is that having a finite fleet will result in lower costs but also means that when a vessel is occupied all capabilities of that specific vessel are unavailable for other activities. For this reason it is important that the fleet composition is constructed in such a way that at all times, or at least within an acceptable error, the requirements set by the missions can be met.<br/>The method that is created during this research acts like a proof of concept of whether such a method could be useful in the future. This research should be able to help with the iterative process of balancing the operational need and design requirements with the feasibility and affordability that occurs within the early design stages of naval fleet design. The main stakeholders in this process are Commando Zeestrijdkrachten (CZSK), the department of planning (DPLAN), and the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO). These three parties can respectively be categorized as the user, military planner, and the supplier.<br/>In order to reach the research goal a model has been created that simulates naval fleet behaviour. This Fleet Behaviour Model (FBM) describes a fleet as a collection of capabilities which are distributed over different vessel types. In order for this fleet to be operational it needs to comply with certain Life Support Activities (LSA) such as maintenance and the training of the crews. The operational need of this fleet is simulated by generating mission scenarios which require certain capabilities from this fleet for a specific time and at a specific location. Next to requiring mission specific capabilities from the fleet the missions also have the possibility of enemy presence. When this happens naval combat is simulated which introduces attrition into the model. The inclusion of attrition into a fleet behaviour model is what makes this research unique. Using this model the performance of multiple fleets can be tested against one or more scenarios. <br/>After the Fleet Behaviour Model was finished and tested a Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been constructed in order to systematically find an optimal solution. In this case an ""optimal solution"" is the fleet of which the capabilities and the distribution of these capabilities best fit a given mission scenario. It also takes into account the difference in design priorities that can change over time. One or more of three performance parameters: mission successfulness, attrition, and fleet size can be prioritized. Depending on factors like risk and budget these priorities can change which in turn can have a drastic impact on the resulting fleet compositions.<br/>In order to test the models' capability to provide insight into what makes an effective fleet, three test cases have been constructed. These test cases test the model on how well it can generate performance optimized fleet compositions as well as testing the performance of one fleet against a range of different scenarios. After these simulations the resulting data has been analysed in an attempt to find clues on what makes one fleet perform better than another. This insight was than translated to the broader spectrum of general early stage naval fleet design.<br/>In conclusion, the data gathered from the test cases has proven that the model is capable of providing insight into the early stage design requirements of naval fleet design. As a proof of concept this Fleet Behaviour Model seems promising as a useful tool for naval fleet design in the near future.<br","Naval fleet optimization; Hughes' salvo model; Fleet behaviour; Fleet composition; DMO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four porous plates with different hole sizes and porosities, as well as a solid, 'dummy', plate, have been tested in a Mach 2 wind tunnel whereby an oblique shock wave (produced by a wedge) impinged on its surface, for two different wedge angles. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements, and Schlieren images, were recorded and used to analyze the interaction. The effect of the porous-plate covered cavity on the interaction's downstream boundary layer thickness and turbulence, flow separation and interaction length were analyzed and explained. The results showed that first of all, concerning the effect on boundary layer thickness, an increase in boundary layer thickness is induced by from the presence of a porous plate-covered cavity, that the effect of plate hole size, porosity and shock strength on this increase are insignificant. The turbulent kinetic energy of the downstream boundary layer could be observed to increase for a low shock strength, and decrease for a higher shock strength. This leads to the presumption that under specific circumstances a porous plate-covered cavity could lead to a beneficial application as a turbulence decreasing flow control device, but further research will have to validate this. The results showed that flow separation is increased for all plates tested, especially for higher hole sizes and lower porosities. Finally, interaction length was shown to increase due to the presence of the porous plate in all cases measured, although this result is likely highly specific to the design tested in this investigation, as is discussed in the Conclusions chapter. Keeping this in mind, interaction length seemed to increase with decreasing hole size and with increasing porosity. In order to be able to prove the abovementioned correlations with more certainty, performing a future investigation with a larger parameter range is recommended.","Supersonic; Shock wave boundary layer interaction; shock wave; Aerodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

MEMS nanoreactors allow scientists to view these reactions in-situ. This opens up doors to finally understanding the underlying mechanisms of the nanocatalyst's effectiveness, which may eventually improve our every day lives.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses on the viewing port of the device -- the electron-transparent window (ETW) -- and how they can be improved for future generations. From scattering theory, it was determined that the best way to improve the imaging quality of current ETWs was to develop thinner ones. Two questions were then asked: can a thinner ETW be integrated into a nanoreactor process? If so, how will it affect the mechanical strength of the ETW?<br/><br/>Aluminum oxide (alumina) was chosen specifically because of its deposition method, atomic layer deposition (ALD). The characteristics and material properties of ALD alumina were assessed and it was determined that they are suitable for ETW applications.<br/><br/>Using ALD alumina presented a few challenges in its integration into nanoreactors, especially the use of vapor hydrogen fluoride. ALD alumina ETWs were able to be successfully integrated into a nanoreactor down to 5 nm thick. The 5 nm alumina ETWs are able to withstand a pressure difference at least 0.75 bar, however they were not able to survive inside a TEM as they disintegrated immediately under the electron beam.<br/><br/>Alumina ETWs that are 10 nm were able to be imaged in a TEM. These windows were tested in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) to showcase the improved electron-transparency. <br/> <br/> The ultra-thin ALD alumina ETWs can improve the imaging quality of nanoreactors, due to their lower thickness compare to current nanoreactors. The successful release of 5 nm membranes may also be useful for other applications, such as sensors. <br/><br","ultra-thin memrbanes; aluminum oxide, alumina; atomic layer deposition; nano-reactors; nano-catalists; In-situ transmission electron microscopy; electron-transparent windows","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-23","","","","","",""

Pile driving subjects the soil to such type of dynamic loading. Accumulation of excess pore water pressure continuous until contact between the sand particles is lost, a process known as soil liquefaction.<br/>This research investigates two soil configurations which are vulnerable to pore pressure accumulation and subsequent liquefaction induced by pile driving: slopes and confined aquifers. Slopes are vulnerable because of their geometry. Limited accumulation of excess pore pressures might be sufficient to induce sliding failure. Confined aquifers are vulnerable because of the lack of drainage boundaries. This can result in significant excess pore pressure accumulation in the aquifer.<br/>Pile driving induced liquefaction instability is modelled by considering the pile-soil-plug interaction, the emission, propagation and attenuation of waves into the soil domain and the resulting generation of excess pore pressures. Two models are developed for this purpose.<br/>The first is an cylindrically symmetric damped elastic pile-soil-plug model. This model calculates the vertical and radial displacements in the soil domain as a function of space and time. Shear stresses, which are the driving parameter for the second model, are then calculated as a function of the spatial derivatives of the two displacement components.<br/>The second (liquefaction) model is a combination of the governing differential equation for cylindrically symmetric soil consolidation and an empirical model describing generation of excess pore pressures as a function of shear stress amplitudes. The output of this model is the steady state relative overpressure distribution. The relative overpressure distribution can then be used as input into slope stability analysis software in order to investigate whether a slope failure will occur given the reduced soil strength.<br/>The biggest uncertainty in the second model is the coupling with the first model. This coupling is achieved by adjusting the elastic shear stresses (which are unrealistic and can therefore not be directly used as input for the liquefaction model) calculated in the first model. Three variables are defined for this purpose. Analysis of the sensitivity of these variables show that the variable beta, which is the ratio between yield shear stress and initial effective stress of a liquefied interface, is the most sensitive and therefore most uncertain variable in the model. Experimental validation of beta is recommended to the increase accuracy of the liquefaction model.","Pile Driving; liquefaction; Finite Difference Method (FDM)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-23","","","","","",""

However, a good understanding is necessary for effective management of coastal areas (Scholar et al., 1998). A small artificial pocket beach has relatively large shadow zones, therefore, diffraction might be an important process. Designs of pocket beaches are now based on equilibrium beaches and morphological changes and sediment losses during storm conditions. The numerical model XBeach is used to predict the beach development and losses. However, so far diffraction has not been included in these simulations. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to gain better insight on the effect of including short wave diffraction in the simulations on the morphological development in pocket beaches. Various modes of XBeach give the opportunity to variate including short wave diffraction or not. A simplified pocket beach and a case study beach has been used to research the influence of short wave diffraction on the morphological development within a storm and the underlying hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes. The simplified beach used, has a length of 500 metres and perpendicular groynes. The shadow zone covered about 30% of the embayment area. The case study beach is a stable designed, real, curved pocket beach in Constanta, Romania, with a similar surface area as the simplified beach but a total shadow area of 40%. In both cases the effect of short wave diffraction appeared to be a wider circulation cell than without diffraction and the outflow velocities along the groyne are lower with diffraction. Sediment transport patterns are similar to the circulation patterns, however, without diffraction an abrupt decrease of sediment transport can be found at the boundary of the shadow zone. Erosion and sedimentation patterns are dispersed gradually over the embayment in case diffraction is included in the simulations. In case diffraction is neglected the transitions of erosion and sedimentation are very abrupt. The exact results of the morphological development in the case study look more reliable than the simplified pocket beach results. Both cases, with and without diffraction, show erosion, however, with diffraction the total loss of sediment is 10% less relative to without diffraction. With diffraction, the exposed shoreline shows less erosion (10%), the shadow shoreline shows more erosion (90%), the shadow embayment shows less sedimentation (30%) and the exposed embayment shows more sedimentation (350%). Without diffraction abrupt vertical changes of about one metre exist at the boundary of shadow to exposed zones. The results with diffraction look promising however, a real validation of the results was not possible with the available data. In conclusion, diffraction appears to be an important phenomenon in relatively small pocket beaches. The sedimentation and erosion pattern is much more gradually dispersed over the area. The main alongshore velocities and sediment transport direction in the exposed zone and the gradual development of sediment transport into the shadow zones cause these gradual transitions. The abrupt transitions in the sediment transport patterns without diffraction result in very abrupt changes in the bed level alterations.","Artificial Pocket Beach; Embayed Beach; Diffraction; Morphodynamics; XBeach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-04-23","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The Global Risks 2015 report, published by the World Economic Forum, included this rather strong warning: “90 percent of companies worldwide recognize that they are insufficiently prepared to protect themselves against cyber-attacks”. Even worse, the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that cyber attacks and cybercrime already cost the global economy over US$400 billion per year! Attacks are likely to increase in size and to diversify in nature, driven by the expanding number of services available online and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals who are engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with security experts. The impact of attacks can even be catastrophic when it comes to critical infrastructures such as power grids and nuclear plants. Hence, there is an urgent need for robust solutions.<br/><br/>Developing appropriate solutions requires a deep understanding of potential and/or existing attacks; these can have either a hardware or a software nature. As the state-of-the-art provides some good solutions for software attacks, hackers seem to move recently more to the exploration of hardware as a powerful mean of attacks. Examples of such attacks are fault injection, side channel analysis, and hardware Trojans. Among these, side channel attacks are recognized as powerful attacks as they do not require any insertion to the system (i.e., they are purely based on observations), making them undetectable. Side channel attacks come in many flavors; one of the most popular is the template-based power attack. In this case, the adversary uses an identical copy of the targeted device and performs a physical characterization to extract a profile of the device which is used later during the attack. As this step is very complex, hackers are trying to use deep learning for the physical characterization. Providing a solution against such attacks needs a deep and full understanding of such attack. This thesis explores the usage of deep learning as a way to advance the accuracy of the side channel attack. Two scenarios are developed and experimented with: one based on supervised learning and one on unsupervised learning. In the supervised scenario, the attacks are enhanced using data pre-processing, which improves the classification accuracy of the associated physical characterization method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the unsupervised scenario, the attacks are trying to skip part of the physical characterization (called profiling) and apply clustering using Stacked Autoencoder neural network in order to retrieve potential secret information. The two scenarios are implemented and validated against the two of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms known as Advance encryption standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The results show the usage of data pre-processing techniques increases the accuracy of attacks by 30% and 15% on AES software and hardware implementations, respectively. The results of the clustering model show that it is feasible to advance the power attacks by skipping the characterization/profiling phase. The results show a 60% prediction accuracy for both aligned and misaligned power traces of the ECC implementations.","Hardware; Security; Deep Learning; Side Channel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-22","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The goal of this project was to gain knowledge about current shin protection in use during field hockey and apply this together with design and production techniques used at CrossGuard. The result is a superior ergonomic redesign of the current shin guards including a new part: the knee pad.The report has six phases; the introduction is a dive into the assignment and its context; the analysis is a closer look at the sport, its players and the market; the design brief in which all the data is interpreted and translated into usable criteria for the design; the synthesis is a combination of the ideation and conceptualisation phase in which the conclusions are applied in a design; the embodiment explores the chosen concept and details all aspects of the concept; and finally the reflection looks back at the process, progress and goals set in the beginning. During the introduction, the focus was on exploring the scope of the project. Finding a good place to begin and exploring the context of the assignment. At the end, specific project and personal goals were set and a planning was formulated to guide the process towards success.The analysis phase consisted of research into all aspects of the project. The goal was to be able to answer most of the research questions at the end of it. First the leg physicality was researched, finding weak spots and studying the geometry using 3d scanning. Secondly the target group was set and researched, using questionnaires and interviews. This concluded in a clear vision of what the consumer wants. The interaction with the current products and the current products themselves were benchmarked based on predefined aspects and tested for their efficiency in those aspects. Lastly the current sizing system was researched and a new sizing system was advised based on gained insights of the physiology and 3d scans.To conclude the analysis phase and to provide a guideline for the project the design brief was formulated using a vision: The shin guard should feel like a indestructible second skin. Protecting the sensitive areas, while not obstructing any movement nor causing any discomfort. And a challenge: To design a shin guard that provides the highest possible protection for the lower leg with modular options for specific situations, without compromising comfort nor maneuverability. In the design brief the criteria to validate the product are also set out, together with trends in this specific scope that can inform design decisions.The synthesis phase is the combination of the ideation and conceptualisation phase in which the found data will be applied towards a shin guard redesign. Rapid prototyping techniques to iterate between working on paper and having a physical prototype to try out were valuable to the success of this project. It allowed the combining of separately used solutions from different applications towards a single concept in the end. The final concept was chosen from a set of three, with a different focus point which their designs build on.The final phase in the design was the embodiment of the chosen concept into a product, the Ergo Pro shin &amp; knee guard, looking at production techniques, material solutions and building a functioning prototype were central to this chapter. To validate the success of the Ergo Pro, it was benchmarked against existing solutions, tested with a regular player and an interview with an expert user was performed. The conclusions and improvement points were written down. A small roadmap for the company on how to introduce this product into the current market marks the end of this project.The reflection looks back at the process and the success of the final product, seeing if there are aspects that need more attention or if mistakes were made. Any other notes about the project will be made here as well.In the end the prototype testing validated the concept and the Ergo Pro shin &amp; knee guard is a feasible product, which meets the goals and criteria set in the earlier chapters.","Hockey; Ergonomics; Protection; Design; Lower leg","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Graduation project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Work-life balance is becoming increasingly important in today’s job market. Young professionals actively search for jobs that promote their well-being. The concept of well- being encompasses not just physical health. Psychological health, such as social connectedness and engagement, is just as important. Katz (1964) stated in his research that specifically extra-role actions intended to benefit people other than oneself, extra-role prosocial behaviors, are essential for successfully functioning organizations and well-being among employees. This project focuses on how office environments can foster these extra-role prosocial behaviors. Three themes were studied to answer this question.<br/><br/>Firstly, a literature study, two brain writing sessions and a focus group on prosocial behavior at work were executed to define various ways of- and incentives for these behaviors. These studies have shown that, in order for extra-role prosocial behaviors to occur more frequently, the most substantiated strategy is to invest in the improvement of collegial relationships across disciplines. <br/><br/>This leads to the second theme, interdisciplinary bonding at work. Interdisciplinary bonding encounters challenges due to differences in interests and practices. These differences are rooted within the organization’s culture. A literature- and generative study is performed, consisting of a questionnaire, interviews and observations, on cultural differences in organizations. These studies have shown that a common ritual can function as a way to enhance interdisciplinary bonding. A creative co-design session with an interdisciplinary group of participants resulted in the definition of four design strategies to strengthen interdisciplinary bonding in office environments. <br/><br/>The aim of fostering prosocial behaviors in office environments requires a sustainable change in routines and behaviors from the people in that environment. Research on the third theme, behavior change at work, has shown that for certain target behavior to happen, a person must have sufficient motivation, sufficient ability, and an effective trigger. Furthermore, the involvement of employees, for instance by allowing environment personalization, can have a positive effect on positive attitudes towards change. In addition, one can not neglect people’s different characters and their naturally different responses towards change. Three behavioral personas were defined in order to take these differences into account. Thereafter, the four defined design strategies are analyzed based on the above mentioned essentials for a sustainable change in behavior. As a result, the most viable design strategy is finding common ground in personal interests through environment personalization. The desired interaction consists of a ‘sharing’ and a ‘caring’ part. The design should facilitate employees to share personal interests, and for other employees to care for these interests. Three intervention iterations in context were performed based on the desired interaction. These interventions have shown that the development of genuine interest in one another is most important for sustainable change towards prosocial behavior. This led to the design goal: motivating knowledge workers to develop genuine interest in interdisciplinary colleagues. A benchmark analysis of existing interactions was performed to define the unique perspective of this desired interaction. <br/><br/>The conclusion from this benchmark analysis resulted in a definition of a product-service-system for Ahrend: the Ahrend Portrait. The Ahrend Portrait allows employees to visually portray their interest on the walls of their organization to personalize their work environment. Furthermore, it allows employees to develop interest in the portrayed interests on the wall by interacting with them. The concept combines the benefits of digital interactions (bridging distance) with benefits of the physical interactions (explicit and passive). Different use case scenarios of the concept describe the opportunities for interdisciplinary bonding and prosocial initiatives. In order to find backing for the effect of this concept, two validation tests were performed at two different offices. The results of these validation tests suggest that the concept is capable of fostering interdisciplinary bonding and attentive, prosocial, behaviors. Furthermore, the concept inherits the potential to lower communication thresholds and increase mutual understanding and tolerance in organizations. <br/><br/>From here, multiple validation tests are required, for a longer period of time, to prove its positive effect on prosocial behaviors in offices. Furthermore, further research has to show how misuse of the concept can be prevented, whether the incentive to interact with the concept is self sustaining and what the most effective way is to introduce the concept in offices.","Prosocial behavior; office environments; positive design; well-being; interdisciplinary bonding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

According to Dukic &amp; Oluic (2005), 50% of the total order picking time is spent on unproductive traveling. The operations that need to be performed in warehouses are highly dependent on the customer demand. The customer demand shows seasonal patterns spread over the year caused by so-called seasonal influences. The objective of this research was to investigate and identify the opportunities and possibilities regarding the order picking process to react to the seasonal impact that influences the productivity of order picking. Order picking can be described as a warehouse process of retrieving products from storage in response to specific customer request and bringing them to an area dedicated for collecting the assembled customer orders. Order picking can be performed in a variety of Order Picking Systems (OPS). This study focusses on the lower automatization level of pick-and-sort batch picking using a picker-to-parts system. An insight of demand profiles in certain time series and order characteristics have been obtained by using a decomposition model with multiplicative seasonal-adjustment. Patterns in number of orders, items/order, weight/item and volume/item were determined for setting up design alternatives. The alternatives are based on some primary interdependent policies proposed in the study of Wascher (2004): storage policy, routing policy, zoning policy, and order consolidation policy. The three design alternatives in this study are: class-based randomized storage, volume-based randomized storage, and zone decomposition. These alternatives are tested in a model with discrete event simulation for both regular and peak periods, compared to a base alternative. The KPIs are cycle picking time and the variable order picking (labour) costs and both need to be minimized. All three design alternatives seem to be promising for future order picking operations compared to the base alternative. The results of this study show that major savings can be reached changing the order picking strategy in general. For companies, focusing on the reduction of travel distance of the operators can lead to more efficient processes in the fulfilment centre and in the end cause a decrease in labour costs. However, it is recommended for the company of the case study, to implement the class-based randomized storing policy. On yearly basis, the order picking costs decrease with 12%. Looking at cycle time and travel distances, even higher savings can be obtained in future operation by deploying the zone decomposition dynamically during peak periods. This means that during peak periods, zones are dynamically divided into two sub-zones causing a decrease in travel distance between picks, leading to lower cycle picking times.","order picking performance; e-fulfilment centre; Seasonality; time series analysis; case study; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon fiber is conductive and heats up when placed inside an<br/>alternating magnetic field. A generator, coil, and pressure frame are needed to perform induction<br/>welding. The support plates needed to pressurize the carbon fiber parts need to be non-conductive,<br/>non-magnetic, temperature resistant, stiff at high temperatures, and thermally insulating.<br/>The material used is five harness satin weave carbon fiber PPS supplied in pre-consolidated plates<br/>and unconsolidated semi-preg. Three different joint geometries are used in this investigation: a conventional<br/>scarf, a continuous scarf, and a stepped lap joint. The stepped lap joint and the conventional<br/>scarf are milled using a CNC machine. The continuous scarf is produced in a press using specialized<br/>tooling and a press program prescribed by TenCate.<br/>Of each type two specimens are produced: an induction welded specimen and a press joined specimen.<br/>The specimens are tested in tension to determine the tensile strength and stiffness. This gives<br/>the performance of the induction welded joints with respect to the press joined specimens. Additionally,<br/>both of the welded specimens are compared to the pristine specimens.<br/>By measuring the temperature along the weld-line of multiple test specimens, an induction welding<br/>program is obtained for each joint type. Achieving a consistent temperature along the weld-line is<br/>challenging due to the thermal conductivity of carbon fibers and other effects inside the laminate. Similar<br/>to the continuous scarfed specimens, the press joined specimens are created using specialized tooling.<br/>Before testing the specimens in tension, they are scanned using a C-scan. The press bonded<br/>specimens show no flaws, whereas the induction welded specimens do not return the signal to the<br/>transducer. Micrography of the specimens shows similar results as the C-scan. The press joined<br/>specimens show little to no flaws and the induction welded specimens show a significant amount of<br/>voids and small unjoined sections near the tips for the continuous scarf and stepped lap specimen.<br/>The tensile tests show that all induction welded joints perform less than the press joined specimens<br/>with a percentage of about 73-78%. The conventional scarf and the continuous scarf result in a similar<br/>failure strength recovery of about 44% of the pristine failure strength for the press joined specimens.<br/>Both the conventional scarf and the continuous scarf show similar behavior in welding and the tensile<br/>testing, but the continuous scarf is more difficult to produce. Therefore the conventional scarf joint is<br/>preferred over the continuous scarf joint. The stepped lap joint has the best performance, recovering<br/>about 59% of the pristine stiffness. The stiffness of all tested specimens is between 92%-99% of the<br/>pristine stiffness.<br/>Inspection using digital image correlation and finite element modeling indicates the failure initiates<br/>inside the PPS matrix in between the parts at the location of the first or last step. Finite element modeling<br/>also suggests that a smaller angle for the scarf joint or a longer overlap for the stepped lap joint would<br/>increase failure strength.","Induction; Welding; CF; PPS; KVE; Scarf; Stepped lap; Repair","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

To make adequately use of noise mitigation measures during offshore wind projects and to protect marine life the prediction of sound levels in water is important. The aim of this thesis is to assess if the UAS is suitable to give insight in the physics contributing to sound propagation and if the UAS is suitable to quantify sound levels in water for the application in future wind park projects. This is done by comparing the predicted sound levels with the UAS with the measured sound levels obtained during the construction of the Gemini wind park. The results obtained with the UAS identify the parameters related to the seabed properties as the most important for governing the attenuation of the noise levels as function of distance and frequency. In the UAS the seabed is modelled as a fluid. Especially frequencies &lt; 800 Hz are sensitive to the choice of geo-acoustic parameters. These frequencies show a trend of underestimation of the sound levels compared to the acoustic data. An increase of the predicted sound levels is observed for increasing the coarseness of the sediment of the upper seabed layer and decreasing this layer thickness. The UAS parameters can be tuned to obtain sound levels that agree with the measured sound levels in the Gemini area. However, these parameter values do not represent the properties of a realistic seabed. Additionally, no evident choice of values exist to arrive at sound levels that agree with the acoustic data. It is concluded that the choice of values compensates for the exclusion of the shear effect in the fluid approximation of the seabed in the UAS. The exclusion of the shear effect in the representation of the seabed in the UAS is regarded as essential. Tsouvalas (2015) shows that the propagation of sound energy at low frequencies is governed by the shear of the soil. These lower frequencies propagate in the deeper parts of the seabed where shear effects play a role. Also, sound energy in the form of Scholte waves propagates at the water-seabed interface, thereby contributing to the sound levels in water. The reason the sound levels propagating at low frequencies is sought in two aspects. In a fluid seabed the geo-acoustic parameters are adjusted and account for the damping associated with shear, while the propagation of sound energy at these wave forms is not modelled. Another possible explanation is the trapping of the low frequency pressure waves in the seabed. Although the UAS is able to predict sound levels in the Gemini area that agree well with the measured sound levels, this is not due to the correct implementation of the physic regarding the seabed. As a consequence, the model is tweaked to arrive at the measured. The UAS is therefore not considered suitable for application in future wind park projects.","Underwater sound propagation; Piling noise; Underwater Acoustic Simulator; offshore wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However governmental organizations have been constantly struggling and are slow to open their administrative data to the public due to barriers, such as: opening up of data is thought up much later in the process and not when the data is being created; they have limited knowledge or support to open data; and scarce awareness among employees about the potential of open data. Organizations also miss out on realizing potential benefits of opening up data such as: the increased quality and efficiency of the public services; new business models are created which benefits the economy; transparency and accountability is improved in public services; and there will be an increase in collaboration, participation and social innovation. <br/>In this research we focus on archival institutions who want to open up their administrative data to the public, when traversing through the extensive literature of open data, we found that there was barely any literature providing guiding principles for archival institutions on how to open up their administrative data to the public. These principles are important as they can be seen as a support system to archival institutions who are just starting to open their administrative data to the public. Secondly, the existing literature does not focus on the barriers at archival institutions for opening up administrative data to the public. <br/>Action design research (ADR) is used as the overarching research approach, where four main stages can be differentiated as: 1) problem formulation stage; 2) building, intervention and evaluation stage; 3) reflection and learning stage; and 4) formulation of learning stage. <br/>The objective of this study is to design principles for opening up administrative data by an archival institution to the public. Design principles are defined as directive and normative guidelines envisioned to guide all the stakeholders to design and evaluate frameworks. We assumed that this would guide the employees of archival institutions in opening up their administrative data to the public.<br/>In the problem formulation stage of this study, we answered the first research question, namely: “What are the barriers curtailing governmental organizations from opening their administrative data to the public?” A comprehensive list of barriers was derived from a literature review. In the building, intervention and evaluation stage, we answered the second research question - “To which extent do these barriers block opening of data for archival institutions?” using the case study approach, this comprehensive list is narrowed down based on importance and relevance for single organization that <br/>is the Dutch National Archives. The limelight is on those barriers which are related to opening of data. Four different categories of barriers were recognized through literature such as institutional, technical, legislative, and task complexity, the barriers are: At the National Archives there is a lack of appropriate support for data creation which can be readily opened; Creation of open data requires trust and participation from both the data publisher and the users; At National Archives it is uncertain how data will be reused in the future outside the organization; In National Archives there is emphasis on barriers and opportunities are neglected; There is limited awareness among employees of the needs of open data users; No tool support for opening up data at the National Archives; There is an emphasis on privacy violations caused by opening data at the National Archives; There is an emphasis on security risks of opening data at the National Archives; It is difficult for employees in the National Archives to search for data; and there is no helpdesk support for open data challenges internal to the National Archives.<br/>The third research question “What design principles can be developed for opening up archival administrative data?” in building, intervention and evaluation stage is answered and the design principles are formulated for opening up administrative data to the public by means of output from literature review and case study analysis. The barriers are used as basis to formulate the design principles, additionally requirements like usability, comprehensibility, flexibility and effectiveness were embedded into the principles. Ten design principles were formulated.<br/>After the formulation of the principles for opening up administrative data, the next step was to evaluate them. In the fourth and final question - “To which extent do the developed design principles make opening of archival administrative data easier?” was answered. We chose the combination of ex-ante and naturalistic type of evaluation where we used the questionnaire and observation approach to evaluate the principles. The evaluation was done at the National Archives and the results show that the proposed design principles indeed make it easier for opening up administrative data to the public. Furthermore, from the feedback given in the evaluation, the ten design principles were modified and shortened to 7 final design principles, namely: Create and maintain a helpdesk for open data related issues, such as creation and opening of data; Provide knowledge to employees through hands-on and classroom trainings on open data; Check for privacy violations – Automation of tools to check for privacy violations; Check for security risks before publishing; Collect metadata simultaneously with the data when the data is created; Evaluate the existing tool for opening up data and then modify/create new tool; and Host hackathons/events to foster co-creation. <br/>This study contributes to literature by enumerating an exhaustive list of barriers concerning the opening of data by archival institutions, by formulating and evaluating design principles for opening administrative data, and by contributing to ADR as a design science approach. Additionally, as practical contributions, the thesis is instrumental in firstly listing the barriers for open data at the National Archives, secondly from the aforementioned barriers, the design principles will recommend the steps for National Archives to take for opening their administrative data. Thirdly, the proposed design principles can be used by archival institutions, confirmed by the evaluation results. Lastly, the implementation of the proposed design principles is assumed to lead to opening up more administrative data by archival institutions and this may lead to the envision benefits of increasing transparency, and accountability.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this thesis is to arrive at optimal airfoil geometries to enhance the performance of VAWTs and analyse the performance of these optimal airfoils under steady and unsteady operation conditions of the rotor. The airfoil design is aimed at rotors operating in the Reynolds number range of 10ዀ. The inverse airfoil design approach is used to arrive at the airfoil geometries. The design process involves formulating a multiobjective optimisation problem with the aerodynamic and structural performance of the airfoil as objectives.<br/>After a comprehensive literature study, the objective derived by Ferreira and Geurts [25] was chosen for its suitability to the current work. The aerodynamic performance of the airfoil is gauged by the ratio of lift slope and drag coefficient. The structural objective is limited to the flapwise bending stiffness. To account for the weather impact, the aerodynamic objective also includes the effect of surface roughness. <br/>An effective optimisation framework is built with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm(NSGA-II) to arrive at the Pareto front with best suitable airfoils for VAWTs. This framework is coupled with XFOIL which evaluates the geometries and another python based framework, Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python(DEAP) which helps in setting up the genetic algorithm. Once the convergence is reached, few airfoils from the final Pareto front are chosen for further analysis.<br/>Based on the literature study, the Actuator Cylinder Model(ACM) was chosen to simulate the performance of the airfoils in a VAWT rotor. The performance of the selected airfoils were analysed under steady flow conditions with the ACM. To account for the effects of unsteady flow over the airfoil, a Beddoes-Leishman type dynamic stall model formulated by the Risø national laboratories was integrated into the AC Model loop along with a correction to the effective angle of attack. The inviscid part of this model was validated with another AC Model<br/>code from Li [42] and the inviscid panel method 푈2퐷푖푉퐴 [65].<br/>The performance of the optimised airfoils is an improvement over the performance of the NACA airfoils of similar thicknesses which proves that the optimisation process has been successful. The performance of the airfoils in steady flow indicates that the power performance of the airfoil suffers more from the surface roughness as the thickness of the airfoil increases. The thicker airfoils perform better at high solidity applications at low tip speed ratios. The range of operational tip speed ratios decreases as the airfoils become thicker.<br/>The performance of these airfoils under the effects of unsteady flow under the inviscid flow assumption provides an overview of the differences in the performance of the airfoils under unsteady flow conditions. The range of tip speed ratios where the airfoils show their best performance moves towards higher values indicating that under unsteady flow effects, the rotor needs to operate at a higher rotational velocity to achieve its best performance. However, to obtain a better insight on the performances of the airfoil under unsteady flow effects, further studies with the complete validated Risø model have to be carried out.","Airfoil optimisation; vertical axis wind turbine; unsteady flow effects; Actuator cylinder model; performance simulation of VAWTs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.9900, 4.3754"

This tool has increased the knowledge about muscle-tendon dynamics and sometimes revealed surprising muscle stretch behaviour. System identification experiments use robots to disturb the ankle and measure its torque and angle. Muscle movement is derived from the measured joint angle and their assumed relationship. This study uses plane-wave ultrasound imaging to investigate the relation between ankle angle and muscle length during system identification experiments. The first goal is to determine the feasibility of using ultrasound measurements for system identification.  The second goal is to investigate the validity of the assumption that muscle stretch is proportional to ankle angle and the effect of this assumption on the prediction of reflex size. Transient and continuous disturbances were applied to the ankle, while images of the soleus and gastrocnemius were recorded with ultrasound and processed with an image tracking algorithm. For small (1° SD) continuous perturbations ankle angle and muscle length can be assumed proportional during a relax task. However, a conclusion cannot be drawn for the position task due to the low coherence of the muscle length measurements. For transient perturbations with a high velocity (&gt;90°/s) the muscle length showed oscillations that were not present in the ankle angle, demonstrating a non-proportional relationship. The gastrocnemius velocity predicted the size of the short latency reflex better than the perturbation velocity of the ankle robot.

(mentor); Nourian, Pirouz (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The current Dutch standard for daylight in buildings does not assure good daylight quality.<br/>Designers therefore often do not know when a building has good daylight quality and how they can design a visually comfortable and healthy building.<br/><br/>The new European standard for daylight in buildings is more elaborative and recommends a higher daylight quality. When this standard is introduced, the assessment method must be adopted in the Dutch building regulations. The assessment method however differs a lot from the current Dutch assessment method, which makes it difficult to compare the standards and determine the exact differences.<br/><br/>To make it easier to design buildings with good daylight quality, the goal of this research was to establish a set of recommendations. For these recommendations, it was necessary to compare the Dutch and European standards. Three aspects of the standards were considered in this research: the requirements, the assessment methods and the effects on daylight quality.<br/><br/>Literature review on the standards gave insight in the requirements and assessment methods. The most obvious difference was that the European standard is more elaborative and assess, besides daylight, also sunlight, glare and view. Another big difference is that the Dutch standard is normative and the European standard descriptive. Both standards do not consider the orientation of a building and opposite obstructions. <br/><br/>After a literature study, two case studies were performed. The assessment of daylight in a basement showed that a space that meets the Dutch standard, can have a really bad daylight quality. It also led to the orientation factor which can be used to convert simulated daylight factors. This can be useful to gain insight in the amount of daylight in a space in common situations when the sky is not completely clouded and sunlight influences the daylight quality a lot.<br/><br/>The second case had quite good daylight quality, but still did not meet the European standard. There is not enough daylight, at the south east side there is too much glare, and at the north west side there is not enough exposure to sunlight.<br/><br/>The last part of the research was a systematic study. Variants were simulated according to the Dutch and European standard. Variants with a minimum daylight area from the Dutch standard had a bad daylight quality and showed that the window shape influences the access of daylight. In almost all other variants with bigger windows, higher reflection factors, or less obstructions, it<br/>was not possible to meet the European standard on both side of the building. This means that in a dense area the European standard is almost unachievable. Because of the many influencing factors, there is no clear relation between the equivalent daylight area and the daylight factor.<br/><br/>For designers it is recommended that they consider the orientation, surroundings and reflection factors, even though it is not required according to the standards. This gives a more realistic insight in the daylight quality. Rooms should comply with a minimum daylight factor of 0.8% in 50% of the area and an average daylight factor of 1.5% also in 50% of the area. Besides the amount of daylight, sunlight, glare and view also influence the daylight quality and should be taken into account during the design process.<br/><br/>Of course, there might be more factors that should be considered by designers. Those are not mentioned in this research, but can be investigated in future research.","Daylight; Dutch Standard; European Standard; Daylight factor; Office; Equivalent daylight area; Visual comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

This eternal character can be found through the many traces that Rome contains of former states within its physical environment. When researching these traces, an interesting conclusion can be drawn; almost all physical elements have either fallen into decay or have continuously moved with the city to meet the needs of new social structures. But nowadays with the declaration of the city centre of Rome as one large monument, this is no longer possible. While at the same time the current social structure is crumbling. This is particularly visible with all of the Roman churches. Christianity is losing relevance fast and these church become nothing but museumpieces in the city that are no longer contributing to the current social structure of Rome. That is why this thesis proposes a radical move; to provide space in the city center for new architectural experiments by moving 10 of the 400 churches to a new location outside the city center. With the collection of 10 churches also a grand experiment will be conducted, creating a gigantic second hand religious market, using the historical logistical character of the new location. Continuing Rome is about giving the city the impulse to restart the layering that makes Rome great and to give Rome back to its own citizens for a new eternity.","Rome; Architecture; Experiment; Monument; Layering; Nolli; Churches; Second Hand; Vacancy; Public Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","",""

Furthermore, experiments are proposed based on three modes of operation: static force tracking, sinusoidal force tracking and disturbance rejection. The input signals for these experiments are based on human walking and support strategies.

Urban areas can become productive and not only consumptive if a well-planned distributed energy system is implemented. Switching to renewables, however, means rethinking today’s urban landscape entirely. Decisions made for the future need to be built on a robust understanding of urban energy systems. There is a need to bring creative perspectives to include local potentials into urban planning and study the energetic gaps and opportunities that can foster a circular metabolism.<br/>This thesis presents a modular energy generation system with an innovative noise-barrier integration feature. This novel concept, formally known as the Energy Wall, is designed to capture the local wind and solar energy resources of urban areas and transform them for urban use while exploiting the benefits of reusing existing urban stock. This paper embarks on a comprehensive assessment of the potential of this system taking a full approach from experimental data to energy and cost modeling. A study area located in Delft, the Netherlands, has provided a solid basis for this research. The base-case Energy Wall module in this area generates per year almost enough energy to supply the annual demand of a residential household. To account for the great diversity of urban environments, the energy supplied by the system is investigated in different scenarios with varying local characteristics. A number of cost reduction opportunities have been identified increasing the appeal of noise-barrier integration. Despite this, the small-wind system faces economic burdens hindering its profitability. Field measurements from sonic anemometers are employed to investigate the wind concentrator effect of a noise-barrier showing an acceleration effect up to 30% depending on flow perpendicularity. The robustness of current vertical wind profile scaling techniques is tested to gauge its reliability within the urban boundary layer. Results have underscored important gaps in the theory of near-surface wind speed prediction methods. The higher complexity and uncertainty of urban wind energy generation has given this research a special focus on understanding why this technology has lagged behind over the recent years and, most importantly, what steps should be taken to change this situation.","Sustainability; Urban integration; Renewable energy; Urban wind; circular cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

For every pictorial unit, such a skin, a very specific palette was created. In this case the palette would then only be used to paint the skin and nothing else. The result is that for each pictorial unit a separate palette is used. This assumption can be verified by characterizing the all the paint mixtures present in a painting. Paint derives it colour from the pigments present within them. Many pigments used in the 17<sup>th</sup> century contain characteristic heavy elements. The usage macro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning is gaining popularity as a non-destructive method for determining elements present in a paintings. By the creation of elemental maps the pigments can be identified and localized in a painting. These maps already allow for visualizing many interesting features such as retouches, inpaintings and even hidden layers behind a painting. However the usage of the XRF data have never been used for identifying and visualizing the palettes used while painting.<br/>In this work it is attempted to identify and visualize the palettes used in the <i>Man with the red baret</i> by Rembrandt van Rijn, by an in-depth analysis of raw XRF data. The raw data was model fitted using a simulated annealing algorithm to retrieve spectral line intensities in each point of the painting. The fitted spectral intensities was then visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). With help of the t-SNE visualisation the painting is divided into 24 sections. The suggestion is that these 24 sections each contain a different and unique paint mixture. This suggestion is further investigated by the use of the two-sample χ²-test between the sections’ spectral composition. The combination of model fitting alongside with t-SNE on a XRF spectra can indeed visualize different paint mixtures and give strong suggestion of the different palettes used in <i>Man with the red baret</i>.","XRF; Rembrandt; t-SNE; Man with the red baret; Palette; Paintings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for energy-trade between prosumers and consumers, a cen- tralized and undesirable middle-man is still necessary. We developed a method to decentralize essential aspects of energy distribution between households. Macro-grids are divided into vari- ous neighborhood sized community-grids; a micro-grid. A micro-grid as a community yields a degree of self-sustainability. Nevertheless, micro-grids currently still possess centralized elements. The presence of central controllers, trading-agents or banks, maintains this undesirable situation. Decentralization of a power-grid increases end-user autonomy, independency and fairness in the system.<br/>We propose to establish a truly transactive micro-grid: decentralized in its energy distribution, control and money-flow by deploying EnergyBazaar, a distributed trading algorithm. Concepts of game theory are used in the design to enable EnergyBazaar to solve the economic dispatch problem: agents want to individually optimize their social welfare, while the collective task is to stabilize the grid. Micro-grids make use of a decoupled hierarchical structure: primary control is responsible for fast dynamics of voltage and frequency, secondary control coordinates the economics within the micro-grid. In its core, EnergyBazaar coordinates inverter-based droop parameters within the Energy Storage System (ESS) of each agent, managing their charging/discharging behaviour. A trade-off is identified between economical gain and the necessity of surviving energy scarcity. For this, energy patterns are predicted and acted upon. In contrast to a coordinator dictating a centralized solution, EnergyBazaar creates a free market, where agents individually converge to a global Nash equilibrium. A comparison is made to show performance of both.<br/>By rejecting centralized institutions in the micro-grid, trust challenges are introduced: achieving decentralized money-flows, the necessity of shared information during distributed optimization and the manipulation of the free-market by malicious agents. We introduce an approach of mitigating these issues in a decentralized paradigm by embedding EnergyBazaar in a smart-contract deployed on a blockchain platform.","Decentralised Micro-Grid; Game-Theory; Blockchain; Distributed Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While Mars is well defined as the next frontier for human space flight, little work has been done towards identifying possible settlement sites on its surface. The current site proposals use a bottom-up approach, that is focusing on one settlement site and then investigating if and why this site fulfils all requirements considered relevant to a human outpost. Here, the Expert System: Settlement (ESS) is presented, a tool that follows the inverse, top-down approach in which initially the entire Martian surface is considered. From there, the set of possible settlement sites is reduced stepwise for various criteria, discharging those sites not fulfilling the specified criteria. Examples of these site requirement are the max. MOLA elevation, the solar power available on the surface, and the water concentration in the subsurface. To cover the different criteria included in this work, the ESS was assembled of the three sub-expert systems Expert System: Engineering Constraints (ESE), Expert System: Climate (ESC), and Expert System: Resources (ESR). The ESS was successfully verified using the engineering constraints defined for the landing site selection of the NASA InSight mission, returning, inter alia, the mission's selected landing site. With view on manned missions, settlement selection constraints were derived from literature to provide input to the ESS. The ESS identified possible settlement sites fulfilling the requirements in Xante Terra/Lunae Planum and West of Elysium Planitia. Other qualifying sites were located in the Northernmost part of Noachis Terra, in Vastitas Borealis between 40°N and 50°N latitude and in Arcadia Planitia, Northwest of Olympus Mons. The ESS is built completely generic, allowing to run the expert system for a variety of possible and diverse mission architectures. Moreover, the code architecture allows to simply add further selection constraints and corresponding planetary data sets required for future selection processes. The ESS is capable of investigating both landing ellipses (as has been done for the NASA InSight mission) and circular exploration zones around a nominal site. Next to settlement site selection, the code developed is therefore also suitable for landing site selection. With suitable data available, the code can be adapted to any celestial body. The current application of the tool regarding site analysis is directly dependent on the available data sets' coverage and maximum resolution; where the latter controls the computation time of the ESS.","Mars; Settlement; Human Space Flight; Site Selection; Expert System; Solar System Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Electricity is a basic need in today`s society, being present in almost every aspect of life. The extensive infrastructure that transports electricity to the consumers, is expected to always work. At the same time there is a growing realism that the energy sector needs to modernise and ‘greenify’, in order to become more climate friendly. This is realised in the Netherlands by increasing the electricity produced by rooftop solar panels and wind parks.<br/><br/>Electricity produced by solar and wind depends on weather circumstances. Their production pattern is much more variable and uncertain than conventional fossil power plants. In order to maintain the balance on the electricity grid, an increased amount of balancing power is needed. For the Netherlands this is estimated to reach 15.2 TWh in the year 2050. <br/><br/>New sources of balancing power are also established by becoming more climate friendly. In the Netherlands the electrification of demand, results in gas fired boilers being replaced by heat pumps. Not just the established ground water based variant, but also the air based heat pump. <br/>The heat pumps capability of providing balancing power is based on two aspects. First are the well-insulated houses in which they are installed. This reduces the cooling rate. Secondly is that residents generally do not experience any discomfort when the room temperature slightly deviates from their comfort temperature. And when they are absent, the room temperature may take any value. <br/><br/>Among the houses and residents where a heat pump is installed, differences can be found. Not everyone lives in a detached house, and not everyone is absent during the day. The effect of these differences on the demand response from a pool of heat pumps, is not known. This leads to the main research question:<br/>“To what extent can a distinction in different residents and houses, increase the accuracy of demand response calculations for a Dutch heat pump pool?”<br/><br/>In order to answer the research question, a model based approach is chosen. The ISO 13790 modelling approach is selected, as it includes the following requirements:<br/>1.Includes the comfort temperature of the resident<br/>2.Includes the 4 MW participation requirement of the secondary reserve market<br/>3.Allows the comfort temperature to change on an hourly basis<br/>4.Allows for a distinction between different houses and residents<br/>5.Includes the room temperature<br/>6.Includes the air based heat pump`s dependency on the outside temperature <br/>As a result of the 4 MW participation requirement, heat pumps need to be combined into a pool. An aggregator is tasked with controlling this pool, and offering the demand response to the market. It is the aggregator that must predict the demand response available from each heat pump. Distinguishing between the different houses and residents, should increase the accuracy of predictions. <br/><br/>The distinction between the different houses and residents programmed into the model, depends strongly on the information available about the region. The region chosen in this research is the Netherlands. For this region four different categories of houses have been identified, each with a different cooling rate.<br/>•Detached house<br/>•Semi-detached house<br/>•Terraced house middle<br/>•Terraced house corner<br/><br/>In case of the residents three different types have been identified. Each having a different comfort temperature and a different daily routine. <br/>•The single <br/>•The couple<br/>•The family<br/><br/>Each of the three types of residents could live in any of the four categories of houses. All of the possible combinations have been included in the experiments. In the experiments the demand response available from the two types of heat pump has been calculated, in both the up- and downward direction. The demand response is here defined as the intentional deviation in the electric load, compared to the normal use of the heat pump. <br/><br/>The results of the experiments show that both types of heat pump are capable of keeping the house near to the comfort temperature. Between the two types of heat pump a significant difference was found. The air based variant is capable of providing more demand response, especially during the winter. <br/><br/>A significant difference was also found between the three different types of residents, and almost all of the four different categories of houses. With the exception of the semi-detached house and the terraced house middle, where no significant difference was found in the upward direction. <br/><br/>The conclusion is that by making a distinction between residents, houses and heat pumps the accuracy of calculations will increase. <br/><br/>The differences in the demand response available from each combination, effect the number of heat pumps needed for the 4 MW participation requirement. Depending on the time of day, the size of the pool would range between less than 10.000, and more than 180.000. It can be stated that it is not about finding the size of the pool that allows an aggregator to always participate. But it is about determining when an aggregator is capable of participating, based upon the pool he controls. <br/><br/>With the growing balancing power needed by 2050, heat pumps will be capable of providing part of the needed capacity. However, the balancing power offered fluctuates strongly depending on the time of day and season. Next to that, it will require large numbers of heat pumps in order to participate.<br","Heat pumps; ISO 13790; The Netherlands; Secondary reserve market; Model based approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(B) 100% gas replacement using an analysis of energy potentials (C) Configurations aiming for minor spatial impact on the selected urban blocks taking into account the wishes of inhabitants.These ten configuration were assessed on their quantifiable spatial &amp; energy characteristics using a set of selected/modified spatial &amp; energy indicators. Secondly a perceptual analysis was employed on a pilot group of inhabitants during an information night. During a presentation of the configuration results questionnaires were filled in by inhabitants.The results of the quantifiable and perceptual analysis are compared using the the following criteria: energy potential, spatial impact, inhabitants acceptance, amount of m2 used energy production panels &amp; necessary additional technologies. The configuration (C.4), using PVT + large scale heat pump + pit thermal energy storage, is the optimal solution of the investigated energy solutions.Purely based on the energy characteristics replacing 100% of the gas use, the best option would be (combination of configurations C.3 &amp; C.4) using PVT + large scale heat pump + latent thermal energy storage.If spatial/visual impact in the public space of an energy transition project is not possible or there is an aim for zero spatial/visual impact of stakeholders, then the B.1 or C.2 configuration, using flat-plate collectors + pit thermal energy storage (without covered parking), is the best option.This thesis hopes to contribute to speeding up the process of energy transition projects, replacing the gas produced heat demand with a renewable produced heat demand, for the existing built environments in the Netherlands.","Solar energy production; thermal energy storage; energy transition; heat pump; configurations; energy potentials; selected urban blocks; spatial design; Haarlem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altered cortical responses to external stimulation of different modalities are observed in migraine patients, also between attacks (in the interictal state). However, it is yet unclear if abnormalities are detectable in the functional network at rest, i.e. without external stimulation.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","An acute admission is a disruption from daily life and affects the child patient and his or her family. To reduce this disruption of daily life, the VKC is planning to build a Paediatric Acute Medical Unit (P-AMU) in the coming years. The VKC (Vrouw-Kind Centrum; Woman-Child Center) is the center of excellence in the field of all woman and child healthcare inside of the AMC and VUmc alliance. Their mission puts a strong focus on patients that participate and have control. The key values of the VKC are to be ‘Open’, ‘Sensitive’, and ‘Innovative’. <br/>The P-AMU will provide 24/7 care, and focuses on rapid and effective diagnostics, formulating treatment plans, and starting the execution of said plans within a maximum of 72 hours. The current plans for the P-AMU are made from an organizational or management perspective. The patient perspective is not yet included in this stage of development. Literature research showed many benefits of an AMU from the organizational perspective with the main benefit being; containing chaos in one place makes the other regular nursing departments more plannable and will improve the quality of care. The main goal is for children to go back home as quickly as possible. Medical professionals consider this to be in the child patients best interest.<br/>To include the patient perspective in the plans, design research was conducted to fully understand the patient experience during the paediatric acute admission process. The result identified two main themes; unsure: not knowing when, where, and what to expect; and bored: which occurs during the many moments of waiting. This uncertainty consists of two kinds; the medical uncertainty and the uncertainty about the process, where the medical uncertainty is a stable factor and the uncertainty about the process is a variable. The patient journey clearly showed more fluctuation in patient’s emotions and more innovation opportunities at the ED in comparison to the paediatric nursing department. Therefore, improving the patient experience at the P-AMU already starts at the ED. <br/>The design goal was formulated as followed:<br/>‘‘Design a tool that improves the communication of child patients and parents with the healthcare system about the acute admission process, and that puts the children in control in a playful and understandable way, in order to make the feel less unsure and bored during the acute admission.”<br/>An iterative design process was performed where child patients, medical professionals, and technical and design experts provided feedback from their perspective on the intermediate designs. This eventually led to the development the final concept design ‘Mijn Buddy’. ‘Mijn Buddy’ is a digital application designed for children, aged 8-13 years old, that provides insights in order to reduce the uncertainty about the acute admission process, which will eventually lead to a better patient experience. The connection of ‘Mijn Buddy’ with EPIC, the digital patient record, makes sure the journey is personalized and adjusted to a patient’s individual situation, so the right information is provided at the right moment. It helps child patients and parents to manage their expectation by providing information about what, who, where, and when things will happen.<br/>An interactive prototype was developed to evaluate ‘Mijn Buddy’ with both a number of child patients and (non-patient) children in their home environment, as well as pediatricians and ED-doctors. The feedback and outcomes of this evaluation study were very positive. ‘Mijn Buddy’ increased the knowledge about an acute admission for appendicitis, so it can be assumed it will reduce the uncertainty about the process. Children perceived it as fun and easy to use. Not only did child patients that were unfamiliar with the hospital and their journey see a clear added value, familiar patients also perceived the information provided by ‘Mijn Buddy’, like who to expect and when, as useful. Recommendations to further improve the design were also identified from this evaluation study, such as showing the possibility of a transfer to another hospital in the patient journey.<br/>However, more research is needed since ‘Mijn Buddy’ was only tested with one kind of acute admission (appendicitis), whereas there are a variety of reasons for an acute admission. Further research and pilot tests are needed to implement the application in the current healthcare system. ‘Mijn Buddy’ has the potential for many future extensions and build-ins like feedback surveys and pain measurements. Furthermore, with small adjustments ‘Mijn Buddy’ can also be valuable for a larger age-range. It is recommended to bring ‘Mijn Buddy’ into the market in various phases with continuous testing, adjusting, and developing.","patient experience; acute admission; children; healthcare; application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

To obtain these future corporates as a customer, ING wants to be there for them at the start. Therefore ING has set the goal to become “the startup bank of the Netherlands”. ING wants to offer startups more than a bank account; access to knowledge, a network and investors. To realise this ambition ING started the Startup Squad two years ago. With the goal of ING to become the startup bank of the Netherlands, their purpose is to be not only the bank, but also the partner of both startup and investor. To become a partner it is important that there is a value transfer between the participating parties. In the current product offer of the squad, the main focus used to be on the investor side. This resulted in an uneven balance of the portfolio. To have a fitting product offer for both customer groups, the research question for this project was established; “Discover the value which can be realised between startups and ING, and how this can be realised into a successful product or service”. The setup of the graduation project is based on the Double Diamond design process (Council, 2005). The red line through the project is dominated by this process as the project is split up in the four phases: discovery, define, develop and deliver Discovery &amp; Define First an analysis is performed to obtain deeper insights on the current situation. The analysis is split up in an internal and an external analysis. The internal analysis focusses of the strengths of the squad and ING. The squad is a relatively new team, this results in the opportunity of not having a clear objective. Depending on the opportunities, the team could change their strategy. ING has a strong purpose throughout the whole organisation. This provides a good framework to work within and to develop products around. The external analysis provides new insights on the market around the Startup Squad and ING. The competitor wheel shows the diversity of the saturated market for startups in common. By executing the strategic value curve, it became clear that here was room for improvement on the abilities of providing tailor made advice and face-to-face attention. Adjusting the scope to a niche of the later stage startup created a starting point for the consumer research. Develop Conducting qualitative interviews with both later stage startups and serial entrepreneurs, revealed the struggles later stage startups experience with the professionalisation of their startup. The term professionalisation can be split up in the four problem clusters; human resource management, finance, insurance and legal. An interesting insight is that startups enjoy to work with the unknown, dealing with these struggles is what drives them. In order to create a solution to these discoveries, a design statement was drafted; I will design a tool where the professional network of ING can help later stage startups with one of the four defined problem clusters by bringing together both parties to stimulate synergy. Ideation sessions with both SPD students and ING employees resulted in solutions to the design statement. The main outcome focussed on bringing together experts and startups to share knowledge by creating synergy. Three concepts were drafted and presented to the squad, the different concepts together had several touch points with a possible customer journey. The squad was looking for a more complete product, therefore the strengths of the concepts were combined into the Founders Club. Deliver The Founders Club is a portal which can provide an answer to the customer’s question. Based on the four problem clusters, two channels are exclusively accessible for members; A call service and physique meetups. Real value between ING and a later stage startup can occur by establishing a relationship. In brief, a relationship is an accumulation of touch points with the customer. The different elements will reinforce each other by placing them in line. The key is to have a two way conversation between customer and ING. The design of the service can function as an incentive to start building this relationship for ING. It is of great value to conduct a validation over a longer period to detect what triggers the customer and if ING can provide the requested value. ","Service Design; Startups; Banking; Membership; Relationship; Customer Values; Omnichannel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This collective idea of the public library does not correspond any longer to the way public libraries are used, designed, built and managed. In the recent years many new ways of transferring knowledge have arisen, mostly due to the impetuous development of ICT. This has put the original function of the public library in a new daylight. Since the public library is an open institution for everyone, it is directly influenced by the society we live in. This society is subjected to a lot of change today. With the end of the industrial re­volution we are developing into a knowledge society where people have to learn throughout their whole lives. At the same time a creative economy is evolving where creativity is steadily ­gaining weight as a production factor. Also, the welfare is constantly subjected to change. Due to cuts by the governments the focus point of investment is shifting all the time, which affects governmental institutions and results in a changing welfare. ­Finally, we can observe a movement in the demographic structure influenced by global connections. A structure, where it becomes common that different groups of people live next to each other. Subjected to a continuous integration of new cultures, in which exchanges happen in real time. This research focuses on the social and cultural value the public ­library has today and the way it can respond to the changing society we live in. If we look at the recent library developments we see a missing link between the actual library values and the ­library design. Architects have more or less re-invented the ­library at any new assignment. But, what is the contemporary identity of the public library, and what aspects have to be taken into consideration in order to design the library of our time? In order to redefine the ‘architype’ of the public library, the ­sociological research of the library identity will be combined with an architectural analysis focusing on the architecture of the public library building. With assistance of existing trends in the field of library development and an architectural analysis of the modern contemporary library, the aim is to define a new identity of the public library. This can contribute as a guidebook for architects to ­design the public library today and in the future.<br/><br/>The design builds on the idea of a network of different library identities, where each library branch has his own expertise within a field of knowledge. The House of Imagination focuses on the world of fiction. The building is a continuation of the forest around it, based on the Voronoi structure that makes you able to find your way among collumns as trees in the woods. ­Finding light places to meet, secluded places of focus and hidden ­places of fairytales, connected by a ‘forest path’ trough the House of Imagination. <br","library; public library; public building; future; social value; cultural value; archetype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However the cost of renewable energy sources still remains high compared to the traditional fossil fuel based energy sources. With the total worldwide energy demand also rising, combining renewable energy sources helps to reduce the cost through a shared infrastructure and increase in energy production. This thesis investigates the feasibility of a combination of floating offshore wind and marine current energy. As a basis the Hywind spar type floating offshore wind turbine is used. This 5 MW system is combined with a 1 MW marine current turbine. The characteristics of the current turbine will be examined with the program Aerodyn and the blades are designed with the program Harp_opt. As a cost reduction, the effect of scaling down the weight of the mooring system in combination with reversing the direction of the thrust of the current turbine is also investigated.<br/><br/>The program ANSYS AQWA is used to investigate the dynamic behavior of the<br/>combined system. The thrust forces of the wind and current turbines are calculated via an external python server and added to the simulation in AQWA. The structure is modeled in a rigid body approximation, assuming no structural deformations. The behavior of the combined system is investigated in 3 operational and 1 survival load case. The operational load cases represent the environmental conditions of the cut-in, rated and cut-out wind speed of the wind turbine. In the fourth load case the system is subjected to survival conditions and the direction of the thrust of the current turbine is reversed. The environmental conditions are simulated with a steady wind velocity and the sea state is modeled using the JONSWAP wave spectrum. In all 4 load cases the system is subjected to a strong current.<br/><br/>By using a levelized cost of energy prediction model, a first estimation of the levelized cost of energy of the combined system is obtained. Adding a current turbine to the Hywind spar increases the cost of the initial investments and operational cost of the system, but also increases the total energy generation. Compared to the original Hywind spar, adding a current turbine to the system lowers the levelized cost of energy from 149.4 €/MWh to 142.3 €/MWh. Scaling down the weight of the mooring system lowers the levelized cost of energy to 141.9 €/MWh.<br/><br/>From the results of the simulations it is found that using the current turbine during survival conditions has a positive effect on the motions and maximum tension in the lines. It is concluded that by using the thrust of the turbine the weight of the mooring system could be scaled down, but the effect on the levelized cost of energy is minimal and doesn’t justify the increased risk of failure.<br","floating; Offshore; Wind Energy; Current energy; LCOE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-19","","","","","",""

The movement of the interface between the two phases is controlled by the diffusion of carbon and a reaction on the interface between the two phases. In this thesis research a similar model and method is given for a three-phased model with an extra diffusive phase. This third phase is ferrite, which nucleates on the interface of austenite and cementite when the temperature is dropped below the eutectoid temperature for a high carbon steel alloy. The difference between austenite and ferrite is the matrix structure of the iron atoms. This influences how much carbon the phase can contain. The difference in structure also results in different properties of the steel with respect to strength, hardness, etc. Modeling the growth of this three-phased steel alloy could eventually lead to useful insights for high-carbon steel production.\\ <br/>Extra difficulties arise by the introduction of a second diffusive phase. These difficulties concern defining sufficient interface boundary conditions between the different phases, capturing the different phases with the level-set method, creating a qualitative good mesh capturing these phases, recovering gradients on an interface and getting correct carbon concentration value in the triple points because of the interface boundary conditions. Except for the latter problem, the results of this research show decent results.

The goal of this technology is minimizing a certain function, such as compliance, mass or frequency. <br/>This technology can improve the performance of components in different fields within the shipbuilding industry, depending on the function of the element and which type of ship they belong to. The three areas of application in which this technology was thought to have a big impact were weight reduction, aesthetics and comfort.<br/>It is a common thought that Topology Optimization could only help to the diminution of mass of bodies. Nonetheless, this reduction of weight does not benefit to all the ships. Cargo ships with a cargo limitation due to volume are less likely to take an advantage of its lightweight cutback than those with a cargo capacity limitation by weight. Moreover, vessels with a very low center of gravity would suffer stability disorders, such as cruise ships. <br/>The area of aesthetics was studied from a different point of view: now the construction industry was not perceived as only dedicated to maintain the integrity of structures, but an artistic point of view was explored with the target of resembling the ideas of consumers and transmitting feelings to customers. Vessels with a greater interest in the appearance are the ones dedicated to the transport of passengers, such as ferries and cruise ships and also those ships with a focus on the luxurious face of the marine construction sector, such as yachts. <br/>In the search of improvements regarding comfort, the focus was kept on the vibration phenomenon and the occurrence of noise. Vibrations are harmful for machinery, crew, passengers and the overall structure of the craft and therefore is an issue to be avoided as much as possible. With this target, Topology Optimization was applied on a mast under certain circumstances, taking into account the amount and allocation of navigation devices these elements must carry. <br/>This thesis aims to give an introduction to what can be achieved with the technology of Topology Optimization in the maritime sector. Although no decisive results were achieved for some of the previously presented elements, findings were attained and the potential of this application is positive. Nevertheless, more research is required in order to build solid confirmations about the profitability of the implementation of Topology Optimization. Moreover, manufacturing processes, and more specifically Additive Manufacturing is to be grown in order to fulfill the structural requirements of the optimal components. This refers not only to the fabrication process itself, but also to the implementation of this methodology in Regulations by Classification Societies. <br","Topology Optimization; Vibrations; Aesthetics; Weight Reduction; Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-19","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The Amstel area is known for its garden villages and gardening culture and thus the excellent location for the Garden City 2050 with its Green Garden Grocery School and the Green Machine. These buildings together form this graduation project. <br/><br/>The Green Garden Grocery School is the building where primary school children of the Amstel neighbourhood are educated in the future of food production in order to create community support for producing fresh food on a large scale and literally seed awareness for a more intensive and advanced gardening culture. This school provides the Green Machine with cuttings and seeds.<br/><br/>The Green Machine is the building in which many new ways of future food production are designed and exposed to the public. It functions as a machine of fresh local food, since it houses a large scale fish, crustaceans and sea weed farm, a vertical vegetable farm with an insect farm on top.

(graduation committee); Janssen, G.J.M. (graduation committee); Liu, Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A phase-domain analog-to-digital converter (PhADC) is a promising alternative to a pair of amplitude-domain in-phase and quadrature (IQ) ADCs for low power FSK/PSK demodulation, but due to the nonlinear amplitude-to-phase conversion, IQ offsets and gain mismatch can produce nonlinear phase distortions which that can lead to phase errors and an increase in bit-error rate (BER).<br/>An IQ offset and gain mismatch detection technique is developed for PhADCs and verified. The offset and gain mismatch is estimated by detecting the phase vector distribution imbalance among the four phase quadrants after the analog-to-phase conversion. A feedback path has been constructed between the PhADC output and the offset/mismatch compensation interface. The closed loop will help the compensation interface to settle to the proper compensation values of the offset and mismatch. Incorporating this cancellation loop in a receiver system can improve its sensitivity and robustness. <br/>In a conventional IQ ADC receiver we have two quantizations, i.e., one for I and one for Q, and then process the information to extract the phase. By contrast, the PhADC, due to its embedded demodulation attribute, performs only phase quantization. So only one quantization is needed. Because of its compactness, the hardware is simpler and thereby consumes less energy. Moreover the PhADC is immune to magnitude variations, because in an IQ ADC, amplitude quantization noise produces larger phase quantization noise at small vector<br/>magnitudes, while in a PhADC a larger vector has the same phase quantization error as a small vector. Because of these advantages the PhADC is a very good candidate for low power communication. A detection algorithm has been developed that detects the phase vector distribution imbalance between the left and right IQ complex half plane in case of I offset and between the top and bottom of IQ complex half plane in case of Q offset. Using this imbalance we can determine the sign and size of IQ offset. A similar approach has been done for IQ gain mismatch, where the phase vector distribution imbalance is detected between the four phase quadrants in the IQ complex plane. A mixed-signal approach, i.e., detecting the offset and mismatch in the digital domain and compensate in the analog domain.<br/>It is well known that in the IQ ADC receiver the offset and mismatch can be detected and calibrated if necessary before the amplitude is converted into phase in the digital domain, but in the PhADC receiver the offset and mismatch cannot be determined directly due to the absence of amplitude information. Here, we use phase information rather than amplitude information for detection and compensation. For this reason, we have created a direct mismatch and offset detection technique using the output phase signal of the PhADC. The relation between signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) and its digital counter parts bit-energy-to-noise density (E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>) and symbol-energy-to-noise density (E<sub>s</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>) is established and is used to show the effect of IQ offset and gain mismatch on the BER as a function of channel and phase quantization noise from the PhADC.<br/>It is shown that E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> and or E<sub>s</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> are not the same as SNR and less understood ratios that are often confused with SNR. The relation between SNR and Eb/No, or for higher dimensions (i.e., multiple bits per symbol), the E<sub>s</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> depends on the modulation parameters. For π/4 DQPSK modulation, the following relationship holds:E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> = SNR + 0.97 dB.<br/>An ideal PhADC receiver for π/4 DQPSK demodulation, with a noise-free channel, can tolerate a maximum IQ offset of 28 mV and a gain mismatch of ± 25 dB for a required BER of 10<sup>-5</sup> according to the IEEE802.15.6 standard. But with a channel noise of SNR= 21dB these become 22 mV and ± 6 dB, respectively. A practical PhADC receiver with the same channel noise can tolerate a maximum IQ offset of 14mV and a gain mismatch of ± 3 dB. <br/>An approach is presented to convert the PhADC receiver analog channel select filter to a digital one for discrete modeling purposes in Matlab Simulink. First, the Laplace transfer functions of the filter stages and from those the overall Laplace transfer function of the total filter are derived. A mapping procedure is proposed to convert the continuous time domain Laplace transfer function to a discrete one.","Phase Domain ADC; IQ offset; IQ gain mismatch; compensation system; Low power; Short range communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The aim of this project is to gain insight into the causes for the development of a two channel system in the Outer Weser and into the origin of the related alternation pattern of a dominant channel. Due to the construction of training walls and groynes at the end of the 19th century, the described characteristics disappeared and thus, they are a historical phenomenon but yet today not fully understood. However, to gain insight into the natural development in the Outer Weser estuary is beneficial for current and future engineering projects. <br/>For the investigation a schematic model is generated in which only essential processes are considered and simplified. By applying a flat bed as initial bathymetry, using simplified boundary conditions, multiplying the morphological changes with a morphological factor and using relatively coarse grid, the model is able to predict long term morphodynamics. In the next step scenarios are composed by considering the most relevant processes that could be responsible for the generation of two channels and for the alternation, leading to six scenarios. These scenarios are compared to a base case. <br/>In order to investigate the morphologic equilibrium, the development of two channels and their cyclic behavior, a number of methods are applied. These include time depended hypsometries, cumulative bed load transport, visual inspection and a special method for characterization of channel forms / geometries in a cross-section. <br/>The six scenarios cover the influences of the Kelvin wave, the Coriolis effect, wind waves, extreme river discharge, the absence of river discharge and an increased tidal range. All simulations have a period of ten years of hydromechanics which in combination with the applied morphological factor of 400 results in 4000 years of morphodynamics. The scenarios as well as the reference simulation reach a morphologic equilibrium within the first fourth of the simulation time. Afterwards, all simulations reveal the development of two channels with different dimensions and locations with respect to the reference simulation: While the scenarios excluding the Kelvin wave and river discharge result in a stronger development of the western channel, the scenario excluding Coriolis and the scenario including wave action lead to a more dominant eastern channel. The simulation with extreme discharge and the simulation with an increased tidal range do not favor one of the two channels. For the alternation, the developed evaluation method indicates an alternation between western dominance and equal dominance for the no Kelvin wave and no river discharge scenarios. For the no Coriolis scenario the alternation is observed between eastern dominance and equal dominance. No alternation is found for the extreme river discharge and wave scenarios, while the only scenario indicating an alternation between eastern and western dominance is the scenario with an increased tidal range. For the scenarios in which an alternation is indicated the alternation period is determined and compared to the reference case. This shows a shorter alternation period for the no river discharge scenario and a similar alternation period for the no Kelvin wave and no Coriolis simulation, while the alternation period is raised in the increased tidal range scenario.<br/>The conclusions are that the development of the two channel system is mainly caused by the tides and the basin geometry, since it evolves even when the Kelvin wave, Coriolis, the river discharge and waves are excluded. Furthermore, it is reasoned that the alternation pattern and period are dependent on the dominance of the tides and the depth of the two channels, due to a shortening of the alternation period in the scenario without river discharge (stronger domination of the tides) and an increased alternation period in the scenario containing an amplified tidal range (deeper channels). Additionally, it has been reasoned that the alternation might be introduced by the shape and geometry of the Weser estuary.","Flat bed; Weser estuary; Historical development; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","53.550099, 8.562469"

However, the effect of these measures on the reduction in flood risk or failure probability of the flood defence is often unknown. This research focusses on the effectiveness of grass revetment reinforcement measures applied during critical conditions at the outer slope of river dikes. Reinforcement measures applied during critical conditions are characterised by time constraints and human errors. The effect of the reinforcement measure on the reliability of the flood defence is studied. A probabilistic model is developed to assess the failure probability of the reinforcement measure and the time needed to install the measure. A model named OPSCHEP-model is used to quantify the failure probability due to human action. The effect of the measures on the failure probability of the flood defence is calculated by a crude Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that the reinforcement measures are most effective for known weak spots in the flood defence. Weak spots that are to be found during emergency dike inspection result in a much lower reduction in the failure probability of the flood defence. The level of preparedness of the water board organization largely determines how effective the measures are in reducing the failure probability.","reinforcement measures; crisis organization; grass revetment; emergency measures; human reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The investigation of small bodies in the Solar System such as asteroids and comets is of increasing interest to the space exploration community for scientific and security reasons. A key enabling technology is the availability to control position and attitude of spacecraft for asteroid close-proximity operations. Dynamics and control issues related to these operations have been investigated addressing the orbital and attitude motion of the spacecraft with no coupling between them assumed. In reality however, the translational and rotational dynamics of spacecraft are generally coupled. It is therefore desirable to simultaneously take into account the full six degrees of freedom problem when developing pose (position and orientation) control laws for practical applications. One way of doing that is by expressing the state variables with dual quaternions, a mathematical formulation that naturally couples both motions in an efficient and compact way.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to determine what advantages and disadvantages can a six degrees of freedom controller based on dual quaternions bring over classical methods regarding asteroid close-proximity operations. To do so, a simulator was developed in Matlab R2016b with the two different representations: the dual quaternion one and the classical one using vectors for position, velocity and angular velocity, and quaternions for the attitude. Then, a controller was designed and optimized for each representation to follow a reference trajectory in three different scenarios, such as orbiting, hovering and landing on the asteroid Bennu. The dual quaternion representation has only two equations of motion instead of the four required for the classical one because of its compactness and natural way of coupling rotational and translational motions. However, results show that the dual quaternion controller takes 15% more computational time to achieve the same level of accuracy and energy consumption as the classical controller for the nominal scenarios. The reason for that is because the total number of operations involved in the integration of the equations of motions is higher. Moreover, a stability analysis was carried out and showed that controllers based on dual quaternions can handle much larger perturbations than the classical ones. Specifically, between 23 and 227 times larger perturbations depending on the scenario. Apart from that, results also proved that dual quaternion controllers can correct trajectory perturbations in a much faster and efficient way than the classical ones. Specifically, they have a settling time between 29% and 92% shorter, accumulate between 2.6 and 19 times less error and consume between 3.2 and 9.3 times less energy, depending on the scenario.","Asteroids; Dual Quaternions; Control; Attitude; Pose; Quaternions; Landing; Hover; Orbit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

One of the options to achieve so is optimizing support structure design. Using XL-monopiles allows for larger turbines, deeper water access and consequently can provide for a more cost effective support structure. Within this market, Energieonderzoek Centrum Nederland (ECN) operates with its in-house developed software package to evaluate turbine responses. To further improve the model, a better insight is needed in breaking wave impacts on structures. <br/>This thesis is focused on developing an enhanced method to evaluate breaking waves on monopile structures to identify the effect of slamming waves on XL-monopiles. Based on wave tank measurements, a method to identify slamming wave impacts is developed and tested. Later, those wave tank measurements are reproduced and the identification method verified.<br/>Wave tank experiments were carried out at the Atlantic Basin at Deltares within the joint industry research project WiFi. For the experiments, two monopile scale models were placed in the wave tank, both equipped with multiple load and pressure sensors. During the tests the monopiles were exposed to series of wave trains, the irregular wave trains with a total of approximately 5000 waves, created a large sample size needed for the experiment. The wave measurements from the tank are analysed numerically to identify breaking waves. In this thesis a slamming wave event definition is proposed as follows:<br/>• Front crest steepness 푆 should reach breaking limit<br/>• The slamming impact of the wave should be more than 4 times the standard deviation of the force time series<br/>The numerical computations are carried out using the potential flow solver OceanWave3D to generate a sea state with comparable characteristics to the wave tank measurements. At first, the generated sea state appeared to lack the necessary wave height. By adjusting the input in the OceanWave3D program, a sea state was found that matches the measurements. Wave energy dissipation is checked throughout the measurements wave tank and compared to dissipation in the numerical model. It was shown that both the wave tank and numerical model show resembling dissipation.<br/>Hydrodynamic loading on the monopile foundation is assessed using the kinematics obtained from the OceanWave3D model. Several methods were combined to come to the total wave loading. First the Morison approach was used to account for the non-slamming part for the wave load. Using OceanWave3D, the force coefficients are calculated applying DNV guidelines. The second part, the slamming part of the wave load, is obtained in multiple phases. First, based on the above mentioned slamming wave criteria, wave steepness and impact forces, the individual waves are evaluated and scored as potential slamming. Secondly, using conservation of momentum and kinematics derived from OceanWave3D, the slam load is calculated. This slam load is determined evaluating the impact velocity of all waves individually and added to the Morison load if identified as slamming. Finally, when the calculated impact loads from the numerical model are compared to the recorded loads in the wave tank measurements, large similarity can be noticed. <br/>After comparison of the developed slam load representation to the DNV method of slam load estimation, the result is a less conservative slam load approximation. This is due to the evaluation of slamming impact velocities per wave, opposed to the assumption of a single impact velocity for the whole sea state. The results of this thesis can further implemented in turbine response evaluation tools by ECN resulting in a more optimized calculation model. It will enable the design of more (cost) efficient XL-monopile structures.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-27","","","","","",""

The Dutch government estimates that the build environment is responsible for 50% of resources used, 40% energy use, 30% of water use, 35% of CO2 production and 40% of the total waste production in the Netherlands. Because of these relatively high numbers, changes in the build environment can have large impact on the sustainability of our society. <br/>At this moment about a hundred thousand dwellings built during the 1960 -1970 are reaching the age of 50 each year making more than 50% of the Dutch building stock older than 50 years. In the current Dutch building stock, only a small portion of new buildings is added every year. At the current rate of 0.4% it would take 250 years before all buildings would be renewed. The average lifetime of a residential building is 50 years. This can be extended another 50 years with the right intervention. It is therefore very important to have a solid strategy to deal with existing buildings as this can play an important role in maintaining a high-quality building stock while working towards sustainable goals. <br/>This thesis looks at the challenges of high rise residential flats built in the post- WW2 era of the 1960’s in order to develop a refurbishment method that can help to upgrade and maintain these types of buildings in a sustainable way. By keeping the buildings instead of demolishing or replacing them resources and energy can be spared and by refurbishing them a more sustainable building stock can be achieved. <br/>The chosen refurbishment method is an add-on strategy as this deals with many challenges the flats are facing. Using the parameters from the case study project the Leeuwerik flat in the Poptahof, add-on variants have been designed with big emphasis on flexibility, demount ability and durability. The Add-ons aim to improve the physical building qualities by providing better thermal performance. They improve the spatial qualities by providing extra space and they improve the social quality of a building by provide a new and more diversified look. <br/>The three main add-on variants are categorised by material namely wood, concrete and FRP. The add-ons have been detailed to be completely prefabricated and to be quickly mounted on the building. The performance of each of the addons has been assessed in order to compare them and to find out what the influence is of the material choice on add-on dimensions, the thermal performance the and the environmental performance. <br/>Overall it can be concluded that using a demountable add-on strategy is a feasible way to quickly refurbish a building. It offers a way to deal with existing building physical problems and can improve the architectural and spatial qualities of an existing building. Different add-on types and construction materials and are possible. This leaves a lot of space for designers that want to use the demountable add-on strategy while working on a refurbishment project of a high rise residential building to make their own choices depending on the focus of the project, giving each building a unique appearance. This will lead to a higher quality and more sustainable building stock in the long run. <br","Sustainability; Refurbishment; gallery apartment buildings; demountable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.99973500000001, 4.350894799999992"

In addition, digital developments enable and create more specific requirements among users for the products they purchase. Knowing the impact that these rapid developments have on consumerism, it is inevitable that users will create stronger preferences for their living environment as well. These tendencies in our society must be translated to its housing. To adapt to such diverse demands would be a difficult challenge for the housing market. Current processes make it labour-intensive and therefore a costly and unsustainable matter. It is of importance that both our existing and future housing is able to respond to these demands in an adaptive and sustainable manner.<br/><br/>A possible solution, responding to the diverse demand, would be to involve the consumers themselves in the development of their dwelling. When involved, consumers can directly shape the dwelling to their needs themselves; customisation. However, current practices make this an undoable matter. The over-complexity in (pre)construction processes and conservative mind-sets of real-estate developers and construction firms hinder any level of participation with the consumer.

Van Oord’s offshore installation vessel Aeolus was purposely-built to transport and install foundations of offshore wind turbines. To ensure that the vessel remains competitive in a market that is changing rapidly, Van Oord decided to upgrade this vessel to expand its operational capabilities to work on soft soil seabed conditions.<br/><br/>Equipped with moveable legs, the mobile jack-up vessel is able to elevate its hull out of the water and provide a stable work platform. Prior to each installation, the soil is preloaded by penetrating the spudcan footings into the soil under the self-weight of the structure, followed by progressively pumping sea water into the ballast tanks until the target preload is reached. Offshore industry guidelines follow the conventional bearing capacity theory to assess jack-up procedures. However, these conventional procedures are inadequate in incorporating all relevant mechanisms that contribute to the preloading behaviour in cohesive soils. The effect of consolidation around the spudcan footings on the soil strength and the viscous strain rate-dependent soil strength are two important aspects which are poorly described in the current guidelines. Using numerical modelling, a better understanding of these mechanisms is aimed for in order to evaluate spudcan bearing capacity in cohesive soils in a more detailed design.<br/><br/>An axisymmetric finite element model of the spudcan foundation is constructed in PLAXIS 2D to assess the effects of consolidation and rate-dependence of soil strength on the use of different preloading strategies. As spudcan penetration is relatively fast and clay permeability is relatively low, consolidation effects are found to be insignificant during the preloading process. Contrary, viscous strain rate effects dominate the soil strength of clay in predominantly undrained conditions. Higher shear strengths are found for higher spudcan penetration rates. During the standard jacking process, when the target preload value is reached and the spudcan is stopped, a reduction of the leg load occurs due to decreasing viscous resistances, which must actively be brought back to the target preload value. In clay soils, this leads to further penetrations and multiple preload cycles are required before the spudcan response is stabilised. In terms of preloading duration, a rather slow spudcan penetration rate is therefore beneficial when using the standard jacking procedure.<br/><br/>Alternatively, a different jacking procedure is assessed numerically, which adapts for these viscous strain rate effects by overshooting the target preload value by 10-15%, in order to reach the stable spudcan response more quickly. In this way, the spudcan is brought to the depth, which would have been reached by the creep-like additional penetrations in the iterative preload cycles under the target preload value. Once the load is reduced from the overshoot to the target preload value, it is likely that the preload can be sustained without additional penetrations and preload cycles. The overshooting jacking procedure reduces the required preloading time considerably for both spudcan penetration rates. The largest time savings are gained for the largest penetration rates. However, using this method, larger leg penetration predictions compared to the standard jacking procedure are observed for decreasing spudcan penetration rates. That is because in the standard jacking procedure, less creep-like additional penetrations are present when using a slow spudcan penetration rate. The overshooting jacking procedure can thus be considered beneficial for relatively fast spudcan penetration rates, both in term of preloading duration and spudcan penetrations.<br","Offshore wind farm; Aeolus; jack-up; spudcan; preload; preload time; cohesive soil; clay; consolidation; Strain rate; viscoplasticity; Soft Soil Creep; jack-up strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, manual tracking of whiskers in thousands of frames is not feasible, and reliable tracking of individual whiskers is not possible with the best current software available. In this work, a new system for the automatic tracking of whiskers in top-view videos of untrimmed, head-fixed mice is presented. The design of this system is based on a variety of image processing and computer vision algorithms. For each step, several alternatives have been considered and assessed. The best options have been combined and implemented in MATLAB. This new system, the Full-Whisker Tracking System (FWTS), detects the centerline of whiskers on each frame along their whole length with sub-pixel accuracy. The whiskers are defined by their angle, position, shape and length. FWTS uses these features to track and recognize whiskers over multiple frames in video segments with a frame rate of 1000 Hz. The system was tested on representative, challenging video segments from two experiments using different mice, and showed itself superior to the pre-existing system BWTT, by detecting on average 21.2% more whiskers, and with twice as much precision. In contrast to earlier systems, FWTS has been demonstrated reliably track individual whiskers in untrimmed mice. Furthermore, FWTS's processing time is on average 41.7% lower than that of BWTT. This thesis work shows that it is possible to track whiskers in untrimmed mice, even in the face of partial occlusions, and makes it possible to study the functioning of the intact whisker system of mice in unprecedented detail.","whiskers; mice; rodents; computer vision; machine learning; curvilinear objects; detection; whisker detection; whisker tracking; tracking; BWTT; FWTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-driving cars, digitization of historic buildings or maintenance of highway infrastructure are a small selection of many applications that use laser scanning to acquire three-dimensional data of our physical surroundings. Most of these applications require more than the shape of their surroundings. For example, a self-driving car needs to identify pedestrians, road signs and traffic lights in order to navigate safely. Therefore the point cloud acquired by laser scanning needs to be enriched with additional information. Automatic assignment of the object type a point belongs to is called classification.<br/><br/>This research focuses on deep learning for point cloud classification, because it revolutionized classification of imagery. PointNet is used to enable deep learning directly on point cloud data sets. To date PointNet is proven for indoor point clouds, this research explores the application of PointNet on an outdoor highway scene. The methodology creates point cloud training data efficiently by reusing known 2D object locations. Different spatial representations and sampling methods for the points are tested.<br/><br/>On average the method classifies 50% of the points correctly in four object classes. In combination with clustering of the point-wise predictions, the method predicts 60% of the 2D object locations successfully. The performance is comparable to the 47% average class accuracy PointNet achieves for 13 classes on the indoor data set.","Neural Networks; Point Clouds; Mobile Laser Scanning; Classification; Highway Scene","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","TNO Research",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The laws and regulations regarding the radiated noise and the on-board noise of the ship are expected to be stricter in the future. There is a big concern in this field, especially for the underwater noise. The radiated noise from the ship is harming the life of the underwater mammals while the on-board noise is threatening the health of the on-board crew. One of the main contributors to the noise generated by a vessel is the propulsion system. It is true that the noise reduction can be achieved by doing the corrective action in the later design stage, such as installing mounting and noise absorption material. Nevertheless, the decision in early-design stage often gives the highest impact on the noise generated by the propulsion system where the level of uncertainty is high. This thesis has two main goals; to determine the design choices of propulsion systems which affect the noise excitation, and to develop an evaluation methodology to assess a certain power configuration from the perspective of generated noise.<br/> First, the aspects of the propulsion system that affect its noise are determined. Those are transmission types, number of engines, number of shafts and number of compartments. The loading point is also included as one of the parameters. Although it is not a design choice, it has a significant role in the noise generated by the propulsion system. Second, the selection of the significant noise source in the propulsion system needs to be done. There is much equipment inside a propulsion plant, but not all of them give sufficient contribution to the overall noise level. Based on the literature review, the equipment that is considered as the main noise sources are the diesel engine, the diesel generator set, the reduction gear and the electric motor.<br/> A noise model from SNAME is implemented in this project to predict the airborne and structure-borne noise source levels of the equipment and the transmission losses to the receiver location. An engine room-sizing model is developed in this project since the transmission loss is a function of the compartment dimensions. Furthermore, the room dimensions depend on the equipment dimensions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a model to predict the size of the equipment too. Afterwards, the evaluation methodology is established to quantify the effect of a certain design choice towards the noise of a propulsion system. <br/> The effects of varying ship requirements are also investigated to see the behaviour of the model with a different input. These requirements are the ship installed power, the ship propulsion power and the ship auxiliary power<br/> This project provides a general guideline for the marine engineer to evaluate the propulsion system based on the noise considerations in the early design phase. The evaluation methodology proves to be applicable to a wide range of propulsion plant type. It is possible to extend the application of this method for a ship with prime mover other than the diesel engine and the electric motor. <br","Airborne Noise; Structure-borne Noise; Propulsion System; Early Design Stage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

First, it implements a flexible modelling process to support architectural creativity during the conceptual design phase. The conceptual model is composed of building blocks that can be combined and parametrically adjusted to form a whole structure. Second, it helps the users understand the structural behaviour by visualising the force flow in near real-time. Instead of the conventional finite element method, the behaviour results of individual and combined building blocks (super elements) is computed using a symbolic differential equation method. Third, it includes feasibility checks and visualises them for both disciplines to improve understanding and encourage collaboration during the decision making process.","conceptual design; super element method; feasibility; structural analysis; collaboration; real-time; parametric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The great majority of them are young professionals. They are facing the problem that their ideal housing type, which provides quality of affordability (affordable rental housing), assessibility (connectivity to work place through public transportation) and liveable living condition (proper privacy, neither social cage or anonymous community without green) does not exist. Thus this project is in motion to create a more friendly neighbourhood for the young professionals through designing a liveable neighbourhood in terms of control of social interaction, sustainalbe green, affordable rental housing and a seamless public transportation system. Xiongan New Town is a proper location as it provides a larger range of possibilities for this neighbourhood spatially. However, Chinese New Towns are until now built with-out a out relation to their historical and ecological context. This leads to a proposal for an new town that relates to the local ecological and urban context and with references to the history of dwelling in the area. Therefore the objective is to design a infrastructure framework for a New Town and a fully designed liveable neighbourhood as a illustrative example of alternative design approach. Therefore the strategy is composed by two parts. Firstly, based on typology analysis, scenario analysis, case study, mapping, etc., I put forward a series of approaches for Xiongan new town in multiple scales (regional, city, district, neighbourhood) to provide a framework as precondition for a liveable neighbourhood. These approaches aim to achieve a balanced harmony between landscape and city, history and future development as context for neighbourhood design. Secondly, a spatial design focus on the qualities of control on social interaction, historical continuity and sustainable green. Spatial design in neighbourhood scale includes an integral framework and smaller interventions. A blue and green network based on water and topographic condition will be introduced. Accessible network and density hypothesis will be created on top of this landscape layer. Smaller interventions will be embedded into this framework, to show the possibilities of balancing density, creating legible territory, preserving historical continuity, achieving spatial integrality. Specifically, the neighbourhood will be composed of housing types of various density (matching potential density); it will be divided into multiple legible territories of various levels of privacy; historical connection will be provided through preserving parcellation patterns and existing buildings. Houses will be constructed by the method of layer construction to leave space for future development. Green space helps to combine all spatial elements. Finally, the liveable neighbourhood will be a synthesis of all those interventions.","Territory; Chinese new town; Control on social interaction; Urban design; Landscape-based strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The device is capable of providing active flexion/extension and pronation/supination with approximate output torques of 0.3 and 0.2 Nm respectively. The lack of output torques is most likely caused by the use of a 3D printed housing which resulted in several alignment issues, introducing additional friction into the system.

By looking into methods to release metals from polymer substrate and design interventions to enable predictable fracturing of 3D printed structures in a shredder, a step towards the recycling of valuable metals from future electronics is made.<br/> <br/>Recent rapid technological advancements in the production of electronics have created a vast and increasing stream of electronic waste. Not only is this is this waste a source of toxic pollutants when inappropriately processed, billions worth of valuable metals are squandered as the products are not recycled.<br/><br/>Current technological advancements are made in the development of additive manufacturing techniques that enable the 3D printing of structural electronics. This novel production technique promises enormous possibilities when it is matured as manufacturing method for embedded electronics in consumer products. However, 3D printing of electronics will leave components and circuitry made from valuable metals embedded between fused layers of one or more other materials. This results in the whole piece becoming electronic waste at the product’s end of life, with no fitting processes in place to retrieve the value embedded in the product.<br/><br/>Literature research and field studies led to the conclusion that designers should be supported in the design of recyclable 3D printed electronics. Complications in the access to the embedded components and circuitry and liberation of dissimilar materials were identified as main concerns in the recycling process. Explorative studies to solve these two problems were conducted parallelly. One study aimed at the design of 3D printed structures that enable predictable fracturing of the object in a shredder, which facilitates access to the circuit and components in the recycling process. The second study focussed on new methods to achieve the release of silver circuitry from PLA substrate, aiding in the liberation of the this metal in a recycling process.<br/><br/>In the first study several design interventions were found that allow controlled fracturing in a shredder. The best results were obtained with modifications that led to fracture in a horizontal plane, in the direction that the object is build. In the second study promising results were obtained by heating the substrate and circuitry by submerging the object in hot liquid and moving the circuitry and substrate relatively to each other. Ultrasound was investigated as a method to induce this relative movement in the product while it was submerged in hot water. Both methods require further investigation before definitive conclusions can be drawn.<br/><br/>Based on the results of the two studies and a literature study on the current recycling processes for electronics, guidelines for the design of recyclable 3D printed electronics were established.

European legislation prescribes that assessment of the quality of the current collection system shall be performed according to measurements and/or simulations. Due to the increase in computer power in recent years, simulations have become increasingly attractive as an addition or replacement to real line measurements. <br/><br/>The goal of this work is to judge current collection quality through dynamic time-history simulations of the pantograph-catenary interface. First, the current state-of-art is reviewed, subsequently a simulation approach is determined, applied and tested to the norm EN50318:2002. Based on simulation results and comparison to measured values, the simulation approach is validated according to the norm EN50318:2002. <br/><br/>As a consequence of the large finite element models used in the valid model, a method for enhancing the simulation speed without losing non-linearities is determined. Changes in solver and contact model are identified as possible improvements, as is a modal reduction of the model. In order to apply the proposed solver improvements, a test model is built in Matlab. The valid Ansys model is used to test simulation times as different contact models are used. A modal reduction approach is implemented in Matlab. <br/><br/>It is found that as a consequence of solver changes, simulation times may improve by up to 40%. Furthermore, contact model changes may result in improvements of up to 77%. Modal reduction, when applied to the current model, has been found inefficient due to high amounts of interface DOF with respect to the full size of the model. Therefore, no results are presented for the modally reduced system. <br/><br/>Non-optimized simulations currently require around 24 hours of simulation time. It is to be expected that multiple simulations need to be executed in order to simulate all possible pantograph combinations, thus performing all simulations may require days to weeks. This situation is deemed undesirable. Based on the findings in this work, it is concluded that simulation times may improve by a ratio [6:43] if solver and contact model are chosen wisely.

Theoretically, the optimal control inputs can be determined offline by using models. However, due to modelling assumptions, this method can result in a suboptimal operation of the plant. Besides, performance of the plant varies over time as a result wear and tear, fouling, and fluctuating ocean water temperatures. Comparable obstacles are encountered in maximizing the electricity production in wind turbines. A promising solution in this field is Extremum Seeking Control (ESC). ESC is a model-free control strategy used for the real-time optimization of an unknown objective function. In this study, ESC has been implemented on a room-sized OTEC test-setup, called the OTEC-demo.

As the installation of pipelines makes up a significant percentage of the total costs of a project, the workability of the installation vessel is of great value. The workability is dependent on the weather conditions and multiple operability limits. The operability limits guarantee the safety during offshore installation. A more accurate methodology of describing the operability limits will usually result in a higher workability. The operability limits in this work describe the limitations of the pipe integrity. <br/>Traditionally, operability in offshore construction projects is defined in terms of operable weather conditions. The operability limit is based on critical sea states which can be compared with the actual sea conditions. The critical sea states are characterized using the significant wave height, peak wave period and multiple directions. The crew has to assess the actual sea state and compare it to prescribed limiting sea states. The human assessment of the actual sea state lead to inaccuracies which can lead to a loss of workability. <br/>The sea states that are used to describe measurable operability limits are not the direct cause of the pipe integrity infringement. The vessel moves due to the waves and the vessel motions cause significant loads on the pipe during normal-lay operations. The simplification of sea states and the vessels RAO are two conservative steps that are not taken into account for operability limits based on vessel motion. The pipe integrity criteria (unity check) consist out of pipe bending moment, pipe tension and hydrostatic pressure. The focus of this work is the pipe bending moment because the dynamic part of the pipe bending moment is larger compared to the other loads. The objective of this thesis is to develop a methodology that determines the operable conditions based on vessel motion limits for pipe bending moment during normal-lay operations. <br/>Previous work only achieved some basic operating criteria such as limiting the vessel roll to 2 degrees single amplitude determine the workability. Since the pipe bending moment at the overbend is not only dependent on a single degree of freedom vessel motion, a new methodology needs to be developed. An accurate vessel motion limit can predict the maximum pipe bending moment. This can only be achieved with highly correlated vessel motions and pipe bending moments at the points of interest. A delay between vessel motions and pipe bending response has a negative effect on this relation and must be corrected. <br/>This thesis applies a model based approach to determine the relation between the vessel motions and pipe bending moment. The points of interest are roller box 3 in the Hang-off module of the D.C.V. Aegir and the sagbend where the pipe radius is minimum. This research concluded that a frequency dependent delay is present between the vessel and the sagbend bending moment. This delay shows a clear relation with the wave frequencies at sea. A methodology is presented to correct the pipe bending moment signal towards the governing vessel motion.<br/>The vessel motion limits that are obtained for the overbend pipe bending moment are presented in figure 1. The figure shows a 2DOF vessel motion limit (black line) which is based on the lateral and transversal rotations at FC1. The vessel motion limit represents the bending moment limit of 2000 kNm. <br/>Before evaluating the correlations, the pipe bending moment signal at the sagbend is corrected in the frequency domain towards the vessel motions. This resulted in the sagbend pipe bending moment showing a clear dependency on the axial acceleration and a large improvement in correlation. <br/>The relation between the vessel motions and pipe bending moment responses are described by a curve fitting equation with a probability of p90. This p90 curve fit is able to accurately predict the pipe bending moment due to the high correlation between the limit and the modeled BM data. This achievement makes it possible to determine reliable vessel motion limits for normal-lay. An accurate vessel motion limit saves engineering hours and prevents conservative decisions during operations, especially when the operability limits are low during e.g. during installation of structures. The presented methodology can already be implemented in the current workability calculations as well as on deck of the vessel.<br/><br","Operability limits; Vessel motions; Workability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-13","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The mobile robot mainly operates out of sight of the operator, making accurate localization of the robot crucial to its operation. However, the absence of absolute localization and sources for error build-up like wheel slip and sensor noise, increase the error between the estimated location and true location over time. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to minimize the amount of error build-up between the estimated position and the true position of the robot, to allow more efficient operation of the robot and to ultimately allow the robot to operate autonomously.<br/><br/>The main sources for error build-up are determined by simulating the position estimator with modeled sensor- and perturbation models and evaluating their individual effect on the position estimator. Algorithms that combat the error build-up are established by synthesizing working principles from literature and extensively testing these principles using simulated data and finally verifying them using real but limited data. <br/><br/>The analysis of the sensor noise and perturbations revealed that the EKF is best suited to estimate the position of the robot and that the main sources for error build-up are wheel slip and IMU heading drift. The addition of a slip detection and velocity correction algorithm reduced the average error build-up per meter traveled by a factor of four. The addition of the heading correction algorithm reduced the error build-up by a factor of three and mitigates the need for intermittent resetting of the robot heading by the operator.<br/><br/>The velocity and heading correction algorithms improve the position estimator allowing the operator to more efficiently control the robot. In order to further reduce the error build-up, it is recommended to add two more wheel encoders to the robot.

In this graduation project, social sensitivity is approached as a fundament for learning in the context of the new primary school Klein Amsterdam. Klein Amsterdam’s mission is to create schools as in-between spaces, in which children learn from society. Collaborating with Klein Amsterdam led to the following scope of the project: constructing learning lines for children to develop social sensitivity at primary school Klein Amsterdam. By studying the development of social sensitivity from various perspectives, the method ‘The Good Conflict’ was developed. The Good Conflict includes a framework of constructed learning lines that enable children to develop their social sensitivity. Research through design showed that children experience difficulties reflecting on their emotions. Learning about emotions starts by expanding a child’s emotional granularity, that is to say, the ability to differentiate between the specificity of emotions. This lead to the following design goal: ""I want children of six and seven years old to have a multi-sensory learning experience, which contributes to their emotional granularity, by engaging them in a story both physically and mentally.” The final design is a storytelling experience for in the classroom through which children immerse themselves in a story. The storytelling experience enables children to imagine themselves being the main character of the story. By embodying the story, guided by the narrator, the children safely experience the emotions of the character. With this, they are introduced to the associated body of language and facial expressions of the corresponding emotion. The story is communicated through spoken word (narration), music, sound effects and visuals that represent the context of the story to create a multi-sensory learning experience. The intended user experience was tested with a prototype in a classroom with children of six and seven years old. The test showed that the design goal was validated and the interaction qualities were met. The children embodied several emotions in the learning experience and reflected on these in the group reflection. During the group reflection, children were able to link the emotion(s) to the embodied experience. The outcome of this project is a starting point for further development at Klein Amsterdam.In order for the design to be further developed, the content needs to be altered for different age groups. Guidelines should be made to create appropriate content for the other age groups. Furthermore, new content for the learning experience should be created. If other schools are interested in the design, the learning community of Jeelo will take the creation of content in consideration.","social sensitivity; Klein Amsterdam; Education; Embodied storytelling; method; conflict","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Er wordt met een zodanig hoge snelheid een grote hoeveelheid afval geproduceerd dat dit niet op een natuurlijke manier verwerkt kan worden. Dit resulteert in mogelijke schade voor het milieu en de gezondheid van mensen. Deze situatie vraagt om een nieuwe benadering van bouwen en ontwerpen. Afval moet niet meer beschouwd worden als afval, maar als grondstof. Overal waar afval geproduceerd wordt, liggen kansen voor lokaal hergebruik. Om ervoor te zorgen dat resten niet schadelijk zijn voor de stad, moeten naar nieuwe mogelijkheden gekeken worden om met resten om te gaan. Door te streven naar een circulaire economie kan hergebruik gestimuleerd worden. <br/><br/>Ontwerpers kunnen een belangrijke rol spelen bij een transitie van een lineaire naar een circulaire economie. Nu hergebruik een steeds belangrijkere rol begint te spelen, wordt er gezocht naar mogelijkheden om kringlopen te sluiten en een circulaire economie te stimuleren. Hierbij zijn voornamelijk technische vraagstukken in het geding waarbij het doel is om vraag en aanbod van bijvoorbeeld warmte of elektriciteit op elkaar af te stemmen. Voor ontwerpers komen technische vraagstukken in een ander kader te staan.<br/><br/>De transitie van een lineaire naar een circulaire economie vraagt om nieuwe werkwijzen. Om uiteindelijk een ontwerp te kunnen maken dat gebaseerd is op een circulaire economie wordt in deze scriptie een stappenplan aangedragen. Als onderdeel hiervan is een tool ontwikkeld waarmee reststromen met behulp van een tool in kaart gebracht worden, zodanig dat deze hergebruikt kunnen worden in een ontwerp. Het ontwerp dat voortvloeit uit deze scriptie moet aantonen dat het mogelijk is om een ontwerp te maken dat gebaseerd is op restproducten. Het doel van het ontwerp is om reststromen en -producten van verschillende functies met elkaar in verbinding te brengen, zodat de discrepantie tussen vraag en aanbod opgeheven kan worden. Om bewustwording van de mogelijkheden van hergebruik te stimuleren zal het te ontwerpen gebouw een publieke functie krijgen, die afhankelijk is van het soort resten dat uit de directe omgeving beschikbaar is.<br/><br/>De tool die in deze scriptie is ontworpen dient als hulpmiddel om uiteindelijk ontwerpvoorwaarden te formuleren voor het te ontwerpen gebouw.

Voor het te ontwerpen gebouw vormen deze restproducten nieuwe mogelijkheden om de omgeving te verbeteren. Op deze manier dienen de restproducten weer als grondstof en is van afval geen sprake. Door de materialen binnen gesloten kringlopen te houden zal de stad op deze locatie meer functioneren als een natuurlijk ecosysteem. Het beoogde ontwerp maakt van de restproducten iets positiefs waar de omgeving van kan profiteren. Door op meerdere plaatsen in de stad naar synergieën te zoeken, waarmee restproducten een nieuw doel kunnen dienen, kan de hele stad minder afhankelijk worden van import van materiaal.","Circulaire Economie; Stedelijk metabolisme; Hergebruik; Architectuur; Amsterdam; Arenapark; Nieuwe bouworde","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.311989, 4.942952"

The main problem of this sport however is that swords are designed to hurt people and good protection equipment is not available.

During the concept development the arm protector is divided in different sections that are linked to specific requirements originating from the three research areas. Within these sections principle solutions are created, tested and selected to be combined in a preliminary design. The preliminary design is validated with experienced H.E.M.A. practitioners and further developed into the final design. The final design is a tailor made arm protector that exists out of stiff specifically shaped shells that can rotate relative to each other in order to create the necessary freedom of movement, protection and fit.

For some cases a laparoscopic approach is difficult to perform. In cases of highly obese patients, or a specifically distal laying tumor. The tumor is then difficult to reach because of the funneling shape of the pelvis. This creates difficulties for the surgeon resulting for higher risk of damaging nerves and surrounding organs. For these cases a transanal approach is introduced: Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision (TaTME). A key step in TaTME is the purse string suture which is used to close the distal stump of the rectum before starting full thickness incision. Currently training of the procedure is done through proctoring and a two-day introductory course with OR-observation and cadaver training. Literature study showes that no box trainers that allow objective assessment of skills are currently available for this specific task. This goal of this thesis is to find parameters that might contain construct validity for expertise for a transanal purse string suture. <br/>Several force-based parameters are selected for analysis. To obtain the goal a novel measurement system is designed according to a set of requirements. The system measures forces exerted on the entrance port for the instruments as well as tissue interaction forces. A pilot study is done after which improvements in the device and test protocol are implemented. Last a construct validity study is performed at VU medical center in Amsterdam. <br/>Two groups participated in the study: novice (n=7) and experts (n=3). Promising results are found for tissue interaction forces. Novices apply higher and longer peaks of force. This correlates to observed difficulties in positioning the needle correctly before incision. Experts create a smooth motion by interchanging the needle between instruments. Interesting results are obtained for portal forces along the long axis of the port, in other words box in- and outward. It is seen that the resultant force shifts from a mostly pulling force for novice to a pushing force for experts. This can be a sign of incorrect instruments handling and must be researched further for its function as a parameter for objective skill assessment. Furthermore, internal moments about x-axis and y-axis show interesting results. Where the moment about the y follows a clear sinusoid for both novices and experts, this is not the case for the moment about the x-axis. It is very likely that this is due to the interference of the scope. Significant differences are found for Mx.min, Mx.mean, and Mx.pos. It is suggested that the moment about the x-axis can also be a good indicator for instrument handling skills<br/>The novel measurement system designed for this study can be used to give insight in instrument handling behavior when performing a transanal purse string suture. It has the unique feature to assess internal moments in a single-port setting, which is not applied in skill assessment in laparoscopy yet.<br","TaTME; total mesorectal excision; skills assessment; objective; parameters; purse string suture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project researches the creation and impact of “material narratives”. Generally, it takes around 20 years until a new material is fully adopted. Material narratives can show the potential of new materials and make people aware about the underlying reasons, by using methods of storytelling and narrativity. Material narratives reflect the life stories and possibilities of new or newly used materials, as well as our relationship to materiality, which includes the personal and cultural stories of the people behind it. The goal of these material narratives is that the receiver can better relate to these materials, enriching and enhancing their “materials experience”. This led to the following design goal: ""Design a method for designers to create material narratives to positively influence the materials experience.""<br/><br/>This graduation project started with the broader goal to stimulate and facilitate the use of local and natural building materials, as an alternative for the conventional construction techniques through material narratives that positively influence the materials experience, based on my vision and prior experiences (p.3).<br/><br/>An extensive research on narratives, based on literature (chapter 2) and existing example narratives (chapter 3), led to the definition of the material narrative model (chapter 4). This model describes six essential narrative elements, including sub-elements, interrelations and influential factors. This model is an addition to existing research in the way it describes the relations and effects. <br/><br/>As a way to apply and test this theory in the field, a showcase was executed in South Limburg (chapter 5). During the showcase several material narratives were created, focussing on local natural materials and its related crafts and people, and shared for feedback. Furthermore, tools and templates were explored and developed to make the model easily accessible through a guiding method. The method consists of four main phases: inventarisation, selection, translation and communication. The first two phases include the research preparation to acquire the material narrative input; the latter two phases facilitate the actual narrative creation, based on the material narrative model.<br/><br/>These two parallel processes - the narrative research and the showcase - led to the final product: the Material Narrative Method. The method is designed as workbook that can be filled in by the user and taken along to the project (chapter 6). The thesis concludes with a strategy for the method workbook, opportunities for collaboration with other methods, such as the MDD method (Karana et al.,2015), and recommendations.","material narratives; materials experience; storytelling; method; conviviality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Correia, Gonçalo (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The taxi procedure at an airport refers to the surface movement of the aircraft between the parking position and the runway or vice versa. Nowadays, aircraft tend to taxi with the main engines, even if they are not optimized for it. Using an alternative suitable taxiing system that fulfills the requirements of the taxi procedure could be a useful tool to save costs. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) seem to be a convenient alternative that could potentially be used for aircraft taxiing.<br/><br/>This report focuses on the state-of-the-art concept of using AGVs in the taxi procedure so that the vehicle tows the aircraft to the runway and the main engines of the aircraft are not used during the largest part of the taxi operations, reducing this way the cost of it. The main research objective is ""to analyze the effect of using automated guided vehicles for aircraft taxiing at a major airport by creating a routing and scheduling model that is capable of creating trajectories for aircraft and automated guided vehicles while optimizing the cost of aircraft taxiing"". <br/><br/><br/>The use of AGVs started in 1955 in different situations and ever since its employment has continuously grown. With the current technologies an AGV system able to cope with the current throughput and reduce the cost of taxi operation could be developed. Indeed, it would be profitable for airlines keeping the throughput and airports. <br/><br/>After an exhaustive literature review of the topic, a routing and scheduling model that improves the current taxiing system has been created. This model takes into account the aircraft taxiing requirements and the optimal way of routing and scheduling with AGVs and is developed by Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) in order to minimize the cost of the airport ground movement problem, including the cost of delay of the aircraft.<br/><br/><br/>The model should be able to find the optimal solution for taxiing using AGVs in any major airport - in this research Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) has been used as case study. Historical flight data and the taxiing network of AAS are used to model the traffic on the taxi lanes. In this case study it was found that a small fleet of two narrow-body (NB) towing AGV and one wide-body (WB) towing AGV gives the highest cost savings for the analyzed days. The departures at AAS are not evenly distributed over the day, which affects the utilization rate of the vehicles. A roughly year estimation showed that 1.4 million EUR could be saved. Also 11 thousand tons of CO2 could be reduced, which means a plus of 82 thousand EUR to carbon offsetting cost savings in 2020. <br/><br/>By analyzing the effect of changing the input parameters a sensitivity analysis is made on the jet-fuel price, diesel price and the depreciation cost of the AGVs. While diesel price has a relative low effect on the cost savings using AGVs, these cost savings as well as the optimal fleet of vehicles is highly dependent on the jet-fuel price (the higher the jet fuel price is, the more cost savings can be obtained) and the depreciation cost of the vehicles. Since all these costs are an input to the model, it is possible to check whether it is cost-efficient to implement an AGV system based on the expected prices for an airport.<br/><br/>This research can be further improved by analyzing the effect of using AGVs on different airports and by testing more cases for AAS using up-to-date data. Another suggestion would be to decrease the computational time of the model to make it more user friendly to use for further research.<br","AGV routing; Aircraft taxiing; MILP; AAS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, enforcing global continuity produces computationally expensive optimization problems. This thesis presents a distributed approach, using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), to reduce the complexity of the B-Coefficients’ estimation. ADMM decouples the simplotopes, and introduces coupling coefficients to enforce global continuity, resulting in a parallel estimation algorithm whose complexity is depending solely on the partition size, being independent of refinement of the model tessellation. Results show that for a 3D model, the distributed algorithm converges steadily to the global solution with a good approximation accuracy after a few hundred iterations. Validation results of the distributed approach were similar to those of the global optimal solution for various noise intensities, and the continuity constraints were satisfied with maximum mismatches below 10-4. The distributed approach has been used to construct a first order continuous aerodynamic model for the ICE aircraft, which has been implemented in Simulink, and proven to perform well compared to the original model.","Simplex B-Splines; Simplotope B-Splines; Distributed Optimization; Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers; Innovative Control Effectors; Aerodynamic Model Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the Netherlands this amount is already growing to 1 out of 5 people suffering from dementia. This is due to better diagnosis and the aging generation. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, there still has not been found a solution to cure this disease. This means that a closer look should be taken in how the wellbeing of patients with dementia could be improved to make sure that this last part of their life is experienced with no feeling of insecurity or fear. Therefore the aim of this project was to improve quality of life of patients with dementia, by design. This was done for nursing home patients with dementia that lived intramurally. <br/><br/>During analysis, three patient groups were found that defined the different type of patients with dementia: Wanderers, Zen dementing and Equilibrium seekers. By creating a patient journey from these different types of patients, together with a journey of formal caregivers, it was found that wanderers get restless just after lunch break because of the decrease in stimuli in the environment. From this it was decided to design for this specific patient group and try to provide them with a meaningful activity. Therefore the design goal of this project was: Improving Quality of life for patients with dementia, by designing a product (-service) that facilitates meaningful time spent. A meaningful activity is something that could provide the patient with a feeling of contributing something, how the patient feels with the process and involvement of the activity or how the patient stays connect with who they were in the past ( e.g. reminiscence). <br/><br/>My favourite is a product that helps patients to calm down by providing the patient with 2 or 3 stimuli. <br/>The product is designed in such a way, that the shape giving the feeling of holding a baby or pet, due to the intuitive shape.

However, the current way in which KLM introduces its products to its customers is not aligned with this vision. This misalignment can reduce the company’s performance in relation to other airlines that compete in the same market. Therefore, the problem definition was stated as: “KLM needs to improve the way its products are introduced to its customers so it matches the company’s vision of customer intimacy”. The term products in this problem statement refers to ancillaries, which are a great source of revenue and at the same time help travellers to create their own experiences. In order to solve this problem, the research questions for this project are formulated as follows: <br/>“How can KLM digital offer its products in the most relevant way to its customers?”<br/>“Which elements should be considered to create an offer?<br/>Analysis<br/>The variety of topics explored during the internal and external analysis is very diverse, but all of them provided valuable insights. The exploration of the context revealed that airlines will increase the control over its own products which will be merchandised in order to be differentiated. Merchandising means that products are promoted in a way that are more attractive to customers instead of only being displayed. Regarding ancillaries, there are six main areas that can be merchandised: offer, price, channel/device, time and place, communication, and offering technique. In addition, bundling is a relevant offering technique which is closer to KLM’s customer intimacy goal due to travellers’ high interest in it. For this reason, this offering technique is further explored by reviewing relevant literature and it is also tested during the research phase.<br/>Research<br/>The research phase has three main objectives: first of all, find out if customers really see ancillary bundles as an interesting product and if they are willing to buy them, which factors have an effect in their purchase intention, and which combination of factors creates the most relevant ancillary bundle offer for customers. <br/>Proposal<br/>All the knowledge gained during the analysis and research is combined during this phase in order to create the most relevant combination of products for travellers. The insights are clustered according to six different areas: offering technique, offer, touchpoint, channel/device, communication, and target and they have been put together in the following model.<br/>Implementation<br/>The ideal situation would be to deliver a personalised and consistent ancillary offer to each customer in order to enrich the overall KLM customer experience.

This type of MRI scanner has many advantages, but a downside is the amount of noise in the obtained images. A way to reduce noise is diffusion filtering. This thesis discusses the theory of some linear and nonlinear diffusion filtering methods and tests them on several test problems. The methods range from the basic linear method, the heat equation, to the more advanced Perona-Malik method. The results indeed show that the Perona-Malik method generates better results, sometimes when combined with a Gaussian kernel to decrease its ill-posedness.<br/>Two numerical methods have been compared for these anisotropic diffusion filtering methods: the Forward Time, Central Space method and the Additive Operator Splitting method. The advantage of the AOS method is the unconditional stability for al positive time step sizes, while FTCS implementation is only stable for time steps smaller than 0.25. The results for the AOS method were also slightly better than for the FTCS method and almost never lead to instability. The FTCS method showed instability more often.<br/>The parameter choice is of significant importance for the outcome. Several options for determining the gradient threshold parameter K, time step size and stopping time S have been investigated. A new estimation for the time step size and stopping time S have been proposed and compared. The results are images with good visual quality for both introduced methods. Also, an adaptive time step has been tested to overcome the instability for unstable methods and this seems to be succesful.<br/>Lastly, region growing segmentation has been applied to images obtained with the proposed stopping time S. Segmentation is an additional way to investigate the quality of these outcomes. For most test problems the partitioning resembles the partitioning of the original image.<br/>However, choosing certain parameters stays a challenge and can be of interest for further examination. It also remains a goal to investigate the discussed methods on data obtained with the actual TUD/LUMC MRI scanner.<br","anisotropic; diffusion; filtering; Imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has wide applications in diverse industries viz. metallurgy, atomic energy, electronics, communication, space, military, insulation, biomechanical appliances etc. It is preferred material for armour protection due to its high strength-weight ratio. Its plastic deformation and failure behavior have, therefore, become a subject of extensive research in the recent past. Consequently, several material models were formulated in the second half of the nineteenth century by researchers such as<br/>Johnson- Holumquist, Rajendran-Grove, Deshpande-Evans etc. to study ceramic response under high-velocity impact. But these models are complex and require extensive calibration, while the Drucker-Prager (DP) Model is easy to implement. It was developed for study in soil and rock and is chosen to analyze ceramic quasi-plastic and tensile behaviour as part of research through the current thesis.<br/>Tensile ring and cone cracks, first observed by Hertz, are one of the modes of failure in brittle materials like ceramic. The prime objective of the thesis is the study of ceramic failure as well as cone crack initiation and its propagation through the ceramic body under the influence of varying material parameters such as cohesion, friction angle, dilatancy and softening of ceramics besides confinement by indentation. The Drucker Prager model is employed to study<br/>indentation by simulation through numerical methods in JEM JIVE FEM library. Verification of the model was done through simulation of unit cubes subjected to unidirectional stresses at prescribed displacements. Suitable modification for pressure dependent softening behaviour of the ceramic is also made into the model and simulations undertaken in order to get insight into the nonlinear strength degradation of the ceramic post-elastic limit. Since the DP criterion<br/>tends to overestimate material strength, a suitable mechanism to limit the material strength is integrated with DP yield function and also to facilitate the comparison of results arrived through DP and modified yield functions. <br/>The results obtained by a simulated indentation in accordance with the DP formulation suggest that ceramic having high dilatancy, low friction angle and small softening modulus under confined conditions is more suited for use as armor protection. The pressure dependent softening behavior of ceramic is favorable for it being a good armor protection material. The DP Yield function modified to limit the material strength to a finite value, did not have any significant impact on crack initiation though the zone of compressive plastic strain grew in size during indentation. The DP based numerical model suﬀered from mesh sensitivity. The introduction of viscoplasticity to the numerical model was observed to have a positive influence in mitigating mesh sensitivity.<br/><br","cermics; indentaion; Jem jive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Urban growth is enforcing these trends, resulting in growing problems and reaching limitations to the growth of our economies. In this thesis, these worldwide trends will be challenged in the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The concept of circular economy is used to improve residential waste collection and treatment to close loops and reduce environmental impact. Amsterdam is a fast growing city and has many spatial challenges related to this growth. A new more integrated system for residential waste treatment and collection is needed. In this way, the city can live up to its high circular ambitions and reach their set goals in a short time frame. To conquer these challenges, a link between circular economy and urban design is made. Circular concepts can now be translated to urban systems, creating possibilities for urban integration. In this way, circular economy becomes part of the city, interacts with other systems and circular economy evolves in a economic, social and environmental concept which contributes to sustainable development of our cities in the future. The circular proposals are integrated in Amsterdam, taking into account the great diversity in urban forms and possible connections to existing systems. This all results in a list of recommendations for the municipality on how to improve their vision and continue with their circular ambitions. The main recommendations concluded from this research are:<br/><br/>1. Waste treatment and collection should connect to existing urban systems, creating more support and integration within daily lives.<br/><br/>2. Circular economy does not have just a economic value. Circular waste treatment can contribute to the city, strengthen communities and improve living quality .<br/><br/>3. The value of circular waste treatment needs to experienced by the residents themselves. It will contribute to the motivation and will support a change in disposal behaviour.<br/><br/>4. Separate waste collection should be available for all the residents of Amsterdam. It will require large investments in some parts of the city. However, by making clever use of existing structures, improvement can be made fast and without tremendous costs.","Circular economy; Urban design; Urban metabolism; Systemic design; Urban integration; Residential waste; Sustainable urban development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Smart Cities and Urban Metabolism","52.3717204, 4.9020727"

The mathematical similarities with optimal control theory lead to a new interpretation of economic agents as optimal controllers. Pontryagin's maximum principle generates the necessary conditions, but the economic consequences become clear when its historical development is followed. It is found that the Euler-Lagrange equations result in a no-arbitrage condition in economics, and Hamilton's canonical equations describe the change in asset allocation and the asset price over time. The Hamiltonian itself is equivalent to the economic surplus of the agent, and the maximum principle requires that it is maximized along the optimal trajectory with respect to the control actions. This gives a different, myopic perspective to the economic agent, being an agent that maximizes economic surplus instantaneously instead of utility over an entire planning period.","DCSC; Thesis; Optimal Control; Utility Maximization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

With kerosene being the predominant source used as jet fuel, this increase in air traffic is expected to result in the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels and undesired climate changes on a global scale. Therefore, the industry is currently exploring the electrification of aircraft, taking into account advanced concepts such as more electric aircraft (MEA) and hybrid electric propulsion systems (HEPS). This thesis addresses a combination of these two concepts characterised as an electrically assisted propulsion &amp; power system (EAPPS). This system integrates a conventional turbofan engine with a network of electrical components, providing assistance to the aircraft propulsion and non-propulsive power systems. This secondary electrical system can be activated throughout the flight mission to assist the turbofan engine and increase the overall system efficiency. The amount of electrical power relative to the total power is defined as the power split ratio.<br/>The objective of this study is to evaluate how gradual modifications in this EAPPS affect the overall performance of an Airbus A320neo (new engine option) aircraft in a short-range mission of 1,000 km. The proposed changes include the conversion to an electrical architecture of the non-propulsive power systems, the implementation of a fuel cell system, the installation of photovoltaic panels on the outer skin of the aircraft and the downscaling of the turbofan engine. To analyse these effects accordingly, two separate simulation models were developed within the MATLAB environment to perform and verify a series of trade studies at two different time frames: near future (2020+) and far future (2040+).<br/>The results revealed that each modification has proven to be advantageous in terms of overall fuel and energy consumption; however, turning the A320neo into a MEA is the most effective approach. The inclusion of fuel cell and photovoltaic systems brings minor benefits, but also increases the complexity of the system. Nonetheless, the derived optimal setups for the 2020+ and 2040+ scenarios feature all modifications, but with a different power management strategy and engine scaling.<br/>The optimal power management strategy for 2020+ includes fully electric taxiing, a take-off power split of 17%, a climb power split of 9% and a downscaled engine of 90%. Compared to the conventional A320neo, this setup will lower the fuel and energy consumption by 17% and 13%, correspondingly. Also, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced by 16%. By 2040+, the optimal take-off power split increases to 26% and the climb power split to 43%. This allows the CFM LEAP-1A engine to be scaled down to 85%. The total relative savings of fuel, energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions equal 28%, 18% and 27%, respectively. The impact of the projected technological development in a time period of 20 years, from 2020+ to 2040+, is witnessed through the increased use of electrically assisted propulsion and significant greater amounts saved with respect to fuel, energy and engine emissions.<br","aircraft flight performance; battery system optimisation; commercial aviation; EAPPS; electrically assisted propulsion and power systems; electric propulsion; environmental impact assessment; fuel cells; gas turbines; HEPS; hybrid electric propulsion; non-propulsive power systems; photovoltaics; power management strategy; sustainability; system modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-04-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In an annealing line cold rolled steel is heated to 973 K and cooled down again to change the properties of the steel. In the heat pipe assisted annealing project the cooling line is thermally connected to the heating line via heat pipes. A heat pipe is a closed cylinder which is partly filled with a liquid. Heat pipes are very effective heat transfer devices, due to evaporation of the liquid at one side of the heat pipe and condensation of the vapour at the other side of the heat pipe. Due to rotation and a head, liquid will return to the evaporator side of the heat pipe. Applying heat pipes in a continuous annealing line could lead to energy savings up to 70%.<br/>The TU Delft rotating heat pipe setup is in development for testing the performance of organic working fluids in heat pipes and validation of models, for the temperature range from 423 K to 723 K. The goal of this thesis is described as: finishing the development of the TU Delft rotating heat pipe setup and use this test setup to validate the developed model. This goal was divided into several objectives.<br/>An investigation was made of what has to be done before the commissioning of the setup. It was discovered that the heat input calculation is overestimated, because insulation is not taken into account. Therefore, a new calculation was made. It is concluded that in the worst case scenario 1155 W of heat input is needed. Also, the available band heaters could not be used, therefore IR heating with quartz lamps has been considered. A calculation was made to confirm if they will provide enough power to meet the requirements of the setup. It is concluded that six quartz lamps with an effective heating length of 165 mm will provide enough power. In the fill ratio calculation, it is learned that non-annular flow is beneficial for the heat transfer compared to annular flow. Also, it was decided to fill the heat pipe with 35 grams of Dowtherm A as a start. With this amount of fluid, it is possible to operate the heat in both flow patterns over the whole temperature range. Last, it is concluded that bearing cooling is needed.<br/>Another objective was to select the required data acquisition hardware and program the required software for control and data acquisition. A compactRIO from National Instruments is selected together with several modules. This configuration is able to process all the signals and has extra capacity to handle more signals in the future. A LabVIEW program was designed to control the Delft setup. This program meets all the requirements. It has been tested with dummy signals and during a leakage test with the actual heat pipe.<br/>A model which represents the actual Delft rotating heat pipe setup has been made. The same inputs as in the Delft setup can be adjusted. This model has been developed as a network model. These types of models are often used because of their reasonably accurate and practically simple way to model transient heat pipe analysis. This model was validated with two different papers. In the first paper, an experiment is performed with a stainless steel ammonia heat pipe, which operates in non-annular flow. The data of this paper is only useful for steady state. At the steady state part, the maximum deviation is 0.96 K. In the second paper, a copper-water heat pipe is used. This heat pipe is not rotating, but has a wick. This means its behaviour is similar to a rotating heat pipe with annular flow. The data of this paper is very precise and shown in tabular form at three different points at 4 time stamps. The root-mean-square error between the experiment and the model at all data points is 0.36 K.<br/>The commissioning of the heat pipe is in progress now. When all the safety procedures are checked, the experiments can be conducted.","Heat pipes; Annealing; Experiment setup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Rotterdam, with one of the largest port city in the Netherlands, is an example. Rotterdam is a dynamic world port and has a century-long tradition of living with water. The tradition of protecting “against and living with water” contributed to the development of the city. The strategic location of Rotterdam in the Dutch delta brought us prosperity and growth. The city grew with their port activities. After the 20th century, the movement of the port towards the sea where the Maastvlakte aroused has left former post-industrial areas abandoned. This change in space and function has accelerated into new opportunities for Rotterdam as a city port. Rotterdam can continuously adapt to new conditions responding to economic and social changes. Thanks to its position in the delta, Rotterdam has a strong international orientation and has a large number of potential financial clusters. Because of this economy, the population number has grown in Rotterdam. Rotterdam as a delta can also face the threat of river floods and storm surges from the seas and heavy rainfall. The City cope with a lot of heavy rain that can affect our health and environment. Due to a changing climate and changing insights concerning sustainable relations between cities and water-landscapes, new interventions will be needed to create a new urban delta-landscape. In addition to safety and better water-systems, in urban delta’s there is a need for stronger spatial identities and new cohesion of cities and their water-landscapes (delta intervention objectives). There is a requirement for Rotterdam to transform into a climate adaptive city to protect itself from floods and water damages. It is a favorite situation to live in or along water environment. Therefore, development of the water-related climate offers excellent opportunities in Rotterdam. This challenge Rotterdam in a correct way of land use planning where public and private stakeholders are involved. New interventions that are needed to create a new urban deltalandscape are mostly planned as an individual tool that lacks in coherency of urban planning strategies in general. Van Veelen (2016) mentioned that there is a lack of research that focuses on actual processes of urban development, management, and change as an essential precondition for a successful implementation of climate adaptation strategies. There can be an integrated approach of climate adaptation in waterfront development and urban renewal. Incorporating adaptation into regular urban development processes can be explained as part of a political process to redistribute responsibilities to lower levels of authority (e.g., city level) and enlarge the role of the private sector (van Veelen, 2016). This part of the research indicate the problems of climate change, waterfront redevelopment and declining neighborhood resulting in a problem statement and a hypothesis for an enhanced integrated approach in the development of common interest between private and public stakeholders.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

A solution for this problem could eventually entail an optimisation in the use and storage of solar energy.<br/><br/>The technology of PVT is very promising in relation to the current energy transition, most certainly as an incentive to foster the use of renewable energy sources and technologies. That is why the development of a PVT system configuration with additional envelope-integration is<br/>treated in this thesis.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this thesis is to expound the energy concept of PVT, its role in the system configuration and its facade-integrational aspects, all this in relation to the application of PVT on a multi-family case study building. The accompanying research question is: How can an energy<br/>concept with PVT be optimised or maximised in terms of renewable energy and be integrated in the envelope of a multi-family building?<br/><br/>In order to give an unambiguous answer to this question, the energy concept of PVT and other relevant technologies will be explained in a literature and background study upfront. This is followed by the description of the case study building. After that, the development of the PVT<br/>output types, configurations and the development of the system configuration and operation modes are discussed. The energy requirements of the multi-family building together with the energy output of the PVT collector results in an energy balance. Finally, the facade-integration<br/>aspects of PVT are described, where the amount of collectors on the roof and in the facade are determined by the energy balance.<br/><br/>It was shown that a PVT collector that is glazed on the top and insulated at the back is the most effective type in the light of this thesis, that is to say in combination with this specific multi-family building. In addition to this, several collectors in series will lead to an effective configuration.<br/>Besides, for an efficient utilisation of the (collected) energy, it is wise to apply low-temperature heating as well as an energy storage in the system configuration. For the integration of PVT into a multi-family building, it is first of all recommended to design a proper layout for the in- and<br/>outcoming distribution pipes. Finally, in order to improve the integrational flexibility, it is advised to introduce multiple dimensions of PVT collectors in the future.","Climate Design; Facade Design; Renewable Energy; Photovoltaic Thermal Collectors; Building Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to adsorption-based generators where the mother nuclide is retained on a static column, in liquid generators both mother and daughter nuclides are in solution and need to be separated via extraction. Microfluidic techniques are promising for the extraction process because mass transfer is very efficient and in theory the laminar two-phase flow in the microchannel can be easily separated at the end.<br/><br/>The generator of interest in this thesis is the W-188/Re-188 generator. However, some work also concerns the chemical similar Mo-99/Tc-99m generator and the Lu-177m/Lu-177 generator. <br/><br/>The start objective was to find a less water miscible replacement for the commonly applied organic phase methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) in the W-188/Re-188 generator, since with this system precipitation was observed previously in the microchannel. Several organic phases have been tested for precipitation, but also for their extraction efficiencies and abilities to separate rhenium from tungsten. The best results were observed for 0.2 M Aliquat 336 in 1,3-diisopropylbenzene, an organic phase that shows no precipitation, has suitable wetting behaviour in the microchannel and an even higher extraction efficiency than MEK. <br/><br/>Another issue addressed in this thesis is the incomplete phase separation at the Y-splitter (end) of the channel. Either some aqueous phase leaves through the organic outlet or some organic phase leaves through the aqueous outlet. One possible reason for the leakage is the uniform surface of both outlets, and therefore the preferred wetting of the hydrophilic glass wall of the microchannel with one phase. Coating one side of the microchannel hydrophobically showed that the leakage can be stopped. The effects of radiation on the coating have been investigated using an external gamma source and a threshold of 5 kGy before deterioration was found.<br/><br/>An even easier method to achieve complete phase separation is the use of a membrane separator. <br/>Here, two phases are combined in simple 0.5 mm tubing in droplet fashion before being separated by a membrane. With the above mentioned organic phase, an extraction efficiency of 95% was reached within 5.3 minutes contact time. This is considerably longer than the typical contact time in the microchannel (in the order of seconds), but the total handling time was reduced from over 3 hours (with a microchannel) to 16 minutes by using a membrane separator. For lutetium, an extraction efficiency of 99% was reached after 2 minutes contact time, reducing the total handling time by a factor of 2.5 compared to the conventional method.<br","microfluidics; liquid-liquid extraction; medical radioisotopes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Hence, it is essential to correctly interpret the soil properties, in order to achieve realistic representations of the in-situ conditions.<br/><br/>To interpret the soil layering at a particular site, the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is commonly used in Groningen. It offers a quick, economical and reliable measurement of ground conditions. However, the CPT-based correlations used to estimate soil properties can constitute a source of uncertainty if not coupled with full-scale testing and laboratory measurements.<br/>The present thesis, thus, deals with the verification and the improvement of two CPT-based correlations used for soil interpretation in Gronigen specifically. The research study focuses on the mathematical models related to the plasticity index (PI) and the undrained shear strength (Su) of soft soils present in Groningen.<br/><br/>A comprehensive database of factual data was compiled in order to group various test types and provide a best-estimate of soil properties for different soil types using geotechnical and stratigraphic considerations. Secondly, a statistical characterisation of data-sets was performed to obtain insight on the correlations performance in relation to the in-situ and laboratory measurements. Based on the outcomes of the statistical comparison, analytical and regression analyses were carried out with the scope of improving the correlation that was deemed to be inadequate. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was executed to investigate the influence of three relevant soil properties on the seismic ground response from a typical soil profile from Groningen. The parameters assessed are: plasticity index (PI), undrained shear strength (Su), and shear wave velocity (Vs).<br/><br/>Results indicate that, among the considered CPT-based correlations, the equation for PI from Cetin and Ozan (2009) is adequate in some cases. The geotechnical units sandy Clay and Loam show good correspondence with the factual data. On the other hand, the PI predicted with such relation tends to be lower than the laboratory measurements for the remaining soil units (e.g. clean Clay, silty Clay, OC Clay). Conversely, the PI behind the models implemented in the NPR 9998 (Bommer et al., 2017a) are in closer agreement to the factual data, however, the<br/>PI from some soil units can be further improved with the findings from the present research.<br/><br/>For the interpretation of Su, the SHANSEP model from Ladd and Foott (1974) is frequently used. The available factual data showed a poor correspondence with the predicted Su values. Therefore, the SHANSEP model was further studied to calibrate its parameters for different soil types. From the available triaxial consolidated undrained laboratory tests, best-estimate of SHANSEP coefficients were obtained for the main soil types (clean, sandy, and silty Clay). New Su values were validated with the in-situ and laboratory measurements. In this context, it is confirmed that the dependency of Su on the overconsolidation ratio (OCR) is crucial. Moreover, the estimation of OCR from CPT measurements (following the Mayne, 2014, procedure) is found to be partially inaccurate within the SHANSEP framework and needs to be studied in more detail.<br/><br/>Engineering aspects related to the topics of the research are discussed and considerations regarding the applicability of the new correlations are provided. Furthermore, the present study gives indications about the usefulness of a number of test types, suggesting direction for future soil investigations. In addition, look-uptables for PI and Su, based on the outcomes of the present research, are provided as part of the recommendations for implementation in the soil parameter interpretation for the Groningen region.<br","CPT-based correlations; Cone Penetration Test; Groningen; Earthquakes; Undrained shear strength; Plasiticity Index; Site Response Analysis; Regression analysis; Triaxial tests; Torvane tests; Atterberg Limits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-11","","","","Civil Engineering","VIIA Groningen","53.2193835, 6.5665018"

The first part of the research focused on identifying the main causes of conflict in Best Value projects. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with fourteen project managers from clients and contractors to understand how conflicts originate and evolve in Best Value projects. The analysis showed two causes of conflict in Best Value projects. (1) The lack of involvement of the client’s client leads to unnecessary process- and technical-related conflicts during the execution phase. Often the conflicts occur after tasks are completed, and the hand-over takes place. (2) Best Value forces the contractors to prove their trustworthiness towards the clients. However, contractors often do not continue to prove their trustworthiness, which makes the client anxious. This will lead to traditional and controlling behaviour. A set of actions was designed to help contractors and clients to prevent conflicts in the execution phase of their Best Value project. The interviews and expert sessions are the input for activities that could be used. These activities were analysed to identify actions for the clients and contractors in Best Value projects. The actions focus on making sure that the client’s departments can be involved in the projects or on building cognition-based trust during the project.","Best Value; Conflicts; Trust; Execution phase; Conflict management; Construction sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The undrained shear strength (su¬), which describes the strength of clay and peat layers, is important information for the macro-stability analysis of a dike. The cone factor (Nc) gives a linear correlation between undrained shear strength (su¬) of the soil and the cone resistance (qc) from a cone penetration test (CPT)¬. In practice the uncertainty on this correlation, given by the variation coefficient, is high, especially it overestimates the su for high values of qc. As a result, a large reduction factor (RF) is taken into account between the expected value of su and the characteristic value of su used in calculations.<br/>In literature the cone factor (Nc) is assumed to depend on the soil stiffness, the cone roughness and the initial soil stress state (∆). Including the initial soil stress state, or more specifically the horizontal soil stresses (σ’h0), in the cone factor determination can lead to a reduction of the variation coefficient. Based on literature and a numerical analysis it is found that including the initial soil stress state in the determination of Nc can lead to a difference of 10% in cone factor. However, the difference is less than 10% for most measures due to the relatively similar stress conditions over a large part of the cross section of a dike. In addition, a theoretical application of the initial soil stress state (Δ) shows that the overestimation of su for high values of qc cannot be solved by including it as found in literature.<br/>A case study on the Hollandse IJsseldijk project has been conducted to back up the theoretical approach with experimental measurements. As a conclusion it is found that the variation coefficient is reduced slightly taking into account the initial horizontal soil stresses, resulting in a decrease of the reduction factor (RF) of 2-3%. Taking this small improvement and remaining unknowns in the calculation into account, it is concluded that including a measure of the in-situ soil stress state (Δ) in the determination of the cone factor (Nc) does not result in a significant reduction of the present uncertainties in dike assessment with existing approaches.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The probabilistic models for the new safety assessment (WBI2017) not only deal with the natural variability, but also with so-called epistemological uncertainties. One class of epistemological uncertainties is the model uncertainty in the hydrodynamic models used. The quantification of the water level uncertainty depends on the dominant hydraulic processes in each water system and is chosen to be independent of the return period. However, water level frequency lines derived including model uncertainty sometimes conflict with the physics. A comparative analysis is carried out to assess the performance of Hydra-NL w.r.t. observations and to analyse if physical processes that play an important role in each fresh water system are represented correctly after the inclusion of model uncertainty with the WBI2017 method. This study showed that the estimated exceedance probability of actual water levels in the tidal river area and lake area are often overestimated by the Hydra-model even without model uncertainty. When model uncertainties are included the overestimations become even larger. Furthermore, the inclusion of model uncertainty sometimes gives an incorrect representation of the underlying physical processes. The effect of the model uncertainty gets larger when the water level frequency line becomes flatter. This is e.g. the case at locations where the water levels are influenced by the closure of the Europoortkering and upstream of the flood channel near Veessen-Wapenveld. It can be argued that water level uncertainties are likely to decrease in these situations, because a reservoir is more predictable than a flowing river and the operation of the flood channel results in an enlarged conveyance that is less sensitive than an average river profile. The hypothesis that the inclusion of model uncertainty according to WBI2017 results in an incorrect representation of the underlying physical processes is further analysed for several case studies in the upper river area and the lake area. Varying river schematisations and two river interventions (flood channel and retention area) are modelled to compare the WBI2017 method with a more physics-based approach. In this physics-based approach the hydraulic roughness of the main channel and/or floodplains is incorporated as additional stochastic variable for the derivation of water level frequency lines. It is shown that the water level uncertainty becomes smaller for wide rivers where the water level frequency line becomes flatter. The cases where river interventions are present the water level uncertainty is bounded, because of the environment/geometry that influences the water levels. According to the physics-based method the water level uncertainties are location and discharge dependent, which are both not integrated in the WBI2017 method. For the lake area the focus is on locations where high water levels are predominantly determined by the wind that is causing a set-up on the lake. By considering an empirical parameter of the ""capped Wu"" formula as additional stochastic variable the uncertainty of the drag coefficient is modelled for the physics-based method. The physics-based method demonstrates that the water level uncertainty is larger for higher decimate heights and vice versa. It can be concluded that it is not valid to choose one uniform standard deviation of the water level for all wind-dominated locations, as it is done for WBI2017. It is recommended to include the model uncertainty by considering a model parameter in the hydrodynamic model for the upper river area and lake area as additional stochastic variable in the Hydra-models, to model uncertainty in the water level. In other water systems it becomes more complex, because several equally important sources of uncertainty are present. Still, the most important model uncertainty sources could considered stochastically, but computational effort would become the limiting factor","model uncertainty; water level frequency lines; WBI2017","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

It was found that the assistance dog vest has three functionality goals for the clients; to show that the dog is an official KNGF Geleidehonden dog, to communicate that the dog should not be distracted, and to explain that the dog is helping the client. However, currently many dogs are often distracted, which is considered as a functionality issue. Furthermore, it was found that the clients have many different physical disabilities often resulting in limited strength in the hands and arms. Because of this, the usability of putting the assistance dog vest on the dog and taking it off is difficult for the clients, because of the bellyband, which is considered as a usability issue. <br/><br/><b>Redesign</b><br/>A redesign was created focussing on solving both the functionality and the usability issue.

Lenticular colour-coded shoulder patches are added to create a distraction and barrier between people and the assistance dog. Furthermore the imprint is chosen to clearly explain the situation. The usability of the assistance dog collar is designed to be suitable for the client, by changing the vest into a collar, in which its functionalities are integrated.

New, innovative business models are needed to enable maintenance and adaptive reuse of heritage buildings in order to finally rebuilding the future.<br/><br/>Objective - This explorative and design-oriented research aims to have insight on the circular redevelopment potential of elements within the existing built environment. This research focused on two central themes, respectively adaptive reuse of societal heritage projects and circular economy. These central themes represent the theoretical framework. The overarching objective was to accelerate a transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy through circular redevelopment.<br/>Methods - This thesis is structured from both an empirical and operational perspective. Literature study is used to summarize prior research, critically examine contributions, explain results of prior research and clarify differences in alternative views of the past. The conclusion extracted from the empirical study will be used as input for the operational model, together with unstructured expert interviews, and a case study research.<br/><br/>Results - The CRP indicator comprises 6 consecutive strategies which are assessed for each component; respectively (1) Reuse, (2) Repair, (3) Refurbish, (4) Remanufacture, (5) Repurpose and finally (6) Recycle. Identifying the degree of circularity starts with the assessment of applied material characteristics (Bill Of Materials) and their relation and interfaces with all elements in the system (Disassembly Determining Factors). By combining this factor with the actual condition on site (NEN 2767), the applicable reutilization potential of an element could be developed. In accordance with the preferred representability of predefined spaces specific components are categorized if applicable. Altogether, this reflects the degree of circularity of a building (Building Circularity Indicator) for a particular intervention.<br/><br/>Conclusion - The CRP Indicator is a useful tool for the assessment of properties to implement circularity during the redevelopment process. Building inspectors can provide property managers/ owners with objective data about the applied material characteristics and corresponding condition status of building elements. It supports principals to identify preconditions, in order to specify their ambition on circularity and provide the sufficient information to actually enable contractors to differentiate from their competitors during tenders. The assessment model is not intended as a certificate or label, however could be used as supportive instrument to substantiate any classification on this matter.","Adaptive reuse; Circular Economy; building circularity indicator; condition assessment; reutilization potential; circular redevelopment; assessment model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Currently, 60% of the vacant offices are structural vacant. Flexibility could be used as an instrument to prevent future vacant office space. The flexibility to change characteristics of a building during its life cycle is called the adaptive capacity of a building. Adaptability can be regarded as way to make the real estate supply more dynamic and better able to cope with demand dynamics (static supply and dynamic demand) and in this way extend the functional lifespan of buildings. The problem is that real estate investors are hardly interested in investing in office buildings to increase the adaptive capacity. Thereby, is the most used financial method the DCF method which is currently insufficiently used to simulate the future uncertainty in an investment in flexibility on the longer term. This aim of this research is to illustrate how to cope with the future uncertainty in a new financial method. By using a stochastic approach with the Decision Tree Analysis the investors could be stimulated to invest in the adaptive capacity of office buildings and increase the adaptive capacity of a building to respond if the functional demand changes.","Adaptivity; Flexibility; Real Estate Investor; Decision Tree Analysis; DCF method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human influence on the planet has reached far beyond safe parameters and could lead to disastrous consequences for large parts of the world. This is attributed to the resource dependency of the current economic system. Resources are taken from the earth and products are made which are quickly disposed of after use. As a result of this ‘linear economy’, increasingly more resources are required to sustain economic growth. However, resources are depleting, leading to rising and volatile resource prices. In the meantime, humanity’s impact on the environment is increasing as well, displayed in the large amounts of pollution and waste that are generated. The need for a new economic system has been expressed and the ‘circular economy’ has been proposed as an alternative model, in which resource use is minimised, waste is prevented and resources are cycled in the economy. Governments, businesses and academia have expressed the desire to move towards a circular economy, but little has been implemented thus far. This graduation project aims to address this issue.<br/><br/><b>Assignment</b><br/>Critical Minds is a project management consultancy. It wanted to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by starting a new consultancy service (Sustainable Minds) to help industrial companies implement circular business models. This graduation project was initiated to answer the need for more research into the process of implementing circular business models at industrial companies and the possibilities for consultancy by Sustainable Minds to facilitate this process. The following research question was created:<br/><br/><b>“How can Sustainable Minds help industrial manufacturing companies bridge the gap between design and implementation in the circular business model innovation process?”<br/></b><br/><b>Research</b><br/>To investigate the research question, three studies were performed: an internal analysis of Critical Minds and Sustainable Minds, external analysis of the circular economy consultancy market and a qualitative interview study of the circular business model implementation process, barriers and success factors. 12 interviews were conducted with companies aspiring to implement a circular business model, with companies that had successfully done so and with experienced circular economy consultants. Changing mindsets was found to be the biggest barrier and successful implementation required the circular business model to be aligned with existing company objectives.<br/><br/><b>Synthesis</b><br/>The insights were synthesised to create a circular implementation strategy and framework for Sustainable Minds. It focuses on breaking the transition to a circular business model down into smaller steps and running a series of implementation projects. It was concluded that clients need help turning circular opportunities into an actionable project proposal. The following design challenge was created: <br/><b>“Design a method and tool for Sustainable Minds to support industrial companies in bridging the circular design-implementation gap by helping them turn a set of circular opportunities into an actionable project proposal.”</b><br/><b>Design</b><br/>To create a design that is in line with the design challenge above, a series of design activities were performed. Two creative sessions were organised, one with 6 design students from TU Delft and one with the Sustainable Minds team. The creative sessions were used to create a rough layout for the design and formed a starting point for the design phase. This layout was then detailed, tested and iterated in a series of 7 design sprints. These iterative sprints were structured using elements of the lean startup: by building, testing and learning. <br/><b>Circular Rollout</b><br/>Circular Rollout is a structured approach that Sustainable Minds can use to help their clients turn circular opportunities into a proposal. It consists of a method, workshop and set of tools. The circular rollout method focuses on setting the right scope for the circular project and creating a project proposal. This proposal can then be pitched to the board and other stakeholders of the client company. The project proposal is created in a circular rollout workshop. Using the circular<br/>rollout toolkit, the workshop is focused on determining the desired scope of the project, comparing three projects, selecting one, determining project actions and creating a Big Hairy Audacious Goal. The toolkit consists of 5 tools: a circular project selector tool, circular project description tool, circular project value tool, circular project challenges tool and circular rollout tool. <br/><b>Validation</b><br/>The Circular Rollout workshop and toolkit were continuously tested in an iterative manner during the design phase of this project and the final design was validated in a usability test with all Sustainable Minds team members. The team members were able to independently use the toolkit and apply it to a case description. The toolkit was evaluated positively and the team members are planning to start using it. However, it is advised to first tested it in a real life implementation project to fully validate its effect.","Circular Economy; Circular Business Model; Implementation; Service; Design; Method; Toolkit; Consultancy; Workshop; Circular Rollout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

One such a possible method is Ocean Thermal Water Production (OTWP). This thesis continues on the innovative concept of the use of OTEC waste water as a cooling fluid for atmospheric water production introduced in previous work. In this thesis, an experimental study on a structured packed bed condenser column is presented. This work was carried out on an experimental OTWP set-up installed in the Process &amp; Energy lab at the Delft University of Technology. Additionally, a numerical Python model was used to investigate the heat transfer and condensation characteristics of the packed bed column. The condenser function of the Python model was used to compare the prediction performances of different mass transfer coefficient and hydraulic correlations. The Python model simulations were compared both to the predictions of Aspen plus, an established chemical process software, and to the experimental results. The correlation by Olujic et al. (1999) was chosen as the most suitable for the transfer rate and hydraulic behavior predictions for the Python condenser model. A mean average error in the mass transfer predictions of 2.5 % and in the hydraulic predictions of 16.9% was reached in relation to the experiments. outperforms the Aspen plus model, that has respective mean average errors for the mass and pressure drop predictions of 9.5% and 13.0 % for the correlation proposed by Rocha et al. (1993). The Python model was extended with functions that calculate the pressure drop over the remaining necessary equipment for an OTWP plant. The aim of the developed model was to predict the processes in the OTWP condenser column and design a pilot-plant. The model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis on a large-scale column. A preliminary economic analysis identified that reducing the diameter of the condenser column reduces the cost of water production but increases the energy requirement. For an OTWP pilot-plant with a production of 25 m3/day, the chosen column diameter of 6.6 m leads to a system energy requirement of 3.5 kWh/m3 and a levelized cost of water production of 8.08 $/m3. Those production costs can be reduced by an optimization study of the full OTWP pilot-plant.","Packed beds; Mass transfer coefficients; Experimental study; Desalination; Condensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-09","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The project is commissioned by boardsport lifestyle brand Brunotti.<br/><br/><b>Project goal</b><br/>The many differences between Brunotti’s two product collections (boardsport hardware and boardsport lifestyle apparel) imply brand inconsistencies. This project aims to reveal these inconsistencies and, accordingly, propose a strategy that (1) helps eliminating the inconsistencies and (2) helps gaining competitive advantage.<br/><br/><b>Literary substantiation</b><br/>Literature confirms the importance of consistency for Brunotti by supporting that offering a wide variety of products has a positive effect on a brand’s perception, but only if the overall message it embodies is consistent. Besides a brand’s effort to convey a certain message, the customers’ character proves to play an important role in how a brand is perceived and, as a result, how likely they are to accept brand extensions.<br/><br/><b>Brand analysis</b><br/>The message that Brunotti wants to convey can be traced back to its origin in many ways, despite the several major operational changes that the company has gone through. Whereas the brand was founded from a single man’s (Claudio Brunotti) passion for windsurfing, it is now an internationally well-established corporate. Despite this large transformation, Brunotti stayed close to Claudio’s love for boardsports and sense for fashion design and high-quality products.<br/><br/>At the very core of Brunotti’s intended message are the values ‘Authentic’, ‘Active’, and ‘Innovative’. ‘Authenticity’ embodies the brand’s rich heritage, ‘Active’ embodies the boardsport lifestyle that the brand propagates, and ‘Innovative’ embodies the aim for technical products that set new standards. Secondly, at the core of Brunotti’s identity is the philosophy ‘No Matter The Conditions’. The philosophy calls to embrace the forces of the elements, the ever-changing weather conditions and unpredictable seasons. The third important part of Brunotti’s intended message is the brand’s desire of becoming a more premium brand. Being an premium brand typically means being well-known, taking position in the high-end of the market and conveying high-quality.<br/><br/><b>Brand perception analysis</b><br/>A quantitative research among Brunotti’s (potential) hardware and apparel customers is conducted in the form of an online questionnaire. The research is setup to reveal the gaps between Brunotti’s intended and the perceived message. Thus, it aims to disclose inconsistencies in what Brunotti wants to be and what they are in the eyes of the customer. Somewhat 200 responses reveal that the most critical inconsistencies (gaps) between Brunotti’s intended and perceived identity do not occur between the two customer segments (hardware and apparel), nor between the perception of the two product collections (hardware and apparel). The most critical gaps occur between the customers’ overall perception and Brunotti’s intentions in term of:<br/><br/><b>Quality</b>. The perceived quality is not low, but still consistently lower than intended. To reach a premium brand status, a higher perceived quality is desirable.<br/><b>Innovative character</b>. The brand Brunotti and its products are perceived as far less innovative than intended. Being one of Brunotti’s core values, this sense of innovativeness needs to become much stronger in the minds of the customer.<br/><b>Philosophy</b>. The brand perception analysis indicates a lower association with reliability and honesty than intended. This denotes a mismatch with Brunotti’s philosophy to support their customers ‘No Matter The Conditions’.<br/><br/><b>The Solution Space</b><br/>The solutions to closing the identified gaps are to exist in the solution space that derived from the brand perception analysis. This virtual space is where high quality and innovative product features, that are applicable to Brunotti hardware- and apparel products, support their customers’ lifestyle ‘No Matter The Conditions’. Hereto, over a hundred boardsport lifestyle pains are identified in an exploratory session with four boardsport practitioners. To come up with innovative solutions for these pains, smart materials served as input for several creative problem-solving sessions. The ‘No Matter The Conditions’ philosophy is the final piece to the puzzle. From this philosophy, the ‘Embrace the Elements’ strategy emerged. The ‘Embrace the Elements’ strategy employs the four basic elements (sun, air, earth and water) to classify, not only the proposed product features, but also Brunotti’s products, and the boardsports that are the very reason for existence of the brand. In this way, Brunotti conveys a consistent message on all three levels, namely;<br/><br/><b>Product-feature ideas</b><br/>The strategy is employable to the brand-core-, and product-level through mere classification. How the strategy is employable on a product-feature level becomes concrete in the ideation phase of this project. A large number of - element - product feature ideas proved the versatility of the ‘Embrace the Element’ strategy. Some ideas are of course better than others. Therefore, a selection is made together with Brunotti’s Head of Design and Development Director. Moreover, one of the selected ideas is brought into a further stage of development and prototyped as a real-life showcase of the strategy’s capability of driving innovation.<br/><br/><b>Strategic implementation</b><br/>The applicability of the features to both product collections and planning are of great importance for the strategic implementation. An overview of the features’ applicability (to hardware and apparel products) helps showcasing their suitability for creating consistency throughout Brunotti’s product portfolio. Depending on the complexity of the idea and the readiness of the technology it holds, some ideas can be put to market quicker than others. Subsequently, a product feature-introduction-planning is proposed. Keeping Brunotti’s minimal develop period in mind, the first ‘Embrace the Elements’ strategy’s product features can be introduced to the market in 2020.<br/><br/><b>Product-feature showcase</b><br/>A prototype of an integrated vacuum compartment in a Brunotti trolley, that allows users to take more luggage, showcases an ‘air’-class innovative product. It showcases the strategy’s capability of driving innovation. Moreover, the prototype allows Brunotti to communicate the idea to manufacturers, and thus accelerates the development process.<br/><br/><b>Finalisation</b><br/>The report concludes with a confident note on the ‘Embrace the Elements’ strategy’s capability of achieving the project’s goals, depending on how well the strategy is implemented. It than gives some recommendation on the first steps to take for this implementation. Though some limitations in the research’ setup and distribution, and strategy’s implementation are identified, there is no reason to assume that they cancel out the value of the project’s outcomes.","Strategy; Strategic Design; Innovation; Product design; Brand Strategy; Brand driven innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Plettenburg, D.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The restoration of the walking function of paraplegic patients requires long and extensive training. Physicians themselves are not able to provide this training due to the physical labour required. Robots and soft exoskeletons are in development to assist the physicians in this task, however, they are either bulky and restrictive or lack a method to actuate the knee joint. This research explores if a hydraulic system with elastic element is able to actuate a human knee joint during gait training.<br/>The hydraulic system is required to provide a torque of 75Nm with a bandwidth of 4Hz, the large force bandwidth, and a torque of 20Nm over a bandwidth of 12Hz, the small force bandwidth. The system must fit on a knee joint and impose the least amount of restrictions on the patient. Concepts that were identified as possible solutions in a previous literature review included a hydrostatic transmission, a system with a master rotary pump and a rotary slave actuator, a dual-acting hydraulic cylinder, and a master slave hydraulic cylinder system. Preliminary open loop simulation results suggest that the Hydrostatic transmission could give better performance in Torque transmission, size, and complexity. The bandwidth performance for both concepts was equal.<br/>The simulation model of the hydrostatic concept is expanded to include DC motor/driver dynamics, knee dynamics in swing phase, and ground reaction forces in stance phase. A physical test bed is designed to evaluate the simulation results with a real-world counterpart.<br/>Open loop and closed loop with PI controller results showed a significant decrease in the output torque magnitude for the real-world system, up to a factor 13 smaller. The output torque is decreased by the higher friction, slow pressure build-up and leakages in the real-world system. These factors are in part caused by the design choices made for the test bed design, such as the over-the-counter parts and usage of a 3D printed spring. Failure of the spring was observed at high torque and low frequency input signal. This was made worse by the large initial overshoot of the system in the closed loop tests. A more precise control scheme than the PI controller should be designed to prevent breakage. The real-world system is stable and the bandwidth of the system was larger than the 4Hz that is required for the application. For future research a smaller custom hydraulic loop will need to be created to alleviate the friction and leakage issues. Only then will a hydraulic system with series elastic element actuate a human knee to help a paraplegic patient walk again.","Exoskeleton; actuation; simulated model; model validation; knee; gait training; Hydraulic Actuation; series elastic element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

A simulation model of this Baggage Robot Concept is developed to evaluate the performance of this concept in the sorting process of a baggage handling system at medium-sized regional airports. The research identified that the most important design elements for the Baggage Robot Concept are the number of robots and the floor layout configuration. The Baggage Robot Concept turns out to be a feasible concept. An important design choice that is identified in the research is the trade-off between manoeuvre space of robots and the location of charging and storage positions. This study has been a first exploration in integrating autonomous robot systems in baggage handling systems, contributing to future proof and cost efficient operations.","Baggage Handling System; Autonomous Transport Robots; Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation; Sorting Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Asteroid exploration is a new booming field for planetary sciences and space engineering. This navigation study deals with the first characterisation of the binary asteroid system, Didymos, for ESA's AIM mission. In particular, it tackles the estimation of its highly-uncertain environment and the scale-factor indetermination problem. <br/><br/>Previous asteroid missions, such as NEAR-Shoemaker and Hayabusa, solved the scale-factor indetermination using ranging instruments while Rosetta combined simultaneous optical navigation and radiometry to solve for it. However, the imposed low-budget character of AIM makes both of these solutions impracticable; radiometry is only gathered when SC-ground communications are established while the fixed navigation camera and the non-steerable high-gain antenna (HGA) prevent the possibility of simultaneous optical and radiometric data. New navigation strategies are studied to effectively solve the proposed problem without incurring into higher operational costs that outweigh the initial system savings.<br/><br/>A GNC simulator was designed to test the behaviour of orbit determination (OD) methods used at ground control centres involving high-precision filtering techniques and realistic measurements models developed on projects for ESA, including a landmark matching model for image processing. Compromise navigation strategies were found, where the OD is first carried out by the sole use of radiometric measurements. These carry information on distances, although referenced to Earth, whereas optical measurements only provide angular information. Then, landmark matching navigation techniques are incorporated to refine the orbit solution and obtain the most precise characterisation of the system, including the landmarks position knowledge.<br/><br/>Results show a difference in magnitude between the along and cross-track directions and the radial direction, caused by the lack of information along the line-of-sight of the optical measurements, which cannot be removed, A weak correlation was found for the relative position of the Earth and the Sun, implying a good level of independence on the simulated scenario's epoch. Manoeuvre execution errors were found to directly drive the performance of the GNC. The inclusion of either a steerable HGA or an altimeter is seen to improve equally the navigation performance.<br/><br/>Taking into account all these considerations, a final navigation strategy that tackles both operational constraints and mission design is proposed. These recommendations and analyses can serve as a starting point for any further asteroid-navigation assessments, in particular, for the newly proposed HERA mission.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

During the wet season, typically from late December until late April or early May, multiple floods per week can occur. Mainly the excessive rainfall in combination with high tide penetrating into the city results in a high flood risk, but some flood-prone areas can also flood in case of spring tide only.<br/>The main objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of reducing pluvial and coastal flooding in urban areas by constructing a (semi-permanent) barrier in a sea branch, which retains the incoming tide and creates storage for excessive rainfall. In addition, local storage areas spread over the city are considered to delay stormwater runoff into the sea branches. Based on a system analysis and by numerical modelling, several closure locations and their effects are assessed.<br/>Temporary storage of stormwater behind a barrier in a sea branch is a suitable solution to prevent both coastal and pluvial flooding. Based on the results of this research and possible locations of the barriers, a combination of three selected barriers is most opportune, because all catchment areas adjacent to a sea branch can drain their stormwater in a closed-off part behind one of these barriers. In order for these barriers to be effective, they must be closed during low tide prior to heavy rainfall. All three barriers are able to withhold the stormwater volume from their corresponding catchment areas during a 10-year design rainfall event. Even in the event of the highest possible water level during low tide, being neap tide in combination with the storm surge of El Niño, the storage capacities are sufficiently large. Besides the large-scale and small-scale solutions that are currently considered by the local authorities, they are advised to also consider the intermediate-scale solution presented in this study.<br/>Local stormwater storage in the form of water squares in parks and playgrounds is a small-scale solution to reduce pluvial flooding. The storage capacity of these areas is much smaller than the storage capacity behind a barrier, but it is a solution for low-lying urban areas that are not adjacent to a sea branch or river. When the storage capacity of parks and playgrounds in some catchment areas is not sufficient, underground storage basins can also be considered as local storage areas.<br/>The local authorities are advised to set up regulations on return periods for designing flood risk-reducing structures and to assess the economic losses of floods in urban areas, in order to be able to estimate the acceptable cost of these structures.<br","Guayaquil; flood prevention; stormwater; tide; barrier; storage","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","MP235","-2.1, -80.0"

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an important part of machine learning applications in areas such as object recognition and detection. In this thesis we will explore how we can implement CNNs on the ρ-VEX processor and what can be done to optimize the performance. <br/><br/>The ρ-VEX processor is a VLIW processor that was developed at the Delft University of Technology and that can be reconfigured during runtime to take advantage of Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) and Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) in an application. In this work we have developed a streaming pipeline in a simulator consisting of multiple 8-issue ρ-VEX cores connected with memory buffers. This pipeline was designed to execute CNN inference and take advantage of the overlapped execution to increase throughput. Furthermore, as each ρ-VEX core can be configured to operate in a one core, two core or four core mode based on available ILP and TLP, we can adapt the processor based on the current operation being executed and the amount of parallelism that is available.<br/><br/>By generating the required code from a high-level description of the CNN, it becomes straightforward to test multiple configurations of the pipeline and determine which creates the best performance. The implementation was subsequently tested using a simple network trained on the MNIST dataset. <br/><br/>By dividing the workload of the convolutional layers over multiple contexts to take advantage of data-level parallelism, we improved the latency by 3.03x and the throughput by 3.14x in simulation. By creating a pipeline of six cores in a single context configuration in the simulator, we achieved a throughput increase of 1.77x. A hardware implementation of the pipeline was also synthesized for a Virtex-6 FPGA, consisting of four 2-issue ρ-VEX cores at a clock speed of 200 MHz. We subsequently propose several optimizations to increase performance of CNN inference on the ρ-VEX architecture.","Convolutional Neural Networks; rVEX; Streaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

These cracks occur due to the cyclic stresses induced by the waves causing premature failure. Monitoring these fatigue cracks using a wireless system gives the opportunity to guarantee the integrity of the structure without manual inspection, making this a safer way of inspection. In addition, inspection is very costly due to the man hours and because of the fact that the locations of fatigue cracks are mostly not easily accessible. Also, visual evaluation of the crack length can be difficult to assess, which could result in early retirement of structures or unnecessary and costly maintenance.<br/><br/>A wireless crack monitoring system based on the Self Magnetic Flux Leakage (SMFL) method could be a solution for this problem. This method suggests that the ferromagnetic material is passively magnetized by the Earth’s magnetic field and the magnetic signal changes when a crack appears in the material. The measured data is sent wirelessly to the control room of the marine structure. Here, the data can be assessed to determine the size of the fatigue crack. With this information, it can be decided what course of action should be taken to ensure the integrity of the marine structure as long as possible. This will result in a safer way of working and being economically more efficient.<br/><br/>For accurate crack sizing, the SMFL must be interpreted correctly. During cyclic loading the stresses in the material change, affecting the magnetic signal. This is called the stress-induced magnetization. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of stress-induced magnetization on the SMFL in the stress concentration zone of a structural steel plate, and its implications for crack monitoring by the SMFL method.<br/><br/>The measured stress magnetization curves are obtained by means of an experiment. In this experiment, a steel plate with an elliptical hole is cyclically loaded up to the yield stress. The magnetic signal is measured in a grid around the hole. The results show a maximum variation of 25 µT. Depending on the application, the stress-induced magnetization may need to be considered for the interpretation of the measured signals for crack monitoring using the SMFL method.<br/><br","Crack monitoring; Self Magnetic Flux Leakage; Stress magnetization; ferromagnetic steel; cyclic loading; stress concentration zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-05","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In Figure 1 an abstract overview is shown of the project process, consisting of three main phases. <br/><br/>Fatboy is a Dutch design brand that provides accent furniture products which bring more (fun) to living. The company is especially known for its colourful and iconic bean bags. Besides these textile lounging products their relative younger lighting category especially distinguishes itself from other brands with portable and simplistic designed lamps. The products are playful and flexible in use, while iconic and simple in shape. <br/><br/>When looking at the future of the lighting market an important aspect is the shift in the functioning of light. For years the functioning and experience of light was mainly evaluated on its visual performance. Only recently researchers realized that light can accomplish a certain atmosphere and therefore affect people in their mood and emotions. Furthermore the development of LED technology creates new possibilities for this, by making light for instance smart and adjustable in colour. Besides the development in the connected lighting market, LEDs are also boosting the innovation in embedded lighting. The miniaturization of electrical components, results in LEDs the size of 1 mm2. This makes it possible to integrate light sources in flexible structures and architectural materials. <br/><br/>The future context of living was mainly defined by the population growth and urbanization trend. More people are moving towards big cities, which results in smaller living spaces. Furthermore the trend of small and compact living is also driven by the environmental awareness and mindful living. Experiences are becoming more important than the possession of physical objects. Furthermore the Danish hygge principle showed that there is a desire for experiencing more nostalgic and cosy moments of togetherness. Especially in a world where people are surrounded by technologies and distractions, there is the desire to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. For these reasons it was considered important for the new lighting product to be: flexible, sustainable, atmospheric and personal. <br/><br/>According to the Vision in Product (ViP) design method, a vision was created to form an inspiring basis for the conceptualisation phase. The statement was defined as: “I want to enable people to enjoy the simple pleasures (together) by creating a cosy atmosphere in a flexible way”. From this a few main product qualities were defined as: playful, affectionate, care-free and supportive. <br/><br/>With the vision as starting point ideas were generated, which resulted in various key ideas. From these ideas new insights were gained and a new focus was created. The flexibility in the use of the product is of great importance in this project. Therefore the concept should leave room for the personal interpretation of the user. The light experience is focussed on moments of cosiness and relaxation. Furthermore the interaction with the product especially should be playful and intuitive. Eventually it was decided to focus on ideas in which the combination of textile and light is the essence. The use of textile makes it possible to create flexibility in the lighting product, but the tactility of textile also refers to cosiness and comfort. Furthermore it creates a direct connection between the Fatboy product categories. <br/><br/>Further literature research was done on the integration of LEDs in textile (products). Different technological principles with supporting product examples were explored, that resulted in concept directions which were tested with material experiments. To maintain a low tech, simplistic and friendly experience of the product, which is important for the connection to the Fatboy design language, it was decided to integrate the LEDs underneath the textile. In this way the light experience becomes a surprising element in the design. The LEDs are connected to another textile material with the use of conductive yarn, which maintains the flexibility of the product. Furthermore it was decided to make use of a light pattern, which creates a natural, playful and cosy experience of light.<br/><br/>The essence of the idea is that the flexible lighting product shaped like a small slightly thicker blanket boosts the relaxing atmosphere at home. Due to its flexibility it is possible to bring the light close, even on soft unstable but comforting places like the couch or the bed. With the warm and soft light pattern an instant cosy atmosphere can be created. Furthermore with the looped rope makes it still possible to hang the product somewhere. <br/><br/>The final form of the product was inspired by the shape of an animal skin rug, which is playful but also refers to the cosy elements of the hygge principle. The product exists of a sleeve, an electronic inner part and some accessories like the rope. The embodiment of these parts were defined by their materials, measurements and manufacturing principles. <br/><br/>A working prototype was made and tested with participants on the qualities that were defined in the design vision. There was concluded that the product is validated on these different aspects. Some more qualitative insights were also gained from the making and testing of the product which resulted in recommendations for the further development of the product.","Lighting; Product design; Aesthetic Experience; E-textile; LED; Vision in Product Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As recent developments focus on reducing the impact by operational energy (OE) (heating, cooling, hot water and ventilation during use phase), impact by the embodied energy (EE) (production, construction, maintenance and demolition of materials) becomes increasingly significant. Structural materials account for the biggest part of embodied carbon (EC) in buildings. The number of studies that address the environmental impact of high-rise building structures has grown only recently, research is still limited. Moreover, it is doubtful to which extent these researches are applicable to the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to provide insight in the environmental impact of structural systems for high-rise buildings of 150, 200 and 250 meters in the Netherlands. Five different stability and three floor different systems were designed in cast-in-situ concrete, prefab concrete and steel. All of the models contained a concrete core. 2-dimensional static linear calculations were performed in order to determine the cross-sections and reinforcement.<br/><br/>Through parametric modelling, an automated design and analysis work-flow was developed and a total number of 146 models was assessed. The environmental impact was calculated by using the fast track life-cycle analysis (LCA) method. A cradle-to-gate analysis (production phase only, A1-3) was performed by using data from the Nationale Milieu Database (National Environmental Database) (NMD) and steel data from Bouwen met Staal, which contain the environmental impact for multiple impact categories, measured in environmental cost (shadow price). The construction and demolition phases were left out of scope.<br/><br/>It was found that all steel structures had a 6% to 35% higher cradle-to-gate environmental impact compared to concrete structures with the same stability and floor system. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the cradle-to-gate impacts of cast-in-situ and prefab concrete models. Differences in impact between the materials are likely to be affected by inclusion of the construction phase (A4-5) and foundation structure. It is expected that the gap in environmental impact between steel and concrete is reduced by inclusion of these aspects. Floors were responsible for 32% up to 73% of the total environmental impact.<br/><br/>Regarding the stability systems, results showed that, when subjected to wind loads, systems with axially loaded elements scored significantly better than systems with elements loaded in bending. The outrigger structure decreased the total environmental impact of the concrete models by 5% to 16% and 20% to 26% of the steel models, compared to the tube structure. The braced tube only decreased the impact for the 200 and 250 meter models, with 7% to 12%, compared to the tube structures. The diagrid structure had the best performance at all heights and reduced the environmental impact by 17% to 28% for concrete and 28% to 41% for steel models, compared to the tube structures.","Sustainability; Structural Design; sustainable structural design; high-rise buildings; Life Cycle Assessment; parametric approach; Parametric design; embodied energy; stability system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rowing together has no clear-cut definition. However, it is known that each rower has his or her own style, which can be registered in movement patterns and force curves. The big question is how to combine these individual styles such that the crew works together in the best way. The Dutch Rowing Federation showed interest in this topic, wanting to know how to adjust the rigging dimensions of the boat to allow the best racing performance. The goal of this thesis is to provide advice on what features of the rowing stroke should be synchronized and whether and how this could be promoted by individualized rigging.<br/><br/>The theoretical foundation for this study was a literature study about the current knowledge on the rowing stroke and differences within and between individuals and crews. Current used measures on performance and synchronization of rowers were described, and finally a proposal was done for which methods to use in the ongoing of the study.<br/><br/>Data was obtained from five female athletes of elite level, doing trials in a quadruple sculls of approximately 30 seconds at 30 SPM and 32 SPM in four different combinations. The strokes were identified and analyzed, based on performance and synchronization measures. Performance measured as Average Speed, Work per Stroke, Blade Losses, Velocity Fluctuation Losses and their respective and combined efficiencies. Synchronization measures were defined as Mean Standard Deviation of the Phase, Standard Deviation of the Time to Half Impulse and Standard Deviation of the Time to Half Work.<br/><br/>The chosen synchronization measures were not completely independent. Standard deviations of time to half impulse and half work were found to be highly similar (r = 0.970). An opposite effect was found between kinematic synchronization and the other two, Mean Standard deviation of the Phase was not in line with the empirical rule that better synchronization leads to better performance. The kinetic and energetic measures did show this effect: Lower standard deviations of time to half impulse and time to half work meant higher average speed (r = −0.193) and higher Work per Stroke (r = −0.574).<br/><br/>The best performing synchronization measure was time to half impulse synchrony. A drawback on this measure was that the sampling period was long, compared to the interpolated time differences. Athletes were found to achieve their half impulse moments in a consistent order.<br/><br/>To find out whether it is possible to promote synchronization and thus performance by individualizing rigging, the oar angles at the time to half impulse were analyzed. This new measure correlated moderately (r = 0.624), meaning it quantifies more or less the same effect. The kinetic similarity actually worked better (r = −0.292 with Average Speed and r = −0.748 with Work per Stroke) than the synchronization measure.<br/><br/>Similarity of half impulse angles enables the coach to adjust the rigging such that the timing should improve too. However, this should be tested in a follow-up study.","Rowing; Synchronization; Interaction; Kinetics; Performance; Crew; work; Speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design | Sports Engineering","",""

Relations should be reinvented, and incentives for market parties should be created to invest early in the development process.","Housing Production; Housing Systems; Mismatch; Netherlands; Newly built Dwellings; New Institutional Economics; Owner-Occupied Dwellings; Real Estate Crisis; Transaction Cost Economics; Williamson’s Four-layer Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This is driven in part due to the negative consequences of burning fossil fuels, such as health issues and climate change. To optimize the energy extracted in a wind farm the turbines require some control algorithm. Today, wind turbines that are part of a wind farm do not take neighbouring turbines into account when determining their control settings. This results in greedy control, where each turbine tries to align itself with the dominant wind direction and optimize its energy production using generator torque control and pitch control. During operation, each turbine creates a volume of slow-moving turbulent air behind its rotor, which is called a wake.<br/><br/>The issue with greedy control is that a turbine does not take into account where its wake will end up with respect to downwind turbines. By misaligning a turbine with the wind direction its trust can displace the wake. This will cause an efficiency loss on the misaligned turbine, but it can be used to increase the efficiency of a downwind turbine, leading to an increase in net power production. We know that a controller that uses yaw optimization can optimize the power production in a small scale experimental setup [Campagnolo et al., 2016]. In this particular research a line of three turbines produced 15% extra power compared to greedy control.<br/><br/>Wake redirection can be thought of as an attempt to efficiently mix the slower moving air in the wake with the faster stream surrounding it. This allows more of the total energy in the free stream to be extracted by any given wind farm. Yaw redirection has the potential to mix in the high velocity air that could otherwise pass through the empty space between the turbines. Tilt redirection has the potential to more efficiently mix the high velocity air that would otherwise pass over the wind farm into the air that hits the rotors [Annoni et al., 2017]. This work focuses on the development and implementation of a wake model that can be used to predict the effects of rotor tilting on the wake.<br/><br/>We started with the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady state (FLORIS) model as described in [Gebraad et al., 2014]. This model can be used to estimate the power production of a wind farm. It models the wake intensity and position and combines wakes when they overlap. The power production and wake characteristics of each turbine are predicted using three sub-models. There is one model for the wake intensity and its velocity profile, one to estimate wake deflection and one to determine how wakes are added to each other. In current practice, the wake deflection is modeled only in a horizontal plane, it can be driven by rotor yaw. In this work, the deflection model will be extended in such a way that the effects of rotor tilting on the wake position can be modeled.<br/><br/>Tuning a reduced order model such as FLORIS is notoriously difficult. In the FLORIS model, as described in [Gebraad et al., 2014] there are twelve hand tuned parameters. An important part of this research was attempting to simplify the tuning problem by making a robust parameter tuning procedure. A sensitivity analysis of the tuning parameters on the predicted power signals by FLORIS was performed. This analysis was used to identify situations where a subset of the model parameters is responsible for the variance in the predicted power production. Such situations with specific sensitivity were identified, but I lacked time and resources to fully leverage these and accurately tune the tilt extended model.<br/><br/>We stuck with the original nominal parameters of the different parts constituting FLORIS to conduct a case study. The case study compared predicted power increases by FLORIS with high fidelity simulations in two different Large Eddy Simulation (LES) packages. The case study was conducted by trying to optimize the power production of a small wind farm containing six turbines. The wind turbines were positioned in a two by three grid and the wind direction was aligned along the three turbines. The FLORIS model was used to optimize the yaw angles, tilt angles and both of them simultaneously for this layout. This led to four sets of control settings, the baseline case with greedy control and three optimized sets. We found that the FLORIS model strongly overestimated the power gain caused by turbine tilt. The main reason for this over-estimation seems to be that FLORIS currently has no implementation of the ground. In effect, the wakes in FLORIS can simply disappear into the ground. The case where only the yaw angles are optimized matched the high fidelity simulations to a higher degree confirming the work done in [Bastankhah and Port´e-Agel, 2016].<br/><br/>In conclusion, tilt control seems to have the potential to extract more energy from a certain atmospheric region. This is postulated because the air that gets forced on to rotors using tilt control would otherwise have passed unused over a wind farm. However, the model proposed in this thesis is insufficient to analyze the possible energy gains because it overestimates the effect of turbine tilting. This biggest problem with the FLORIS model is that it lacks a method for modeling the interaction between the ground and a wake. For future research the main priority should be implementing a solution to that problem.<br","wake control; wake deflection; turbine tilting; turbine tilt; wind farm optimization; rotor tilting; rotor tilt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wind energy is becoming a major source of renewable energy. As a result, a large stream of wind turbine materials arises. Most of these materials can be recycled very well, but the rotor blades pose a big problem after their lifespan of 20-25 years. These blades consist of complex composite materials that are doomed to end up in landfill or incineration plants, although the high performance material often still possesses excellent mechanical and chemical qualities. This confronts owners and manufacturers of wind turbines with high costs, as they paying ±€100 per tonne of waste to dispose of the blades. The blade waste problem is steadily growing. By 2050, between 21.4 and 69.4 million tonnes of cumulative wind turbine waste is expected. On an industrial scale, no proper solutions to the wind turbine blade waste problem have yet been found. Most current solutions involve shredding of the blades, which generally results in loss of material qualities. Some solutions have been found that utilize the structural qualities of the blades. However, these new applications are often ‘occasional solutions’; projects that are interesting but are difficult to upscale in an economically viable way. In order for a new product application to be viable, it is important that the material qualities of the blades are utilized and that the resulting product offers an advantage over its competition. The solution must be applicable on a worldwide scale to offer a significant reduction of the blade waste problem. To solve this problem, a large amount of ideas was generated during different kinds of creative sessions. Based on the criteria found in the analysis, a slow traffic bridge was chosen as the most promising idea. This bridge was further developed into a concept. The market potential was identified for the ‘Bridge of Blades’, and the product was designed to fit this purpose. The concept was developed regarding aesthetics, user interaction and structural performance. In the design, the previous life of the bridge is clearly visible. Two rotor blades cross the entire bridge and carry the bridge superstructure. Between the blades, a deck is placed, that provides a comfortable crossing for pedestrians, wheelchairs, bicycles and mopeds. The resulting design is playful, dynamic and tells the story of how high performance materials can be re-used in a commercially viable solution. All components and connections were developed into detail with production and re-use of materials in mind. At the end of the lifespan of the bridge, all materials can be separated and find a new use in the circular economy. This way, the bridge offers a constructive solution to one problem, prevents new problems and acts as an example to fuel debate regarding material use in the technologies of the future. The concept was evaluated, to predict how it could perform in its context. Approximations of the structural performance and a qualitative analysis of the environmental impact are presented. The thesis is concluded with recommendations for further development and evaluation, that are required to make this concept reality. Finally, recommendations for blade designers are given, to make sure the problems that were faced in this project can be avoided in the future.","Wind Turbine Blade; Bridge; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The PSD2 requires banks to provide third parties access to users’ payment account information, if a user requests to do so. This enables both banks as third parties to bring users’ account information together in one place and to develop financial services on top of users’ account information. <br/><br/>Virtual Affairs (VA), the company for which this project is executed, is specialised in developing digital channels for financial service providers. VA aims to inspire and guide clients in their innovation efforts. Grounded examples of how PSD2 can be translated into new value propositions would support VA in inspiring clients and in their own concept development. The assignment of this project is therefore to design these value propositions, based on the question: How can PSD2 be applied in propositions which are meaningful to end-users and valuable to potential clients of VA?<br/><br/>The design solution<br/>From the perspective of four user profiles, four value propositions were developed. The propositions were tested which resulted in the requirements that the service should be actionable, optimistic and explorative. Also, the insights enabled to determine the core essence of each proposition, reflecting the basic and most important quality for the relevant user type. The essences are as follows:<br/><br/>1. To discover<br/> For artisans, the most important quality is defined as ‘to discover’: Discovering what is in their power to change and what the impact of these changes would be, in an explorative and playful way. <br/><br/>2.

To reflect<br/>For idealists, the most important quality is ‘to reflect’: Reflecting on where their money is going to and to what extent this is in line with what they find important, and tho dream about future possibilities. <br/><br/>Based on these essences, the final propositions were designed and combined into one showcase. To be able to serve the differences in objectives of clients, the propositions are modular: variations can be made based on different parameters - such as whether only the clients’ own financial products or also third party products are offered within the digital service. <br/><br/>Value for VA and its clients<br/>The propositions and reasoning behind them were evaluated with a UX designer and client of VA. The reactions were very positive and the propositions will be shared and used as input in ongoing projects. The propositions add value to the client’s current activities and strategy, among others because they contribute to becoming a central place of users to manage financial matters - especially since the propositions connect transaction data (the scope of PSD2) to other financial needs (e.g. around life events and financial planning). In addition, the propositions can be used by VA internally to serve as inspiration and input for various ongoing projects. <br/><br","PSD2; Open Banking; Design; Strategy; Value propositions; Modular design; Financial services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); van Kranendonk, J (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","At the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, ambitious goals for the worldwide CO2 emissions were set. To achieve these goals, a huge reduction in CO2 emissions must be realized. For the energy market, the current aim is to use renewable electricity instead of fossil fuels. However, there are multiple sectors where electricity is not a suitable form of energy, due to storage issues. For example, the chemical industry is heavily based on fossil fuels as a resource to synthesize chemicals. It is therefore useful to investigate the feasibility of renewable synthetic fuels. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to design a process that converts the hydrocarbon fuel combustion products CO2 and H2O into a fuel that is a liquid at atmospheric conditions. Methanol is selected as the liquid fuel because of its basic molecule structure. It requires much more energy to obtain methanol from CO2 and H2O than it does from natural gas. The process is determined to be container-sized to become cost competitive through mass production. The technical feasibility of a mass produced, autonomous, renewable and container-sized methanol production plant is studied in this thesis. The whole process is divided into sub processes. H2O is obtained from desalination of seawater. The H2O is split into H2 and O2 using alkaline electrolysis. The CO2 is adsorbed from the air and recovered using pressure and temperature swing. The required energy is obtained using solar PV and solar thermal. The H2 and CO2 are finally converted to methanol in the methanol synthesis sub process. The intermittent character of solar energy yields a dynamically operated process. The methanol synthesis sub process is studied further because of the small scale and dynamic operation that are new concepts for this technology. The other sub processes are considered as black boxes with fixed in- and outputs. The steady state operation of the whole process is modeled using Aspen Plus™ and the distillation process is modelled in MATLAB®. Using the results from Aspen, pinch analysis is performed for optimal use of the available heat. <br/><br/>From the results of the model, it is found that an autonomous container-sized methanol production plant is technically feasible. 140 kg of methanol can be produced daily with a purity of at least 96.6 %, using a set-up of three 40 feet sea containers, two of which are dedicated to the capture of CO2. 288 kW of electrical power and 24 kW of heat is required for the operation. This is equal to a solar park with an area of 1663 m2 assuming an average 6 hours of solar irradiance. Using the LHV of methanol in the calculation, the total efficiency of the process is estimated at 45 %. The results from the MATLAB® model of the distillation cannot be validated because the used equation of state of REFPROP underestimates the concentration of methanol in each iteration, yielding an invalid mass balance. Fixing this issue results in an invalid energy balance. It is therefore concluded that REFPROP is not suitable for iterative calculations of distillation columns.<br","Methanol; Renewable; Circular; Autonomous; Container Sized; Aspen Plus; MATLAB; Modelling; Design; Process design; Solar Energy; Electrolysis; Carbon capture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Sustainable Process & Energy Technology","",""

Then, we show a novel method of selecting a source domain by using four unsupervised distance measures: Chi squared distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD). We evaluate the effectiveness of using these unsupervised measures individually, and in a linear combination, to identify one or more suitable source domains for an SC task for various target domains.

Runoff generation does not only depend on the measured rainfall resolution but also on the level of detail of land-use and therefore of the runoff generation. This study aims at identifying the influence of rainfall radar resolution and land-use data on the urban water balance in Rotterdam. Results show that the water balance in this study does not close properly, as more volume enters than leaves the system. This is most probably because infiltration is neglected and the reliability of the pumping data is uncertain. Furthermore, the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) volumes are overestimated which might be caused by the high uncertainty of the weir parameters and of the water levels at the non-monitored CSO weirs. This error multiplies with an increase in sewer district size, a higher amount of unmonitored CSOs and lower weir levels. When comparing the different resolutions, the water balance degrades remarkably with coarser land-use data detail and improves slightly with higher rainfall radar resolution, until reaching a certain threshold where the error is minimized. After this threshold the water balance closes less again. Possibly, the reduction in noise and in sensitivity to shifts in timing and location of the radar data with coarsening rainfall radar resolutions is responsible for these unexpected results. Furthermore, this study suggests that there might be a relationship between the changes in land-use resolution and the changes in rainfall radar resolution.","Rainfall; radar; Rotterdam; Urban","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

There are various reasons for a gas field to be classified as economically unviable, one of them being the small size of the field. With the current challenges the E&amp;P sector is facing it is valuable to re-evaluate the criteria often used in determining a fields economic viability. One of those criteria is the column height encountered in the well, which when it becomes too small can be very sensitive to water inflow. Gaining further understanding of the relation between gas column height and gas production can be valuable in determining the potential of a gas field with a limited gas column. Consequently, the focus of this study is twofold: 1) finding the minimum gas column height required for producing a sufficient amount of gas (0.1 – 0.2 BCM) and 2) investigating the effect of specific important reservoir heterogeneities (i.e. high-permeability streaks and clay layers) on the production results (total gas production and production time). These two research topics were approached through two separate methods: 1) a sensitivity study carried out using two types of models, a simple box model and a complex reservoir model and 2) an analysis of gas wells, and the corresponding gas reservoirs, that encounter small gas columns. Both research methods are focused on Rotliegend gas reservoirs. The results from this study show that the minimum gas column range for yielding economic gas production was found to be 20 – 40 m, depending on the field’s characteristics and configurations. Furthermore, in the models used for this study the presence of a highpermeability streak may either cause an increase or decrease in the total gas production, however they are found to significantly reduce the production time which is beneficial towards the economic analysis of a potential project. Additionally, they are found to be highly beneficial in gas reservoirs with a low average permeability. The clay layer on the other hand, significantly increases the total gas production of the models, although this is accompanied by an increase in the total production time. A potential downside of the clay layer is the restricted flow of gas which is particularly problematic in horizontal reservoirs with a significant portion of the gas column situated below the clay layer. Lastly, a possibly positive correlation between transition zone and the total gas production from thin gas columns reservoirs was found in the well analysis, on which further investigation is recommended in order to be able to draw more meaningful conclusions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

However, a knowledge gap exists about the effectivity of applying a simulation game to induce a behavioural change in the construction sector. Certain characteristics of the construction industry make it difficult for employees in this sector to change their behaviour, which makes it seem too blunt to assume that simulation gaming would have the same positive effects on behavioural change in this industry, as it has in other industries. Therefore, the goal of this research is to fill the knowledge gap surrounding the application of a simulation game to a construction company by conducting an empirical research into the effectiveness of the application of a simulation game to a behavioural change process in a construction company. It was established that a simulation game can be considered effective when it induces a behavioural change or a change in attitude of participants. With help of interviews, questionnaires and observation it was investigated if such a development in attitude or behaviour arose in the company under investigation. Within the timespan of this research no behavioural change was measured and also a change in attitude was only measured amongst a part of the participants. It can be concluded that the investigated simulation game was not effective to induce a behavioural change in the construction company. However, as a simulation game has the characteristic that every game-run is different, this game could yield a completely different result when applied to another company. Therefore it cannot be assumed that the results from this research are representative for the entire construction sector. It is recommended to conduct further research into the application of other simulation games to other construction companies. By comparing the results of the different cases a better idea about the real effects that a simulation game could have on a behavioural change in a construction company can be formed.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Considered as an effective real-time monitoring tool, Acoustic Emission (AE) measurements is a promising technology for reinforced concrete (RC) structures. However, its application on real RC structures is still limited. Due to the lack of knowledge on the crack induced acoustic emission in large scale structures.<br/><br/>The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between the fracture energy and the energy of AE signals at structural level. This serves as a basis for the quantification and localization of cracking activities at structural level.<br/><br/>This study is based on the AE and crack propagation measurement of a series of large scale RC specimen tests. To avoid the influence of existing cracks, the first part of study focuses on the development of the first flexural crack. It was assumed that the amount of energy required for unit length of crack opening is linearly proportional to the energy of the AE signals that are generated upon the opening of this segment of the crack. These signals can only be monitored AE sensors at given locations. By then, they have travelled through the bulk concrete and possibly already existing cracks, thus their energy has attenuated due to the geometric spreading and the damping property of the material. When these effects are taken into account, the total energy of the AE signals that were obtained by the AE sensors at given location (defined as cumulative signal strength CSS) has a potential of reflecting the fracture energy of the corresponding crack. In the part of the study, this process is theoretically studied first. The theoretical result was further validated by the AE measurement obtained from experiments. <br/><br/>Theoretical investigation is carried out based on a simplified model considering only length of the crack and the horizontal distance between crack and AE sensor. Theoretical result shows that both crack length and horizontal distance would affect CSS. However, when the horizontal distance is big enough, crack length is no longer the dominant factor, and CSS drops significantly with the increase of horizontal distance. The CSS of different sensors in a row in the experiments are used to validate this attenuation phenomenon. Exponential curve fitting is carried out to describe the attenuation of experimental results in different tests. Finally, a comparison of attenuation in percentage terms between curve fitting results and theoretical results is carried out. In the uncracked specimens, the results fit each other well. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the effect of the existing cracks to the attenuation of the CSS is studied as well. In that case, a dramatic drop of CSS is observed compared to the uncracked structures.<br/><br/>The study shows CSS detected by AE sensors could partly indicate the cracking behavior of RC structures. The attenuation tendency gives a guidance for sensor installation in future tests.<br","Acoustic emission; Reinforced Concrete structures; Cumulative Signal Strength; Attenuation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional thesis",""

The surrounding farms rely on the Phetchaburi River for irrigation water and the drinking water companies rely on it as a source of water. However, the Phetchaburi basin has problems with yearly floods, salt intrusion and pollution. Water monitoring stations in the region are scarce. A new telemetering system has been put in place, but due to the cost of these stations they are few in number. This project presents a showcase for a cheap and robust water monitoring system in terms of both quantity through water level data and quality through various water quality parameters using apps on an android or iPhone device to gather and analyse the data. The app from Mobile Water Management (MWM) is used to measure the water level through reading a photo of a staff gauge. The Akvo app uses various methods like electronic devices and reading strips via a photo to measure several water quality parameters. It was proven that construction of the staff gauges needed for the MWM app is cheap and does not require highly skilled workers. The resulting data is reliable, if the app is handled by someone trained in handling the app, and/or the data that is created is checked by a trained person. The fact that the pictures taken by the app are uploaded to the database makes for easy verification of the data. This makes verification of telemetric data possible, which as it turns out is not always reliable when compared to the MWM data. The Akvo app has a similar advantage in the sense that verification of the data at a later moment is not only possible, but also easy. This eliminates several human errors in the data collection process and effectively increases the data quality. Right now, several RID officers are needed to collect this data. Using the Akvo app, the required manpower can be lowered. Data analysis shows that the Phetchaburi River has significant levels fecal contamination (E. coli) and issues with low oxygen concentrations at certain moments. For this reason, it is not recommended to use as recreational, fishing or irrigation water. The boundary between salt and freshwater is constantly changing depending on weather conditions and can cause serious problems for local farmers. When constructing the staff gauge there are multiple possible human errors that need to be avoided in order for the MWM app to work correctly. This mainly has to do with the placement of the staff gauge sticker, keeping it straight and unobstructed and also directed towards the user. It turned out that several of the Akvo strips are not working correctly. Other than that, taking data from many parameters can also be time consuming. We recommend that the RID looks into this method of data collection further, both as a cheap and easy way to expand their water monitoring network, and in the case of the MWM app to verify the effectiveness of the telemetering systems.","water level; water quality; app-based; monitoring; data collection","en","student report","","","","","","","","2023-07-04","","","","","MP255","12.91, 99.85"

The lower Clarence Valley is an area covering approximately 1000 square kilometers and is located on the downstream part of the Clarence River. Due to heavy rainfall, the Clarence River discharge can increase from an average 160 m3/s to 20000 m3/s. As a result, water levels rise significantly leading to severe floods in the Clarence Valley. The main urban areas in this region, Grafton, South Grafton and Maclean, are located in narrowing river bends which makes them particulary vulnerable to flooding during high water levels. <br/><br/>The main goal of this report is to present flood mitigation measures to reduce the impact of flooding in the urban areas of the Clarence Valley, based on the Duthc flood mitigation strategy called 'Room for the River'. Consequently the following research question was formulated:<br/><br/>How can the impact of flooding on the urban areas in the Clarence Valley be reduced by increasing the storage capacity of floodplains?<br/><br/>In order to answer the research question, the following project approach is applied. Six areas were identified, based on a fieldvisit and an extensive preliminary study, to implement flood mitigation measures and assess existing flood defences. Part of these flood defences are the Swan Creek Floodgate and the reinforced concrete levee wall of Maclean, which will be investigated on their performance. A fully calibrated numerical floodmodel provides input for the hydrological analysis. The model represents the current situation in the Valley. Scenarios are created by applying topographic adjustments. The new scenarios are implemented into the numerical model and the effectiveness on flood mitigation in urban areas is assessed by comparing the results of a 5, 20 and 50 year Average Reccurance Interval flood event to the current situation during one of these flood events. <br/><br/>By making use of the proposed floodplains and improving the performance of existing flood defences, the flood defence system of the Clarence Valley can be extended. It can be concluded that it is possible to reduce the impact of flooding in the urban areas of the Clarence Valley by increasing the storage capacity of floodplains around Grafton. Therefore, the usage of a ’Room for the River’ strategy can be a solution to the problems the Clarence Valley is facing, and possibly might be applicable to more flooding-vulnerable areas in Australia.","Flood Risk; Flood Mitigation; TUFLOW; Modelling; Floodgate","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-29.697735, 152.938615"

To make the circular economy happen, social, environmental and economic challenges have to be integrated in the transition. This report will identify these challenges and propose a vision, a development strategy and projects/policies to propose a new system in the sector where most of these challenges come together: the agrifood sector. The agrifood sector being one of the most polluting sectors in the world plays a key role in a circular economy. The project uses the circular economy as a tool to establish normative change in the case of the imbalanced agrifood sector. The development strategy of the project provides a framework for a future circular economy in a fairer agrifood sector. The framework encompasses localising the food network and creating a local circularity in the flows of energy, water, heat, fodder, CO2 circulation and organic material. This localisation aims to create jobs for the low to middle educated people that are struck by socio-spatial polarization. It also suggests new ways of protein production and of the usage of peatlands. The conclusion is that, while already a big portion of the circular economy can be realised, more research is needed to be able to make the circular economy happen in the agrifood sector. To balance the sector, it has to be deconcentrated and localised. This localisation is essentially a modern form of the traditional sector from the 18th and 19th century. Therefore it’s called an agronomic renaissance. Due to the traditional nature of the sector, institutional change has to happen, which can only be achieved by a long term strategy, strong policy and a periodical review. Giving the sector guidance and a perspective is important to instigate the change needed for a circular agrifood system that also accounts for the social, environmental and economic challenges mentioned. This project gives a possible direction for this long term perspective.","Circular Economy; Amsterdam metropolitan area; agrifood sector; localised agrifood networks; deconcentrating; new farmer; Food hub; spatial planning; regional development; localized","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","REPAiR",""

The food system is a very important aspect within our lives, socially as well as economically but it is also one of the most important causes of unsustainability. The Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (AMA), a key player within the global food sector, is also working to a more sustainable system with their focus on a circular economy. This research outlines the fact that in order to reach a more sustainable economy, there should also be an emphasis on resilience. In analyzing the region, there were several dependencies highlighted within the food system. Within the aspects of production, retail and end of life, each are dependent on a handful of controlling and dominating stakeholders as well as unsustainable and uncircular practices. Thus, there is a heavy emphasis on the food system needing to adapt and change to growing demands and trends. <br/><br/>This led to our research question of, How can the food system become more resilient in the AMA to promote a sustainable circular economy? In our research, scenario planning and weather mapping were used to showcase and locate feasible opportunities for our goals and strategies within the AMA. The primary strategies to create resiliency within the food system were to decentralize, diversify and connect aspects related to various urban and agri-food trends. This project envisions a decentralized system that contains a dense network of diverse and independent stakeholders with localized sustainable projects. There is also an emphasis on creating smaller and shorter connections within the chain.This includes incorporating and empowering various smaller stakeholders and actors with positive incentives but also restricting dominating stakeholders with policies and regulations. In addition, through the creation of more transparency through integrated and multiscaled design solutions, this will increase awareness and promote healthy and sustainable practices within the system. Food island encourages a thriving circular economy that is resilient and thus more sustainable. <br","Circular Economy; Resilience; Sustainability; Food System; Amsterdam Metropolitan Area; Diversifying; Decentralizing; Connecting","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""
