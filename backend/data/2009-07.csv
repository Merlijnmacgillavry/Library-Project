(mentor)","2009","Research related to the impact that war head induced damage had on the aeroelastic integrity of lifting surfaces and in turn the resulting upset of the complete aircraft, prompted a current look at similar aeroelastic events that might be triggered by damage of the aircraft due to icing. This possible aeroelastic impact due to icing damage is not a very commonly explored area of research. Although seldom studied, icing can also significantly impact the aeroelastic stability and hence the overall stability and control of the aircraft. In this latter context, classical flutter events of the lifting surfaces and controls can occur due to ice-induced mass unbalance or control force reversal. Also, a loss of control effectiveness or limit cycle oscillations of the controls and lifting surfaces may appear, due to significant time dependent drag forces introduced by separated flow conditions imposed by the ice accumulation. Two commonly observed ice-induced upset scenarios were selected to investigate. The first scenario involves an elevator limit cycle oscillation and a resulting loss of elevator control effectiveness. The second upset is related to a violent wing rock or Dutch roll instability. In both proposed ice-induced upsets, lock-in mechanisms of two unsteady events occur, (1) the ice-induced unsteady flow field and (2) the unsteady structural acceleration of the aircraft. A wind tunnel study is employed to investigate the lock-in mechanisms of the structural acceleration and the unsteady flow field induced by ice accumulation that is only present on the elevator horn balance leading edges. The purpose is to determine the linear and non-linear coupling mechanisms between these events. An experimental data set has been obtained where the unsteady, ice-induced, flow field and the acceleration of a 1:10 scale, reduced-stiffness, aircraft model is synchronously acquired using pressure transducers and accelerometers, respectively. The experiments are performed at various angles of attack of the aircraft, _p, with and without simulated ice accumulation on the elevator horn balance leading edges and with various settings of the elevator deflection angle, _. Statistical signal processing techniques, that are able to compute linear and quadratic coherence spectra, are presented in this thesis work and are applied in the pressure-acceleration coherence study. The first-order processing technique, based on the well-known linear coherence spectrum, revealed a low-frequency lock-in (f = 6Hz, _p > 7_) for the case where ice accumulation was simulated on the leading edges of the horn balances, while no lock-in was observed without ice simulations. This indicates that violent aircraft motions can indeed be a result from the ice-induced flow field over the horn balances. Although a reduced-stiffness aircraft model was used in the experimental setup, and thus the quantitative results are not translatable to the full-scale case, the identification of this linear lock-in mechanism indicates that their is a significant chance that similar lock-in mechanisms occur in full-scale flight applications. An attempt to identify the quadratic relations between the two unsteady systems was performed by employing higher-order statistical signal processing based on a non-orthogonal, secondorder, single-input/output (I/O) Volterra model. Due to current limitations, related to the implementation of this technique, no physical interpretations could be done based on the higher-order coherences. Recommendations are given to improve the identification capability of this higher-order technique, which might become a powerful identification and estimation tool in (experimental) fluid dynamics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

The feasibility analysis is conducted on a number of different algorithm classes. The Parzen Window algorithm appeared to be the most suitable option for acceleration when recongurable hardware is considered. The reason for this is that the Parzen Window consists of independent calculations that can be computed in parallel. It can be computed by execution of Custom Configured Hardware Units (CCU) in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The feasibility analysis presented, gave insight in the question whether it is useful to implement these kind of algorithms in hardware. Our results showed that algorithms that have independent calculations and thus are able to be executed in parallel are strong candidates for hardware implementation, certainly when the design can be executed with integer calculations. Integer calculations reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, require smaller area on the FPGA, reduce the bandwidth of the calculations and can be computed faster than their floating point version. In the future our methodology can be reused for other algorithms that have a parallel structure.","Hardware Accelerator; Pattern Recognition Algorithm; FPGA; Parallel Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Groeneweg, T.W. (mentor)","2009","In Nederland bestaat er bij het realiseren van bouwkuipen met een onderwaterbetonvloer en trekpalen, in de veelal slappe ondergrond, onzekerheid over de gevolgen die een ontlasting van de ondergrond teweeg kunnen brengen. De grond zal zich aanpassen aan de afgenomen spanningen wat gepaard gaat met uitzetting van de grond. Deze volumevergroting van grond ten gevolge van het ontlasten wordt zwel genoemd. Bij cohesieve grondlagen is het moeilijk in te schatten hoe snel de zwel optreedt middels een consolidatieproces en welke gevolgen dit heeft voor de onderwaterbetonvloer en de palen in de bouwkuip. Met dit afstudeerrapport is getracht de onzekerheid te verkleinen door het inzicht in de materie te vergroten. Speciale aandacht gaat uit naar snelheid waarmee zwel optreedt en welke factoren hierop van invloed zijn. Dit wordt in relatie gebracht met de snelheid waarmee ontgraven wordt en het moment waarop vervolgens de onderwaterbetonvloer wordt gestort. Daarbij is onderzocht welke interactie reeds aanwezige paalgroepen en grond aangaan en welke gevolgen dit heeft. Het rapport bestaat uit twee delen. In Deel I wordt de ontwikkeling van zwel van een diepe kleilaag in een bouwkuip behandeld en de interactie met een onderwaterbetonvloer zonder trekpalen. Dit geschiedt aan de hand van een praktijksituatie, te weten de startschacht Sophiaspoortunnel. Bij de ontgraving van deze bouwkuip tot maar liefst een diepte van 20,2 m zijn intensief metingen naar het gedrag van grond en constructie uitgevoerd. De gehele uitvoering is gemodelleerd in Plaxis 3D Foundation waarbij na aanpassing van de doorlatendheid de resultaten goed overeenkomen met de metingen. Tevens worden resultaten weergeven van een algemene studie naar zwel en zwelbelasting zonder de specificaties van de uitvoering bij de Sophiaspoortunnel. In Deel II wordt de ontwikkeling van zwel van een ondiepe kleilaag in een bouwkuip behandeld en de interactie met een onderwaterbetonvloer met trekpalen. Aandacht gaat in het bijzonder uit naar de interactie die de grond met voor ontgraven geïnstalleerde palen aangaat. Deze interactie is maximaal terwijl bij palen die na ontgraven worden aangebracht, de zwel al opgetreden kan zijn. Het project Museumparkgarage en ondergrondse waterberging is als casestudie bestudeerd. Een belangrijkste conclusie is dat diepe cohesieve lagen, zoals de laag van Kedichem bij de startschacht Sophiaspoortunnel, goed in staat zijn het uitvoeringsproces te volgen. Van aanzienlijke wateronderspanningen en zwel na het voltooien van het ontgravingproces is dan ook geen sprake. Ook bij ondiepe bouwkuipen tot ongeveer 10 m diepte, waarbij na paalinstallatie Holocene pakketten worden afgegraven om vervolgens een onderwaterbetonvloer te storten, zal zich over het algemeen geen noemenswaardige zwelbelasting op een onderwaterbetonvloer manifesteren. Naast het afnemen van de potentiële zwelbelasting met de bouwtijd heeft het herbelasten van de ondergrond met het effectieve gewicht van de onderwaterbetonvloer een belangrijke compenserende functie. In tegenstelling tot de vloer worden vóór ontgraven geïnstalleerde palen wel aanzienlijk belast door een directe interactie met de ondergrond, waarbij de invloed van zandpakketten omvangrijk is. Tevens hebben de palen een beperkende invloed op de zwelbelasting op de onderwaterbetonvloer. Deze conclusies gaan ook op voor de Museumparkgarage en ondergrondse waterberging: van een zwelbelasting op de onderwaterbetonvloeren zal geen sprake zijn geweest maar wel op de palen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-engineering","","","",""

Our testbed provides necessary modules and service, such as command dissemination and feedback module, data logging and collection module, network programming module and time synchronization service. Different from other existing testbeds, our testbed removes wire connections and gateways, which are used for transmitting commands, feedbacks and users’ programs, between nodes so that it provides high flexibility in deployment and reduces costs. This testbed can be widely applied in different environments without extra devices but experimental motes. We have deployed our testbed on the 19th floor of EWI building at TU Delft and verified its functionality and performance with tests. The testbed meets our design goals that it can be used for most WSN experiments. We hope this testbed can make a contribution to WSN research in the future.","Testbed; wireless sensor network; IEEE802.15.4","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

Het doel van onze opdracht is om een web-applicatie te maken die de beheerders van EASY alle nodige informatie d.m.v. een paar clickjes met de muis kan tonen. Dit hebben we gedaan door eerst een vooronderzoek te doen en daarna middels eXtreme Programming[6] en wekelijkse vergaderingen de webapplicatie te bouwen. Bij eXtreme Programming begin je na het vaststellen van de requirements gelijk met programmeren, je hebt wekelijkse vergaderingen(Planning games) waar samen met de opdrachtgever gediscussieerd wordt welke requirements de week daarop geïmplementeerd gaan worden.

(mentor)","2009","Gas-injection enhanced oil recovery can recover nearly all residual oil where the gas sweeps. Sweep efficiency in these processes is often poor, in large part because of gravity override of gas. Stone and Jenkins presented a model for gravity override in homogeneous reservoirs, showing that the distance gas and water travel before segregation depends directly on injection rate. In cases where injection pressure is limiting, injectivity is key to overcoming gravity override. Stone assumed continuous injection of gas and water as a model for WAG (Water Alternating Gas), contending that this is valid as long as slugs mix near the well. This model for co-injection can be extended to relate segregation distance for co-injection processes directly to injection pressure. Injectivity depends on saturations very near the well, however. Therefore, where injection pressure is limiting, this model is pessimistic because injectivity in WAG is greater than in co-injection. We investigate the increase in injectivity possible with WAG compared to co-injection in 1D and 2D, and the implications for gravity override in 2D, using a range of models for gas and water relative permeabilities. We confirm that the greater injectivity of WAG improves vertical sweep compared to Stone's model when injection pressure is limiting. The greatest improvements occur when slugs violate Stone's assumption: that is, when they are too large to mix fully near the well. The increase in injectivity over co-injection is greater for foam than for WAG without foam, because foam has much lower mobility when gas and water flow together.","WAG; SWAG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering and Geoscience","","","",""

The proposed up-converter IC allows the necessary signal modulation for the radar to be generated at a relative low frequency, after up-conversion to W-band takes place. In our case, the FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) principle is used for the actual radar operation. This up-conversion, based on analogue signal multiplication, reduces the source signal bandwidth requirement by the amount of its multiplication factor. The purpose of this work is to explore the possibility of implementing a wideband high-order frequency up-converter which suits the needs of our radar system namely, like high conversion gain, spur suppression, improved noise performance, as well as limited DC power consumption. In our system, the up-converter converts an input signal from X and Ku-band (around 10GHz) to W-band (around 94GHz). The up-converted signal is used to drive both the transmitter antenna and the receiver mixer LO port. The whole circuit includes a multiply by 8 chain and necessary gain blocks on W-band. Study of the frequency multiplication process has resulted in a carefully planned frequency allocation, as well as, power leveling for each sub-circuit. A wideband frequency doubler capable of high conversion gain and low unwanted spur generation is designed. In the multiply by 8 chain, optimum operation of the frequency doubler, as well as, on chip filtering are performed to guarantee the spectrum purity of the output signal over wide bandwidth. Two W-band medium power amplifiers are optimized for flat gain frequency response. The multiply by 8 chain provides an output signal from 80GHz to 112GHz, with an in-band conversion gain ranging from 13.2 dB to 16.6dB. The suppression of unwanted spurs is better than -40dB. The antenna driver amplifier delivers more than 3dBm output power with 3dB in-band gain variation. The LO driver amplifier delivers more than 150mV peak voltage swing at mixer LO port with less than 2dB in-band gain variation.","Signal Up-conversion; Integrated Radar System; Frequency Multiplier; MMIC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hekmat, R. (mentor); Kooij, R. (mentor); Hoffmans, J. (mentor); Baken, N.H.G. (mentor)","2009","Today’s Telecom sectors’ implementations seem to be sub optimal and might even end up out of control because of the multiple implementation of technological and process functionalities, and dominant financial focus that complicates removing legacy networks. Even though, there is support for fulfilling customer needs, the inefficient use of resources can negatively affect the business activities and profits. The Telecom sectors’ current evolutionary stage requires a thorough evaluation of all its current implementations in order to restructure and consolidate them. In order to maintain the vital telecom contribution to our society and economy, cost optimisations and the ability to keep on innovating in an increasing complex setting, need to be safeguarded. We know that, apart from financial difficulties, there are important handicaps in this sector itself: it has an ill-defined set of functions that has been addressed by different standardisation bodies. This has led to the main research question, namely: How to identify a best of breed model which both reflects the current (2009) and the near future (2012) Telecom sector functionality in order to come up with an advise about optimising its internal functional structure taking into account the relevant requirements concerning interoperability with other sectors? The major objective of this study was to identify both the internal and external functions performed by the Telecom sector and thus reveal how they provide value to the other nodes in the sectors’ network. The Telecom sector (as defined in this document) is the research domain and subject of modelling in this thesis. Accordingly, the functional approach deliberately chosen for this project provides an implementation independent basis of knowledge that could be transferrable from the Telecom sector to other sectors or to different aggregation levels in the economy and society. The functions were extracted from well known and commonly used telecom related models. As a result, from the data mining and analysis applied to those telecom related models, this thesis provides a long list of 331 functions performed by the Telecom sector. In addition, these functions were mapped onto other non-telecom sector specific models that have a sectors’ network applicability in order to confirm the neutrality of the functional perspective. A minority of those functions proved to be Telecom sector specific. In this thesis, we present a proposition to classify functions, taking into account two dimensions: Composition (atomic, composed), and domain of applicability (generic, specific). It is known that the generic-specific dimension has been considered before; however, in this thesis we have included a new dimension atomic-composed. These both dimensions are not exclusively, can be applied at the same time, and are context dependant. One of the models studied in this study, providing a sectors’ network view is the Holon model. This model as well makes use of the fact that natural language can be used to represent the economic and social context. It has three main propositions: 1. Holons could be considered as nodes in a network 2. A holon is composed of four layers: est, vivit, sensit, intelligit 3. Each holon can interact with other holons in their same aggregation level (left & right), not only with the holons in other levels of the hierarchy/holarchy (up & down) Interaction with other holons in the same aggregation level is a proposition presented in this thesis. The original concept of holon (proposed by Arthur Koestler) implies that holons form a hierarchical structure (called holarchy), keeping relations with other holons in upper and lower levels of the hierarchy it is part of. This thesis includes as well, an application of graph theory to get insights about the set of data obtained. In this direction, we identified the most common functions in between all the models assessed by doing an exercise of a graph representation. Furthermore, after studying functions and the Holon concept, we propose some new questions for the complex networks and graph theory community: 1. Going from nodes to holons 2. Consider holons being four-tiered structures. 3. Holons looking up and down to other aggregation levels, but also looking left & right within its own aggregation level. From two-tiered graphs to four tiered graphs, the est layer being the foundation of three overlays: vivit, sensit, intelligit. Currently, the flows that traverse the envisaged sensit and intelligit layer are performed by human beings. In the Telecom sector the est and vivit layer are mainly performed by systems. 4. To open a holon and look inside them, how their internal behaviour is reflected to other nodes in the network/hierarchy. Opening a holon shows another four tiered network. The research methodology described in this thesis proved to be suitable to obtain a functional model. The answer to this “how” question was given via the following steps: 1. Selecting sector specific standards and models based on the proposed criteria 2. Extracting functions from those models and long-listing them (functional portfolio) 3. Mapping functions to generic (non-telecom sector specific) model (testing) We have obtained a list of functions that was mapped to three selected generic models (STOF, CTOM, Holon) and to the meta-functions (that are common to all sectors). This led to the conclusion that it is possible to derive a novel functional model from the existing models, if we have a focus on a specific target (in our case: to serve the sectors network). The best of breed model we have chosen is based on the Holon concept explained above.","telecom; functions; models; trans-sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

Integrated asset modelling allows improving the understanding of the field’s performance and production network, fluid flow behaviour and optimization at any stage and level during the life of the field. This approach enables the optimization of production by adjusting control parameters taking into account surface facilities constraints and the interactions between surface and subsurface systems. Using material balance modelling as a tool for history matching, the Fensfjord reservoir showed that the North and West tanks are behaving as separate compartments. There is some communication between the South and Central tanks and that the aquifer is giving some support to the North and South but not to the Central tank. In this work, given the design of the integrated model and the hierarchical structure of the software it is best to define the objective function, control variables and constraints within each application which has its own optimizer. The impact of scenarios with respect to the total system can be modelled. This brings valuable information on whether in fact the new scenario can be handled by the current surface facilities or if an upgrade is needed and how cost effective it will be. Furthermore, the premise that optimal gas lift rate allocation can bring significant changes in production when gas processing is constrained by surface facilities was verified, yielding an increase in 4.2 % of cumulative production over a period of 3 years.","History Matching; Production Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-07-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

A design of a small sounding rocket, such as Stratos, is a good example of an interdisciplinary challenge. An optimal design is a combination of structures, manufacturability, propulsion, aerodynamics, electronics and many other aspects The Stratos rocket achieved an apogee altitude of 12.551 meters at the Esrange Space Centre, thereby setting a new European altitude record for amateur rockets. A detailed flight trajectory reconstruction is done, whereby differences between simulation and reality are explained. The objective of this thesis is to give a detailed insight in the design, the simulation tools, the production process and the results of the mission. The design philosophy of the Stratos rocket, simulation software and the production planning concept are valuable tools in the development of newer and more powerful rockets, which could ultimately result in a successor of the Stratos rocket.","DARE; rocket; Stratos","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-20","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

Most of the research in the past focused on the contribution of recycling to precipitation within a certain region only. This paper clearly distinguishes between different definitions of moisture recycling. This allows us to study the complete process of continental moisture recycling. In addition to identifying how much of the precipitation originates from continental sources, a new definition is used to identify regions which are major moisture suppliers for continental precipitation. An accounting procedure based on ERA?40 reanalysis data is used to calculate moisture recycling ratios. As such, this paper derives new information from existing data. It is estimated that on average 38 % of the continental precipitation has continental origin and that 52 % of the continental evaporation returns as precipitation over continents. This paper demonstrates the important role of topography in the Andes and the Tibetan Plateau where regional moisture recycling is a key process. The Amazon and the Congo are identified as very important regions for sustaining continental precipitation. It is also demonstrated that moisture recycling from the Eurasian continent is the major supplier of the fresh water resources of China.","precipitation; evaporation; moisture recycling; land-atmosphere feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

To realize a more efficient use of this valuable resource, secondary spectrum usage by cognitive radios is being considered. Cognitive Radio is a paradigm for wireless communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its transmission or reception parameters to communicate effectively while avoiding interference to licensed users. The cognitive radio in its operation may want to make opportunistic use of spectrum that is already allocated to primary users and adjust itself to certain conditions so that it does not impair the operation of these primary users. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of deploying cognitive radios within a Licensed User (LU) network without causing harmful interference. This thesis shows that this may be possible provided certain conditions are met by the cognitive radios thereby achieving a more efficient use of the scarce frequency spectrum. The approach for this work is to model and analyze an interference scenario involving a cognitive radio interferer (secondary user) and a victim licensed receiver (primary user). The case scenario being considered involves secondary users which are being represented by public safety organizations (police, fire brigade and ambulance) who normally use the 380-400MHz band for Emergency communications (in Europe). The primary users are considered to be commercial Private Mobile Radio systems operating in the 450-470MHz band. Secondary access to the latter band could help to offload the 380-400 MHz band in crisis situations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

The Mail NL business line of TNT Post is faced with the challenge of introducing Enterprise Architecture in its organization. The experiences of TNT Post may be of great value for large and comparable organizations that are also faced with this challenge. This thesis presents the experiences and implementation of the first steps in the introduction of Enterprise Architecture at the Mail NL business line of TNT Post, in order to support the introduction of Enterprise Architecture at other large organizations.

(mentor); Rothkrantz, L.J.M. (mentor)","2009","In our life we get more and more dependent on our computer and we have less time for face-to-face social activities with friends and families. In face?to?face communication our faces convey lots of emotions using facial expressions and lots of information is transmitted faster non-verbally than verbally, through the facial expressions. Using lots of modalities like facial expressions, speech and (hand and body) gestures make the communication between the humans multimodal. But the current communication style between human and computer is still dominated by keyboard and mouse and there is no room for emotions and facial expressions. In order to have a better understanding of human?human communication and to improve the human?computer interaction it is essential to identify and describe the different modalities of human?human communication including collection and annotation of multimodal data. Using the facial expressions, (hand and body) gestures, speech recognition and content awareness make the communication multimodal and enable the computer to adapt itself to the needs of the individual users. In this report we study one of the important modalities, the facial expressions and we proposed an algorithm for tracking the facial expressions from face?to?face communication. To discover the relation between the different facial expressions and their meaning we needed data of the human face?to?face communication to analyze the facial expressions during the interaction between them. After some research we decided to make some recordings and build our own database. Our research problem is to localize facial expressions, to label them and research the communication impact. To facilitate the localization we put markers on the faces of test persons during our experiment. We asked 3 observers annotators) to watch the recordings of the face-of-face communication and put labels on the segments that contain an emotion. Calculating the level of agreement between the annotators we compared their results with each other and finally we used these labeled segments in our model to extract the different features for each emotion. Using our model we followed the changes of the face during the facial expressions to collect facial features and used these facial features to define emotion clusters. Using these clusters we can start building an automatic emotion extraction tool from face?to?face communications. For defining enough features to recognize the emotions we need a much bigger database. During this project using our data, we extract some features for basic emotions and define clusters to recognize them, like recognizing ‘sadness’ from ‘happiness’ and ‘anger’ from ‘surprise’. For making a big more emotion clusters and recognizing more emotions we need more annotated data.","Annotation; Emotion recognition; Communication model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Men, Machine Interaction","","","",""

Successfully employing current QoS solutions in heterogeneous environments, such as home networks, requires compatibility between the many possible solutions for the different network technologies. Often the solutions need support from all devices throughout the network. Additionally, it is often difficult to configure QoS settings properly. An alternative approach that adds some QoS support to home networks is admission control based on path quality assessment. The service delivering device decides if a new service can be admitted based on a quick path quality measurement. Currently there are no tools available for performing a fast and accurate path quality measurement in heterogeneous network paths. This report describes the design and evaluation of a path capacity measurement tool for small­scale, heterogeneous, best­effort IP networks. A new probing method is developed that obtains the bottleneck capacity in paths consisting of different link layer technologies. Besides standard IP support, we do not put any requirements on the service receiving devices. The performance of the newly developed probing method is evaluated through simulations of Ethernet/802.11b networks in OPNET Modeler©. Simulation results show that the path capacity estimation tool provides accurate (typically ±0.5 Mbps) estimates for the path capacity (typically within 5 seconds) if employed in paths with low to moderate cross traffic intensities. For higher cross traffic intensities, the performance of the tool decreases.","capacity measurement; capacity estimation; packet pair probing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services (NAS) Group","","","",""

A novel data processing method was developed to obtain more accurate values without the spurious scattering of the obtained contact angles. This data processing technique uses both a full description of the bubble shape and of the substrate surface based on first principals. As model system we use carbon dioxide bubbles on different substrates immersed in CO2-saturated hexadecane at 45oC and pressures ranging between atmospheric and 12 MPa. All issues regarding the accuracy of experimental data and data processing are discussed at length. The main emphasis is on the image processing and the subsequent description of the bubble shape in relation to the substrate surface. The image analysis procedure was validated with computer generated bubble shapes with known contact angles.

(mentor)","2009","A small, low-cost, single-chip multi-band WCDMA/GSM transceiver solution is needed to address the high growth segment of 3G enabled smart phone ICs, while still keeping compatibility with widely deployed 2G GSM networks. In this thesis, an inductor-less LNA+mixer combination for multi-band WCDMA is presented. By designing the mixer for high IIP2, the inter-stage saw filter between LNA and mixer, as is normally used in WCDMA receiver designs has been eliminated, resulting in substantial cost reduction. Although mainly intended for WCDMA, the LNA+mixer combination also meets the requirements for GSM. For the LNA design, a noise cancellation topology has been used to achieve wide-band input matching, while still providing the required low noise figure. For this configuration, tradeoffs between noise, linearity and power consumption are explored in detail. Several modifications over basic noise cancellation topology are presented, which result in a significant reduction in noise figure. A passive mixer topology with a switching core followed by transimpedance amplifier (TIA) has been used for the mixer design. To reduce the noise contribution of the TIA, a new approach, which makes use of a current buffer between the switching core and the TIA is presented. This current buffer also allows the use of higher gate lengths and widths for the switching core transistors, which is beneficial in meeting the high IIP2 required to eliminate the inter-stage saw filter. The design of the transimpedance amplifier is also explained in detail. The LNA+mixer combination presented in this thesis achieves a worst case total gain of 35.5dB and noise figure of 2.9dB across all WCDMA bands. S11 is below -15dB from 870MHz to 2.17GHz. The IIP2 at transmit frequency offset is greater than 50dBm across all WCDMA bands. Across all these bands, the worst case IIP3 at transmit frequency offset is -8.2dBm and input referred 1dB cross compression point is -20dBm. The combination of LNA and I/Q mixer consumes 25mA from 1.2V supply. The design has been carried out using IBM 65nm CMOS process technology.","multi-band; WCDMA; LNA; mixer; noise cancelation; IIP2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

For any given linear code and any given maximum number of correctable erasures, in the paper ‘Separating Erasures for Errors for Decoding’, [1], Abdel-Ghaffar and Weber introduced parity-check matrices yielding parity-check equations that do not check any of the erased symbols and which are sufficient to characterize all punctured codes corresponding to this maximum number of erasures. This allows for the separation of erasures from errors to facilitate decoding. Typically, these parity-check matrices have redundant rows. To reduce decoding complexity, parity-check matrices with small number of rows are preferred. The minimum number of rows in a parity-check matrix separating all erasure sets of size at most l is called the lth separating redundancy.

(mentor)","2009","The rapid growth of internet traffic and the eminent shift from IPv4 to IPv6 addresses indicated the need for an efficient address lookup method that can keep pace with the ever-increasing throughput demands. As current address lookup solutions tend to become the bottleneck in internet routing, the efficient Range Trie address lookup method was designed for a hardware implementation in this thesis. A complete Range Trie hardware design was derived that is parameterizable in many of its aspects. The proposed design offers the required properties of low latency, high throughput and low memory requirements, while these properties scale well with the increase of the address width and/or the lookup table size. After implementing the Range Trie using 90nm ASIC process, an operating frequency of 540MHz up to 694MHz was achieved for IPv4 addresses, depending on the lookup table size (256-512K entries). For IPv6, the throughput was sustained between 442MHz up to 571MHz. For both IPv4 and IPv6, an OC-3072 (160Gbps) wire speed is supported for the worst-case of 512K ranges. The memory requirements ranged from a few KBytes up to 24 MBytes, while the occupied area ranged from 0.014 cm2 up to 4.64 cm2 and the power consumption ranged from 0.2 W up to 31 W depending on the address width (32, 64 or 128-bits) and the lookup table size (256-512K entries).","internet routing; address lookup; IP lookup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Nikookar, H. (mentor); Mantel, O.C. (mentor)","2009","The demand for high data rate is ever increasing. OFDM-based wideband systems such as LTE and WiMAX are being employed as they can provide such high data rates. The performances of these systems not only depend on SNR but also on wideband arameters such as delay spread and angular spread. Obstacles (buildings, trees, vehicles, lamp posts, etc.) in radio propagation environment can cause reflection, diffaction and scattering ofthe radio signal. This results in attenuation, dispersion in time and spreading in angle of the radio signal at the receiver. The resulting delay spread and angular spread affect the performance of OFDM and MIMO technologies respectively, which are adopted for future mobile network systems (LTE and WiMAX). To evaluate the performance of wideband OFDM-MIMO systems, it is therefore important that these wideband parameters be accurately predicted. Propagation modeling based on ray-tracing can be used to predict these wideband parameters. To this end, the prediction accuracies that these models can provide in different scenarios have to be evaluated. In this thesis, the prediction accuracy of received power, delay spread and angular spread that was achieved by using 3D ray-tracing prediction model has been evaluated by comparing predictions with wideband field measurements. The prediction results showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. The effects of parameter settings of ray-based propagation model on the predictions were also studied and the results are presented in this thesis.","ray-tracing modeling; OFDM systems; predictions of wideband parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Applications run on embedded DSPs become increasingly complex, while the demands on speed and power continue to grow. One method of meeting these demands is to move some of the processor complexity from hardware to the compiler. This increases the importance of the role of the compiler. This thesis describes how we ported the Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC) to the Embedded Vector Processor (EVP). GCC is a widely used open source compiler framework, which brings several advantages. It's open source nature allows the compiler developer insight into the inner workings and provides the means to change every aspect of the compiler. This allows great freedom in applying compiler optimizations as well as the ability to adapt the compiler to changes in the architecture on short notice. GCC has a large supporting community, delivering quick and accurate feedback and allows the compiler developer to benefit from the improvements contributed by its members. The EVP is a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) vector processor, developed at NXP Semiconductors and now property of ST-Ericsson. It is an embedded processor used in mobile communications to handle GSM, UMTS, 3G and 4G standards, amongst others. The goal of this project was to provide proof-of-concept that an EVP back end for GCC can be written that (1) supports all the vector types of the EVP, (2) supports custom operations in the form of the EVP-C intrinsic operations (an extension to the C language designed for the EVP) and (3) that takes advantage of features of the EVP such as post-increment and -decrement addressing, predicated execution and the ability to schedule operations on several different functional units. In this report we describe the implementation of support for vector data types and registers and support for EVP-C intrinsics. The Discrete Finite Automaton instruction scheduler in GCC was adapted to schedule VLIW code. In addition, support was implemented to schedule semantically equivalent operations on different functional units using different instruction mnemonics. For this we devised a new approach that allows us to maintain scheduling freedom while at the same time being able to split the instruction scheduling automaton into several smaller automata in order to avoid excessive build time and compilation time. We tested the compiler using the DejaGnu testing framework, the EEMBC Telecom benchmark suite and a Fast Fourier Transform benchmark which uses EVP-C intrinsics. The experimental results obtained show that the compiler generates correct code of high quality.","GCC; VLIW; Vector Processor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Swaaij, R.A.C.M.M. (mentor)","2009","Thin film silicon solar cells are produced by using plasma deposition techniques. With this technique a thin film layer of silicon, most commonly amorphous silicon (a-Si: H), can be deposited on a substrate. The material properties depend largely on the plasma properties and the growth mechanism. The investigation of the correlation between material properties and the ion bombardment, which are important for electronic device operation, is the sole aim of this thesis. Expanding Thermal Plasma Chemical Vapour Deposition (ETP-CVD) is used for the deposition of a-Si: H layers. With this deposition technique, growth rates in excess of 1nm/s can be achieved. Through this, the production cost of solar cells can be reduced because of the increase in the production output. The growth mechanism of a-Si:H layers deposited with this technique has been extensively investigated and it has been shown that SiH3 radicals contribute to about 90% of the growth. The growth mechanism of a-Si: H layers can be manipulated by applying a bias to the substrate. In this way, the contribution of ions to the growth and the ion energy can be varied. To induce ion bombardment during film growth, a non-sinusoidal pulse-shaped signal is applied to the substrate and the material properties, which include optical properties, structural properties, and electrical properties, are measured. Denser a-Si:H films are obtained with increasing ion energy, indicating material densification. Higher growth rate is observed because of the production of more radicals around the substrate. An increase in photoconductivity is obtained up to 100V, which correlates with the decrease in the Tauc band gap and the densification of the material. Increase in the ion bombardment leads to decrease in the microstructure, which indicates reduction of voids in the material. However, defect density and Urbach energy increases with the ion bombardment due to the creation of weak bonds which end up as defects in the a-Si:H films. The optimized layers of the measured samples are incorporated into solar cells. Solar cells that are produced with pulse-shaped bias voltage up to 50V yielded a conversion efficiency of 6.2%. The efficiency is lower at higher voltages, which is mainly caused by smaller Voc and FF because of high defect densities present in the intrinsic layers at higher voltages.","amorphous growth mechanism; material properties; Pulse shaped biasing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor); Goossens, K. (mentor)","2009","We propose a power e?cient branch predictor for the Cell SPU, which normally depends on compiler inserted hint instructions to predict taken branches. We designed four predictors all using Branch History Table (BHT) to store the Branch Target Address and the prediction, which is computed using a bimodal counter. The Simple Bimodal Predictor (SBP) predecodes instructions in the Instruction Line Bu?er and accesses the BHT only for a branch instruction and ignores hints. For the second design, four ways to combine hints with the SBP are studied, by not or partially overruling hints by the predictor. We also introduce Branch Warnings (BW). The SPU only accesses the predictor when a BW or a hint is executed and hints can be overruled. The Aggressive Bimodal Predictor is an aggressive implementation of the SBP that starts predicting when instructions are fetched from local store. It is not designed for energy e?ciency but to investigate the maximum possible speedup for a branch predictor not using hints. Results show that a SBP in combination with overruling hints (SBP-OH-NLS) and a 256-entry BHT can have a speedup of 18.8%. The Branch Warning predictor is the fastest in some occasions, however a non optimal compiler makes it the worst for others. The SBP has the lowest performance overall. The estimated extra power needed for the SBP and SBP-OH-NLS is about 1% of the total SPE power and even less for the BW-OH-NLS. The energy-delay product is reduced the most for the SBP-OH-NLS.","energy efficient; branch prediction; SPU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Compare the 1D spectrum computed in SWAN (Svasek, 2007) with it measured by buoy OS4 in the Oosterschelde Estuary, serious underestimation of wave energy can be found on low-frequency band. Investigation has been performed to find the possible reasons for the missing energy on low frequency part. In this study, diffraction is hypothesized as the reason owing to 1) the model constructed by Svasek has no diffraction; 2) diffraction does re-distribute the wave energy from areas with rapid spatial variation in amplitude to areas with low amplitudes. Before the diffraction is added to the Oosterschelde Estuary in the SWAN model, two sub-tests have been studied beforehand. 1. A ray tracing model (REFRAC model) is applied to the Oosterschelde Estuary for two purposes: 1) to find the existence of diffraction in the Oosterschelde Estuary; 2) to validate the refraction effects in the SWAN model. A parallel case called Canyon case is applied to the REFRAC model first to provide a reference. The results show that areas with rapid variations in amplitudes exist in the Oosterschelde Estuary. It is necessary to take diffraction into consideration. The effects of refraction in the SWAN model work well. 2. Three academic cases have been performed in advance to validate the diffraction implementation in the SWAN model. They are the Semi-infinite Breakwater Case, the Gap in Infinite Breakwater Case and the Ridge Case, respectively. The results show that diffraction has apparent effects in the SWAN model. The underestimation of wave energy in the lee of the breakwaters has been improved. Diffraction in SWAN compensates the refraction over irregular bottom albeit it is not accurate enough. Model in SWAN with diffraction, under certain spatial resolution and with smaller number of smoothing steps is suggested. By performing the Oosterschelde Estuary in the SWAN model with diffraction, the results show that diffraction has apparent effects when the incoming waves at the boundaries are unidirectional. However, when the incoming waves have broader directional spreading, diffraction cannot solve the underestimation which can be resulted from the fact that diffraction effects of the wave components may cancel each other. Therefore, further investigations with respect to local wind sea and the ambient currents are suggested as future work since these two processes induce the wave energy on low-frequency band flow. In addition, the effects of the directional spreading of the incoming waves at the boundaries are suggested to be further studied since the value of the directional spreading is critical to the diffraction implementation in the SWAN model.","the SWAN model; Oosterschelde; diffraction; refraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

We learn to recognize facial expressions long before we learn to communicate verbally. Facial expressions are the most effective way to communicate our emotions. For years most researchers centred their attention in the automatic recognition of facial expressions and the most important for them was the recognition of the shape of mouth, eyes and eyebrows. Nowadays, researchers are getting more interested in the automatic generation of facial expressions using an input text. This approach can be of a big importance in many disciplines, such as human communication through computer interfaces and games. Based on this approach, my Master thesis will be focused on building a Non-verbal Emotional Dictionary (NED) where the most important aspect is the relation between from one side an emotional word, and from the other side its corresponding facial expression coded by Action Units (AU) representation and facial expression. This dictionary can then be used as a bridge between an emotional text analyzer and a 3D Talking face system to mimic humane conversations using emotions in a virtual world. To accomplish this, the database of the NED system should include a number of the most used emotional words with there corresponding AU’s. Of course this database will not include all existing emotional words, but will use another database, the Dictionary of Affect Language (DAL) to find the link between the words that are not listed in my database to words that are listed in it. This database (NED) will help, when combined with a 3D talking face system with a text as its input, in the automatic generation of facial expressions. The idea consists of, given an input text, the system should be able to recognize the different emotions and the mood that this input text contains. In this way the “3D face” system should be, in the future, able to read a text or a story as emotionally as a human would do. Using such technology we will achieve a big step in the future of the human communication in the digital world.","emotion; emotional; non-verbal; dictionary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","",""

This is caused by the growing ship dimensions and/or intensities. A functional flexible lock is the solution for extending the functional lifespan. This type of lock is, with or without a few structural adjustments, capable of serving the shipping traffic for its whole structural lifespan. This design approach will be applied on the lock complex ‘Sluis Sambeek’, which is located in the Meuse route. The first part of the study is carried out on the basis of the Life Cycle Management (LCM) approach. The LCM is started with a trend forecast, from which follows that the future ship sizes are normative for the required lock dimensions. After that, three alternatives are elaborated: 1. Zero-alternative: renovation of the lock. 2. Functional flexible lock: standard lock that is built large enough at once. 3. Structural flexible lock: a relatively easy extendable navigation lock. The maximum dimensions are reached stepwise. Alternative 2 appears to be the least expensive option for ‘Sluis Sambeek’. Although alternative 3 is the most expensive option, this alternative is elaborated further, because it is the most innovative option and could be a better solution for another lock reconstruction. The structural flexibility in alternative 3 is formed by the lock chamber which exists of relatively simple replaceable sheet pile walls, and by floatable lock heads that can be replaced by wider lock heads. The construction planning and the structural lock head design are the innovative parts that are elaborated most specifically. It is concluded that it is useful to consider both the possibilities of a functional and a structural flexible lock design for ‘Sluis Sambeek’ or for another lock location.","Inland navigation lock; Flexible design; Life Cycle Management; Meuse route","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In these networks, the optical signals deteriorate due to the physical impairments they encounter as they traverse multiple links. This necessitates regeneration of the signals at the intermediate nodes so that the signals will reach the destination with an acceptable level of quality. In translucent optical networks, the regenerators are sparsely placed in the network. Some applications that are transported over these networks require a guaranteed end-to-end quality of service (QoS). The QoS routing in these networks involves two tasks: guaran- teeing the end-to-end QoS requirement, and making sure that the signal quality will be acceptable at the destination by considering the physical impairments. In this thesis, we present physical impairment-aware QoS routing algorithms in translucent optical networks. We have proposed exact and heuristic algorithms that aim at optimally satisfying the QoS requirements, and minimizing the number of regenerators used along the selected path. The attractive feature of our algorithms is that they incorporate both the physical impairments and the regenerator assignment into the path computation process. As a result, the paths are computed efficiently. The experimental results show that each of our algorithms has its own aspect of fitness where it should be the best choice over the others.","QoS; impairment-aware; optical routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

Many digital watermarking algorithms have been proposed in special and transform domains. The techniques in the spatial domain still have relatively low-bit capacity and are not resistant enough to lossy image compression and other image processing operations. For instance, a simple noise in the image may eliminate the watermark. On the other hand, frequency domain-based techniques can embed more bits for watermark and are more robust to attack. Some transforms such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used for watermarking in the frequency domain. In this thesis, we compare the DCT watermarking algorithms and especially the DWT watermarking algorithms based on robustness criteria. In other words, the robustness of different transform watermark algorithms is evaluated by applying different attacks. One main reason to consider the DWT watermarking algorithms is that several multimedia standards such as the JPEG2000 and MPEG-4 are based on the DWT. These new standards brought new requirements such as progressive, low bit rate transmission, and region-of-interest coding.","digital image watermarking; image processing; DCT and DWT; Matlab Tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering Laboratory","","","",""

Prefabricated immersible elements are applied to form a dry construction platform in the canal. On top of this platform a caisson is constructed and subsequently immersed into the ground by means of the so-called ‘pneumatic caisson’ method. The entire garage is made by construction, immersion and interconnection of several of such caissons. Although slightly more expensive than traditional construction methods, the elaborated concept turns out to be very promising in an urban environment. The absence of a dry cofferdam is a significant advantage over traditional bottom-up methods, especially regarding soil deformations and the risk of leaking retaining walls.","parking garage; pneumatic caisson; prefab immersion element; underwater construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Cardiotoxicity is a common side-effect of drugs and a major cause of late-stage drug rejections, costing the pharmaceutical companies massive amounts of money. A drug is cardiotoxic when it has a negative influence on the heart. Often, it changes the electrophysiological characteristics of the heart, resulting in arrhythmia. This can have potentially fatal consequences. Thus, it would be desirable to have a reliable, early-stage indicator of the cardiotoxicity of a drug. A stretchable microelectrode array probing the electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes under influence of a drug could be a big improvement in cardiotoxicity drug screening. It has two advantages over current systems employing human embryonic stem cell (HESC)-derived cardiomyocytes. It allows anisotropic contraction of the heart cells, mimicking a real heart more closely, and it could train the cardiomyocytes; both primarily due to the stretchable nature of the device. A prototype of a stretchable MEA was designed, using the silicone elastomer PDMS as stretchable substrate and wavy gold tracks as stretchable conductors. The device consists of the following basic parts: - Support - Patterned release layer - Stretchable substrate - Electrodes - Interconnect - Patterned insulation layer - Container for nutritious solution - Cell pattern A process flow was developed to fabricate the device. The device could almost be fully fabricated. The only problem that was not solved was the failure to contact the bond pads.

With the many advantages of optical technology, multimedia applications which require strict quality of service(QoS) are able to be guaranteed in an optical network. Unfortunately, the optical technology still have some limits in setting up a connection. One of these limits is that a lightpath must use the same wavelength on all the links along its path from source to destination in an optical network without wavelength converters. This limit influents the resource utilization. In an optical network, wavelength converters are used to overcome this limit so they will help to improve the efficiency of the resource utilization. However, because of their expensiveness, a limited number of wavelength converters are usually used at some routers in optical networks. Many researchers have been working on multi-domain routing protocol for optical networks. In this thesis, we will implement and evaluate the performance of three optical inter-domain protocols in an optical network with wavelength converters. In particular three protocols which are discussed in dept are: Optical Border Gateway Protocol (OBGP), Optical Border Gateway Protocol Plus (OBGP+) and IDRA-based Routing Protocol (IDRA protocol). By building the simulations for each protocol in OPNET, we compare the performance of the three protocols based on two metrics: the blocking ratio of inter-domain lightpath requests and the overall number of routing messages to archive this blocking ratio. Moreover, we also evaluate the efficiency of wavelength converters in an optical network.","optical networks; wavelength converters; optical inter-domain routing protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","It has been found by many researchers that low frequency (LF) waves dominate the wave energy spectrum in very shallow water. Given that many longshore and cross-shore morphological processes are located within this zone, LF waves play an important role in determining morphological change, especially dune erosion and overwash during storm events. The numerical model, XBeach [Roelvink et al. (2008)], has been developed to simulate such morphological processes which are influenced by LF waves. For hydrodynamics, it utilizes the wave forcing determined from a second generation wave module to drive linearized shallow water equations within a flow module. The objective of this thesis focuses on validating the hydrodynamics of XBeach with particular attention paid to the estimated LF waves. This is particularly important to correctly estimate morphological changes, as it is highly dependent on the accurate representation of waves and currents. In the validation study, XBeach is used to replicate the flume experiment of van Noorloos [2003] in which bichromatic and irregular wave conditions are imposed on a plane sloping beach. The advantage of using this experiment is that measurements have a high spatial resolution, allowing for decomposition into incoming and outgoing wave components. Group-varying time-averaged short wave parameters are used to investigate the accuracy of the short wave module in XBeach, while at the same time the relationship between the short waves and LF waves are determined by looking at the energy transfer to and from the LF components. The results confirm many previous findings, such as the plus 180 degree phase difference between the short wave envelope and the bound LF wave, the dominance of LF wave energy in shallow water and the ability of LF waves to extend their reach to the uppermost parts on a beach. Given the limitations of the assumptions based on linear wave theory, the short wave results from XBeach are quite good, especially when using a newly modified breaker parameterization of Battjes and Janssen [1978] by Roelvink [Pers. Com. 2009]. The main shortfall of the model is that it tends to overestimate the bound LF wave heights in shallow water for irregular waves. This is believed to be partly due to the overestimation of the energy and radiation stresses contained in the short waves in this region. In reality, as waves approach breaking, the non-linearities present in the waves increase, which, during breaking, effectively redistributes energy within the wave spectrum. Since frequency dependent shoaling of short waves is not currently enabled in XBeach, the energy within the HF band may tend to encourage continued shoaling of the LF waves in the surf zone. As such, it is recommended that the current wave action conservation scheme be improved to allow for either reduction or redistribution of the short wave energy during shoaling. Wave run-up as modelled with the linearized shallow water equations is shown to over-steepen the front of the LF wave in the swash zone. This effect is a likely result of the numerical scheme used, which tends to limit the maximum run-up height based on a minimum depth for which a computational grid cell is determined to be wet. In general, XBeach has shown that it is capable of modelling both quantitatively and qualitatively the short wave energy flux and LF wave shoaling and reflection quite will without inducing serious errors from the linear simplifications in the wave module. Wave-current interaction, which was not considered in the modelling, can most likely give even better results if it is successfully incorporated in the model.","low frequency waves; infragravity waves; wave shoaling; wave breaking; energy transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2009","Diffraction diagrams are frequently utilized by engineers within the feasibility and early design phases of a project. These helpful graphics, based on directional spreading and wavelength, can be used for a number of layouts and angles of incidence. In spite of the tendency to design breakwaters for the fullest dissipation of wave energy, current diffraction diagrams in use are for full reflection. They have a very strict view of the breakwaters themselves; solely an infinitely thin, fully reflecting, vertical breakwater without any transmission or overtopping. This study focuses on the changes to the diffraction patterns once construction aspects related to breakwater reflection are considered. The alteration to diffraction coefficients due to wave spectra variations, both directional and frequency, is examined through the use of theory and advanced modeling systems. It is found that the directional spectrum causes large changes while frequency variation is negligible. This primary driving component is than related to breakwater layout and incident angles. A study of literature related to breakwater reflection is used in advanced computer models to determine where and how much this characteristic contributes to the diffraction pattern. Two separate types of models, phase-resolving and phase-averaging, are used to test breakwater reflection in diffraction modeling. This comparison confirms theoretical assumptions, finds possible faults in current diffraction diagrams, and creates new questions about breakwater tip physics. The full analysis shows that breakwater reflectivity causes little change to the diffraction pattern beyond the area closest to the breakwater. The areas of greatest influence are located at the breakwater tips, which can be associated with reflection off the breakwater’s front face, and along the leeside of the breakwater, which can be attributed to the absorption of the leeside’s reduced reflectivity. Therefore, the need for new, updated diffraction diagrams based on reflectivity is unnecessary. As a secondary objective of this study, the usefulness of using the SWAN modeling program for diffraction studies was examined. This topic is of importance as SWAN is an efficient alternative to more computationally intensive modeling programs. In addition, it is a free software which is universally available. Believed to be incapable of computing rapidly changing wave environments near breakwaters or in harbor situations, SWAN performed diffraction remarkably well for broad directional waves. More narrow directionally spread waves had good accuracy throughout with only minor scaling differences. SWAN, within this study, was unable to replicate the effects of reflection on both sides of a breakwater and therefore was not used for the primary objective.","Diffraction; Reflection; SWAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Geers, K. (mentor); Deboutte, N. (mentor); Riedijk, M. (mentor)","2009","Urban Reaction The thesis proposal comes out as a result of seeing the City of Brussels as a Mundaneum. At the beginning of the process, an analysis of the two main axis of the city revealed that the area that is in direct relation with the canal and the actual Harbour is not defined. Which is why, this area was choose as a possible site for the project. Historically speaking, the canal and all the infrastructure that relates with it had been remove in several occasions along time. At present days, the harbour is intended to be moved once again, leaving this area as a vacant space, creating a hole in the city. As an urban reaction, the idea is to keep this empty space which will be generated and give it to the city, creating a new park in the area which will include this location in the structure of parks of Brussels. Furthermore, the project proposes the generation of a new primary element which will border the park in order to avoid the city to invade the space. Public Pools Program The Mundaneum was a project proposed by Paul Oulet, considered as a building that would hold together all the knowledge of the world. As a first reaction to the problem of Mundaneum, it is intended for the primary element to act as a counter project for the other parks of the city. In one hand, all the other important parks are located in the highest points of the topography while the project is proposed for the lowest part of it. Also, the other parks contain buildings that are in direct relation with the expression of power, either political or religious. The thesis proposed a project that will hold a program that is not related with power, but a project for people. As long as one of the main elements of the site is the presence of water, and, that public baths since Roman Empire had always been considered as monuments for people. It was decided that this program was the most suitable for the proposed building. Design Infrastructures are primary elements per excellence because they either can accelerate or retard the urban process. In order to create a primary element in this point it was decided to create a new infrastructure which at the same time will provide a service for the city, it will work with the canal and hold the public program. In order to do this, the thesis proposed to merge in one single element architecture and infrastructure. In this sense, the thesis creates a water treatment plant merged with the program of a public pool. The building takes the water from the canal, purifies it and uses it for the pools, giving the building the spirit of machine that creates its own elemental basis to generate leisure for people. The Building is composed by system of steel truss frame structures created by the repetition and placement of a basic element of 7,5 by 7,5 m, which allows to create a mega structure of 600m long by 260m wide capable to save long distances without support and hold the machinery needed for the infrastructure and to generate the spaces needed for the program. This steel structure composes the main load bearing system, which is revealed in the façade, giving the building the expression of a giant industrial machine. Furthermore, the main load bearing system holds together a serious of substructures that contain the inside spaces and are based on modular systems that come out from the dimensions of the main structure. The substructures change in scale from outside to inside, maintaining the monumentality of the infrastructure to the outside and transforming it to the scale of a building to the inside. At the inside, the process of water purification is revealed becoming part of the public program of the building. Metaphor The expression that was looked for the building is the expression of an old fabric in which the pools become a piece of purified water inside an space which may not be considered as a proper environment for this type of program, the purified pools come as a result of a process of the re use of the polluted water from the canal, as an analogy of how infrastructures generate the base for societies to work. This analogy becomes a metaphor of a Mundaneum, because there is no need for the project to stack pieces of knowledge production because society is the one that produces knowledge demonstrating that it can also be a project devoted for people as long as it creates an absolute outbreak in our traditional way of life, and this project creates that outbreak in an urban, architectural, and programmatic levels.","Mundaneum; Public Pools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-31","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

Hydraulic parameters during extreme events and local mangrove vegetation parameters were estimated for the Kanika Sands mangrove island near the upcoming Dhamra Port in Orissa, India. Simplified generic analyses were first conducted to obtain insights into the characteristics and behaviour of the model and the system. These were used to select relevant scenarios for simulations of actual conditions at the case-study site. The mangroves were found to be effective in reducing wave heights at the port behind the island though the effectiveness is limited by its geometry and distance from the port. The presence of vegetation has a marked effect though the effect of a variation in vegetation density is limited. An optimum cross-shore width range for maximum protection was quantified. The required size of the mangrove patch for maximum wave attenuation under all conditions is 300 to 800 m in the cross-shore direction and around 6 km in the alongshore direction. At present the vegetation is 1.5 km cross-shore by a 4 km alongshore at a maximum with a shape that is slightly different from the optimum. Given the conditions of the area northward expansion is considered more relevant. Vegetation strips around the island seem to be an effective option though the effects of density reductions become important in this case. Model characteristics such as the sensitivity trend of hydraulic parameters and the comparative effects of emergent and submergent vegetation were also investigated. Conclusions regarding model and system characteristics observed during the study were also drawn. Finally, based on the work done recommendations were made regarding mangrove management options for the port and directions for future research in case of further numerical modeling, physical modeling and field studies.","Mangroves; Cyclone; Wave Attenuation; Dhamra Port; Kanika Sands; SWAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The main objective of this project is to propose alternatives to low-income housing, amplifying local skills and cultural consciousness, facilitating autonomy through local production and trade, as well as creating the possibilities of political manifestation through the strengthening of communal facilities. The wasteland in between the Las Americas gated community and the dried-out Lake Caracol is zoned for industrial use as in its current condition, it is not fit for housing developments due to soil and dust pollution. The proposal is to improve the environmental condition by making the 900 ha former lake productive through water-based agriculture with related processing facilities along its border. The proposed agricultural model is based on chinampas, a pre-Hispanic agricultural system with productive fields within a large body of water, which is still practiced in contemporary Mexico City. This will allow to urbanize the wasteland in order to propose an alternative model for urbanization with 14 000 units, approximately the same as Las Americas. The aim of the architectural design proposal is to develop a new model for urbanization that will counter previously mentioned urban problematics, based on higher urban density, meaning not only volumetric built density, but also mixed functions, less open space and rather more usable public space which will ultimately lead to an increase in density of social relations. Specifically, housing typologies will be developed that relate closely to the production and processing project mentioned above as well as other small-scale commercial activities. Seeing the low density and the mono-functionality of Las Americas, densification and introduction of new planned land uses within its suburban fabric becomes a key strategy. As the priority given to cars is what provides this low density, the proposal is to invade excessive public space of roads through the addition of housing as well as commercial functions. The final objective is to link the existing suburban fabric to the new mid-high density urban development that is proposed above.","urban; mexico; sustainable; social; process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Delft School of Design","","","",""

(mentor); Loset, S. (mentor)","2009","Thesis deals with finite element (FE) simulation of borehole jack (BHJ) tests in ice. The purpose of the thesis was to simulate elastic-plastic range shown in BHJ tests, compare measured ice stiffnesses with obtained from simulations, fit plastic range, investigate plastic properties and stress descending in surrounding ice. Eight BHJ tests carried out at different depths of different boreholes in the first-year ice ridge have been taken for simulation. Tests were performed in ice blocks of sail and in consolidated layer. Two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) models were developed in FE program Abaqus 6.8-2. Plane strain situation was assumed in 2-D model. In reality this can correspond to the BHJ test at the depth of sufficient ice confinement. 3-D model considered thicknesses of ice blocks. Elastic moduli obtained in uniaxial tests of samples taken in the vicinity of the BHJ tests were used as a material input. The ice in simulation was assumed isotropic, because of severe distortion, and independent of strain rate, since it is not known at the beginning of the test. Simulations were carried out up to the measured peak stresses, softening and fracture of the ice was not covered. Stiffnesses obtained in 2-D simulations were lower than the measured, average error was 27.1%, while 3-D model gave stiffnesses in general higher and average error was 55.8%, however high value of the error is governed mainly by two results. Stiffnesses simulated with 2-D and 3-D models showed the same pattern as elastic moduli. It was shown that the thinner ice confinement of BHJ leads to the lower stiffnesses, and 2-D model could not take this fact into account. Fitting of elastic-plastic range was carried out with 3-D model, therefore lower values of elastic moduli had to be taken for fitting of elastic range. Some facts, which could lead to lower measured values of in situ stiffness, are discussed: interpretation of BHJ output pressure-displacement diagram, action of BHJ on both sides of the borehole. Introducing of plastic hardening was required for fitting of measured curves up the peak stresses, thinner confinement required higher degree of hardening. Fitting of measured diagrams required introducing of input materials with peak stresses in average 1.8 times higher than the ones of corresponding brittle uniaxial specimens. It was shown that to some extend plastic hardening in BHJ tests is due to confinement of surrounding ice. And also concluded that testing conditions could increase the brittleness of uniaxial samples, therefore plastic range in uniaxial samples was not shown. Stress descending in 2-D and 3-D models showed profile similar to the theoretical solution of stress descending in the circular plate with a concentric hole with internal pressure. 3-D model showed closer profile. Obtained results had good correspondence with the measured value. In experiment of Barrault and Strub-Klein (2009), at the distance of 4 borehole diameters stress descended down to 2% of stress measured by BHJ, while it was 3.6% in 2-D, 0.4% in 3-D model, theoretical approach gave 1.2%. Therefore it is possible to conclude that theoretical approach can be used for preliminary estimations of stress descending quite safely. Many uncertainties arose due to the fact that input used for BHJ tests simulation was taken from the BHJ tests performed in the sea ice ridge. Simulation of BHJ tests carried out in the level ice of known thickness, with input material parameters obtained from the field testing will help to validate numerical model. Introduction of fracture mechanics in the model is also required for further improvements.","Borehole jack test; Finite element simulations; Ice stiffness; Elastic-plastic range","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

They are found in tropical and semi tropical areas spread throughout South-east Asia, the Caribbean, the Indonesian archipelago, on Australian coasts and in the Pacific islands. Coral reefs are subject to both anthropogenic and natural threats such as biological perturbations, floods, outflows carrying pollutants from land, runoff sediment, sewage, oil wastes, mining and quarrying processes, fisheries, tourism and coastal urbanization. The period for which these pollutants stay within the lagoon depends on the residence time. The longer a pollutant stays in the lagoon before being flushed away, the more destructive it will be to the lagoon and coral reef ecosystem. Residence time is probably influenced by many factors. This study established two numerical models, a simple model and the Delft3D model, of a lagoon fringed by coral reefs with tides as the boundary conditions. The study compares the simple and Delft3D model. Then a sensitivity analysis is made of several important parameters such as tides, coral reef depth, inlet geometry and lagoon geometry.","coral reef; hydrodynamics; residence time; water circulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The objective of this study is to increase knowledge about the heterogeneity of the Delft Sandstone Member for the construction of a future heterogeneous dynamic reservoir model of the Delft Sandstone Member. The present study comprises a core study presented in a core log; this core log is linked to a GR log, a porosity log and a permeability log. In the core log a description of the core is given. It contains the lithofacies, sandstone/silty sandstone /siltstone, the grain size, other features such as the presence of coal pieces and fractures and clay clasts. The Delft Sandstone Member is divided in 5 sandstone bodies, at the bottom three single sandstone bodies, in the middle a multiple stacked sandstone body and at the top a single sandstone body. The sandstone bodies have a fining upward trend. By linking the core log to the petrophysical logs it can be seen that there are five zones. At the bottom of the Delft Sandstone Member there is a low porosity and permeability zone, but the porosity and permeability increases towards the top of the Delft Sandstone Member with a small decline in both properties near the top of the formation. From the link between the permeability log and the core log it is interpreted that fractures and laminated coal are responsible for a decrease in permeability in the Delft Sandstone Member. The results can be put in a new dynamic reservoir model to make a better prediction of the fluid flow in the Delft Sandstone Member.","Delft Aardwarmte Project; Delft Sandstone Member; heterogeneity; core log","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Applied Geology","","","",""

(mentor); Armstrong, S. (mentor); Carroll, B. (mentor)","2009","Managed realignment involves the deliberate breaching of engineered defences to allow landward coastal migration whilst at the same time creating intertidal marshes and mudflats. Over the last two decades, this practice has become more common; however, the monitoring of realignment schemes is relatively limited and morphological changes are generally not monitored in great detail. The monitoring programmes of the sites in the Humber Estuary are a clear example of this issue; here the morphological changes of the four realigned sites are mostly represented by generalised rates of accretion or erosion. The aim of the this study was to analyse in detail the morphological changes that have taken place at the four managed realignment sites in the Humber Estuary, using LiDAR in order to obtain elevation change plots, cross section profiles, hypsometric curves and sediment volumes in an ArcGIS environment. In addition the physical processes driving these morphological changes were also identified and the future evolution trend of the sites was proposed. The four managed realignment sites in the Humber Estuary presented an accretionary trend over the period of analysis, driven by tides and characterised by high deposition rates during the first years after breaching. However, clear differences in the evolution of the sites were observed, mainly related to the sites location along the Humber Estuary and their configuration. Furthermore, it is thought that, due to the high concentration of suspended sediments in the estuary, the long term sustainability of mudflat habitats (i.e. beyond 10 years) will be difficult with rapid accretion rates within the sites mostly leading to saltmarsh development. The use of LiDAR data in order to monitor morphological changes in managed realignment sites has several advantages; most importantly, the method covers large areas in a relatively small period of time providing detailed data. However, inaccuracies are observed in relation to the presence of water or vegetation, as well as reflective mud surfaces.","managed realignment; LiDAR; humber estuary; GIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

(mentor); Van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2009","A lot of research has been carried out in the past on wind turbine wake aerodynamics. Models exist for both the near field and the far wake. The near wake is governed by a typical vortex structure that gradually decays due to viscous and turbulent mixing effects, forming the less structured far wake region. The formation of the far field from the rotor region and near wake is not completely understood yet. In this thesis an attempt is made to develop a simple model that tries to capture the decay of the vortex wake within the first two diameters downstream of the rotor. A free wake lifting line vortex model has been developed. Viscous effects have been added to the vortex code in the form of vortex core models and a simple model that describes the turbulent decay of circulation as a function of ambient turbulence intensity. Furthermore models for simulating wind shear and the presence of the nacelle have been implemented. A thorough validation study of the model has been carried out by means of hot-film and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Close to the rotor the model compares well with the induced velocities measured with a hot-film. PIV measurements show that the model captures the position of the tip vortex quite well within the first diameter downstream. The measured velocity field can however not be reproduced correctly by the code. No measurements were available that can validate the turbulent decay of the vortex wake; instead suggestions are made for an experiment in the Open Jet Facility of the faculty of Aerospace Engineering The new model is only valid in the region of the wake where the vortex structure of the wake is still in tact which is typically between one or two diameters downstream. Further downstream the outputs from the model may be used as an input for a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model that describes the far wake of the rotor.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AEWE - Windenergy","","","",""

A newly developed composite seawall concept could be a vitally important technique for wave energy conversion. A 3-D model of composite seawall has been simulated to comprehend its hydraulic performance. Composite seawall is a dual-purpose overtopping type of coastal shoreline device and wave energy conversion is considered as by-product of the seawall. Overtopped water generates hydraulic head convertible to electricity by means of low head hydro-power generator. A 3-D physical model of composite seawall has been developed and tested for both normal and oblique waves in this study. Fraude scale laws (geometric scale 1:50) are followed in the model scaling. Total 72 simulations are conducted, and overtopping and hydraulic power generated at the crest of the ramp of the composite seawall for each simulated wave parameters are recorded. Hydraulic performances are measured based on the input wave parameters and results. Wave breaker screen is also modeled and tested (by 12 simulations) to measure its suitability as outfall. Results show that maximum achievable hydraulic efficiency of the composite seawall is about 33.6 % and average hydraulic efficiencies are about 26.6%, 18.6%, 15.9% and 11.1% for the freeboard of 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m and 2.0 m respectively. Hydraulic performance decreases for oblique wave approaches. Average hydraulic efficiency of a composite seawall (having 1.0 m freeboard) is about 20% in case of 1.0 m tidal variation. Composite seawall is not suitable option for high tidal variations and low wave heights. Wave breaker screen is a suitable outfall option but it decreases hydraulic head generated in the composite sea walls up to 12.5%. Composite sea walls for wave energy extraction could be suitable option in such a remote place such as Islands, where conventional energy supply would be highly expensive and rarely possible.","composite seawall; overtopping; wave energy conversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","section Hydraulic Engineering","","Erasmus Mundus MSc CoMEM","",""

The third-generation SWAN model was used to compute the wave processes in a tidal inlet for storm conditions. The computed wave processes are propagation (shoaling, refraction and frequency shifting), generation (wind input), non-linear wave-wave interactions (quadruplet wave-wave interactions and triad wave-wave interactions), dissipation (white capping, depth induced breaking and bottom friction), and the work done by the currents against the radiation stresses. The results were normalised, which resulted in the time scales of all wave processes. The time scales were of the order 100s – 1,000s, except for the work done by the currents against the radiation stresses, which is of the order of 1,000s – 10,000s.

Depth-induced breaking is a subject that has been widely studied, resulting in many scalings on the Battjes and Janssen model. The Battjes and Janssen model, the biphase scaling and the Nelson scaling were selected to compare results in terms of significant wave height. The parameter of interest is the model coefficient . The models were tested with the SWAN model on three different test cases; two reef cases and one sloping bottom profile. The wave period appeared to have a strong influence on the prediction of the significant wave height, in particular on the biphase scaling. The best model over the three test cases statistically is the Nelson scaling.","waves; physics; breaking; SWAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","hydraulic engineering - Environmental Fluid Mechanics","","","",""

A technique called Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration is based on a principle of reconfiguring a small region of the FPGA, while the remainder of the device remains operational. This thesis will investigate the current status of the field of dynamic partial reconfiguration and select the most promising technique for implementation. A proof-of-concept system will be designed and implemented using the selected technique in order to clearly uncover the properties and possibilities of dynamic partial reconfiguration. The implemented system is an audio processor, capable of manipulating sound through the use of several filters. All filters can be replaced while the system remains functional by performing partial reconfiguration. As such, this system also provides a platform upon which new filters can be designed and tested. The MOLEN polymorphic processor is a processor architecture that supports the notion of partial reconfiguration. The technique for partial reconfiguration selected in this thesis will be tested for compatibility with the existing implementation of the MOLEN processor.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

The essence of coastal planning and management in the future relies on an accurate coastal flood risk assessment with regards to sea level rise. Through the set up of flood risk assessment model in Geographic Information System (GIS) using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data, flood height data, and sea level rise estimate based on IPCC high emission scenario, areas at risk of inundation at Seberang Perai (highly developed area) and Kuantan-Pekan (less developed area) in Malaysia were identified. Flood maps were produced subsequently. Damage costs associated with a given flood event were calculated through the identification land value of different land use categories. Four flood management tools had been utlisied in the study. They include “Do nothing”, “Flood insurance”, “No development” and “Hold the line”. The costeffectiveness of these flood management tools was evaluated over a course of 200-year based on a 1 in 200-year flood event for both study locations. Results from the study show that the effectiveness of flood management tools varies with location and land use pattern. However, in both locations, “Flood insurance” is concluded to be the most economically viable option for coastal zone management in Malaysia in the future as the damage cost incurred from a flood event is effectively reduced via the implementation of “Flood insurance” policy. Flood insurance is currently not a common practice in Malaysia. However, in order to reduce the uncertaities resulted from flood risk assessment, the study recommends more accurate elevation data to be captured for future analysis. Besides, it is also recognised that there is a need for Malaysia to maintain long term measurement of sea level.","flood risk; climate change; Malaysia; sea level rise; IPCC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Gachet, M. (mentor)","2009","The first Dynamic Positioning (DP) systems emerged in the 1960's from the need for deep water drilling by the offshore oil and gas industry, as conventional mooring systems, like a jack-up barge or an anchored rig, can only be used in shallow waters. GustoMSC has been developing DP drill ships since the early 1970's and it is still one of their core businesses. DP systems automatically control the position and heading of a ship subjected to environmental and external forces, using its own actuators. The thrust allocator of a DP system is responsible for the thrust distribution over the actuators of the ship. Apart from minimizing the power consumption an ideal thrust allocator can also take other aspects into account, such as forbidden/spoil zones and thruster relations. Because the Lagrange multiplier method, used inhouse by GustoMSC for thrust allocation, cannot accurately describe fullscale DP systems with rudders and forbidden/spoil zones, new methods need to be explored. Various optimal thrust allocation methods for dynamic positioning of ships are considered and their practical use is tested with DP capability calculations and time domain simulations with online optimization routines. The shortcomings of Lagrange multiplier methods are illustrated and quadratic programming methods combined with disjunctive programming techniques are used to present a more elaborate solution to optimal thrust allocation problems. Using disjunctive programming each actuator is modeled by a finite union of convex polygons representing the attainable thrust region. This approach allows combinations of non-rotatable thrusters, rotatable azimuth thrusters with forbidden/spoil zones and main propeller/rudder pairs to be used. As a consequence the allocation problem decomposes into a finite number of subproblems that all need to be solved separately in order to find the optimal solution of the main problem. For time domain simulations the dynamic limitations of the thrusters are taken into account by adding more convex thrust regions to the problem. Briefly, the potential use of linear matrix inequalities for optimal thrust allocation problems is treated. The obtained results are discussed and conclusions are given.","Dynamic Positioning; Thrust Allocation; Lagrange multiplier; Optimal Thrust Allocation; Quadratic Programming; Disjunctive Programming; DP Capability Plot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice in which test cases are written before code implementation. ISM eCompany, who specializes in web solutions, is adapting their development process to become more agile. One of those adaptations is that ISM wants to introduce TDD into their development process, to have projects with a better code quality and a regression test suite. ISM only worries whether the writing of test cases do create too much overhead for the developers and using a TDD approach does not have a large effect on the time spent on fixing bugs and rework. This can cause the projects to overrun and that makes the practice TDD not cost-effective. This thesis will describe a case study of the introduction of TDD in two different projects at ISM. We have proven that TDD can be introduced into the development process of ISM. By introducing TDD in two projects of ISM we tried to determine whether TDD is cost-effective by determining the Return on Investment (ROI). This cost-effectiveness could, due to the insufficient dataset, only be assessed in a limited way. In the monitored projects the developers took 31% more time for developing work items. On the other hand, the developers spent less time on rework and bugs than in projects where no TDD is used. However, it is hard to conclude that this is due to the usage of a TDD approach, because of the low percentage of work items implemented with a TDD approach (17% of the work items). The developers struggled with TDD, because of the lack of experience with writing test cases.","TDD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Technische Informatica","","","",""

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor); Bahaj, A.S. (mentor)","2009","With the instability of oil prices and the increasing of people’s awareness in environmental problems, renewable energy is the key solution of these problems. Tidal energy, with its advantages of being predictable and its high energy density, is one of the most promising renewable energy forms. Indonesia’s topographic conditions with plenty of narrow strait between the islands and its strategic location between two oceans make the tidal energy development in Indonesia looks promising. This study is intended to assess tidal energy resources in Indonesia. A case study in Alas Strait, a pioneer study for this site, is selected among many prospective sites considering its relative shallow depth, high current velocity, and location which far from major shipping line. Princeton Ocean Model (POM) is used to model the flow pattern in the site. It uses the bathymetric map to represent the depth and applies tidal elevation in open boundary condition as generating force. The result from POM is then used to quantify the extractable energy resources using farm method. The model result shows that current velocity in Alas Strait is relatively high, i.e. could reach up to 2 m/s in certain locations during spring tide. Array of typical Marine Current Turbine (MCT) is then placed in specific locations in Alas Strait (depends on water depth) to simulate the tidal energy extraction. New method of estimating downstream current velocity based on direction of the flow is applied to calculate the total power from the array. This results in 27.065 GWh/month for current MCT scenario with depth limitation and 52.736 GWh/month for floating MCT scenario. To conclude, Alas Strait has the potential to be the location of MCT installation. This may be not feasible in the current time since the cost for implementing MCT is still relatively high. However, with the maturity of the technology, lower cost, and the urge to “go green”, this will be applicable in the future.","tidal energy; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

The empirical distribution was simulated based on laboratory and field measurement water elevation data. Both sets of data indicated the presence of abnormal wave ensuring the extreme condition aimed at in this study. The literature review was performed to identify improved predictions of wave and crest height distribution. Wave height predictions which are involved in this study were based on a modified Weibull distribution. Along with these predictions, a later formula that involved nonlinear factor of wave steepness is also applied. Meanwhile, nonlinear factors have been increasingly involved in crest height prediction. The modified formulae which are compared include the nonlinear factor of water depth, wave steepness, and directional factor. In all cases, standard linear Rayleigh distribution is referred to in relation to how good the improved formulae are in predicting the distributions. Based on wave height validation, Rayleigh shows better accuracy than the modified Weibull distributions. The standard Rayleigh distribution seems to fit the laboratory data, but deviates more widely from the field measurement data. The inadequacy of Rayleigh based on field validation showed the need of better prediction of nonlinear wave height in nature. Validation showed that the newly developed Rayleigh-Stokes prediction comes out with a slightly better prediction. Nonetheless, it still largely deviates from the observed distribution. On the other hand, the inadequacy of the Rayleigh distribution is seen very clearly in relation to crest height validation. Newer nonlinear formulae are found to give a better prediction showing a stronger nonlinearity affect on crest height in nature. However these models show discrepancies from one another. It is possibly caused by the different methods underpinning the development of these formulae and the way nonlinear factors are included in their prediction","wave height distribution; extreme wave height; wave statistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Wide variety of wave energy converters has been developed in last decades and presenting more economical and reliable technologies is also under process. The ‘Anaconda’ a full-rubber Wave Energy Converter (WEC) operates in a completely new way, transferring energy from water waves to bulge waves in a giant water-filled submerged rubber tube, aligned head-to-sea. Initial researches have shown that it offers advantages of low capital and operational costs, because of its extreme simplicity and the unique durability of rubber. Besides the importance of the design process of a wave energy converter, it is very vital to decide about the grouping of the devices in a wave farm. To have an optimum power output from the wave farm and minimum environmental impacts on marine environment and shoreline, it is necessary to evaluate the layout and the configuration of wave farm by laboratorial tests or computer simulations. In this study MIKE 21 as a coastal and marine engineering software was used for modelling a wave farm of Anacondas. Optimum configuration which could result in the highest possible power output from the wave farm is investigated. Results of this study showed considerable decrement in the near-shore wave height after setting up a wave farm of 21 Anacondas about 3km offshore. While some physical characteristics of Anaconda is under investigation yet, assumptions about radiation rates were taken into account and different results for different scenarios were presented. The effect of different offshore incident wave height on the ratio of near-shore wave height decrement also showed that the higher the incident wave height the higher is the impact on shoreline. However the extent and intensity of the impact was constant for various offshore incident wave heights.","wave energy conversion; renewable energy; wave modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Gardiner, S. (mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor)","2009","The study focuses on the impact of human interventions on the natural behaviour of estuaries in response to sea-level rise. In particular it focuses on the affect of managed realignment on the critical sea level rise (SLRcrit) for the Poole Harbour. Numerical model ASMITA (Aggregated Scale Morphological Interaction between a Tidal inlet and the Adjacent coast, Stive and Wang, 1996) is used to study the response of the system to the external forcing (both natural and anthropogenic). ASMITA model schematises the tidal-inlet system and characterises each model element by a single variable volume. Volumetric data of the Poole harbour inlet elements obtained through the digitisation of the historical admiralty charts was used to calibrate the model. The model assumes that the each inlet elements tends towards an equilibrium volume which can be defined using the empirical equations. These equilibrium equations consist of equilibrium parameters that depend on the regional properties like hydrodynamics and topography of the Poole harbour. Once the model is calibrated, simulations were performed with various sea level rise scenarios (historic and future SLR) to observe the natural behaviour of the Poole harbour. Managed realignment is being introduced in the model and a range of values of critical sea-level rise was obtained and compared with the predicted sea-level rise rate given in the literature for the next century. Results suggest that the “hold the line” management scenario (current situation) would not result in the complete loss of inter-tidal flats and the coastal flooding is unlikely to occur over the next century, as a result of critical sea-level rise values exceeds the predicted rate. However research suggests, introducing realignment (coastline retreat management scenario) reduces SLRcrit values for the estuary; thus making the estuary more sensitive to the predicted future SLR rates.","siltation; sediment transport; sedimentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM","",""

The most interesting gameplay mechanic in the game was the ability to travel back in time up to a maximum of five minutes, or until the energy meter runs out. This was also the most complex mechanic, and took the most time to implement correctly. In the end however, we prevailed and delivered a great game using a great structure built using a great engine.

(mentor); Stive, M.J.F. (mentor); Løset, S. (mentor)","2009","The objective of this study was to contribute to the knowledge on ice-ridges structures interactions. This work is a follow-up of previous research on simulations of ice-structure interaction using finite element method (Gürtner, 2009b; Konuk, et al., 2009a,b) and a preliminary study of freeze-bond (FB) shear strength (Repetto-Llamazares, et al., 2009b). The presented data should be regarded as illustrative rather than exhaustive. Many important aspects of ice-ridges structures interactions have not been addressed in this thesis. An analysis of experiments with FBs was performed, and a finite element model was built in order to simulate these experiments. Within the framework of the classical theory of elasticity, the numerical model incorporates a cohesive model in order to simulate ice fracture along the FB during shear test. The cohesive behavior of the FB was described by the bilinear traction-separation law. The approach of Camanho and Davila (2002) was applied in order to calculate stresses in the FB under mixed-mode loading conditions. A 6-node cohesive finite element was used for implementation of assumed behavior of the FB. Information obtained via detailed analysis of the FB shear strength experiments and via their numerical simulation can be used for a better understanding of FB failure processes and for a numerical modeling of ice-ridges. The results of numerical simulation confirmed that the finite element model could reproduce phenomena commonly observed in actual shear tests of FBs, including the shear strength hardening and partly softening behavior. The peak load in simulations was completely determined by the maximum traction strength and the initial part of a traction-separation law. This study also showed that from the conducted experiments intended to study FB strength in model ice, it is also possible to study ice fracture processes as well as post-failure behavior. By improving the experimental procedure as described in Repetto-Llamazares, et al. (2009b) it will be possible to study not only FB shear strength but also the frictional behavior of ice after the FB failure. By video monitoring of the crack initiation and growth it will be possible to study a fracture process inside the FB. This work is of appeal to different scientists actively participating in investigations in, and possibly also on the standardization of methods for, measuring strength of freeze-bonds in order to improve existing analytical and numerical models, which are used nowadays for calculation of loads for scenarios of ice-ridges interactions with structures.","freeze-bonds; ice ridges; finite element model; cohesive zone model; ice engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Gardner, S. (mentor)","2009","Existing Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) for Poole Harbour was the first generation produced in 2004, which is before statutory obligations to protect the natural coastline were fully realised. Under the idea of ‘adopting a sustainable policy for the longer-term’, at present the second generation of SMP is being produced. This study was conducted to identify changes in coastal habitats under sea-level rise and to inform development of SMP2 in order to comply with the requirement of the European Union Habitats and Birds Directives. The focus was on mudflat and saltmarsh habitats as these are not only the largest coastal habitats of the Harbour, but also immediately under threat from sea-level rise and coastal management decision. This study involved the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software in a modelling-based approach to study the behaviour of inter-tidal habitats in response to predicted changes in sea level for the remainder of the 21st century. Under the BRANCH project guidelines, ArcGIS was used to model the current and future distribution of habitats in the region. The present state of the habitats was first modelled using three basic inputs- topographical LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), tidal data from the Harbour and assumed boundary conditions for the zonation of the habitats with respect to tidal range. The accuracy of this model was verified with available Aerial Photographic Interpretation (API) data. The model was then used to evaluate new distributions and areas for all the habitats for changes in sea-levels by the 2085. Based on the Tidal Elevation Testing results and sediment transport studies the SPM1 management units were refined. Using all above results and considering four specific coastal management options, a feasible management plan for the refined units were derived, keeping in mind the relevant land-use restrictions and other spatial planning issues. The project concluded that the ‘flexible and safe’ combination of the options of ‘Do Nothing’, ‘Selective Hold the Line’ and ‘Selective Managed Realignment’ were best suited for the coastal habitats in south and west of the Harbour assuming that the sea-level rose according to the DEFRA scenario and taking into consideration the large uncertainties inherent in sea-level rise predictions.","shoreline management; coastal habitat; sealevel rise; poole harbour; estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

To achieve this, the KAoS/Brahms bridge is developed, which allows agents in a Brahms multi-agent system to query KAoS policies. With the KAoS/Brahms bridge at hand, the MECA project is used as context for a scenario modelled in Brahms. The scenario is scripted to contain various situations in which Brahms’ work practice approach interacts with KAoS’ topdown specification of rules. The outcome of these interactions directly influences the outcome of the scenario as a whole. By including an actual human being in the simulation, the scenario can also be used to assess man-machine interaction between this human subject and the other agents. The human subject can assume the role of one of the actors, while the other actors remain simulated. By using a graphical user interface, the human is able to influence the simulation.","Brahms; KAoS; HCI; MECA; Multi-agent","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2009-07-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","MMI","","","",""

De vraag die blijft bestaan is; of de koppeling van de simulatieprogramma’s en de praktijk wel goed is. Een kwaliteitscontrole van het thermische binnenklimaat wordt vrijwel nooit gedaan na de in gebruik name van een gebouw, omdat het te arbeidsintensief en te duur is om dit te doen. Daarnaast is het heel moeilijk om de resultaten van praktijkmetingen te interpreteren en een juiste uitspraak te doen over de kwaliteit van het thermische binnenklimaat in de gemeten ruimte(n) voor een langere periode.
