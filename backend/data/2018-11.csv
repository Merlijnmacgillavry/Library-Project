Since most of the hydrocarbon resources have been discovered, it is necessary to extend the use of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods on these mature fields to increase the fraction of oil recovered. Foam-EOR has shown to improve sweep efficiency during gas injection. However, there are two challenges regarding the use of foams: 1) the performance of the surfactants needed to generate foam and 2) the cost of these surfactants. In this study the performance of six surfactants was tested for steam foam applications; focusing on solubility, thermal stability, foam stability and adsorption in porous media. The solubility of the surfactants ranged from good to poor. However, poor solubility can be enhanced by heating up the solution. The surfactants tested showed a large range of stability behavior, from very good to very poor. The surfactant with the best thermal stability at 275°C has a molecule with three characteristics related to high thermal stability: 1) Sulfonate head, 2) aromatic compound attached to the head, and 3) a long hydrophobic tail (above 18 carbon atoms). The other surfactants, with a low to very low thermal stability lacked one or more of these characteristics. The surfactant with the best thermal stability also had the best foam behavior in porous media at 180°C, showing a max. apparent viscosity of 0.42 Pa·s and a Mobility Reduction Factor of 2818. Finally, for this surfactant, the dynamic adsorption in Bentheimer sandstone was 0.059 mg/grock at 120°C. Additionally, an exergy analysis was carried out to assess the cost of the surfactant from a thermodynamic point of view. For this purpose, the Exergy Recovery Factor was calculated for a system on which the Water Alternating Gas (WAG) and Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG) EOR methods are applied, with different gases injected. The system includes from the initial capture of the gas and transport of the gas to the final oil and gas production from the reservoir and separation and recirculation of produced fluids. Despite the high exergy cost of the surfactant, the exergy recovery factor was higher for SAG than for WAG, meaning that more energy is extracted than invested. It was also found that less CO2 was produced per barrel of incremental oil extracted with SAG than with WAG.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-30","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In the recent past, the interest in secondary services provided by coastal dunes has increased. These services include ecological values and recreation. In order to manage and maintain the coast as an attractive area that combines coastal protection and ecological values, the natural dynamics have to be understood. In view of this, numerical models with quantitative predictive capabilities on the development of coastal dunes can give a lot of insight. A model is developed with the aim to improve the current aeolian modeling by implementing biological and physical processes adapted from different existing models, developing a modular aeolian transport model with quantitative predictive capabilities for dune development. The current version of the model is capable of simulating barchan dunes and the initial stage of coastal dune formation: Embryo dunes. Potentially the model can be used to determine the influence of tidal ranges, storm frequencies, armoring, salinity and precipitation on dune building processes. This will result in a greater insight in the general behavior of coastal systems, including the evolution of embryonal dune fields as well as foredune characteristics like maximum height and autocyclic formation of transverse dunes. On the other hand the model can also be used during more practical situations such as computing recovery times of coastal dunes after extreme events or for the creation of artificial blowouts.","Aeolian sediment transport; Dune development; Process-based modelling; coastal areas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key to their success lies in the combination of hard and soft constituents in a intricate pattern. The design of natural materials allows for the development of toughening mechanisms that increase the overall fracture energy of the sample while keeping the stiffness provided by the hard constituents, as it is demonstrated in the brick-and-mortar pattern of nacre. In addition, the development of graded material transitions avoids failure at material interfaces with a high mismatch in stiffness. This is crucial for the success of certain structures in the human body, such as the connections of ligaments and tendons to bone. Due to their marvellous design and superior mechanical properties, natural materials are a source of inspiration for the development of biomimetic advanced materials. The advancement of multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) has eased the production of structures that combine materials with different properties.<br/>Voxel-based 3D printing is an innovative technique that allows for the strategic placement of voxels of different materials at a high resolution using PolyJet technology. Several studies have attempted to produce brick-and-mortar or graded patterns. However, the production of functionally graded structures by voxel-based additive manufacturing is still a novelty, and the effects of the graded pattern and material ratio have not been assessed. In addition, the performance of brick-and-mortar patterns and graded transitions in the same structure have not been evaluated.<br/>In this project, several patterns for material graded transitions have been designed, produced by voxel-based AM and assessed by fracture mechanics and tensile tests. The effect of different material ratio distributions on the mechanical properties of the specimen have also been evaluated. Digital image correlation techniques provided insightful information about the strain distribution in certain patterns, and how they influence the fracture toughness of samples. A biomimetic model of a human knee was developed in order to compare the performance of sharp and graded interfaces in real-like scenarios. Furthermore, brick-andmortar patterns with different designs, hierarchy levels and platelet aspect ratio have been created, and the patterns’ single and combined effect with a gradient pattern have been assessed. The results outlined that the function that determines the pattern formaterial change does not contribute significantly to an improvement of the mechanical properties, specially when the transition reaches points of pure material concentration. By contrast, when complementary material ratios are located at both sides of an<br/>interface, the fracture toughness of the samples is enhanced. Thus, it was demonstrated that the distribution of material ratio in a complementary manner but avoiding sites of pure hard material presents the most optimal boost of toughness in the specimens. The biomimetic human knee model proved the efficacy of graded material transitions over sharp material interfaces in withstanding higher tensile loads. Finally, the addition<br/>of graded transitions to brick-and-mortar patterns contributes to an increase of the fracture toughness of the samples, followed by a slight decrease of the overall stiffness. The increase of fracture energy is linked to the increased plasticity region in front of the crack tip that was revealed in DIC tests. Changing the placement of the crack tip and increasing the percentage of hard material that conforms the gradient could increase the overall stiffness as well.","Additive Manufacturing; Biomimetic; Gradients","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The research community is ever so eager to investigate new technologies that can offer an efficient and environmentally sound solution to the issues caused by the polluting industrial processes. One of the potential solution is an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) which is proven to be an effective technology to efficiently extract energy from low-temperature sources. The ORC is basically a Rankine cycle but employs a high molecular weight organic fluid as the energy carrier. The peculiar non-classical gas dynamics behaviour of these fluids during dry expansion close to the vapour saturation line (in the dense gas region) poses certain challenges on the turbine design. Furthermore, the low speed of sound in organic fluids and high expansion ratio required in an ORC turbine leads to highly supersonic flows in the turbine. Such high speed flows within a turbine stage are susceptible to high shock losses, if necessary corrective steps are not taken during early design phase. This has sparked a wave of interest in the scientific community to come up with an efficient supersonic ORC turbine design guidelines. The design of a supersonic turbine rotor is crucial to ensure efficient performance of the turbine. In the mid-20th century, a supersonic impulse rotor design methodology for axial turbines was proposed that boasts shock-free turning of supersonic flows using the vortex-flow theory. This procedure relies on Method of Characteristics (MOC) to solve hyperbolic governing PDEs. The method got enriched later with the capability to account for dense gas effects on the rotor geometry which is essential for ORC applications. However, there are no such design guidelines available in the literature to generate a radial rotor blade especially for supersonic flows. The conventional 1D preliminary design methods, generally available for radial rotor blades, are not very reliable in supersonic flow regime. This calls for a novel design philosophy for supersonic radial rotors that accounts for supersonic flow phenomenon early in the design phase to ensure efficient turbine performance. The objective of this thesis is to put forth a design methodology for supersonic radial rotors that acknowledges the flow equations in the design procedure. The proposed design ideology is to extend the supersonic axial rotor design procedure by including the fictitious forces' effects in the governing equations to generate a radial rotor using MOC. These pseudo forces (Centrifugal &amp; Coriolis) are experienced by the flow in the radial runner if seen from the rotor's rotating frame of reference. Furthermore, the dense gas effects are also included in the design using the properties from CoolProp library. A design tool is developed in PYTHON that implements the aforementioned ideology in the design procedure. This thesis takes the first step towards developing a fully functional design methodology for supersonic radial rotors. Therefore, a simple case of a constant force's influence on the rotor geometry is studied in this work and compared with the CFD simulations in both perfect &amp; dense gas region. Future research will focus on understanding the complex behaviour of organic fluids in the presence of an external force and modify the design procedure accordingly.","Supersonic turbines; ORC; Radial inflow turbine; turbine design methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

We investigate the application of decision diagrams to OAS problems by studying a specific problem in detail. The OAS problem considered here is a single machine deterministic problem with sequence-dependent setup time (OAS-SMS) with a further width restriction such that the number of jobs available to be scheduled at any one time is bound by a constant.<br/> <br/>We show this problem to be weakly NP-hard and develop an exact decision diagram formulation for it as well as a restricted decision diagram formulation which we show to be a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) of this problem for a constant width. To make decision diagrams work with order acceptance we generalise the decision diagrams to not require explicit layers associated with the decision variables. We also show that this definition of width used here generalises the Balas-Simonetti neighbourhood in travelling salesman problems and that the exact algorithm solves it in the same worst case time complexity. We evaluate the exact and approximation algorithms on an existing OAS-SMS benchmark set and show it exceeds the state of the art on instances of bounded width.","order acceptance and scheduling; decision diagrams","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This thesis is a first attempt in creating a solver that couples CFD and FEM in order to compute the deformed sail shape (flying shape) and the thrust it can provide. Such solvers already exist but are not available to the public, or if they are they come with a very high license price. The complexity of the problem is both in the flow, which is fully turbulent and detached, and in the structure, which is deformable and free to move in all directions. Moreover, the coupling of the solvers has to be performed in a way that minimizes loss of information and accuracy.<br/>First the CFD simulations have been run and validated with two softwares, OpenFOAM and FINE/Open. The results were very satisfying for FINE/Open, while quite poor for OpenFOAM. Consequently, the FEM solver has been successfully validated for some cases of which the analytical solution is known, due to lack of reference data for this specific case. <br/>Finally, the interpolation techniques have been implemented in Matlab and the fluid structure interaction solver has been run. The solver has been validated on a given testcase with satisfying results; however there is still room for improvement in terms of run times and automatization of the solver.

Benefits include manufacturing each façade element uniquely without the use of a mould while having the potential of integrating functions as water drainage and solar shading within the object. Recycling polymers, obtained from industrial waste, could also reduce the panel’s CO2-footprint. Despite these benefits of the self-developed pellet-extrusion XL 3D print technology, less research has been done on the feasibility of the façade panel under outdoor weather conditions. Since thermoplastic polymers are highly vulnerable to weathering factors (solar radiation, temperature and humidity), preserving their mechanical integrity under outside circumstances could be an issue. <br/><br/>This research aims to have a better understanding of the potential environmental risks of a 3D printed product: the Aectual façade element. First, a broadening study has been conducted, in which several potential risks were investigated. Potentials risks include the effects of wind and thermal load on the façade element and the material’s resistance against fire, thermal shock and frost. The broadening study led to an in-depth study, where the effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the use of UV stabilisers on the tensile strength of a 3D printed polypropylene-based (PP) composite has been researched. <br/><br/>During the experimental study, 3D printed materials, in the form of tensile test samples, were accelerated aged by an indoor UV test chamber. After several exposure time intervals, exposed and unexposed samples were tested on their tensile strength. We found highly scattered data of the tensile properties of the 3D printed material and no significant influence of the UV radiation on the tensile strength between the exposed and unexposed samples. However, it is observed that the extruded material itself became brittle over time. Even at an ageing of 2088 hours (87 days), an increase in tensile modulus and a decrease in yield strain were measured. Adding UV stabilisers to the same print compound tend to accelerate the brittleness of the material over time. As mentioned, the test suffers from highly scattered results due to the to the various print qualities and sample slippage during testing. These factors led to a reduction of the characteristic tensile strength properties of the 3D printed composite as material for building applications. Conventional flat-die-extruded PP-based materials, obtained from a PP-sheets manufacturer, were tested in the same manner and confirm this conclusion. <br/><br/>Further material experiments were conducted to gain a better understanding of the effect 3D printing on the physical structure of the polymer-based composite. Techniques involve differential scanning calorimetry, digital and scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The result show that the 3D printed material exhibits different polymer characterises such as the degree of crystallinity, surface structure and chemical composition compared to the raw, injection-moulded and flat-die-extruded materials. <br/><br/>In the discussion, the limited effect of UV degradation on the polymer’s mechanical strength is explained by several reasons, including the impact of the 3D printing itself. The conclusion includes a summary of all the findings throughout the whole research, with emphasising on the low characteristic tensile values of the 3D printed samples compared to the conventional flat-die-extruded samples. Sample slippage and inconsistent print qualities are factors contributing to this result. In the end, a list of potential improvements is given, including several techniques to further investigate the effect of 3D printing on the material properties of polymers and the development of 3D print technology for building applications.<br","3D Printing; façade element; recycled polypropylene; UV degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

What if we already know our unknowns, would it not be a piece of cake to deliver construction projects of high quality within time and budget? In order to predict the unknown future, Fluor introduced Construction-Driven Execution philosophy. In a construction-driven project, construction managers are involved early in the process during front-end engineering and design (FEED) to provide input to office departments in order to prevent mistakes from happening in later stages of the project. By this it is aimed to ‘lift the veil’ and focus on the unknown knowns (i.e. complex issues) in an integrated effort. Construction managers typically focus on operational decisions during construction on-site and focus on tactical and strategical decision-making during FEED. This transition has a major impact on the way construction managers should approach issues in their daily functioning: they shift from a firefighting to a fire preventing approach. In this perspective, the role of construction managers in FEED is compared to that of project managers, in which the construction manager is responsible for the management of the execution portion of the project. The Project Design School assumes that some kind of design thinking is involved by project managers, in which they use a certain frame and go through certain steps when approaching complex issues. To apply this frame for educational purposes, the Project Design School has created the Project Design Cycle. This cycle consists of four elements: Awareness, Design, Performance and Reflection. The Project Design School aims to fill a literature gap in project management research, which concerns the approach project managers use when choosing and adapting project management tools and systems to be applied in specific situations. These two problem fields of Construction-Driven Execution and the Project Design School are combined into the following research objective: 1. Gather and provide empirical data to firmly establish the ubiquity of the Project Design Cycle elements, their cyclic relationship, and the degree to which managers use these elements as an explicit method, 2. Provide Fluor with advice on how to apply design thinking principles (as incorporated in the Project Design Cycle) within the construction management department in order to enhance the Construction-Driven Execution philosophy. In order to achieve this objective, the following research question is answered in this report: -&gt; How can the Project Design Cycle enable construction managers to identify and approach complex situations in a construction-driven FEED phase? A theoretical framework and empirical research are conducted to answer this question. First, a theoretical framework is determined, which includes the influence of Construction-Driven Execution on construction management practices in FEED and the incorporation of design thinking principles in the Project Design Cycle. Subsequently, the current application of the Project Design Cycle by construction managers is researched in a qualitative case-study analysis. In total five construction managers (respondents) are selected of three oil &amp; gas projects (case-studies). Each respondent is interviewed twice by use of semi-structured interviews. The main goal of the first interview is to get background information of the respondent and to identify complex issues they were confronted with in their current project. The complex issues are discussed in-depth in the second interview, in order to analyze the Project Design Cycle elements in the applied approach of the respondents in their daily practice. The main findings obtained in the cross-case analysis are: - The respondents often did not recognize or perceive the complexity of the issues. It is observed that the recognition of the complexity has a large influence on the way the respondents approach issues. Issue-categories that were perceived as complex concern: modularization, pre-assembly, sequencing of work and revising the plot plan. Alignment of disciplines is not recognized as complex by the respondents. From the twenty issues identified in the first interview, ten were defined as complex in the cross-case analysis. - When an issue is recognized as complex, nearly all Project Design Cycle elements were applied most of the times by the respondent. However, the sequence of the elements was often not correct. The design element was conducted separately (generate and test) sometimes. - When an issue is not recognized as complex, it is observed that practically always one or two Project Design Cycle elements were not applied by the respondents. It is found that the design element is recognized the least, followed by performance. Moreover, it is observed that the sequence is most likely not to be performed in the correct order. It can be concluded that construction managers do apply the elements of the Project Design Cycle in their daily function in FEED. However, only when the issue is recognized as complex. Thus, the approach of the construction manager strongly depends on their ability to identify and recognize complexity elements within issues. Furthermore, it is found that the design element is most likely not to be applied when the issue is not recognized as complex. This indicates that the searching and experimenting nature of design thinking is often not applied by the respondents in this situation. It is observed that the construction managers fall back in their on-site problem-solving mode when they do not recognize the complexity of the issue. In this simplified problem-solving approach, the respondents go straight from awareness of the problem to the performance of a solution. The design and reflection elements are often skipped in such approaches. It is determined that the Project Design Cycle provides a suitable framework to educate and support construction managers in approaching complex issues in FEED. However, the Project Design Cycle needs to be adjusted in order to create acceptance and support within the construction management community. Based on the empirical research, the Project Design Cycle has been transformed to the ADAPT – decision-making cycle (figure 1: ADAPT). ADAPT is an abbreviation of the elements Awareness, Development, Assessment, Performance, and Throw-back. In this research context, the essence of ADAPT is precisely that: construction managers have to adapt in order to change something (their approach) to suit different conditions (construction-driven FEED). By doing so, they “have to become familiar with a new situation”, which represents the new role and responsibilities they have to fulfill in order to solve complex issues in the early stages of the project. ADAPT incorporates the identification of complexities, development and assessment of alternatives, creation of a solution with the highest value, and a reflection upon the outcome. This framework can be used to educate and support construction managers by improving their capabilities and skills that are required to approach complex issues during FEED. ADAPT serves a double purpose in construction management practices and could be applied in the form of a cognitive processing model and in the form of a decision support system: - Cognitive processing model: remind and support construction managers not to make decision merely based on old experiences, but to take their time to properly reflect on situations and share their knowledge in order to identify, recognize and acknowledge complex situations. - Decision support system: structure constructability meetings to approach complex issues in a multi-disciplinary way and to provide construction managers the ability to get an understanding of the problem situation, in order to determine an effective course of action by drawing upon the entire repository of construction management research, knowledge and tools. It is recommended to implement ADAPT both top-down and bottom-up. Top-down support is required to estimate enough man-hours for construction managers in FEED and by selecting the right people that are able to approach complex issues. Additionally, ADAPT should be implemented bottom-up as an integrated approach in which the construction manager is pro-active and takes it upon themselves to drive, adopt, and move it forward. This can be done by making individual construction managers aware of the cycle and its added value. Moreover, the constructability program serves as a perfect platform to implement and test the application of ADAPT. In constructability, multiple disciplines work together to create integrated solutions in order to prevent ‘fires’ from happening on-site. ADAPT can be used as a structure to identify complex situations in the constructability program. These identified complex issues can then be discussed in so called ‘constructability focus’ sessions. In these sessions the focus is put on a specific component or sub-area of the design that contains high complexity, by a multidisciplinary team. As construction management lead these sessions, it is a perfect opportunity to implement the ADAPT decision-making cycle and use its elements to shape and formalize these sessions in a structured way. Additionally, by being aware of the elements, and in special ‘throw-back’, construction managers learn to share their knowledge with other colleagues, disciplines, and projects. In this way, awareness is created for future situations and enables others to identify and solve complex situations in an early stage. Further research should be performed to investigate the underlying reasons of why and when construction managers perceive issues as complex (or not), how construction managers could identify complex situations in the FEED phase, and which qualifications are required of construction managers to properly function in a construction-driven FEED phase. Also, the relation between the recognition of complexity and the occurrence of the design element need to be further examined. Finally, further research should be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the application of the Project Design Cycle (in the form of ADAPT) in construction management.","Construction Management; Design Thinking; Project Design Cycle; Construction-driven execution; Oil and gas; EPC; Project Management; Early Contractor Involvement; integrated approach; FEED; Designing project management; Designing Construction management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Micro-brachytherapy with radioactive Holmium-166 showed to be an effective palliative care method for primary and metastatic brain tumors and intratumoral administration with holmium microspheres (HoMS) showed very promising results with respect to the amount of treatment sessions, hospitalization stay and side effects. This study evaluates the state-of-the-art of available treatment methods for brain malignancies in order to develop a standardized intratumoral administration device for holmium microspheres, where dosimetry, local distribution and visualization of the microparticles are considered most important. The prototype, designed, manufactured and validated within this study creates a tumor-extracorporeal duct for a non-active steerable inner needle to control spatial intratumoral deposition of the HoMS. Validation of the administration device is done by accuracy tests during incision in gelatin phantoms, fluid flow tests with a HoMS suspension and imaging tests with 1.5T MRI for the quantification of artefacts. The inner needle has a pre-bend tip that can achieve a horizontal and vertical displacement of respectively 13.0 and 15.6 mm with an error kept below 2.0 mm in 3-dimensional space (94%) , depending on target depth, during incision in a homogeneous porcine gelatin phantom mimicking the stiffest tumor tissue found in literature. Adjustments of stylet depth and orientation will allow for deposition of HoMS over a surface of 5.8 cm2 and with the aid of this delivery device tumors normally treated by SRS, considering the size (diameter &lt; 30 mm), can be treated. To localize the needle and the holmium microspheres in the phantom real-time 1.5T MRI is used. The tests within this study show a high accuracy with a visualization error of 0.1 - 1.1 mm for the titanium outer needle and an error of 0.2 - 0.5 mm for the nitinol inner needle, depending on needle angle towards the magnetic field. Future research can be performed with the administration device prototype to define right dosimetry, distribution and volume of the HoMS for effective treatment of specific braintumors.","Brain cancer; minimally invasive technique; microbrachytherapy; holmium; microspheres; stereotactic system; steerable needles; intratumoral injection; image-guided therapy; brain tumor phantom; mechanical properties brain tumor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-16","","","","Biomedical Engineering","The image-guided treat-ment of brain malignancies with radioactive holmium microspheres",""

In the early '90s, a new technique was experimented at the end of the Magellan mission, which employed the atmosphere of Mars itself, to reduce the eccentricity of the orbit over a long period of time. Said action was named aerobraking and the design of the required onboard software to perform this maneuver, is the main topic of this thesis. <br/><br/>The navigation part of the software has the purpose of determining the current spacecraft state (position, velocity and attitude). Two navigation systems have been implemented in this research and they differ in the fact that one is purely based on data available onboard (such as accelerometer measurements and a simplified environment model), whereas the other uses observations from an unspecified positioning system, to complement the onboard model.<br/> The tasks of the guidance system can be summarized as: estimating the minimum and maximum values of the pericenter altitude and targeting the midpoint of said range. The first function is achieved by considering the thermodynamic limitations of the spacecraft and the restrictions on aerobraking duration, whereas to attain the second purpose, use is made of a maneuver estimator.<br/> Both an attitude and an orbit controller are designed for the mission. A proportional, integral and derivative controller is used to regulate the rotational motion of the spacecraft, whereas, orbit control is realized by assuming impulsive shots at apoapsis.<br/><br/>Based on the analyses performed, it was concluded that this GNC system partly fulfills its duties. In fact, it is able to 1) reduce the mass of an interplanetary spacecraft, by requiring the employment of 82 instead of more than 1000 m/s of velocity increments, and 2) to maintain a low navigation error (for most of the orbit the position error is within 50 m), but, on the other hand, it is not capable of providing a robust performance. In particular, the excessive heating experienced during the atmospheric phases of the mission, poses a large threat to the thermal and overall integrity of the spacecraft, possibly jeopardizing the whole mission.<br","Aerobraking; Navigation; Guidance; Control; EKF; UKF; USM7; USM6; USMEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Some of them have had a tremendous impact on the City of Galveston and its inhabitants. Two recent hurricanes, Ike (2008) and Harvey (2017), caused significant damage and struck the city in different manners. While Hurricane Ike brought about high wind speeds and surge, Hurricane Harvey deposited extreme amounts of precipitation over the island.<br/>There is a high probability that the City of Galveston will be struck again by a major hurricane. Hence, research is needed on mitigation measures that reduce the flood vulnerability of Galveston. More specifically, the simultaneous occurrence of surge and extreme precipitation is worth investigating, as currently little is known about the synergy between these aspects.<br/>This report elaborates on how the risk of flooding in the City of Galveston can be mitigated, considering the influences of extreme pluvial, coastal and compound flooding.<br/>In order to provide adequate mitigation measures, a vulnerability analysis is performed on the City of Galveston using hydraulic modelling software. Furthermore, a stakeholder and system analysis is done for all relevant stakeholders. Their respective interests, influence and interactions are mapped in a power-interest diagram and tube model. In addition, three residential stakeholder focus sessions were organized which provided valuable validation of the model and evaluation criteria for designs.<br/>The flood vulnerability of the City of Galveston is not merely limited to a single area. Vulnerability maps and an inventory of critical infrastructure show that Galveston has various bottlenecks scattered around the city. A crucial result of the analysis was that flood risk issues in Galveston can be divided into two aspects: nuisance flooding by regularly occurring precipitation and flooding due to hurricanes. This distinction is reflected in the proposed mitigation measures, as they require a fundamentally different approach. While damage caused by nuisance flooding can be fully prevented with the proposed measures, damage resulting from hurricanes can at best be mitigated.<br/>A comprehensive plan containing preliminary measures for both flooding scenarios is proposed for the City of Galveston. As part of this integrated plan, thirteen projects are defined which are elaborated in this report. Proposed measures to prevent damage originating from nuisance flooding include retention and infiltration of stormwater, discharge by pumps and raising frontier roads. Measures that mitigate damage due to hurricanes include breakwaters, retractable barriers and shelters for vertical evacuation.<br/>The authors recommend that more stakeholders are actively involved in interactive design sessions to make the plan more inclusive. Furthermore, for more accurate designs a probabilistic approach is preferred to the deterministic approach used in this report. In addition, more work is needed to elaborate on the design proposals as presented in this report.<br","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MDP268","29.299056, -94.796122"

Action to achieve sustainability is undertaken by various means, such as the Green Deal Healthcare. Several tools exist that can assess the environmental impact of a certain industry or company, but no tools exist that aid in actively lowering this environmental impact. Therefore, the HSMEA (Healthcare Sustainability Mode and Effect Analysis) tool was developed. This method is based on the Lean philosophy and HFMEA (Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) tool and consists of six steps that aid in making a healthcare process more sustainable, in terms of waste production, energy use, or water use. With this tool, processes that contribute to these factors are identified in a highly structured and systematic way, and practical solutions are created and executed for these situations by a multidisciplinary team. This tool was validated in the academic hospital in Leiden, the Netherlands (Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum). Next, it was applied to two clinical case studies, assessing two processes that are currently present in the operating rooms of the LUMC. The HSMEA tool showed that with the implementation of four solutions, great improvements can be achieved in terms of waste and CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents production and recycling rate. These four interventions are currently being implemented in the LUMC. This novel sustainability tool has therefore proved its usefulness and clinical applicability in a healthcare setting.

This thesis project researches the potential for reducing energy consumption and, consequently, the operational costs of the KPN LTE network. There are various resources in a mobile network which consume energy and switching off these resources will lead to a reduced energy consumption. The trade-off in switching off these resources involves a potential impact on the capacity and the quality (throughput) offered by the mobile network. In this thesis we quantify the attainable savings in operational cost and/or energy consumption while still satisfying the quality of service requirements set by KPN. Five different operational cost saving schemes are analyzed on three different timescales in this research. The results of this research indicate that there is ample opportunity present for KPN to reduce their operational cost and/or energy consumption with minimal impact on the quality of service. The results further indicate that maximum savings are attainable in the live KPN network by effectuating the ’turning off carriers’ scheme, in which the capacity carrier is turned off at the base stations. The reduction in energy consumption and operational cost on effectuating this energy reduction scheme is in the range of 21-70% with respect to the reference scenario for each of the timescale. Furthermore, the results also indicate that of the five operational cost saving schemes investigated, the ‘turning off carriers’ scheme has the lowest impact on the experienced quality of service.","LTE; mobile networks; energy saving; spatio-temporal variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main research question is:<br/><br/>How can public opinion on Twitter be characterized, on the case study of palm oil?<br/><br/>The findings of this research suggest how Twitter, in its current form, does not create the optimal environment for forming something that is approaching public opinion due to five characteristics: the exclusion of more than half the world population (a), the domination by a few users (b1) (often with strategic interest (b2)) , the pollution through spam (c), Twitter’s role (d) and the<br/>characteristics of tweets (e).<br/><br/>a. The exclusion of more than half the world population from social media is at least based on the lack of internet access, new media literacy and cultural capital.<br/><br/>b.1. The dominating key players are users who get the most attention from other users, policymakers and journalists. This can either be on a specific topic, or transcending topics. The findings from this research suggest that organizations like Greenpeace, BBC Earth and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil have an above average role in guiding the thinking of the public and therewith steering public opinion. It is difficult to find a user that is saying<br/>something completely different than what the defined influencers are saying. These few key players play an above average role in defining public opinion on Twitter, and the influence of this role is not limited to Twitter.<br/><br/>b.2. The tweets analyzed show how the dominant key players often act with a strategic interest in mind. The public sphere should, according to Habermas, be free of power and ideology and the only common interest should be the interest in good opinion formation.<br/><br/>c. The pollution through spam is argued to play a serious role in influencing public opinion on Twitter. The exact effects of fake accounts and hyperactive automated users is unclear but it can be argued, as can be seen from the examples, that they cause a stream of misinformation and therewith influence public opinion.<br/><br/>d. It cannot be proved what Twitter is doing, and if and how they have influenced the debate on palm oil, since the algorithm is nontransparent. Examples like Morozov’s accusation of censorship in Twitter’s ‘trending algorithm’ shows the influence they can have<br/><br/>e. tweets are not just 280 characters. They are often carefully considered combinations of hashtags, calls for action, snippets of information, interpreted<br/>data and images or videos. These characteristics all help in convincing the reader of the point the user is trying to make.<br/><br/><br","Habermas; Twitter; Public Opinion; Palm Oil","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

An approach is sought by translating subtle changes in magnetisation back to the Villari effect, a phenomenon which depicts how applied stress induces changes in magnetisation in ferromagnetic objects. Since the magnitude of these changes in magnetisation is small, other nonlinear effects of similar order such as magnetic relaxation and hysteresis are identified, measured and quantified preliminarily.<br/><br/>The magnetic behaviour in this project is assumed to be quasi-static, and derivations of the expressions for the magnetic field around simple geometric shapes are provided in order to understand magnetic behaviour and verify the outcome of the numerical simulations. It is shown that the numerical simulations<br/>produce identical magnetostatic induction fields as the analytically derived expressions when using a sufficiently refined mesh.<br/><br/>An attempt is made to measure long-term magnetic relaxation by subjecting a solid prolate spheroid to a continuous uniform background field for periods of an hour while trying to measure differences in the induction field at a fixed distance. Short-term relaxation, the time it takes for an object to reach a certain<br/>magnetisation when the background field is abruptly changed, is also investigated. It is concluded that both effects could not be successfully measured using the current setup. In order to draw proper conclusions, further research into this topic should be conducted using more accurate equipment for extended periods of time.<br/><br/>Upon investigation it is discovered that it can not be assumed that the steel specimens exhibit a uniform permanent magnetisation. A self-developed method is introduced through which non-uniform magnetisation in three directions can be calculated by means of inversion using a set of magnetic induction field measurements in a plane below the specimen when the background field is zero. These measurements are translated to magnetisation using a set of higher order square Gaussian distribution functions that are spaced in a grid over the domain of the test specimen in order to vary the magnetisation locally.<br/><br/>Literature that shows comparable results regarding description of non-uniform permanent magnetisation using an array of induction field measurements has not been found. The concept of hysteresis is introduced and a method is presented through which the parameters of the Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model can be determined using parameter fitting in combination with a forward numerical model created in COMSOL. Closure of minor loops require modifications to the original JA equations which are implemented in the forward model. The numerical model is encapsulated within the Shuffled Leaping Frog parameter optimisation algorithm in order to compute the correct hysteresis<br/>parameters. It is found that it is possible to successfully determine the parameters of multiple specimens using weak magnetic fields, and therefore minor loops, which is unparalleled in literature.<br/><br/>Eventually, the Villari effect is introduced and an attempt is made to measure and model the effect usingan extension of the Jiles-Atherton model proposed by Naus. Experiments have shown that using this methodology the magnetostriction parameters can be succesfully obtained. A recommendation is<br/>provided into how these results can be implemented in crack-propagation models in future research.","Magnetism; Hysteresis; Villari effect; Crack-propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

We train a neural network with the designed scale loss which normalizes both weight vectors and output features to remove the effect of their scale variations on a large Person ReID dataset offline to learn the deep ReID model and build a framework combining detector and tracker to meet real-world application requirements. During the online tracking stage, the data association is solved by calculating the cosine distance cost matrix according to the learned ReID feature vectors.

In spite of its advantages, Miller et al. (2008) have recognised significant challenges in process-based simulation models, one of them is the incapability to condition to subsurface data. The problem in conditioning the data can be addressed by using an alternative method named multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) in modelling the subsurface since its introduction in 1993 by Guardiano and Srivastava. MPS considers the relationship between multiple data points that is different from the conventional geostatistical methods that are commonly limited to using a linear relationship between data (Guardiano and Srivastava, 1993). By using the process-based simulation model as training image (TI) for MPS simulation, MPS should be able to address the conditioning issue in process-based simulation model.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, most research in MPS has emphasized on new algorithms for improving efficiency of MPS (Mariethoz and Caers, 2014; Mariethoz and Lefebvre, 2014), but there are still issues remain for the workflow to be widely used in geosciences. Furthermore, using nonstationary TI such as process-based simulation model in MPS are still an issue because the workflow is always different for specific cases. Until recently, little published works are available in applicating nonstationary TI in MPS.<br/><br/>The principal objective of this project was to determine an optimised methodology that allows the use of nonstationary process-based simulation model for TI input with MPS simulation in the fluvial-dominated delta. The process-based simulation model used in the study is a post-processed data from numerical model done in process-based modelling software Delft3D (Lesser et al., 2004) which is the PhD work of van der Vegt in 2018. There were two different cases utilised in this study that represents the whole delta development: Case A with high repetition in the patterns and Case B with low repetition in the patterns.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the desired outcome, this study links process-based simulation model with MPS using unconditional and conditional 2D MPS simulation with two different approaches: zonation approach and control map approach. The realisations from the unconditional simulation have to be validated until successful unconditional MPS simulation. The conditional MPS simulation were carried out when the unconditional realisations have been acknowledged as the approved results in mimicking the patterns of the Delft3D model. Lastly, the results were evaluated with four methods: connectivity function, E-type models, conditional variance models, and analysis of distance (ANODI).<br/><br/>In all of the MPS simulation results, the use of control map approach with unilateral simulation path proved to deliver better realisations for unconditional and conditional MPS simulations. Also, this study has presented an optimised workflow of 2D MPS simulation on using process-based simulation model in fluvial-dominated delta environment as TI based on different conditions of patterns’ repetition and hard data distribution.","Multiple-point Geostatistics; Process-based modelling; nonstationary; Delta; Delft3D; Jewelsuite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Lantsoght, E.O.L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Finite element analysis is becoming a popular tool for engineers recently. Nonlinear finite element analysis is more advanced due to that it can deal with the nonlinearity of structures, which leads to more accurate approximation of structural behaviour. In Model Code 2010, nonlinear finite element analysis, which belongs to the higher level of approximation, can predict the structural behaviour with refined physical parameters but by devoting more time to the analysis. This leads to better accuracy. Thus, it is important to study how to apply nonlinear finite element analysis to approximate the structural strength.<br/>When it comes to the existing design codes, the shear design methods of reinforced concrete slabs loaded in uniaxial in-plane force are developed from the tests of beams rather than slabs, which may lead to the underestimation of the design resistance. Through experiments of seven slabs, a related study of the validity of existing shear design methods has been performed by Bui et al. (2017). However, there is no existing literature about the application of nonlinear finite element analysis towards the reinforcement concrete slabs mentioned above so far. In this thesis, one single nonlinear finite element analysis is applied to seven slabs of experiment to study the validation of nonlinear finite element analysis on the RC slabs without shear reinforcement loaded in concentrated out-of-plane load and uniaxial in-plane loads. The validation is studied by comparing results from finite element analysis, experiment and finite element analysis from Nana et al. (2017), which mainly includes shear load – displacement curve, development of crack pattern, failure modes and the influence of uniaxial load on the structural behaviour. In addition, the shear capacity under uniaxial in-plane load is studied by comparing results from analytical assessment based on existing codes, experiment and nonlinear finite element analysis. <br/>When compared with experiment, nonlinear finite element analysis shows a close shear capacity of all seven slabs but stiffer structural behaviour. The development of cracks is similar to the observation of experiment. The failure modes indicated by nonlinear finite element analysis is more likely punching shear rather than one-way shear that is demonstrated in the experiment. The influence of increasing uniaxial compression on shear capacity is larger than what is observed in experiment while increasing tension has smaller influence. By comparing the prediction of shear capacity from experiment, existing codes and nonlinear finite element analysis, it can be concluded that NLFEA is unconservative in prediction of shear capacity of the RC slabs without shear reinforcement loaded in concentrated out-of-plane loads and uniaxial in-plane loads. Some suggestions are given for further study. Improvement of modelling is suggested. For instance, finer mesh could lead to more accurate results, and insights of bond-slip reinforcement could generate more precise results. Furthermore, the study of safety formats is suggested in further study to consider the uncertainty due to random variation of material properties. In addition, more experiments and nonlinear finite element analysis are suggested to get insights of the influence of uniaxial loads on structural behaviour of RC slabs without shear reinforcement. <br","Nonlinear finite element analysis; Reinforced concrete slab; Shear Behaviour; In-plane loaded slabs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

Due to small air hindrance, the hyperloop pod is conceived to have a maximum speed of 333 m/s. If such a hyperloop system is to be built underground in soft soils, the hyperloop speed can easily reach the wave propagation speeds in the soil. Strong wave radiation is expected when the hyperloop is travelling at wave propagation speeds, which are called the critical speeds. <br/><br/>The first objective is to analyse the dynamic influence from the hyperloop. A linear elastic half-space with an infinitely long concrete tunnel buried at a certain depth has been modeled. The excitation of the system is a hyperloop modeled as a moving constant load acting at the tunnel invert. In this thesis, a so-called indirect boundary element method (BEM) is applied. Indirect boundary integrals are formed which rely on the fundamental solutions for the interior medium, the two-and-a-half dimensional Green's functions. These 2.5D Green's functions are essentially the steady state solutions of the half-space subjected to a spatially varying line load. The space is assumed to be infinitely long and invariant in the direction parallel to the axis of the tunnel. <br/><br/>Before implementing the BEM model, two improvements have been made to the 2.5D Green's functions: a better convergence of the Green's function surface-related terms and a better satisfaction of stress-free boundary conditions at the free surface. The accuracy and correctness of the boundary element model using the improved Green's functions have been verified by intensive case studies. Firstly, the scattering of 3D harmonic seismic P waves by a cavity and a tunnel in a linear elastic half-space is analysed. Results are validated by comparing to those from literature. Secondly, the BEM model is employed for the moving load problem. The embedded concrete tunnel is modeled using the Donnell's theory for thin shells. A coupled form of the indirect boundary integrals is formulated. Using the same model parameters, the results obtained by the BEM are in good agreements with those from literature. Moreover, a parametric study has been conducted to study the effect of moving load velocity, tunnel depth and thickness of concrete lining on the dynamic response. <br/><br/>As a second objective of the current thesis work, the BEM model is compared with a finite element method (FEM) based model, developed by Movares B.V. The models are compared in both accuracy and computational efficiency. In the FEM model, the moving load is considered as a series of consecutive short pulses. The contributions from all the pulses are synthesized using a convolution. Furthermore, since the space is invariant in the direction parallel to the tunnel axis, it is possible to apply just one stationary impulse load in the finite element model. Using this method, a constant moving load and a moving load with acceleration are modeled. The FEM results are found to have close agreements with those by the BEM. Besides the Rayleigh wave speed in the soil, a second critical velocity which is related to the wave propagation in the tunnel is found. Furthermore, the case where a hyperloop runs constantly at the Rayleigh wave speed is more crucial than the case where the hyperloop accelerates and passes the Rayleigh wave speed.","Hyperloop; Critical Velocity; Dynamic Analysis; Indirect Boundary Element Method; 2.5D Green's functions; Finite Element Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-29","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Firstly, an analysis of the current implementation of robot control under the Active Inference is made to understand its accomplishments and limitations. Secondly, both offline and online control schemes under the Active Inference framework are proposed. To continue with, a low-level controller is designed to be used in the Active Inference control scheme as a prior of the robot behaviour. The performance of the designed controller and the Active Inference scheme using this controller as a prior is compared to a benchmark controller. This comparison shows that the proposed implementation of the Active Inference scheme does not perform better than the current methods, but with further research on the how to implement this scheme using a real process it may become a valid alternative to these methods.

However, the following type of questions are mostly unanswered for realistic structural types and monitoring systems: Which responses of the structure should be monitored? Which sensor locations and sensor combinations carry the most information? Among the currently available computational algorithms, which one is the most suit- able one in this context? Hence, this study aims to contribute on this front and provide answers for practical applicability. A comprehensive study of a realistic, prestressed concrete bridge built by the cantilever method - the Lezíria Bridge in Portugal is undertaken to provide insight into these questions.<br/>The engineering challenge is studied in a probabilistic framework where the uncertainty sources are model uncertainty and measurement uncertainty. The Bayesian paradigm is used to handle the uncertainty component and a validated Finite Element (FE) model is applied to capture the mechanical behavior. The influence of the potential damage scenario, severity of damage, sensor type, the combination of sensors, prior knowledge of the structure, and the extent of uncertainty of the FE model and measurements are analyzed in this thesis. The informativeness of the Damage Identification (DI) process is reflected by the information content of its resulting posterior distributions. The information content is quantified using measures based on information entropy and the area of credible regions.<br/>It is demonstrated that selecting different responses to monitor may lead to a significant change in the informativeness of the result. It is also shown that for all analyzed cases using the most informative sensor type provides adequate information that reflects the damage state, while the rest types could only complement very limited information. In addition, the hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) seems more efficient and effective to conduct Bayesian inference.

One way of mitigating the severity and the number of VRU accidents is the introduction of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functionalities. Such systems must be validated before being introduced on the market. Real-life tests for validating the system would imply driving around for millions of operational hours which would be very time consuming and therefore expensive.

The objective of this study was to develop a vehicle-cyclist interaction model which would then be used along the existing scenario generation method or for validating generated scenarios. The preceding literature study to this Master Thesis, from which the architecture of the models was developed and potential input parameters were defined, was used as a starting point. Based on the architecture, the interaction model was first developed with the help of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). First, a sensitivity analysis was performed from which it was concluded that speed, acceleration, and steering angle are important parameters for a cyclist, whereas speed acceleration and yaw rate are important for a vehicle’s intent recognition. Furthermore, this analysis also indicated that distance to the center of the crossing is a very good interaction parameter. After selection of the parameters, the model was trained and cross-validated using data earlier recorded at TNO. The cross-validation results of the interaction model showed that the intent recognition is more constant for the whole observation sequence and an improved performance is seen for a prediction time of more than 2s compared to a HMM without interaction parameters. From this study, the kinematic input parameters for the cyclist and the vehicle, as well as the interaction parameters, were defined that need to be included in the vehicle-cyclist interaction model. However, the model developed in this study needs to be further validated using naturalistic vehicle-cyclist kinematic data, and for all type of vehicle-cyclist scenarios.","HMM; interaction; cyclist; Car","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Deployable morphing aircraft are gaining popularity in the academic and industrial world. Their deployability offer the possibility to be stored and takes less space. This is advantageous in volume limited applications like space explorations, where every cubic centimeter is important. Another field where this aircraft is increasingly used is the military field. Deploying it in the battlefield directly from a carrier aircraft opens endless possibility to the operation of such aircraft. However, mid-air deployment is subjected to several internal and external factors that could lead to the failure of the deployment. <br/><br/>In this study, a method to assess the safety of deployment of a deployable morphing UAV is constructed. To do this, an aircraft test case is taken and a corresponding model of the aircraft is made using the Multibody dynamics approach. This model is then verified and validated by two different methods. First, a comparison of the stability derivatives of the created model and an off-the-shelf aerodynamic solver is performed. Secondly, the response of the created model is compared with actual flight test data, where the test case aircraft performs a maneuver. For both validation methods used in this study, the created model is able to resemble the output from the off-the-shelf aerodynamic solver and the flight test data. The validated model is then used as to test the method developed in this study.<br/><br/>The method developed starts with the definition of a safe deployment of a deployable morphing aircraft, where three different safety concerns are considered. The definition of a safe deployment also helps in deriving different categories of deployment which includes safe and various unsafe deployment depending on what causes the deployment to be unsafe. This method is tested on two different deployment scenarios.<br/><br/>By using the method developed in this study, safety deployment spaces are constructed from the range of input parameters determined for the two different scenarios. It is revealed from this safety deployment space what combination of input parameters is favorable for a safe deployment, and what causes the different unsafe deployments. Unsafe deployments are also categorized to understand which of the safety concern causes the deployment to be unsafe.","Deployment Safety; Safety Assessment; Morphing UAV; Deployable Morphing UAV; UAV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Dash-X",""

Being that in this thesis we are interested in continuous-time grey-box identification, we shall be dealing with models that allow for forming a direct relationship with physical meaningful quantities. Such models include the state space representation and the matrix differential equation. In general, identifying such grey-box models turns out to be a non-convex problem. In this thesis, we initially review a framework which allows us to solve feasibility problems which have bilinear constraints. It turns out that most of the aforementioned non-convexities can be captured into a single bilinear matrix equation. However, the resulting feasibility problem, including the bilinear matrix equations, makes the overall search for the actual parameter vector NP-hard. In order to come up with numerical tractable algorithms, we use a heuristic known as Sequential Convex Relaxation to relax the bilinear equality constraints. This iterative scheme is flexible enough to allow for additional (in)equality constraints, possibly resembling any other physical constraints. We explore two different approaches to identify both the state space model and the matrix differential equation; one, by directly identifying the model from the given frequency response function; two, by first identifying a black-box model before performing a small scale optimization problem, transforming the black-box model such that it fits the grey-box parameterization. In addition, we present a novel method which uses the Power Spectral Density to estimate a 2nd order model.

This has been done by stricter regulations over the past years in the form of emission limits. An important element which determines the success of this reduction, is the enforcement of the emission limits. A drawback of the current enforcement procedure is that there is insufficient insight in what happens at open sea or, for example, at the borders of an Emission Control Area (ECA). TNO investigates if there are methods to improve the enforcement of emissions in shipping. Therefore, TNO started a research into an on board emission monitoring system. This report is the first step in this research and has the objective to recommend an on board monitoring system that is able to monitor pollutant emissions of seagoing vessels. The polluting emissions of seagoing vessels that are investigated in this report are: sulphur oxides (SOx ), nitrogen oxides (NOx ), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC). The legislation study showed that there is no legislation for an on board emission monitoring system. This means that there is no obligation for the system in the near future. However, the IMO and the European Union want to investigate enforcement options in the future, which offers possibilities for the emission monitoring system. The available on board monitoring systems were divided into two groups, the low-end systems and the high-end systems. It turned out that the low-end systems are not yet sufficiently developed to withstand the maritime conditions and could therefore not be used as an emission monitoring system in the near future. The high-end systems showed to be suitable in the near future as an on board monitoring system. Therefore, the high-end systems were compared and assessed with each other on characteristics like: robustness, costs, accuracy, number of sample points, dimensions, emission measurement and maintenance. The assessment of the high-end systems was executed in the form of a multiple-criteria decision analysis. The on board emission monitoring system that scored the best was the Opsis M800 from Consilum. The main advantage of this system is that it operates with the UV/IR Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy principle. The big advantage of this principle is that the sensors and the exhaust gas are separated, which causes much less maintenance. The above mentioned on board emission monitoring system is therefore recommended, which means that the objective of this research is met. To improve this recommendation it will be desirable and recommended to test all the high-end systems in practice in order to determine and compare their performance for the above mentioned criteria. The opinion from the stakeholders is that they see potential in the system, especially with the task to create a level playing field, after the implementation of the 2020 sulphur limit. However, they also indicate that international legislation will be necessary to implement the system successfully. The shipping companies also indicated that they see potential for the on board emission system besides the enforcement task.","On board emission monitoring systems; Legislation; Stakeholders; Emission control technologies; Fuels; Sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we provide an application which can be used by everyone owned a NAO robot. In our approach, no markers are necessary to be attached on the robot, making the procedure of playing music, seems natural. We propose an efficient real-time approach for recognizing and estimate the metallophone in 3D space using a single camera. Our vision approach performs well in camera displacements, illumination and aspect changes. <br/><br/>For accurate playing, the robot automatically validates the computed IK configurations based on a vision-based robot control approach and adapts its arm configurations if it is necessary. To achieve this, we rely on the estimated pose of the musical instrument and the detection of the beaters in 2D, based on natural features and then we apply inverse kinematics. Concerning kinematics, we use singularity-robust approach by pre-computing forward kinematics which are used to efficiently solve inverse kinematics (IK) problems. <br/><br/>In our approach we limited on moving only NAO's arms for playing the metallophone. Therefore, we developed a human-robot interaction phase in which the robot uses its perception about the position of the instrument in 3D space and it guides a human in order to place it in a reachable for the robot position.

As such, the Jakobshavn glacier became one of the largest outlet glaciers in Greenland [Joughin et al. 2004]. Ice flow velocities within the same period reached over 10 km/yr with strong seasonal variation [Howat et al. 2011, Joughin et al. 2012]. More recently from 2011 until 2013, even higher ice flow velocities of at least 15 km/yr were observed [Lemos et al. 2018]. Due to the relatively high ice flow velocities, the ice discharge plays the largest role in the mass balance (MB) of the Jakobshavn glacier. Quantification of the ice discharge from ice flow velocities is however, not a common procedure. Yet the evolution of the ice discharge of single glaciers not only improves understanding of the climate-cryosphere system, but also aids quantification of sea level contribution on a drainage basin scale. To that end, this study embodies an indirect ice discharge estimation of the Jakobshavn glacier over the period of November 2010 until March 2016 using altimetry (CryoSat-2 Level 1b (L1b)) and gravimetry (GRACE Level 2 (L2)) data in combination with a regional climate model (RACMO 2.3p2). By subtraction of the altimetric and gravimetric mass balance estimates from the atmospheric component (i.e. the surface mass balance (SMB)), two ice discharge estimates are obtained. This approach does not suffer from the drawbacks involved when estimating ice discharge from velocity fields directly, which are based on offset tracking. Data gaps for long polar nights and clouds in the visible spectrum and decorrelation in general, when the duration between subsequent images over the same location is long, are thus avoided. This is because offset tracking algorithms require recognisable characteristics in subsequent satellite recordings to determine the velocity, i.e. satellite recordings need to be sufficiently correlated. To derive the mass balance from altimetry data, adequate spatial sampling is desired. To that end, this study applies swath processing to CryoSat-2 L1b data with an adapted waveform sample selection criterion to obtain an unprecedented spatial sampling with about 2 order of magnitude more height observations compared to conventional retracking techniques. As a consequence, elevation changes can be derived at a relatively high spatial resolution (250 m).<br/>The elevations are converted to elevation changes, volume change and mass change using weighted least squares estimations (WLSE), hypsometric averaging and density models, respectively. The GRACE-based mass change estimate is acquired using a point-mass assumption at the location of the Jakobshavn glacier. The known, simulated point mass is then scaled to the observed mass by GRACE. In addition, data weighting of GRACE Stokes' coefficients is attempted using the full noise covariance matrix. Subsequently, a LSE is used to infer the mass balance from the two time series (with and without weighting of the Stokes' coefficients).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","","69.1686132, -49.9218905"

The 331-500 is used on the Boeing 777 and is susceptible to a sudden failure during operation due to the release of a first stage turbine blade. Investigations found the failure mechanisms of the blade release to be hot corrosion and thermal fatigue. Prolonged operation and the ingestion of environmental contaminants cause corrosion and a loss of material of the first stage Nozzle Guide Vane (NGV) which leads to a reduction in turbine performance. To counter this loss in performance, the APU controller increases the fuel flow, hence Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), which leads to under-platform crack growth of the first stage rotor and the eventual release of a blade.<br/><br/>A thermodynamic model of the 331-500 is created and validated using the Gas Turbine Simulation Program. Test cell data is used to characterise the APU at its design point before historical failure data comprising on-wing APU performance is analysed to assess the condition of the turbine. GPA, in the form of adaptive modelling, is used to adjust the turbine efficiency to match the model with the performance data thereby determining the deterioration of the machine.<br/><br/>Analysis highlights a relationship between the gradient of turbine efficiency, the ratio of the controller- to model-calculated TIT, and the condition of the first stage NGV. A larger gradient and TIT ratio indicate significant material loss in the NGV and that the turbine is heavily deteriorated. From the analysis, a rule functioning as a threshold on both the turbine efficiency gradient and the TIT ratio is formulated and is capable of predicting the historical first stage turbine blade failures up to 600-250 cycles before failure. This rule may then be used for the monitoring of current and future 331-500s in operation with the aim of preventing failure.","Gas Turbines; Predictive Maintenance; Gas Path Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

However, operating a large-scale quantum computer requires classical electronics. In the present experimental setups, classical electronics is placed at room temperature rather than at cryogenic environment where qubits operate, hence requiring a huge amount of interconnections. Considering future scaling of qubits, classical electronics for readout and control must be placed close to these qubits. This thesis project explores the readout of spin qubits which are one of the most promising candidates for a large-scale quantum computer. The readout chain is one of the essential component for operating the large-scale quantum computer. Baseband and RF readout techniques for readout of spin qubits were explored in this thesis project. Based on this, the decision was taken to implement amplifier for RF readout as this gives the option for multiplexed readout of multiple qubits over a single wire connecting the quantum processor and the control electronics thus minimizing the number of readout lines from 20mK to the 4K stage where cryogenic electronics is envisioned to be operating. Limited scaling of the transistor drain noise at cryogenic temperatures was explored. Since many qubit channels are to be multiplexed broadband LNA is required. Resistive-Feedback was selected as a suitable topology to be implemented in TSMC 40nm CMOS. This is due to its simplicity in providing input match and robust broadband noise performance. The test chip was fabricated and tested both at the room and cryogenic temperatures. When operating at the room temperature the LNA achieved minimum noise temperature of 27K at 200MHz which increases up to 45K at 1GHz with a power consumption of 67mW. The S11 is greater than -30dB at 200MHz and increases up to -10dB at 800MHz. Preliminary measurement results at 5K show the LNA achieving minimum noise temperature close to 4K at 400MHz which increases to 6K at 1GHz with power consumption of close to 37mW. Low noise temperature of the LNA would enable higher readout bandwidths. Also, broadband low noise temperature enabled by resistive feedback will increase the number of channels to be multiplexed and will result in the reduction in interconnections.","Cryogenic LNA; Low Noise; Resistive Feedback LNA; TSMC 40nm; Spin-qubit readout; RF Relectometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-28","","","","","",""

The batteries are attached to the back of the PV module, which could increase the operating temperature of the battery. This could lead to a reduction of the lifetime battery. Other than the drawback, PBIM also has several battery criteria. This thesis aims to do a selection of a battery which shows the least impact to the elevated temperature and could fit into the criteria.Firstly, a literature study is performed to select the battery candidates. The battery is expected to have a high energy density, adequate surface area, high lifetime, relatively low price, and good safety. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) are chosen as the battery candidates as they fit into the criteria.Secondly, a series of modeling are performed. The models are designed to understand the effect of PBIM to the lifetime of the battery and also expected to support the battery candidates selection. Moreover, the modeling is used to design a lifetime battery testing. The models consist of a PV model and battery models. The PV model results in power generation profile in a selected location with a specific load. The battery modeling is divided into three parts, electrical, thermal, and lifetime modeling. An integration of the PV and the battery models is done to simulate a PBIM. With this integrated model, lithium-ion is proven to have a superior lifetime compared to other batteries.Thirdly, a lifetime battery testing is designed with the help of the integrated model. The battery testing replicates the actual working conditions of a PBIM. The battery testing is performed in two constant temperatures with two different current profiles. The current profiles represent higher and lower C-rates, and used to examine the effect of different C-rates on a battery lifetime. The constant temperatures are chosen to study the battery safety and lifetime performance in normal and elevated temperatures. Based on this designed battery testing, LFP cells have longer lifetime than the LCO cells. Therefore, LFP is chosen as the more suitable battery technology for PBIM.","PV-battery system; PBIM; battery; lifetime test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A design-oriented approach has been adopted to generate insights regarding multi-use plat- forms. New multi-use concepts were generated and presented, illustrating what a future multi-use farm could look like. Simultaneously, a rigorous decision-making framework was set-up aimed at identifying superior concepts, while systematically producing insights by making explicit the trade-offs which govern the decision. A most preferred concept has been selected and evaluated in more detail, focussing on the identification of engineering challenges and cost-reduction opportunities through comparison of the multi-use concept with stand-alone references. Except for one item, no major technical barriers for the further development of multi-use platforms were identified, given that the challenges associated to the stand-alone activities can be met. This item is the expectation that mooring loads will largely increase by integrating fixed-netting structures in wind energy platforms. A small set of cost-reduction opportunities was discovered, as well as threats to the economic viability. Evaluation of the cost-reduction potential nuanced the view that large opportunities exist in mooring design and shared O&amp;M vessels and demonstrated that the multi-use concept can also lead to additional costs. Most importantly, further study into the availability of optimal sites for multi-use is recommended, because it can be expected that sites optimal for wind energy may be sub-optimal for the production of Atlantic Salmon.","Multi-use; Wind energy; Floating; Aquaculture; Atlantic Salmon; MCDA; Conceptual design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It is of utmost importance to investigate if the cracking behavior can be simulated by numerical modeling and if in the future, the parametric analysis might be performed without large experimental series.<br/><br/>Two types of numerical models are implemented in this master thesis, namely the lattice model and the continuum model. The lattice model can simulate the crack pattern of different materials in the accelerated corrosion test. The continuum model cannot show the behavior of decreasing number of cracks with decreasing fracture energy in the strain-softening materials due to the bifurcation problem brought by its incremental solution method. However, the lattice model shows the trend to underestimate the crack width of the strain-softening material. The continuum model has better performance in predicting the crack width. Also, the lattice model can predict the influence of the repair mortar-substrate bond strength on the crack pattern. Meanwhile, the continuum model always shows a complete failure in the repair mortar-substrate interface.<br/>The boundary conditions at the bottom edge are observed to influence the direction of the bottom cracks. The edges of the specimen are kept free in the experiment. However, the repaired area is constrained by the surrounding concrete in reality. This indicates that the laboratory test may not represent the cracking behavior of the concrete floor in the tunnel accurately. SHCC is observed to be more sensitive to the repair mortar-substrate bond strength than material with lower stain capacity. Extra caution on the bond quality is advised while applying SHCC in a concrete repair system.<br/><br/>From the material point of view, with increasing fracture energy and strain capacity, more but thinner cracks can be performed in the accelerated corrosion test. SHCC material can perform the distributed crack pattern with a maximum crack width of 0.1mm which is ten times smaller than normal concrete. This behavior of SHCC is very suitable for being applied to a concrete repair system. The distributed cracks with smaller crack width can effectively limit the possibility of further corrosion. Besides SHCC, some strain-softening (under direct tension) materials can also show the deflection-hardening behavior in the bending test and produce the distributed crack pattern. SHCC and fiber reinforced concrete with deflection-hardening behavior in the bending test are suggested to be used in the concrete repair system.","Finite element analysis; Lattice model; Continuum model; SHCC; Fiber reinforced concrete; Accelerated corrosion test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

To extend the original optical flow approach, we model the depth change of the object as the scale change of object in the image and present an approach to estimate the scale change and optical flow jointly. Considering the scenario that obvious scale change occurs between two images, the traditional convolution network fails because it lacks the scale invariance. According to the Scale-space theory and the idea of learning a combination of Gaussian derivative basis to approximate arbitrary filters, we build a Basis Convolution layer that allows the network to see the scale change between two images and make use of it to better capture the same feature with various scales on two images.<br/><br/>We test our models on our own optical flow datasets which involve obvious scale change.

Understanding the diseases that affect humanity fatally is critical to our existence. Researchers have studied various molecules and genetic compounds that are responsible for the proliferation of these diseases in the human body. For this purpose, by-far, animal testing has been used most extensively in drug development. Several human physiological models have also been developed to test the efficacy of new therapies. How-ever, it is very difficult to accurately model human diseases in-vitro which has led to failure of several potential drugs. <br/><br/>Consequentially, Organ-on-Chip (OOC) platforms have been developed to serve this purpose. They are specially designed to mimic human organs on a microlevel. Within such controlled microenvironments, biological and electrochemical cues can be well monitored. Stretchable Microelectrode Arrays (SMEA) are commonly used membrane based OOC platforms with suspended electrodes on the stretchable membrane, that are responsible for electrical stimulation. Additionally, several configurations of ion sensors such as Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECT), Organic Thin-Film Transistors (OTFT) and so on have also been used for integration into OOCs. However, most such devices make use of reference electrodes for biasing the transistors that do not provide for easy integration into standard CMOS fabrication technology. Further, the reference electrodes also can disintegrate and affect the electrolyte over extended periods of biasing. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a reference electrode-less floating gate ion sensor has been proposed that can be realized with low-cost standard CMOS technology. The Charge-modulated Floating Gate FET (FGFET) has been designed, microfabricated and electrically characterized. The device makes use of a standard transistor design with a built-in control capacitor that acts as the reference electrode and sets the working point of the transistor. The gate elec-trodes are extended on an active sensing area that is bound by a glass cylinder containing the electrolyte. This delimits the rest of the device from the ionic solution. The change in current output of the device in response to ionic charge variation with different concentrations of the electrolyte was tested and the results have been shown here-in. The device shows a sensitivity of 0.4 ampere per molar concentration of electrolyte or 0.4A/M, which is very good for research purposes as was intended in this study. Further, the sensing area is fabricated as a free-standing PDMS membrane with suspended gate electrode extensions, which further validates the potential of the Charge-modulated FGFET to be integrated into stretchable OOC platforms. The easy microfabrication process and good sensitivity of the device presented in this work is an important step towards the integration of ion sensors for OOC applications.","Organ-on-chip; Ion sensor; Reference electrode; PDMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This problem is partially mitigated in this thesis by optimizing the observation schedule for optical astrometry of Io (provided by JANUS) using the NSGA-II algorithm. The optimal epochs for space-based astrometry are found to be preferentially distributed around the closest approaches of JUICE with respect to Io. During these events, the observations show a high sensitivity with respect to the dynamics of Io and have a low positional uncertainty.

One of these are renewable energies, which are inexhaustible and increasingly competitive. More specifically wind energy is of highly importance due to its benefits. In order to achieve ultimate wind energy exploitation, the design of wind turbines should be perfected. This rises a lot of challenges for engineering companies, which conduct research on more economically efficient and structurally reliable structures. <br/> <br/> <br/> However, due to difficulties in modeling, industry turns into simpler ways of simulating the conditions and loads under which a wind turbine functions. This project aims at providing a simple yet precise model, which takes into account the aerodynamic interaction of a horizontal axis wind turbine blade. The blade is modeled using an Euler-Bernoulli beam and the cross section is considered to be symmetric, taking into account the coupled bending- twist vibration of the blade. The aerodynamic interaction depends on the relative wind velocity, which includes the vibrational velocity of the blade.<br/> <br/> <br/> The main objective of this project is the tower shadow effect on the structural behavior of the blade. The tower is modeled using a mass attached to a stiffness spring, which are connected to the blade. The chosen mass and stiffness were tuned to the first bending mode of the tower so as to obtain its first fore-aft natural frequency . The tower effect on the natural frequencies of the blade is not as expected. Hence a simpler 2 DOF system was constructed to assess this behavior. By doing so, it is observed that the tower induces an extra vibration to the blade tip response which is also observed in the first mode of the system, which is a rigid body mode with initial displacement due to the existence of the spring.<br/> <br/> The wind profile used was Kaimal Spectrum and the aerodynamic loading was simulated using instantaneous aerodynamics.The tower shadow velocity profile was created for two cases, an upwind and a downwind wind turbine. For the upwind case, the velocity profile was derived from the stream function around a cylindrical tower and for the downwind case Powles model was utilized. The study revealed that the downwind tower shadow has a bigger effect on the blade response. However, it should be noted that the turbulence close to the downwind edge of the tower has not been studied extensively in literature and as a result is has been roughly represented here.To better understand and model this effect more experiments should be conducted in the future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, autonomous, connected and shared vehicle technologies are in a far stage of development and it is only a matter of time before AVs and SAVs enter urban traffic. This research aims to provide insights in the congestion effects of AVs and SAVs on urban traffic, focusing on the differences in microscopic behaviour from conventional cars, and to investigate which easy-to-implement solutions a municipality could apply to facilitate the new mix of traffic. This was researched by performing a simulation study, using the traffic simulation package Vissim and a case study of a network in The Hague during the morning peak in 2040. Several AV and SAV market penetration scenarios were tested. Additionally, two network designs were implemented: dedicated lanes for SAVs and kiss &amp; ride (K&amp;R)-facilities. From the results, it was clear that AVs were able to relieve congestion by increasing road capacity and providing a more smooth traffic flow. SAVs, however, caused higher levels of congestion by stopping at the curbside to drop off passengers, forming bottlenecks for other road users, and by circulating on the network using low capacity links. The dedicated lanes design was unsuccessful at reducing this congestion caused by SAVs. The K&amp;R design, however, was successful at reducing delays, but only for SAV penetration rates of higher than 25%. The advice for municipalities is to closely monitor the situation and to account for AVs and SAVs in each new infrastructural project.","Autonomous vehicles; Shared autonomous vehicles; Urban traffic; Simulation; Traffic simulation; Vissim; AV; SAV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In this research, a positioning model -- Inverse Telemanipulation Capability Map (ITCM) -- is designed which take these into account. The goal of this research is to find if the ITCM can be used to replace manual robot placement and if telemanipulation is influenced by the base pose. Six participants have done a pick-and-place task with the robot positioned in the lowest (ITCM-low) and the highest scoring base pose (ITCM-high) and a base pose selected by an expert (Expert). The results show no difference between the ITCM-high and Expert conditions. Participants also reported that the task was less or equally difficult in the ITCM-high condition. From the base pose of the ITCM-high to the ITCM-low condition, the task execution time increases with 71 % and effort metrics are around one and a half times as high. Moreover, participants reported that task was more difficult from the ITCM-low base pose.

However, with the increasing demand for energy, immediately stopping the production and use of fossil fuels is not realistic. Natural gas is twice as clean as coal and hence could be considered as a transition fuel, which can help to find a balance between the requirements of fighting climate change and producing more and cleaner energy.The high-pressure, underground reservoirs supply natural gas which is usually wetted with liquid hydrocarbons and water. Natural gas is lifted through a production tubing to the surface, with a relatively high velocity and the drag between the gas and liquid will also bring the oil (or condensate) and water to the surface. However, over time the gas supply from the reservoirs will deplete, which gives a decreasing gas velocity, until liquid starts to fall. This is known as liquid loading, which can finally lead to the killing of the gas production. One of the solutions to operate such aging reservoirs is to reduce the cross-sectional area of the production tubing through making use of an annulus (which actually is the space in between an outer pipe and an inner pipe).Liquid loading is noticed to occur when the flow regime changes from annular flow to churn flow. A good understanding of this multiphase flow behaviour in an annulus is desired. Therefore, this Master Thesis project was devoted to obtaining new experimental data and to develop a model for upward gas-liquid flow in a vertical annulus. Experiments with air and water were carried out in the small-scale flow loop of TNO in Delft. The air and water throughputs were varied, and both concentric and eccentric pipe-in-pipe configurations were measured. Both the pressure drop and liquid holdup were measured. The model is able to predict the pressure gradient and holdup for a range of superficial gas and liquid velocities, using different eccentricities in the annulus configuration. The model predicted the pressure gradient within 10% of the experimental values at high superficial liquid velocities (&gt;0.5 cm/s). However, for a superficial liquid velocity of 0.5 cm/s, the model was overpredicting the pressure drop by 100%, which could be attributed to the partial dry-out on the tube walls. To determine the superficial gas velocity, for a given pressure drop and holdup, a modified version of the Wallis correlation was used for the interfacial friction factor. The gas velocity was predicted within 5 to 10% at low holdups (&lt; 0.075). For higher holdups the gas velocity was overpredicted by about 40%. The primary modifications made to the model for the eccentric cases are based on applying a number of grid cells in circular direction allowing for the inclusion of a closure for the variation of the circular film thickness both at the inner and at the outer pipe wall. A verification of the closure of the amplitude or of the closure of the film thickness variation is required to confirm the dependency between this parameter, the eccentricity and the holdup. However, with the applied closure of the amplitude the pressure gradient with respect to the holdup was predicted within 6% accuracy for the eccentric cases.","Two-phase flow; Annulus; Eccentricity; Liquid loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Earlier experiences of BW at WTP Dorst had shown that dosing of NaMnO4 to an aeration-filtration system efficiently reduces As concentrations. However, the so-called AOCF method had undesired operational side-effects, including decreased filter run time, breakthrough of particles and poor thickening of backwash sludge. The aim of this thesis was to investigate 3 process alternatives (respectively dosing of NaMnO4, Fe(III) and Fe(II)) to enhance the As removal to &lt; 1 μg/l at WTP Prinsenbosch, specifically including the impact on operational aspects like the filtration process and the backwash water production and sludge properties. The assessment is based on the results of (full-scale and) pilot-plant research at WTP Prinsenbosch. It was found that Fe(III) was slightly more effective than Fe(II) and NaMnO4 for the removal of As, but at doses of 1.3 mg/l NaMnO4, 0.7 mg/l Fe(III) or 1.2 mg /l Fe(II) a drinking water quality of 0.7 μg As/l could be obtained with all 3 chemicals. In rapid sand filters, As(III) is oxidized biologically leading to subsequent adsorption of As(V) onto Fe(III)oxyhydroxides and Mn(IV) oxides. It was found that the adsorption capacity of the filter precipitates was relatively high, because to obtain a concentration of 0.7 μg As/l, the acceptable adsorption load was between 1.4-1.7 μg As/ mg (Fe+Mn). Although As removal was similar for dosing either 1.3 mg/l NaMnO4, 0.7 mg/l Fe(III) or 1.2 mg /l Fe(II), the impact on the filtration process and the backwash water production and sludge properties proved to be quite different. Dosing of NaMnO4 and Fe(III) led to shorter filter run times, increased vulnerability to breakthrough, higher backwash water production and reduced thickening of the sludge. Contrarily, dosing of Fe(II) and the reference case (without dosing) led to longer run times, no breakthrough, lower backwash water production and superior thickening of the sludge. The differences in the impact on the filtration process and sludge properties between Fe(II) and Fe(III) and NaMnO4 are most likely explained by a different density of the Fe(III)oxyhydroxides and Mn(IV) oxides formed in the filter. The different density may be related to the formation process (biotic or abiotic oxidation of Fe and Mn, homogeneous or heterogeneous precipitation of Fe(III)oxyhydroxides and Mn(IV) oxides) and the crystal structure and density (which may be influenced by Eh and pH). The conclusion of the research for WTP Prinsenbosch is that Fe(II) is the preferred chemical in view of the superior operational aspects. It is also cheaper than NaMnO4 (both chemical costs and sludge disposal costs) and easier to handle.","water treatment; Arsenic; aeration; filtration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-10","","","","","",""

Especially the overexploitation of agricultural land, overgrazing and extreme droughts have resulted in land degradation, often called desertification. This leads to the disappearing of natural vegetation, the loss of soil quality, lower production capacity in agriculture and increased water scarcity, which is most severe on drylands like the African continent. Globally, organizations such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) are fighting land degradation by implementing sustainable farming practices and supporting re-vegetation projects such as the Green Wall Initiative in Africa, often using ancient water harvesting techniques. Justdiggit, a Dutch NGO, is currently working on land restoration projects and dug over 72,000 water-retaining semi-circular bumps, or ’bunds’, in Kenya. By retaining rainwater in these bunds, water is given the time to infiltrate into the soil, erosion rates by overland flow are reduced, while vegetation recovers and on the long termcan take over the function of the bunds. Although the first results of the bunds at small scale are promising, the impact of the projects of Justdiggit has never been quantified on a large scale in terms of the amount of water that’s retained, increase of vegetation and decrease of surface temperature.<br/><br/>As dense in-situ networks are expensive and have difficulties in capturing the large spatial variability of parameters such as soil moisture and temperature, often remote sensing (satellite observation) is used, which does well in measuring spatial variability on large scales. However, as optical remote sensing is often affected by cloud cover, data availability is limited. Furthermore, it is difficult to translate optical vegetation parameters such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to vegetation biomass, as these only observe the surface of the canopy. Passive microwave remote sensing, which is measured in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, has proven to be very accurate in determining parameters such as soil moisture content, surface temperature and vegetation optical depth (VOD, related to vegetation thickness and water content). The advantage of using microwaves is that it can ’see’ through clouds and can therefore be used under almost all atmospheric circumstances. However, due to the low intensity of passive microwaves, resolutions are low (¼ 50x30km). VanderSat, a Dutch remote sensing company, downscales the low-resolution passive microwave observations to 100x100m field-scale resolution. The goal of this research is therefore to test if the project areas of Justdiggit can be monitored using these downscaled passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture, surface temperature (night-time) and vegetation optical depth products of VanderSat.<br/><br/>Using in-situ data from sensors that were installed inside and outside the bunds during a fieldwork in Kenya in March 2018, the hydrological behaviour of the bunds was investigated. Furthermore, a cross-validation was carried out to compare the downscaled passive microwave soil moisture, surface temperature (nighttime) and VOD products to the in-situ sensors, thermal derived surface temperatures (day- and night-time) from MODIS and NDVI fromSentinel-2 and MODIS. After these cross-comparisons, the differences between the project areas of Justdiggit and the reference area were analysed using the downscaled passive microwave products. Finally, using the Tau-Omega model, the passive microwave signal from the bunds was simulated. <br/><br/>All in all, the analysis of the results have shown that the bunds have a significant effect on the soil moisture content, especially at the deeper soil layers, based on the in-situ sensors, while results of NDVI have shown a clear contrast in vegetation ’greenness’ between the project areas and the reference area. Due to the short measuring period, the correlations between the in-situ sensors and the downscaled soilmoisture and surface temperature products were still low. Furthermore, highest correlations were found between the downscaled surface temperature product and the night-time surface temperatures of MODIS. As it turned out, no significant differences were found between the project areas and the reference area based on the downscaled passive microwave products. This, in spite of the fact that the soil moisture, surface temperature and VOD products have shown to be consistent. Finally, modelling of the microwave signal of the project areas, has shown that the effect of the bunds is still too small in terms of emissivity and is therefore not being measured yet. Increasing the current percentage of bunds from10 to roughly 20%, or waiting five years after implementation of the bunds in 2016, should give significant differences in terms of soil moisture, surface temperature and vegetation optical depth, as a result of vegetation development and land restoration in the project areas.","Land degradation; Land restoration; Remote Sensing; Passive microwave remote sensing; Water Resources Management; Soil Moisture; Surface Temperature; Vegetation Optical Depth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-2.90, 37.85"

Two different control modes are implemented: buck operation for the start-up of the grid and a special constant frequency modulation for soft switching and increased efficiency of the converter.<br/>Furthermore, its use as multi-purpose converter, its low level control schemes and the co-operation with the high-grid level control are studied. Physical switching models are used to account for the real operation of the converter, when operating under higher level control, aiming at grid stability and optimal power flow.","DC-DC power converters; bidirectional converter; DC Microgrid; ZVS; Droop Control; Decentralized Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In 2003, it was established that the sea dike between Petten and Camperduin was insufficiently safe.<br/>To ensure the safety of the hinterland against flooding, this part of the Dutch sea defence system needed to be strengthened.<br/>During the design process, the most favourable variant was to construct a dune and beach system in front of the sea dike, which was constructed soon after, and finished in 2015.<br/>This changed the 'hard' sea defence to a 'soft' one, linking the beaches and dunes in the north and south with each other.<br/>Thereby not only increasing the safety of this part of the coast, but also providing a new area reserved for recreation and nature.<br/><br/>The change from a hard to a soft coastal system fundamentally changes the characteristics of the area.<br/>Where the old sea dike was a static structure, the newly constructed sandy beach and dune system is very dynamic in nature.<br/>The change in properties of this coastal defence stretch brings the question how the HD (Hondsbossche Dunes) can best be maintained to ensure its functions as a sea defence now and in the future.<br/>The answer to this question requires insight in the processes relevant to aeolian sediment transport in general, and for the HD in specific.<br/>With the knowledge of what processes are important for coastal dune growth in the HD, a model can be selected to make predictions on the likely development of the HD in the future.<br/><br/>Aeolian sediment transport, much like hydrodynamic sediment transport, can be described as a balance between forcing and resistance against forcing.<br/>The most important factors which govern the dynamics of dune growth as a consequence of aeolian sediment transport are: wind speed and direction, grain size, humidity, sediment availability, beach slope, and vegetation.<br/>Especially vegetation (marram grass) is important, as it stabilizes the dunes with its roots and rhizomes below ground, and by locally decreasing the wind velocity with the biomass above ground.<br/>The above ground component of the marram grass not only stabilizes the present sediment, it also accommodates a sheltering effect for any incoming sand grains.<br/>Dune growth rate is the sum of incoming and outgoing aeolian sediment transport rates.<br/>For a healthy dune system, this must be a positive value, as this process negates the effect of dune erosion as a consequence of storm events.<br/><br/>In the period between 2015-2018, positive dune growth rates have been observed.<br/>An alongshore dune growth velocity gradient has been found, with the highest growth rate being in the south.<br/>This is due to a combination of difference in vegetation health (being poorer in the north), and the orientation of the dunes in relation to the average wind direction (more onshore directed in the south).<br/>The dune growth rate has decreased over time, but has remained positive over the regarded period.<br/>This is due to the eroding beach, which decreases the sediment availability for aeolian transport.<br/>Another factor is the coarsening of the average grain size as a consequence of aeolian transport on the constructed coast, increasing resistance to aeolian transport.<br/>This largely explains the decreasing growth rates of the dunes, along with the fact that beach armoring starts to develop in the HD after construction.<br/><br/>The cellular automaton model DuBeVeg, developed at the University Wageningen, is used to model aeolian sediment transport, and the effect of vegetation in the HD.<br/>This model is chosen over other models like AeoLiS and Aeolus, as DuBeVeg is capable of modeling vegetation growth both in surface area and effectiveness against erosion as a result of vegetation density.<br/>Several improvements have been made to the model.<br/>Non-erodible elements have been implemented, which allows the user to model the effects of the presence of objects such as the old sea dike behind the dunes, or pavement on top of the dunes.<br/>Mass balance has been implemented in the model, with an option to define a sediment flux in the marine area of the model as a consequence of cross-shore and/or long-shore sediment transport.<br/>A dynamic erosion profile on the beach is implemented, based on the erosion profile of Vellinga.<br/>Climate change in the form of sea level rise and changes in wind velocity have been modeled.<br/><br/>Sea level rise affects aeolian transport rate and coastal dune development by influencing the sediment availability on the beach.<br/>Higher water levels increase the reach of hydrodynamic processes, which result in higher beach erosion rates.<br/>To ensure sediment availability for aeolian sediment transport, nourishments are an effective measure.<br/>Higher sea level rise asks for a shorter interval between nourishments to ensure sediment availability.<br/>Higher and lower wind velocities generally result in higher and lower aeolian sediment transport rates respectively.<br/>Higher aeolian sediment transport rates don't necessarily result in higher dune growth rates, as the stabilizing effect of vegetation against aeolian erosion must be present to prevent aeolian transport out of the dune area.<br/>Marram grass has an optimum accretion rate at which the plant grows best, and therefore stabilizes the dune most efficiently at this dune growth rate.<br/>Therefore, an optimum dune growth rate exists.<br/><br/>To ensure the HD can maintain its functions as a sea defence, nature reserve and recreational area, it is important for the dunes to grow under average conditions.<br/>To ensure this, sediment needs to be available on the beach which is ready for aeolian sediment transport toward the dunes.<br/>Enough vegetation needs to be present on the dune surface to protect the dunes against aeolian erosion by sheltering, lowering the local wind velocity at the surface. Thereby inhibiting aeolian transport in the dune itself.<br/>The sediment availability can be ensured by nourishing the beach or foreshore.<br/>The presence of enough healthy vegetation can be ensured by providing the right abiotic conditions for the vegetation to thrive.<br/>Increasing the biodiversity in the area makes the HD more robust to changes in the climate, such as sea level rise and changing wind climates which results in different rates of accretion in the dunes.<br/><br/>Increasing the biodiversity enhances the HD's other functions as a nature reserve and recreational area as well.<br/>Biodiversity helps with the robustness of the ecosystem, and makes the area more enjoyable for recreational purposes.<br/>The nourishments ensure the presence of a wide beach, ensuring enough room is available for a recreational day on the beach.","dune; Dune development; dune growth; Aeolian sediment transport; Vegetation; coastal; Coastal Engineering; cellular automata; DuBeVeg; AeoLiS; Aeolus; coastal management; Sea level rise; wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","52.73939, 4.64125"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The phenomenon of earthquake-induced soil liquefaction has been a major issue among geotechnical engineers mainly due to the dramatic consequences this could have on civil structures. Basically, earthquakes propagate shear waves generating excess pore pressures and thus weakening the effective shear resistance of granular soils to their minimum until they liquefy behaving like a viscous fluid. This occurs because the soil experiences undrained behaviour against these rapid cyclic loads. In practice, the cyclic shear resistance of the soil against earthquakes is assessed by means of empirical correlations from in-situ penetration tests and cyclic laboratory tests. However, the liquefaction phenomena analysis is still a topic under research in which soil constitutive models play an important role. <br/>The PM4Sand is an advanced soil constitutive model that has been developed to simulate soil liquefaction behaviour of granular soils by defining mainly three model parameters being an easy calibration model and therefore very attractive for the industry. The current project aims, firstly, to verify the PM4Sand model response at soil element level and secondly, to validate its use for quay wall structures design using the finite element methods software, PLAXIS 2D.<br/>During the first phase of the project, a comparison between the PM4Sand model response and documented cyclic DSS tests documented by Sriskandakumar (2004) is performed. In this, a parametric assessment identifies the influence of the model parameters on the model response, allowing also to evaluate the original calibration methodology proposed by Boulanger and Ziotopoulou (2017). Consequently, initial state conditions are evaluated. It was observed that a proper calibration of the PM4Sand model provides satisfactory response both in terms of stress paths and generation of excess pore pressure, even though the model tends to overestimate the cyclic resistance of the soil at higher cyclic stress levels and to underestimate this at lower levels with respect to a target ‘CRR vs Nc’ relation. Moreover, static shear stress effect is not well captured by the model but this is still under discussion as this effect is not fully understood yet.<br/>In the next phase, modelling of the case study is developed based on research carried out by Iai and Kameoka (1993). The PM4Sand model is calibrated based on the representative SPT tests at the site to then be implemented on the upper liquefiable soil layers. The dynamic analysis of the collapsed quay wall was applied using different approaches: dynamic analysis with and with consolidation effect, and using free-field and tied-degree of freedom lateral boundaries. The results showed that the PM4Sand model is able to properly simulate the onset of liquefaction even though the displacements obtained were much lower than those documented.<br/>Finally, an initial evaluation of the post liquefaction effect of the model was performed that could be considered as a starting point for future research.<br","Soil Liquefaction; Soil Constitutive Model; Earthquake Engineering; Geotechnical Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Based on a predefined map of the environment, the shuttle is able to navigate through mixed traffic its perception sensors such as camera, radar and lidar sensors. This study is acquired in collaboration with RCS and focuses on two parts: assessing the influence of different factors on the domain shift and assessing the importance of depth information in the transformation of scene understanding from image space to top view.<br/><br/>For the WEpod, or any self-driving vehicle to safely travel over the road and through traffic, it is important to understand road scenes that appear in our daily life. This scene understanding is the base for a successful and reliable future of autonomous vehicles. Deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to execute the task of semantic segmentation is a typical approach to attain such understanding of the surroundings. However, when a CNN is trained on a certain source domain and then deployed on a different (target) domain, the network will often execute the task poorly. This is the result of differences between the source and target domain and is referred to as domain shift. Although it is a common problem, the factors that cause these differences are not yet fully explored. We filled this research gap with the investigation of ten different factors.<br/>To explore these factors, a base network was generated by a two-step fine-tuning procedure on an existing convolutional neural network (SegNet) which is pretrained on the CityScapes dataset (dataset for semantic segmentation). Fine-tuning on part of the RobotCar dataset (road scenery dataset recorded in Oxford, UK) is followed by a second fine-tuning step. The latter is done on part of the KITTI dataset (road scenery dataset recorded throughout Germany). Experiments are conducted in order to obtain the influence of each factor on a successful domain adaptation (i.e. negligible domain shift). The influence of factors on the domain shift based on semantic segmentation is assessed by comparing the result of every factor to the result on the base network. Results consist of the F1-measure and Jaccard index for drivable path segmentation and occupancy segmentation although the emphasis lies on the drivable path segmentation.<br/>Significant positive influence on the estimation of drivable path for the WEpod domain was obtained when the ground truth labels only consisted of two labels (i.e. drivable path and non-drivable path) instead of three classes. This performance gain is signed by an increase of 8 percent points for both the IoU and the F1 metric. Making all images intrinsically consistent, and thus removing all geometric differences between the camera sensors, resulted in a larger increase of performance metrics. Compared to the baseline, both the Jaccard index and F1 metric increased with 10 percent points. The training order is a main contributor for domain adaptation with an increase of the IoU metric of 18 percent points and 20 percent points for the F1 metric. This shows that the target domain (WEpod) is more closely related to RobotCar than to KITTI.<br/><br/>Although the investigation of different factors potentially can realise a better performance on the WEpod domain, understanding the environment in image space is not enough because path planning is utilised in top view. Hence, a transformation between image space and top view is needed to use the scene understanding based on semantic segmentation to the full extent. For this transformation, three setups are utilised with each a different form of depth information available: no depth information, ground truth depth information and estimated depth information. This approach gains insight into the relevance of depth information on the usability of scene understanding. The accuracy of top view transformations is measured in the form of four metrics: raw lateral error, scaled lateral error, overlap length and a count metric. The first metric is concerned with the raw difference between the estimated and ground truth trajectory. The second metric is a scaled form of the former. The overlap length measures to what extent the trajectory is estimated while the count metric takes into account if the estimated trajectory is present in top view.<br/>From the experiments it is concluded that depth information plays an important role in the lateral sense of the trajectories while it is of less importance for the longitudinal length of the trajectory. It is also noticed that depth information does not necessarily needs to be dense. Moreover, the sparse but ground truth depth information leads to a better trajectory.","Drivable Path; Domain Adaptation; Convolutional Neural Networks; Top View Transformation; Self-driving car","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The various lithologies have their own number of mechanical properties and the layering effect introduced the term of mechanical contrast, which represents the ratio of rock strength between adjacent layers. Mechanical contrast and confining pressure highly influence the fracture behavior in the layered rocks.<br/>In this study, fractures in layered rocks are investigated, starting with its geometry and also the stress field contributed to the fracture generation and development. The fracture geometry such as fracture length, average aperture, aperture distribution and orientation are quantified in a two dimension slice image. The study focused on comparing the fracture behavior when (a) the layered rock compositions are the same between samples with increasing confining pressure or (b) the different compositions of layered rocks (different mechanical contrast) between samples in the same confining pressure.<br/>The results show that fracture tends to propagate through layer interface when the mechanical contrast between adjacent layers and the confining pressure are low. The fracture in the weak layer developed at a gentler dip (shear fracture) with higher fracture aperture compared to the ones in the strong layer which almost vertical (tensile fracture). In addition, the shear fracture in the weak layer usually accompanied by the zone of cataclastic flow while the tensile fracture has a more clear pathway for fluid flow.<br/>However, mode I opening/tensile fractures are less likely to affect fluid flow in the reservoir because their aperture is insignificant at depth. While in mode II sliding/shear fractures, only several parts along the fracture that can provide the open space, which depend on the presence of jogs and irregularities on the fracture surfaces.<br/>The results from fracture measurements show that in the weak layer, average aperture and aperture distribution will reduce with the increasing of confining pressure, but increased with the increasing of mechanical contrast. Average fracture aperture and distribution have a significant role in capillary pressure. The higher average aperture will reduce the amount of pressure needed to flow the fluid, while a higher number of aperture standard deviation (aperture distribution) has a contrasting effect. The average aperture has a bigger impact on capillary pressure compare to aperture distribution. Thus, by increasing the confining pressure or decreasing the mechanical contrast, the required pressure for fluid to flow is increasing.<br/>Furthermore, the numerical modeling is performed by imitating the rock mechanical properties and the fracturing conditions from the laboratory experiment. The results show that under compressive stresses, the layered rocks still generate tensile stresses around the interface within the strong layer. The tensile stresses occur because of the stress transfer between adjacent stiff and soft layer with a bonded interface. The presence of tensile stress and the crack-tip stress are responsible for the generation of the tensile fracture in the strong layer for all samples.<br/>The effect of varying the number of confining pressure, Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus on the tensile stresses distribution are also performed. The sensitivity study shows that Poisson’s ratio has a more significant impact compared to Young’s modulus on both maximum tensile stress and thickness of tensile region. Higher Poisson’s ratio resulting in higher tensile stresses, while on Young’s modulus it depends on the contrast between adjacent layers rather than the magnitudes.<br/>Understanding the fracture behavior in layered rocks is beneficial for reservoir characterization, as fractures can enhance the permeability and providing vertical connectivity between isolated reservoirs. Accurately interpret 3D natural fracture distribution can help the estimation of the resource and recoverable potential early in field life. It will also contribute to optimizing the well placement and completion design for efficient production planning.","Layered Rocks; Rock Fractures Behavior; Rock Modelling; Stress Distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Therefore, the challenge is to sense between inputs from separate modalities, without information from both modalities at the same time step. Lately, the scientific challenge of cross-modal person re-identification between depth and RGB is getting more and more attention due to the needs of intelligent vehicles, but also interested parties in the surveillance domain, where sensing in poor illumination is desirable. Techniques for cross-modal person re-identification have to solve several concurrent tasks. First, techniques have to be robust against variations in the single modalities. Occurring challenges are viewpoint changes, pose variations or variations in camera resolution. Second, the challenge of re-identifying a person has to be solved across the modalities within a heterogeneous network of RGB and depth cameras. At the present day, work in cross-modal re-identification between infrared images and RGB images exist. At the same time almost no work was done in re-identification between depth images and visible light images. The objective of this work is to fill this gap by comparing the performance of different techniques for cross-modal re-identification of persons. The main contributions of this work are two-fold.<br/>First, different deep neural network architectures for cross-modal re-identification of persons between depth and visible light are investigated and compared. Second, a new technique for cross-modal person re-identification is presented. Thet echnique is based on two-step cross-distillation and allows to extract similar features from the depth and visible light modality. Therefore, the task of matching persons sensed between depth and visible light is facilitated and can be solved with higher accuracy. Within the evaluation, it was possible to report state-of-the-art results for two relevant datasets for cross-modal person re-identification between depth and RGB. For the BIWI RGBD-ID dataset the pre-existing state-of-the-art was improved by more than 15% in mean average precision. Additionally, it was possible to validate the performance of the method with the RobotPKU dataset. Although the method was successfully applied in cross-modal person re-identification between depth and RGB, it was shown that in another modality combinations, like RGB and infrared, the technique in its current definition cannot be considered state-of-the-art. Finally, it is possible to give a lookout on the implications of the results for the intelligent vehicles domain. For a successful deployment in this area more thorough datasets have to be developed and the performance on sparse depth maps, as provided by lidars or radars, have to be investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The further a source in the sample is removed from the centre of rotation in the focal plane, the more distorted the image is in tangential direction due to the limited DoF. The goal of this research is to extend the depth of field in Optical Projection Tomography. The DoF limitations due to diffraction are mainly caused by the Gaussian beam shape and its inherent limitations such as a small high intensity spot and a small region of focus. An alternative to Gaussian beams is found sporadically in the literature in the form of non-diffracting beams. Non-diffracting beams are beams that propagate without diffraction and show regenerative properties after obstruction. The Bessel beam is a non-diffracting beam that is rotationally symmetric and displays a transversal high-intensity core. It can be generated without energy loss with a lens shaped like a rotationally symmetric prism, called an axicon. <br/>A propagation simulation of the axicon generated Bessel beam, using the Hankel transform as a rotationally symmetric alternative to the 2D Fourier transform, is performed and used to verify the analytic description of the axicon generated Bessel beam. A numerical OPT simulation shows that OPT reconstructions of point sources show virtually no blurring, but do show concentric rings due to the intensity distribution of the Bessel beam. These rings can be removed by deconvolution of the projection or deconvolution of the reconstruction of simulated OPT results with the imaging point spread function (PSF) of the axicon-generated Bessel beam. The PSF describes the response of the imaging system to a point source.<br/>Practical work is presented with the imaging set-up of an axicon with an objective lens as described earlier. The resolution of the PSF is analysed over paraxial distance from the objective lens for both coherent and incoherent illumination. The same is done for a resolution target in transmission. Comparison of the Bessel system with Gaussian models show that the DoF increase shown by the Bessel system is significant in all cases. It is found that for sources with spatially narrow intensity distributions (near-point source) the PSF resolution matches theoretical predictions. However, as the spatial light source distribution increases slightly, Bessel distributions overlap spatially. This creates artefacts and deteriorates the resolution<br/>It is concluded that extended depth of field in OPT can be achieved with non-diffracting axicon generated Bessel beams. However, for objects larger than point sources the resolution deteriorates.

For example, one might assume that a user is interested in comedy movies when this user watches comedy movies frequently. Recommender systems are designed to understand the preference of a user from his interactions with the items and suggest items that correspond to his preference. Therefore, observing users’ behavioral pattern in consuming items is essential to capture users’ interest. We define this behavioral pattern of the users in consuming the items as a user dynamic. In this thesis, we investigate user dynamic patterns/features that can be extracted from the implicit feedback and further utilize such features to further improve the recommender systems. Moreover, we aim to leverage such user dynamic features to improve the recommender systems to predict the preferred items in the far future. Three types of item features are explored to discover potential user dynamic patterns: we explore whether a user tends to consume an item that has been rated frequently by the similar users; we explore the moment when an item was rated may influence the probability that this item is rated by a user in the future; and we explore whether the popularity of an item may influence the probability that this item is rated by a user in the future. Some useful patterns are observed from the user dynamics analysis. Furthermore, we propose several<br/>modeling approaches to integrate the observed user dynamic features into the recommender systems, and we start to integrate it into the Bayesian Personalized Ranking Matrix Factorization (BPR-MF). The results show that modeling user dynamics could improve the prediction performance of BPR-MF.","user dynamics; recommender systems; implicit feedback; user behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

In this flow type the viscous oil is lubricated by a water annulus along the pipe wall. The Launder-Sharma low-Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model is used with the Volume-of-Fluid solver in interFOAM. Three types of simulations were carried out: 3D multiphase flow in a pipe section, 2D multiphase flow in an axi-symmetric pipe section (wedge-shaped section), in which gravity is ignored, and 2D single phase water flow in the annulus, using an imposed wavy boundary. This enabled to study the effect of the viscous oil core on the annulus behaviour, such as the turbulence structures and possible dispersion of oil into the water annulus. In particular the rationale of a 'solid-core' assumption is discussed through the comparison between simulations for the annulus that use the 'interface-bounded' flow and 'wall-bounded' flow. <br/><br/>A main finding of this study is that the use of the Compressive Volume of Fluid (CVOF) method in the multiphase simulations gives spurious dispersion of oil in the water annulus. This is the primary cause of the over-prediction of the pressure gradient simulations carried out in a previous study. Therefore, the Coupled Level-Set Volume of Fluid (CLSVOF) interface capturing method has been implemented in the 3D multiphase model. The new predictions show a good agreement with the experimental data at 20, 30, 40℃ (corresponding to a descrease in the oil viscosity). The oil dispersion in the annulus region close to the wall is diminished by using the new method while the sharpness of the interface is not improved. The CLSVOF interface capturing method is concluded to be an efficient and reliable interface capturing method for the numerical prediction of core-annular flow.<br","Interface Capturing; Coupled Level-Set Volume of Fluid Method; Core-annular flow; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

It causes several problems, including the unfavourable colour and odour of water, formation of disinfectant by-products and harmful microbial growth. In drinking water treatment, anion exchange (anion-IEX) is used for NOM removal. However, the regeneration of anion-IEX produces a brine, which is a high saline waste stream containing the desorbed NOM and anions (i.e. sulphate) as well as the residual sodium chloride added during the regeneration process. One possible approach to manage the waste brine is to recover the valuable compounds from the brine, and consequently, reduce the brine volume that has to be disposed. The separation could be done by ceramic nanofiltration (NF) membranes. However, the separation performance of ceramic NF membranes at high salinity conditions is still not fully understood. Therefore, the use of ceramic NF membranes to treat the brine-like wastes that contain NOM and high salt concentrations were investigated. Commercial 500 Dalton(Da) ceramic NF membranes were used in the salt experiments. Several experimental conditions such as pH and ionic strength were investigated to understand their influence on the rejection of sulphate (SO42-) and chloride (Cl-). The results show that the salt rejection was governed by charge effect, and it changed depending on pH and ionic strength. When ionic strength was 0.1M, the mitigated charge effect led to a low rejection of SO42- (&lt;20%) and Cl- (&lt;5%) by the 500Da membranes. On the other hand, the 560Da membrane used in salt&amp;NOM experiments exhibited more than 95% rejection of NOM but less than 25% rejection of both SO42- and Cl- when ionic strength was 1M. Since the 500Da membranes were unable to reject divalent ions at high ionic strength, it is suggested to decrease the membrane pore size to achieve the separation of SO42- and Cl-. The size of pores in ceramic membranes can be narrowed down by an approach called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) (Shang et al., 2017). In this study, the vacuum TiO2 ALD was applied to coat thin films on the commercial ceramic NF membranes that have Molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) ranging from 600Da to 900Da. After the first coating, the water permeability of the membranes decreased dramatically while the MWCO of the membranes decreased slightly. After the second coating, an increased MWCO was observed, which might be attributed to the plugging of small pores. In addition, the flux distribution and pore size distribution were theoretically analysed to investigate the change of the membrane pores before and after ALD.","Nanofiltration; Brine treatment; atomic layer deposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Then, an event detection application is conceptualized which is used for deriving data and model requirements.

The main motivation is to measure the free surface deformations of an air cavity used for air lubrication of ship hulls. Due to limitations in the available techniques, two novel methods are proposed, out of which the Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry synthetic Schlieren (Stereo-PIV-SS) technique is found to be more promising. This technique uses the input of random dot pattern images captured with and without an interface by two cameras mounted in a Stereo configuration. These images are processed to generate ""pseudo"" particle motion vectors using a Stereo-PIV code. An analytical study is conducted to find a simple linear relation between the pseudo vectors and interface height. Two sets of experiments are conducted to test this technique. One with defined transparent solid Plexiglas and glass profiles and another on small amplitude and slope water waves. For the experiments on water waves, the Free Surface Synthetic Schlieren (FS-SS) technique is used as validation data. In addition to experiments, a synthetic image reconstruction study is conducted to test the quality of the images generated by an in-house code. <br/><br/>The investigation reveals that the Stereo-PIV-SS technique is capable of capturing the flat interface height with sub millimeter precision for all interface heights tested in the range of 5 to 60 mm. Nevertheless, the technique can capture a wave profile with sub millimeter precision only for a limited range of wave parameters. The exact limits can only be defined by understanding more about the interplay of various wave parameters, which include the wave orientation, influencing the reconstruction. However, this technique can capture the profiles of waves having wavelength of the order of 1 cm and amplitude of the order of 1 mm, without requiring information about the mean interface height. Moreover, it is low cost, easy to use and apply since it requires only a standard PIV setting. The first attempt to study this new technique has been promising and it can be applied to specified wave regimes. The method can be developed further by understanding how to remove the effect of wave orientation on the reconstruction and including other wave parameters in the interface height correlation.","free surface measurement; Interface Reconstruction; stereo camera; PIV; Synthetic Schlieren; water waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Previous studies have focused on the aerodynamic and structural design of the airframe; but, prior to determining which engine-airframe integration alternative is most beneﬁcial (e.g. boundary layer ingestion, distributed propulsion, and alike), an aerodynamic analysis of the engine installation eﬀects needs to be performed. In this sense, engine integration studies require of complex models and a multidisciplinary approach to address the physics involved in the engine-airframe interaction phenomenon. In particular, the location of the engines around the airframe has a major impact on the overall aerodynamics of the aircraft. Hence, this study focuses on determining whether the aerodynamic eﬃciency beneﬁts expected from this conﬁguration are not oﬀset by negative interferences with the nacelle, weight penalties, or regulation constraints. In order to do so, and initial benchmark for the lift to drag ratio is obtained from a baseline Flying-V conﬁguration, and the inﬂuence of the x, y, and z coordinates, as well as engine orientation are analysed afterwards. To carry out the simulations, an Euler pressure-based solver on a three-dimensional-unstructured grid is used to model the ﬂow at cruise condition: M = 0.85, h = 13000 m, α = 2.9 ◦ , and T = 50 kN, and the viscous drag contribution is computed following an empirical approach. A total of forty diﬀerent engine locations are tested under these conditions to build a preliminary surrogate model that predicts the aircraft’s lift to drag ratio based on the position of the nacelle. The results obtained show that misplacing the engine can lead to signiﬁcant lift to drag ratio losses going as high as 55% when compared against the ideal integration conﬁguration. Finally, a region behind the airframe’s trailing edge is identiﬁed where the interference losses due to the installation are minimized. In light of the results obtained, a location is recommended for the engines where the perturbations observed on the lift to drag ratio are near the 10%, and a good compromise is obtained among the diﬀerent requirements imposed.<br","Flying V; Engine; Integration; flying wing; Interference; Aerodynamic; Aircraft design; positioning study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These seismic events may cause severe damages to the building stock in this area, which is mainly composed of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings not designed to withstand seismic loads. An extensive experimental campaign has been carried out at the Stevin II laboratory of Delft University of Technology to characterize the seismic responses of these URM structures. In this framework, a quasi-static cyclic pushover test on a full-scale masonry assemblage has been performed. In this treatise, the seismic behavior of the tested masonry assemblage is modeled and analyzed via finite element analyses. The validation against the experimental results is achieved through nonlinear pushover analyses on a well-built model of the assemblage. Moreover, as the pushover method used in the aforementioned studies is based on static loading, its accuracy and applicability on studying the seismic behavior for this type of masonry structure need to be evaluated. The evaluation is achieved by performing a series of nonlinear time-history analyses on the model to obtain accurate seismic response of the structure. The applied horizontal ground motion is representative of the earthquakes in the Groningen province and the incremental dynamic analysis method (IDA) is employed. <br/>The nonlinear pushover analyses reproduce the test results properly, showing similar maximum base shear forces and asymmetric capacity curves. In both experimental and numerical analyses, cracks start to form at the top and bottom of the masonry piers due to rocking mechanism and the failure of the structure is governed by damages of the wide piers. Moreover, a sensitivity study based on the monotonic pushover analysis shows that the post-peak behavior of the model is directly related to the masonry compressive strength. The incremental dynamic analysis provides similar base shear capacity and failure mechanisms as the nonlinear pushover analysis. However, the maximum displacement is smaller in both loading directions and a more distributed crack pattern is observed. Overall, for the studied masonry house, the pushover method is capable of properly estimating the base shear capacity but the deformation capacity might be overestimated.","unreinforced masonry; seismic response; nonlinear pushover analysis; nonlinear time-history analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key issue in the availability of wind and solar power that it is independent of the power demand. Fortunately, the liberalised power market provides a financial incentive to increase both upward and downward flexibility.<br/><br/>Delesto is a company that supplies process steam at ChemiePark Delfzijl. They are looking into the possibility to integrate power-to-heat (P2H) in their Combined Heat and Power installation (CHP). This would open up the possibility to decrease the power output of the plant beyond deep part load conditions, and to save on overall fuel consumption. This would be beneficial for periods where profits made from power production drops below the cost of fuel consumption. For this research it is assumed that the power used is emission free, as it originates from renewable energy sources. <br/><br/>In this study, the technical and financial feasibility of an hybrid configured combined heat and power plant, in which both gas and power are used to produce process heat, is researched. The CHP consists of a gas turbine (GT), a dual pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and a steam turbine (ST). Eight different configurations that offer P2H functionality to the CHP are being assessed. The electric heater concepts are compared to the 'conventional' part-load of the CHP. Their steady state behaviour is evaluated using parameters such as Additional Flexibility (AF) and Effectiveness of fuel saving ($\varepsilon$). A duct heater inside the HRSG offers the greatest AF, whereas an air preheater upstream of the GT performs best in terms of effectiveness. Additional to the initial eight electric heater concepts, the combinations of air preheater with other promising electric heater concepts are evaluated. <br/><br/>A dynamic study of (a part of) the HRSG including an electric heater is performed. Only the most promising electric heater concepts in terms of the steady state behaviour are reviewed. From this dynamic study it can be concluded that the minimum ramp time is of the HRSG is well within the requirements of the grid operator. However, a high pressure boiler parallel to the high pressure evaporator of the HRSG results in relative high temperature drop in the system compared to the other electric heater concepts, and is therefore removed from further consideration.<br/><br/>From a financial analysis, a business case is constructed for an air preheater, a duct heater, a stand-alone boiler and their combinations. It is apparent that the profits obtained at the spot market are negligible compared to the profits obtained at the imbalance market. Transportation costs are relatively high and have a damaging effect on the business case. The payback period of the air preheater is the shortest and the payback period of the duct heater the largest.<br","combined heat and power; Power to heat; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-23","","","","","",""

Among numerous onboard sensors, a GNSS receiver for single-frequency Precise Point Positioning and camera are competitive due to the fairly lower cost and the potential to provide a lot of useful information.<br/><br/>However, due to the degraded GNSS solution performance in city valleys, a tight integration is considered combining the two sensors at the observation level, ie. processing the GNSS ranges and the vision measurements in the image of the camera. The availability of High Definition Maps (HD Maps) aids vehicle positioning by providing extra information on the environment. In this project, landmark positions are retrieved through vision and the HD map, and can complement GNSS in city valleys. Additionally, the project focuses on building the mathematical model for the integration of observed landmark position (using a single camera, considering the ease of implementation and cost) and GNSS measurements, analyzing the performance as well as the feasibility for vehicle positioning. The project emphasizes the feasibility study of the proposed mathematical model, which is flexible and capable of using all available input automatedly, and providing a position solution with the best precision.<br/><br/>The uncertainty in the available landmark positions (for instance errors in the HD maps) is handled in two different ways: one is to include the landmark position coordinates as measurements into the model, the other one projects the uncertainty onto the measurements in the camera image. The latter method turns out to be much more efficient. To integrate vision and GNSS measurements, a conversion between an ECEF (earth-centered, earth-fixed coordinate frame), typically used for GNSS, and a world coordinate frame for the camera measurements, is required. A position offset between the GNSS antenna and camera is considered, since the camera lens center does not coincide with the GNSS antenna center. In the simulation and experiment, an extended integration is also presented and discussed which leaves out the position offset, for instance when the GNSS antenna is very close to the camera, which can further improve the redundancy and lower the computational load.<br/><br/>From the simulation and experiment, we conclude that the integration model is able to produce a position solution when one of the sensors is unable to produce a position solution and the other one still can; the extended integration model is able to produce a position solution even when both sensors individually fail to produce a position solution. Among these scenarios, the one when GNSS fails and vision operates, the integration model can produce a position solution within a quarter of a meter in local horizontal coordinates, and the GNSS measurements do not contribute much to the position solution. Compared to the integration model, the extended integration improves the model by reducing or eliminating the (typically heavy) correlation between the estimates, in particular those for the camera-antenna position offset, the GNSS receiver clock error and the vertical coordinate. Under the same scenarios, the extended integration improves the standard deviation in vertical coordinate and receiver clock error, within a quarter of a meter and one-third of a meter respectively.<br/><br/>Further study is recommended in the direction of applying full image processing procedures to obtain more realistic vision measurements, to include GNSS carrier phase observations to replace the current GNSS positioning based on Precise Point Positioning, in order to have a position solution of similar quality as the vision part. The dimension of system gets larger when carrier phase measurements (phase ambiguities) are added as well as two additional rotations for a camera; the extra rotations introduce a significant amount of nonlinearity in the model. A larger model with increased nonlinearity may call for an alternative model formulation.<br","GNSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The aim of this thesis is to explore the opportunities for utilizing cyber-physical systems in the domain of supporting elderly’s active leisure activities (ALAs) and the possible way of interaction between users and cyber-physical systems. ALAs covers wide range of activities. The focused ALAs in this thesis is resistance training. Resistance training can help elderly to maintain their muscle strength which are needed for performing activities of daily living (ADL). However, elderly’s adherence to resistance training are not as high as expected. The low adherence should be more or less attributed to unenjoyable training experience. On the other hand, the training quality can hardly be guaranteed even if some elderly do participate the training. The insufficient supervision and guidance are the main reasons for poor training quality. Hiring an assistant to arrange training plan, give guidance and encouragement could be an option, but it can hardly be affordable for most of the people. So utilizing intelligent technologies could be another option. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is the focused paradigm of intelligent technology in the thesis. CPSs is the network integration of the components for i) sensing and monitoring the real-life process, ii) reasoning the situations and the actions to react to the situations, ii) executing the reasoned action (actuating) as well as vi) learning from the real-life process. The main advantages of cyber-physical system are i) the capabilities to address multi-faceted issues which can hardly be addressed by stand-alone system or products, ii)reacting to suddenly happened situations which can hardly be even noticed by human. The conceptualized cyber-physical system in my thesis senses and monitors three processes during users’ training: i) trajectory of joints which can indicate users’ motions, ii) facial muscle movement which can indicate users’ moods as well as iii) heart rate. On the basis of the monitored real-life process. CPSs can reason the situations like i) training quality, ii) level of enjoyment, as well as iii) level of fatigue. In the meanwhile, based on the situations, the needed reactions are reasoned, such as: i) guidance for optimizing training quality, ii)message for motivating users, as well as iii) the suggestions on dealing with fatigue. Additionally, some exergaming-based elements are also included in order to keep elderly’s long-term motivation. For example, every user have an unique avatar in virtual world, their training can lead to the growth of their avatar which allow the avatar to compete and cooperate with each other. At the end of this thesis, some general opportunities for utilizing cyber-physical systems in supporting leisure activities were extracted from the case of resistance training. The opportunities are explained in terms of three aspects: i) the characteristics of the contexts for utilizing cyber-physical systems, ii) the real-life process for sensing and monitoring, iii) the knowledge for reasoning and learning.","Active leisure activities; Resistance training; Cyber-physical systems; Sensing; Monitoring; Reasoning; Actuating; Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In practice, a RL agent needs to perform many actions to sample rewards and state transitions from their environments. Recent advances in using deep neural networks as function approximators reduce the sample complexity in very high dimensional environments. Another way of reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning agents is by shaping the learning path into a curriculum. Flexible curriculum learning is a way of shaping where the action and/or state dimensionality of the agent is gradually increased, in an effort to slowly increase complexity of the problem. In this research, a deep reinforcement learning architecture, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), is modified to learn in a flexible way. The flexible DDPG is evaluated on a problem where no coordination is required to test basic functionality of the flexible DDPG algorithm. In addition, the flexible DDPG algorithm is evaluated on a problem where coordination is required. Results show that the flexible DDPG algorithm has a comparable sample complexity to a non-flexible approach.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Curriculum Learning; Flexible Function Approximators; Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, current prosthesis design still impairs sprinting performance in multiple ways. An example is the constant mechanical stiffness of the prosthetic devices. The dynamic behaviour of the blade is determined by this property, but it is static and cannot change according to the gait phase-specific sprinting dynamics.<br/>During acceleration a different stiffness might be required as opposed to steady state running. Therefore, it is hypothesised that amputee athletes can improve their performance with prostheses that have a gait phase-specific stiffness.<br/>In order to investigate the effect of stiffness on amputee sprinting performance a novel and unprecedented modelling approached is used. Modelling is economical and straightforward in comparison to other research methods such as laboratory experiments. In this thesis, an extension of the established Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model is proposed that qualitatively describes amputee sprinting motion. The Actuated Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (ASLIP) is capable of predicting stable forwardly integrated sprinting motion with the inclusion of the start and acceleration phase. Optimisation of the model predicts that phase-specific spring stiffness leads to a significant time reduction on the 100m sprint for given physiological parameters. In general it can be said that a stiffer spring results in better performance. More specifically, the model benefits from a stiff spring during acceleration and a more compliant one in steady state. Although it has its limitations, the ASLIP model additionally provides a valuable insight into the mechanics of amputee sprinting. For example, it seems that optimal phase-specific stiffness is strongly dependent on biomechanical parameters such as touchdown angle, force angle and CoM velocity. Future work in this direction can provide a better understanding of the<br/>underlying mechanisms that determine amputee sprinting performance.<br/>The outcomes of this study suggest that amputee sprinters might be able to achieve a reduction in finishing time with prosthetic devices that have a phase-specific stiffness. The modelling approach used in this thesis is promising and lends itself well to investigate this opportunity in more detail.","Stiffness; Running prosthesis; Forward dynamic model; Performance; Amputee sprinting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The customer needs of these so-called sustainable energy collectives are unlike any other customer groups of distribution network operator Stedin. Their applications for grid connections often require case-specific service. There is no uniform way in dealing with this customer group and this leads to dissatisfaction, rework in the process and long process times. Furthermore, no ownership among Stedin employees has been found to take responsibility for servicing this customer group. The design brief has therefore been formulated as follows: Design a single point of contact for SECs that recognizes and communicates the customer journey that SECs live through when applying for a grid connection and logs all contact between Stedin and the SEC. First, ownership of where to embed this service in the organization was found during a co-creation session with different employees of Stedin and SEC members. Secondly, together with these employees, the service journey of these SECs was co-created using six different story boards. The story boards functioned as a boundary object to be able to talk and make decisions about the service with Stedin employees from different disciplines and to be able to communicate this service to the outside. Thirdly, a digital prototype was designed to show how to embed the story boards in the Stedin website and communicate the service to SECs. When validating the service with SECs, the story boards were found to be a successful way to communicate about the service. The service was found to be sufficing the need of a single point of contact for SECs. For implementation, the service has to be validated with SECs, new to the service, and agreed upon by higher management. To keep the service up-to-date, the newly appointed service desk should organize (bi)annual co-creation workshops together with SECs to check whether the service desk can be adapted to the changing needs of sustainable energy collectives.","Co-creation; Service Design; boundary object; Distribution Network Operator; Energy collectives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research suggests that deep learning technique is a promising approach to plan grasp poses on unknown objects in cluttered environments. In this field, three types of data are used for training: (a) human labeled data; (b) synthetic data; (c) real robot data. Each of them has different properties in terms of the cost of collection and label accuracy. Recent approaches solely use a single type of data to train a model. The problem of such a methodology is that human labeled data is inaccurate and costly, synthetic data is scalable but inaccurate, and real robot data is accurate but costly. In this paper, we use the method of combining synthetic data and real robot data to train a Grasp Quality Convolution Neural Network (GQ-CNN). We collect a real robot dataset of 10000 datapoints without human-annotation, by running a UR5 equipped with a pneumatic suction gripper, with an algorithmic supervisor. We use this dataset to fine-tune a GQ-CNN model. We evaluate models both by classifying collected data and running physical robot grasping experiments. We use 50 unknown objects with prismatic and complex shapes for testing. Our method achieves 100% grasp success rate on these objects, and results suggest that the fine-tuned model learns the diameter and the great suction force of the suction cup.","Grasping; Deep Learning; Transfer learning; Self-supervision; Robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A drawback of the relatively stiff is that the ship often encounters problems in certain wave conditions. Several models exist which study the dynamic effects of the mooring system, when the cutter is not being operated. These models have led to innovations in the development of new spud mooring systems which are more reliable and allow the operators to safely work up to the operability boundaries.<br/>From the desire to study innovative concepts for the cutter ladder as well to improve the range of operability, IHC has offered a thesis project to examine a dynamic simulation program of a CSD in operational condition. This project is based on the program DODO which couples the hydrodynamic solutions of a diffraction solving algorithm (DIFFRAC) to multi-body dynamics. The RK4-method is used for the numerical integration of the equations of motion. Although IHC already has several highly detailed cutting models, none of them were used since early on in the project it became clear that they were unsuitable in combination with the multi-body models of CSDs in DODO. Especially the level of detail and the scale size of these programs eventually led to the idea of developing a new and computationally cheaper model. This new Cutter Force Function is based on a case study. <br/>The model for the case study is constructed according to a conventional multi-body method in which the cutter ladder body and the floater body are connected to each other via constraints. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the Froude-Krylov wave forces of the external DIFFRAC solution are applied to the floater body. The transfer functions of the Linear Time Invariant-system are studied to verify the system and to act as a stepping stone for future simulations that include the Cutter Force Function. In the Cutter Force Function an orthogonal spacial discretization is used for a cutter and a seabed matrix which store a template of force unit vectors and the instantaneous surface height of the seabed, respectively. With an elementwise overlay method the cut volumes and their according force vectors are determined for each time step. The Cutter Force Function provides a framework to which clay- and sand cutting models can be added as well as other effects such as bulldozing forces, snow-plough effects, etcetera.<br/>Several time domain simulations have been run to verify the functionality of the Cutter Force Function. The primary results indicated that the function gave adequate signal forms although their amplitudes were not limited to a maximum power. Due to the fact that this could generate energy in the system at moments at which it should not be physically possible, a feedback control loop based on the cutter drive torque should be implemented. The LTI-model of the CSD and the transfer functions are ready to be used for the study of implementing PID-controls on swing wires.<br","Cutter Force Function; CSD; operability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

ARS T&amp;TT is operating in the market of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), it is building smart solutions to improve the traffic flow. The department of Data Warehousing &amp; Sensoring (DW&amp;S) is responsible for the data coming from stationary sensors along the road side. Currently, the market of traffic data is changing, because of the emergence of in-car data such as floating car data. Next to that, there is no established approach for development of innovative products that will meet the requirements of the evolving ITS market. Further, there exists no insightful business modelling and marketing strategy such that the corporate can unlock all the business potential of the products. DW&amp;S started developing a data visualiser to be more pro-active and invest in the business. The product is called a Traffic Data Warehouse Cockpit (TDWC). This viewer is the starting point of this project.To create solutions in this moving market a thorough market analysis is done. The analysis focusses on the company itself, the competitors, the context in which the problem is occurring and the customers. Three future directions emerged from the analysis. The directions are: market growth for ARS T&amp;TT, the emergence of sustainable cities and the development of the technology around autonomous vehicles. Those directions are plotted into a strategic roadmap from now till 2030. This roadmap presents the technological developments in this time period, the market trends are plotted and the product developments of ARS T&amp;TT are presented and aligned with the market and technical developments.Two product lines were presented in the strategic roadmap and next to that also the business models fitting these product lines are created. Future scenarios are made to do an in depth business modelling analysis for the future product portfolio of the data warehouse department of ARS T&amp;TT. Business model solutions are presented for those scenarios and also a path to change the current business model into the future models is created. In the end of the project the marketing strategy for ARS T&amp;TT is designed. This strategy includes the marketing goals, brand positioning, brand strategy and paths to reach the goals. Figure 2 shows those marketing building blocks in a visual. The Marketing activities are visible for external parties, but the other building blocks are under the surface. The final advice how ARS T&amp;TT should set up their marketing activities is presented in three paths to reach the marketing goals. The first pathway is to increase the visibility for the potential foreign partners by seeking for new channels. The second pathway will make ARS T&amp;TT not only being a supplier, but next to this also an advisor to its customers (the road operators). This will build trust and the customer get to know ARS T&amp;TT better. The third pathway is improving the focus of the communication. The current communication is focusing on the features ARS T&amp;TT is selling, but it should change to a benefit-focused communication to attract the attention of the customers. The final advice to the ARS T&amp;TT are written in a strategic product road map and a marketing strategy to prepare ARS T&amp;TT for the moving mobility market in the future.","Marketing strategy; Product Strategy; Autonomous Vehicles; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Pavement management systems (PMS) are essential for pavement management. PAVER, the most common airport pavement management system (APMS) assists pavement managers by identifying the surface condition of pavement sections, however it’s based only on the pavement condition index (Greene, Shahin, &amp; Alexander, 2004). Other criteria are taken into account by pavement managers to select the pavement sections that will be maintained or rehabilitated; however these criteria are not included in PAVER or any APMS. For pavement managers, it is very difficult to select the pavement sections that will be repaired because not all the sections in need of M&amp;R can be selected. This research has focused on developing a pavement management decision making tool to help pavement managers prioritize and identify the sections that need M&amp;R, based not only on PCI but on all relevant criteria needed for airport pavement management. The main research question to be answered in this research is: How can airport pavement management decision making be improved by means of data to identify the pavement sections that need to be maintained or rehabilitated? The chosen methodology to identify pavement sections in need of maintenance is the absolute Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). This research has explored the applicability of this methodology for prioritizing pavement sections in airports. Three major airports in Europe have been chosen as case studies for this research: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Brussels Airport, and Heathrow airport. Based on literature research and on these case studies, the required criteria used in airport pavement management for identifying pavement sections to be maintained have been identified. The required data for all criteria has also been identified. Based on all the criteria, the required data, and the AHP methodology, the mentioned tool has been designed. The design of the tool was presented to expert pavement managers to corroborate its applicability before its development. The tool has been developed in Microsoft Excel and its applicability has been illustrated by using partially real data and partially fictitious data. The AHP was successfully implemented allowing pavement managers prioritize large amounts of pavement sections, considering all relevant criteria. This research has revealed that pavement management decision making can be improved by means of data, by the development of tools like the one proposed in this research. It was also shown how big volumes of data can improve pavement management decision making, providing managers relevant information like the remaining structural life of pavement sections. Airports can benefit from this research by reducing the required time for prioritizing pavement sections and selecting those to be maintained or rehabilitated, by minimizing the amount of time spent on projects that will be disregarded, and by strengthening or facilitating the application of predictive maintenance.","Pavement management; Maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R); Analytical hierarchy process; Functional condition; Structural condition; Operational importance; Pavement condition index; pavement management systems (PMS); Prioritization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This study aimed to provide insights on how each mode of operation (driving, V2L and V2G) impacts the fuel cell stack performance, as well as the overall system. <br/>Operation in each mode was mimicked by applying typical duty cycles to the hydrogen scooter via an electronic programmable load. <br/>Analysis of the experimental data yielded clear differences between each mode of operation.

The power demand throughout this mode was high, making the fuel cell operate at almost full capacity. <br/>Linear regression analysis was used to determine the fuel cell degradation rate. Severe degradation was measured throughout the experiments, with an overall voltage cell drop of 402 µV/h. Distinguishing the degradation rate per mode revealed V2L operation to cause the largest fuel cell degradation (648 μV/h) and driving the least degradation (205 μV/h). This result was confirmed by comparing the IV curve of the fuel cell stack before and after the experiments: the largest voltage drop occurred at low currents. <br/>Further research on scooter usage in combined modes should include new energy management strategies for V2G and V2L operation, which focus on minimizing fuel cell degradation.","CaPP; V2G; V2L; Mobility; Power generation; Hydrogen; Scooter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The 3 key objectives include a 20% reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and CO2 compared to 1990 levels (and up to 80% by 2050), a 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% share of basis energy consumption from renewable sources.<br/>On its own, the building sector is responsible for 1/3 of the world’s energy consumption, of which 60% is due to heating and cooling. In the European Union, this proportion achieves 40% of the total energy consumption, of which heating, cooling and domestic hot water account for around 70%. Fossil fuels represent 75% of the primary energy supply for heating and cooling needs whereas renewable energies account for only 18% followed by nuclear energy with 7%.<br/><br/>A brief energy context being stated, this work focused on the assessment and the optimization of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, coupled with a building integrated photovoltaic and thermal (BIPV/T) system and a simple BIPV system. The objective was to reduce the overall energy consumption of a very well insulated dwelling aiming to make it a net zero energy building (NZEB). This HVAC system incorporated a dual-tank water-to-water heat pump (WWHP), used for space heating and cooling, using the BIPV/T system as a heat source thanks to preheated air. The dwelling is a so-called Deep Performance Dwelling (DPD) developed by the Solar Decathlon team from Canada: TeamMTL. This DPD was used as case study all along this Master thesis.<br/><br/>On the one hand, this study aimed at the modelling of both integrated PV systems which were developed firstly with the MATLAB software and then with the TRNSYS software. One of the objectives was to highlight the impact of the thermal recovery from the BIPV/T system on its PV modules efficiency compared to the BIPV system. Furthermore, the same initial and boundary conditions were used to ensure a truthfulness on-site energy production from both BIPV/T and BIPV systems as well as for the validation of these systems, later integrated to the complete DPD modelling.<br/>On the other hand, sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of various parameters on the NZEB objective and the on-site energy fraction (OEF) covered by the energy produced by the DPD. These parameters included the efficiency of the PV modules, their tilt angle, the materials used for both floors and walls as well as the size and the control strategy used of both electrical and thermal storage.<br/><br/>First, even if the comparison of both MATLAB and TRNSYS modellings led to a similar net increase in the BIPV/T average electrical efficiency of + 0.0014 [-] compare to the BIPV one, the TRNSYS one achieved an 11.0% lower yearly electrical generation due to an intrinsic factor used in TRNSYS called Incidence Angle Modifier (IAM). The impact of this factor affected all the more the thermal yield, namely a reduction by 28.6% for the annual thermal production along with a 32.0% lower thermal efficiency of the BIPV/T system compared to the one modelled in MATLAB. However, given that TRNSYS was required to model the transient behaviours of the DPD, not conceivable with MATLAB due to the time constraint of this Master thesis, it was logically concluded to use the TRNSYS modelling of the integrated PV systems.<br/><br/>Then, to have a good representativeness of the performances of the DPD, 4 cities with very different climates were chosen. For each location, the DPD was categorized as a nearly zero energy building (nZEB). Then, the simulation results emphasized that an optimal tilt angle adapted to every location, concrete-based floors as well as high efficiency PV modules allowed for reaching the NZEB objective in 3 cities, the 4th one facing low annual irradiation.<br/><br/>Moreover, sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to improve the energy performance of the DPD. Based on the interpretation of the results concerning both on-site energy indices and energy outputs, a better configuration than the one of the as-built DPD was suggested for each city. Indeed, the sensitivity analyses indicated that the bigger the electrical storage, the better the electrical OEF index. Then, a 300-litre hot water tank as well as a 150-litre cold water tank led to a better overall OEF index and a lower energy consumption compared to the initial configuration. These results were obtained by applying the initial control strategy relying on price benefits of the grid based on bidirectional power flows between the batteries and the grid. However, a grid-tied configuration with no more batteries-grid connection and not taking anymore advantage of incentive prices of the grid stood out an even better overall electrical OEF index, making a higher use of the on-site power generation.<br/><br/>Finally, the proportion between the on-site PV production and the amount of energy supplied by the grid to meet the demand of the DPD were calculated. Besides, the impact of the solar house in terms of CO2 emissions as well as its advantages for the grid were alluded.","BIPVT; BIPV; HVAC Modelling; On-site energy fraction; MATLAB; TRNSYS; Deep performance dwelling; Solar Decathlon; TeamMTL; Optimization strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","DPD of TeamMTL",""

The improved model is used to see the effect of FRB system in preventing a long-lasting recession as one occurred in 2008. FRB system is a monetary reform which attempts to separate private banks’ monetary and credit functions. Under FRB system, central bank creates money depending on the price level. Therefore, theoretically, FRB system can prevent recessions by maintaining the price level constant. Van Egmond and De Vries have modeled FRB system using System Dynamics (SD) modeling technique. However, their model has a few model problems which reduce reliability of the model; Ⅰ) the model crashes in different conditions, Ⅱ) the model is based on some assumptions that are less realistic or logical Ⅲ) the measurement units of the model are not specified. In this thesis the solutions for these model problems were sought through a model review and desk research. In the original model, high house prices and debt level are a direct and definite reason why the recession begins. Households default because house prices went up too fast and they could not afford the debt repayment. However, in the improved model, households default because their wages are stagnated. Households default when wages are stagnated while debt level grows high. In both original model and improved model, FRB system successfully protects the price and wage level. Under FRB system, the probability of recession decreases significantly. However FRB system is found to be not effective in stabilizing the price level when the firms’ dividend payout ratio is high. Furthermore, FRB system was not necessary as households do not default when the firms’ dividend payout ratio is low. The reason that FRB system’s effectiveness is decided by dividend payout ratio is because the model was calibrated originally with dividend payout ratio of 100% which is unrealistic in the real world. Therefore, the model is expected to be calibrated properly especially focusing on dividend payout ratio in a future work. Furthermore, it is recommended to include trades with other countries in the model in further work.","Monetary Policy; Financial model; Banking; Money; Economic modelling; Economic crisis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Furthermore, each measuring system can only be used for a single person thus increasing the cost and complexity of integrated systems to monitor many persons simultaneously. For remote vital signs and occupancy detection in many smart home/building applications, radar sensors are a preferred option over cameras, due to privacy preservation and robustness to ambient light conditions. These radars not only need to provide precise range and vital signs information over meters distance, but also preferably can operate on a battery up to a few months or even years, for cost and practical reasons (like smoke detectors).

First, the process of transmission line measurement (TLM) is modelled and validated based on current-voltage (I-V) data comparison between reference experiment and simulation results on polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) based CSCs. Simulation and experimental data are in a good agreement, thus confirming that the modeling method accurately describes the main physical mechanism. Therefore, the simulation approach is used to evaluate the resistivity of complete contact stack for poly-Si and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) based CSCs. Simulation results reveals that the contact resistivity exhibits a clear dependence on tunneling mechanisms in terms of potential barrier size and band alignment. For poly-Si based CSCs, SiO2 thickness (potential barrier size) is the prevalent parameter impacting on the contact resistivity. Additionally, proper doping in poly-Si and buried region in c-Si can improve the band alignment, thus the contact resistivity becomes more resilient to the effect of the tunneling barrier. For SHJ based CSCs, low contact resistivity values are achieved with high carrier concentration in TCO and low activation energy in doped thin film silicon layer. In general, low activation energy reduces the potential barrier for carrier transport while high TCO carrier concentration allows a better band alignment. In particular, for p-type contact, high carrier concentration in TCO is crucial to ensure an efficient band alignment for band-to-band tunneling at TCO/doped-layer interface. Additionally, the contact resistance depends also on the bandgap and the thickness of the passivating intrinsic amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) as they impact on band alignment and also energy barrier size. Indeed, lower values of contact resistance are calculated for thinner i-a-Si:H and narrow bandgap because the reduction of the potential barrier opposing to hole collection. Finally, the presented simulation platform has the potential and flexibility of predicting the contact resistance for any type of CSC stack in terms of materials and number of layers.","Simulation; TLM; Carrier selective passivating contacts; poly-Si carrier selective contacts; Silicon Herero-junction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","NextBase European project",""

For this reason the pipe inspection robot PIRATE is being developped by the University of Twente.<br/><br/>In this project the first goal is to design a high-level control layer, which should allow the robot to autonomously move through various types of pipe segments, without falling. The second goal is to estimate the wheel slip ratio and friction coefficient. The Magic formula and Gaussian processes are used to estimate their relation. The third goal is to design a traction controller, to ensure reliable odometry and prevent falls in a vertical pipe.<br/><br/>The high-level control layer is designed based on the motion primitives. In order to structure the behaviour of the robot, five finite state machines are used. The joints and wheels can be controlled by position control or open-loop voltage control. A set of fourteen commands is used to control the robot.<br/><br/>The high-level controller is implemented in ROS using C++, in the RobMoSys style. At the Skill level, nodes for motion primitives and for sequences of motion primitives are implemented. An extra detector node can trigger a sequence by using information from e.g. a camera.<br/>The traction controller incorporates velocity control and gravity compensation for the wheels, and a controls the clamping force for the bending joints. This controller is implemented in a Simulink simulation model of the PIRATE.<br/><br/>To estimate the wheel slip and friction force, the PIRATE drives forward and backward in a 2D straight 'pipe' and in a real straight pipe. The linear velocity is determined by a camera with a marker detection algorithm. <br/>To evaluate the autonomy of the robot, the robot has to drive autonomously through a 2D 90◦ mitre bend. In simulation the robot has to drive up and down in a horizontal and vertical pipe while using traction control.<br/><br/>When driving, wheel slip ratio's up to 0.3 are observed. Differences in slip ratio are observed when the movement of the robot is obstructed. For the friction coefficient large differences between the wheels are observed. <br/>The robot is able to move through the 2D mitre bend, with the setup tilted up to an angle of 28◦, when commands are provided by the operator, as well as when the robot is triggered by the perceived location of the marker. <br/>Simulation shows that the smallest odometry error is achieved with the traction controller that has a velocity controller, but no gravity compensation, and either a controlled clamping torque or fixed joint torque.<br/><br/>The relation between the wheel slip and friction coefficient can not be identified with either the Magic formula or the Gaussian processes, due to inconsistent behaviour of the robot. The software architecture successfully allows for driving through a mitre bend autonomously. The traction controller is able to select a proper clamping torque such that the PIRATE does not slide out of a vertical pipe in simulation.","inspection; pipeline; Robotics; ROS; Autonomy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","PIRATE",""

Literature has provided evidence for two adaptation strategies in response to an increased risk (decreasing the road width or increasing the driving speed) while lane keeping: decreasing driving speed and increasing endpoint arm stiffness. However, so far these studies did not investigate the interaction between the two adaptation strategies. The aim of this study is to find the interaction between drivers’ speed and neuromuscular adaptation for different risk durations. We hypothesize that the speed reduction is larger when the narrow road is longer which allows for a lesser increase in arm stiffness. Additionally, when the narrow road is shorter the increase in neuromuscular stiffness is larger and allows for a higher speed. <br/>Twenty-six participants drove in a driving simulator experiment in a 1.8m wide car on a 35 km long road. Different levels of risk durations were imposed to the drivers on straight road sections by a road narrowing (from 3.6m to 2.2m) with a varying length (10m, 100m, 250m, and 500m). During the experiment speed reduction was measured and neuromuscular adaptation was quantified by measuring the grip force. Additionally participants subjectively rated their experienced effort from 1-10. <br/>The results show that participants adapted to the road narrowing both by speed reduction as well as increased grip force, without significant impact of the length of the road narrowing. Only on the 10m narrow the speed reduction and increase in grip force was smaller compared to the other three cases. Interestingly, although drivers increased their subjective effort, no differences in speed and grip force adaptation were found between the three longest narrow roads. These results suggest that for narrow road lengths up to 500m drivers adapt their driving style to road width rather than road length. Future studies should identify if the identified speed and grip force adaptations also hold for longer and different durations of risk. <br","Adaptation; Driving simulator; Road width; Driving speed; Grip force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

In order to meet these reduction goals and minimise the global average temperature increase, implementation of renewable energy sources is critical. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources in the European Union, since Europe has the largest offshore wind energy capacity with its shallow shelf sea: the North Sea.<br/><br/>Over the last twenty years, the wind energy capacity has increased significantly to become the current second highest power generation form of the European Union. The downside to offshore wind energy however, are the high costs that come with its generation. Cable losses of alternating currents between the wind turbines and the shore become increasingly high, as the distances towards the shore increment. For long distances, this inefficiency becomes unacceptable and conversion to a direct current is deemed necessary.<br/><br/>A recently presented concept that aims to reduce the costs of offshore wind energy, is the concept of a large scale roll-out of interlinked offshore turbines, coordinated at an European level, including a so-called hub island. This artificial island facilitates converters, as well as a home base for engineers and large scale power storage. Technically, no big problems are expected with the construction of such artificial island. The major reason that could stop the hub island concept, is resistance from environmental organisations.<br/><br/>To predict ecological repercussions of an artificial island, the impact on hydrodynamic parameters most important to the bottom of the marine food chain are explored. The primary producers represent this foundation of the food chain, and are most affected by the island through changes in water stratification and residual currents. These parameters highly influence the light and nutrient availability, thereby regulating the primary production dynamics of the ecosystem.<br/><br/>By developing and applying the Three Dimensional Dutch Continental Shelf Flexible Mesh (3D DCSM-FM) model, the impact of an artificial island on the stratification and residual currents is explored for five case studies. Each case study comprises a 6km$^2$ cylindrical island, for different North Sea locations with distinct hydrodynamic properties.<br/><br/>The implementation of an artificial island alters residual currents up to 10km from its position. The location determines the impact pattern, but influences remain local without any large scale North Sea impacts. Since changes in nutrient availability are only expected for large scale residual current impacts, no significant alterations in primary production dynamics are to be expected.<br/><br/>The impact on stratification however, can have a significant influence on the dynamics of primary production. The originally well-mixed areas remain mostly unchanged, while islands in the more stratified regions can cause significant changes in absolute stratification up to 20km from the banks, and alterations in regimes or the seasonal onset timing up to 2.5km. The location and its hydrodynamic properties are paramount to the type of expected stratification impact, and proves to be an important design parameter for ecology around an offshore energy hub island in the North Sea.<br","Offshore; Hub and Spoke; island; North Sea; Stratification; Residual currents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","56.0 3.0"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Single junction solar cells suffer from two primary loss mechanisms due to spectral mismatch: thermalisation and non-absorption losses. A photon with energy greater than the bandgap of the solar cell can be absorbed to excite an electron-hole pair and the excess energy received is released as heat constituting thermalisation losses. On the other hand, a photon with energy lower than the bandgap of the solar cell is not absorbed and leads to non-absorption losses. William B. Shockley and Hans-Joachim Queisser worked out the theoretical efficiency limit of the single junction solar cell based on the spectral mismatch and assuming band-to-band recombination, arrived at a conclusion that the maximum possible theoretical efficiency of a single junction solar cell is 33.1%.<br/><br/>To go beyond the theoretical efficiency limit, a high bandgap solar cell (top cell) can be optically coupled to a low bandgap solar cell (bottom cell) such that the high energetic photons are absorbed in the top cell and the non-absorbed photons from the top cell in the bottom cell. This explains the principle of tandem solar cells. In this work, a tandem solar cell structure known as four terminal device (4TD) is utilised. In a four terminal device tandem cell, the top and bottom cells are mechanically stacked together to have the same optical path, but are electrically isolated to ensure independent performance. This reduces the fabrication complexity involved in a two terminal tandem device structure.<br/><br/>To access the efficiency potential of various 4TD configurations before the actual fabrication of such devices, a theoretical model was derived in this work. The model predicted an absolute efficiency gain of 2% in the bottom cell for a combination of a-SiOx:H-CIGS (top cell-bottom cell) and a 3.5% efficiency gain for a a-SiOx:H-CIS devices. Based on the theoretical model, different combinations of 4TD’s were fabricated. All such devices showed a gain in efficiency in the bottom cell and the combination of a lower bandgap a-SiOx:H-CIS devices showed a maximum efficiency gain of 4.40%.<br/><br/>The performance analysis of different combinations of 4TD’s revealed that the extent of efficiency gain in the bottom cell is higher for a low performing bottom cell and the potential of the current 4TD configuration is limited by the transmission of the top cell. Using GenPro4 simulations, the optical system of the 4TD were analysed and possible solutions were explored. The infrared (IR) transmission of the top cell showed a drastic improvement from 55% to 80% by replacing the Asahi substrate with textured IO:H substrate. The new optimised top cell possess a combination of excellent spectral response in shorter wavelength and a good transparency in the IR region, thus making it more suitable for high efficiency 4TD configuration.<br","Four-Terminal Mechanically-Stacked Solar Cells; thin film solar cells; tandem solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This increasing level of automation contributes to an increasing safety in traffic and a reduction of traffic congestions due tio faster response times and higher reliability, with respect to the human driver. The automation of a vehicle over the longitudinal and lateral degree of freedom requires additional safety measures to ensure safety of the passengers during automated maneuvers. In a lateral control scenario, the fault detection and isolation of faults occuring in the steering system belongs to these set of safety measures. By detecting and isolating faults of interest in this system, a decision process follows which will, for example, either compensate for the acting fault or bring the vehicle to a safe standstil in the case that the fault surpasses a non-acceptable threshold.<br/><br/>This work presents a set of novel methods for fault detection and isolation for a generalized set of linear time-invariant and parameter-varying systems. The faults under investigation comprise of an additive fault acting as an offset on the system and a multiplicative fault acting non-linearly on a set of known signals. Furthermore, the system is subjected to exogenous disturbances. The first challenge imposed is the lack of isolability of the additive and multiplicative fault using conventional linear estimation techniques. The second challenge imposed is the design of a fault detection mechanism for linear parameter-varying systems subject to exogenous faults and disturbances.<br/><br/>The first contribution of this research is a moving least-squares based approach as an extension to an existing nullspace computation based parity-space fault detection filter. This novel combination allows a decoupled estimation of the additive and multiplicative fault. The second contribution is an extension to the first contribution by attacking one of the largest sources of error: the dynamical content of the parity-space filter. The estimation performance of the combined fault detection and isolation filter of both contributions is provided with a guaranteed performance bound, providing not only an intuitive tool to push down the estimation error, but also shows possible trajectories for future work. The third and final theoretical contribution is the adaption of the linear time-invariant parity space method for a linear parameter-varying environment.

The theoretical framework has been applied in a practical case study in fault detection and isolation for lateral control of autonomous vehicles. In this application, there is a particular interest in detecting and isolating the additive and multiplicative fault, acting on the steering mechanism of the vehicle, for compensation or decision making of the autonomous system in faulty scenarios.

Since 1989, every two years, Het Rijksinstituut van Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) organizes a breast cancer screening for women between 50 and 75 years old. The Dutch government organizes the screening because the advantages at the general population level are considered higher than the potential disadvantages. Over the last years, the policy of RIVM considering the screening was mostly focused on the interests of the public as a<br/>whole. On a citizen level the advantages do not necessarily outweigh the disadvantages (e.g., over-diagnosis, false positives, false negatives) [1]. Recently, RIVM introduced a more responsible role towards the public in its policy. RIVM is adopting a more individually centred approach, taking into account more personal and citizen-level factors, and supporting women with informed decision-making. However, research made RIVM aware of the fact that (1) not all women do make well-informed choices yet and (2) women have a very positive attitude towards the screening [2]. It seems that the new goals ask for another communication strategy. This project addressed the challenge: “how can women be supported in making a well-informed decision whether they want to participate or not in the organized breast cancer screening?”<br/><br/>Research<br/>A user-centred design research is carried out, in which a diverse group of women was included regarding ethnicity and literacy. Besides that, a broad, specified context study is conducted to explore solution space.<br/><br/>Decision-making<br/>In the current communication strategy, only risk numbers are communicated. This strategy is based on the rational decision-maker’s perspective, who has the capabilities and motivation to understand and to interpret the risk information [3]. However, it is often experienced as ‘jargon’ and ‘difficult to understand’. Literature research showes that, besides ‘accurate information’ also the elements ‘freedom of choice’ and ‘awareness of personal values’ are essential for a well-informed decision [3]. The user-centred research of this project showes that women do not make a well-informed decision and, perhaps more importantly, are not supported to do so. A noteworthy thing is that women receive a regular envelope when entering the program at the age of 50. The envelope includes the information and invitation at the same time.<br/><br/>Besides this, women do not only base their decision on the rational models. Beliefs also seem to influence women’s decision-making process [3]. The inspirational research of this project showes that women are also aware of different meanings that are associated with the screening, such as: menopause, aging, uncertainty of life and bodily changes. These meanings play a role in the decision- making process. The current communication material does not give attention to all essential elements for well-informed choices, and moreover to the other meanings. Inspirational research showes that another communication focus might be just as effective: emotions as a source of information [4]. If RIVM showes more empathy to women’s perspectives and communicates in a common language instead of ‘jargon’ (quantitative information about risks), emotion could be used as an effective source for informing and for emphasizing the other essential elements.<br/><br/>Design concept<br/>A periodic intervention of 3 magazines between the age of 49 and 50 is designed, which should activate and guide the decision-making process (see figure 3). The magazines offer women’s stories which represents (1) living scenario’s, (2) different choice options and (3)<br/>different motivations for decisions. The women’s stories create:<br/><br/>A. the possibility to emphasize the 3 essential elements for a well- informed choice<br/>B. space to show empathy to women’s interests and concerns, regarding menopause, aging and uncertainty in an inspiring and sensitive way.<br/><br/>After the third magazine, the woman will receive the first invitation. Whether the design concept realizes a well-informed decision-making on the long-term needs to be further tested as is recommended RIVM. Although, the concept test revealed that the magazine gives the possibility to emphasize ‘communicating on an emotional level’.<br/><br/><br/>[1] RIVM. (2012). Uitslagen en testeigenschappen - RIVM.

(mentor); van Lier, Jules (mentor); Sudholter, Ernst J. R. (mentor); de Oude, Richard (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In today’s industry ammonia is produced on a large scale, and is used in the production of fertilisers, cleaning products and much more. Eventually the ammonia enters our wastewater, either directly or through urine. This is then removed with conventional nitrifying-denitrifying treatment or with Anammox. That process consumes energy and does not recover the ammonia.<br/>Therefore, the goal of the ‘From Pollutant to Power’ project, of which this thesis is a part, is to achieve a paradigm shift for ammonia to become an energy resource instead of a wastewater pollutant. The objective of the project is to recover ammonia and use it in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to produce energy. To do this, a vapour with at least a mass percentage of ammonia (m%NH3) of 5% is needed. The energy produced with the SOFC can then be used to cover the energy need for the extraction of ammonia. The SOFC can produce 4.2MJ·kg-N-1 of thermal energy and 8.4 MJ·kg-N-1 of electrical energy.<br/>This study examines the use of vacuum membrane stripping (VMS) to strip ammonia from wastewater. The research objective is to go from using VMS to recover ammonia from synthetic wastewater to strip ammonia from real wastewater, in order to produce ammonia fuel for a SOFC. To accomplish this, some knowledge gaps need to be filled. First, methods need to be found that concentrate the permeate more than previously possible with the VMS to reach the desired m%NH3 in the permeate. Therefore, the effect of the cross-flow of the feed side was investigated and how to concentrate the permeate vapour with the help of condensation. Next, the effect of contaminants on the VMS process was examined by looking at the effect of salts in the wastewater and testing with real industrial ammonia-rich wastewater from amide production, which contains some organics. The final issue to consider was whether this process would be feasible in terms of energy; therefore, an energy balance was made. <br/>Multiple experimental tests were conducted with VMS to investigate the knowledge gaps mentioned above. The selected test conditions were a minimum pH of 10 to exclude CO2 gas transfer, and to ensure the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in the water was in the form of ammonia and not ammonium. For the experiments, feed solutions of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate were selected with a concentration of 1.5, 12 and 20 gTAN·L-1 with a temperature of 35°C. For the cross-flow experiments, the initial test was carried out with the Reynolds numbers 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600. From this initial test it was concluded that a Reynolds number of 200 is laminar and 500 is turbulent, and those values were used in the rest of the experiments. For the experiments with condensation, a condensation tube with cooling water of 5-10°C, 15-20°C and 25-30°C was added to the setup. Next, the composition of the industrial wastewater was investigated. In the end, the results from the different experiments were used to make an energy balance.<br/>The results of the experiments with VMS show that turbulent flow is preferred above laminar flow, due to the increased ammonia flux and the ammonia selectivity of the membrane, which both provide a higher concentration of ammonia and more permeate. Salt (high ionic strength) will lower the ammonia flux through the membrane and the selectivity of the membrane. The condensation experiment was successful and adding a subsequent condensation step will concentrate the ammonia in the permeate vapour. Moreover, this condensation step will make it possible to recover some of the energy lost in the VMS. The experiment with the real wastewater was however not successful. The membrane fouled badly due to the organics in the water, where organics acted as surfactants and decreased the hydrophobicity of the membranes. The energy balance shows that the system would be energetically beneficial in terms of electrical energy with a concentration above 12 gTAN·L-1 in the solution for both ammonium hydroxide and ammonium bicarbonate, and that a concentration around 100 gTAN·L-1 from ammonium hydroxide is needed to make it energy efficient in terms of thermal energy. <br/>More investigation is needed to be able to use real wastewater in a VMS module. For the wastewater tested in this study, stripping with VMS is not an alternative. This does not mean that other wastewater cannot be used in the VMS, therefore, other industrial wastewaters, reject water and urine should be investigated. Another possibility could be to review other stripping methods for wastewaters with relatively high contents of organics.<br","Ammonia; Membrane; vacuum membrane distillation; Solid oxide fuel cells; wastewater; Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-20","","","","Civil Engineering","From Pollutant to Power",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Purpose – One of the long-standing issues in the field of real estate management is the alignment of demand and supply. When building retrofit is initiated to comply with changing demands, the decision-maker has to deal with several, often competing, criteria. Smart systems have the potential to contribute to the process of optimally attuning the building with the changing demands, in other words, adding value to the building. To date, plenty of research exist on predicting the added value based on quantitative variables but fail to incorporate quantitative variables. The purpose of this paper is to provide a decision model that is capable of predicting the added value of smart systems in a building. It offers real estate managers a Preference Function Modelling (PFM) process, structure and model to approach a multi-criteria problem. <br/><br/>Design/methodology/approach – The PFM approach, an evaluation operational research methodology, is designed to help decision makers to choose the most preferred alternative from a set of already existing alternatives. A decision model is made in Excel that enables the construction of measurement scales to which linear algebra and calculus are applicable. A second research technique being used is the Lagrange curve. The model is tested on a single building in the portfolio of Schiphol Real Estate. Findings – The PFM model enables the decision-maker to establish a list of overall preferences scores of all relevant alternatives. The alternative with the highest overall preference score is predicted to add the most value to the building. The pilot study reveals that the procedure resulted in a result but a certain level of uncertainty exists. The cause of the uncertainty seems to be a lack of knowledge about the alternatives. Research limitations/implications – The Lagrange curve is a suitable technique for changing values of a variable. However, the curve tends to overshoot. Practical implications – The practical applicability depends on the selection of alternatives and knowledge available. If the alternatives are not known a priori, the PFM approach cannot be used and Preference Based Design (PBD) is more appropriate. If the knowledge available is low and difficult to improve the input is subject to uncertainty. The output may not project the actual situation. Originality/value – The research is based on the PAS approach from Arkesteijn et al. (2017). The PAS approach is a PBD methodology and is adapted to a PFM methodology in order to fit the intended purpose of the research. The PFM methodology takes both scaling and the Lagrange curve into account and along with an iterative procedure the decision-making process is well supported. The model provides a custom-made outcome, which is of high value for the decision-maker in the SHG case.","Smart building; Preference Function Modeling; Preference Measurement; IoT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

However, without a dedicated software layer to dictate the reconfigurations, the ρ-VEX has to depend on another processor to carry out its reconfigurations meaningfully. Otherwise, this task can be left to the applications themselves, which would increase their complexity. In order to make the ρ-VEX capable of behaving as a stand-alone processor, with complex real-world applications running on it benefiting from its dynamic properties, while remaining abstract from the hardware changes, such a dedicated piece of software is needed. An operating system can equip the ρ-VEX with such functionality, as well as with other desired features like memory management support. Running applications in virtual memory is an important step towards multitasking. Therefore, the envisioned goal of this project is to make the ρ-VEX processor a truly independent and dynamic environment, capable of extracting large amounts of thread-level as well as instruction-<br/>level parallelism from programs running on it.<br/>In this project, the Linux kernel 2.6.32 has been ported on simrvex: a cycle-accurate<br/>architectural simulator for the ρ-VEX processor.

Before transmission, the storage capacity strategy is dependent on portfolio contents and balancing market incentives.

Most of them have been constructed during the 20st century and were considered as unique projects. This led to a great variety in their designs and characteristics. Currently, 52 locks are reaching the end of their technical life span and require significant renovation and renewal. <br/><br/>Almost all locks are different and this variety complicates their management and maintenance. These complications cause several problems concerning sub-optimal availability, unpredictable reliability and high life cycle costs. Rijkswaterstaat performed several studies, indicating that the standardization of lock gates could potentially solve these problems. However, how to standardize these lock gates is still unclear. This research investigates the standardization possibilities with the aim of reducing the variety found in lock gates, focusing on the mitre gates present in 37 of the 52 locks requiring large renovation and renewal. Focus is put on mitre gates as these are the most common gate type used in Dutch navigation locks. <br/><br/>The approach of reducing the variety in the lock gates is based on the creation of clusters, in which one standardized gate is applied. The clustering of the mitre gates is based on the widths and required door heights of the considered locks. <br/><br/>To tackle the problem of standardizing gates in locks with different widths, it has been decided to vary their angle of closure. The degree to which the angle of closure can vary is dictated by physical boundaries, indicating the limit with respect to stability requirements.<br/><br/>Consequently it was chosen to modularize the doors so that they can be scaled up or down to the desired height, solving the problem of applying a standard door in locks with different retention heights.<br/><br/>To grasp the effects of standardization, the over-dimensioning is approximated by using estimates for the amount of material required for the gates. To determine the optimum cluster configurations, a clustering program has been developed, taking into account both over-dimensioning and physical boundaries. <br/><br/>The clustering program encompasses the study of 37 locks. This study shows that the gates of these locks can be grouped into a minimum of five clusters. Due to a modular gate design and fewer spare components, excessive over-dimensioning is prevented. A conceptual design and a comparative analysis indicated that the gates can best be grouped into eight clusters, potentially leading to improved management and a € 7.100.000 cost reduction. <br/><br/>This research included several assumptions and starting points. The following steps should be taken in order to deepen and enhance the current research:<br/><br/>• Assess the influence of the determining aspects on the costs of a lock gate instead of the material required. <br/>• Better approximation of over-dimensioning by using a more complex and accurate model for the estimation of the required material. <br/>• Perform a study on the amount of spare components required for each separate gate cluster.<br","Standardization; Mitre Gates; Clustering; Modularization; standard; Modular; Naviagtion lock; MWW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-19","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","Multi Water Works",""

Given that, most of the MSW incineration (MSWI) bottom ash (BA) are disposed in landfill currently, and technically and economically viable techniques for the reuse and recycling of MSWI BA is still at a premium. This issue would seriously challenge the environmental and public health management worldwide. <br/>In some European countries and the US, MSWI BA has been utilized as aggregate in pavement construction or as aggregate in concrete. Previous studies also proved the feasibility of using MSWI BA in concrete, either as aggregates or binder substitute materials. However, it is worth noticing that there are several significant drawbacks of using MSWI BA in concrete, including the potential risk of leaching due to the existence of heavy metals and harmful salts, the low reactivity due to high content of quartz and unburned organic matters, and the metallic aluminum-induced expansion. <br/>Therefore, in this study, a characterization of as-received MSWI BA was conducted at the beginning to find out the potential problems when used in concrete, namely the metallic aluminum content, low reactivity and unburned organics. A comprehensive pretreatment was performed subsequently to solve the problems. Specifically, both physical and chemical treatments were carried out to get rid of the metallic aluminum in BA. Afterwards, thermal treatment was conducted to enhance the reactivity of BA and remove the unburned organics. Pre-treated BA samples were characterized again to reveal the effectiveness of pretreatment. The results showed that both chemical and physical treatment were highly effective in removing metallic aluminum. Meanwhile, thermal treatment was proved to be a proper activation method which also removed the remaining organic matters through the high-temperature process.<br/>Subsequently, the investigations of the effects of pre-treated BA addition on compressive strength, reaction products and hydration heat development were conducted on cement paste level by varying the replacement material (BA with different treatment methods) and ratio. A proper method of pretreatment was proposed as well as an optimization of a maximum replacement level of BA in cement paste without detrimentally influence the performance of concrete paste was studied. Compared with nonreactive micronized sand (only works as filler) and pure cement, the addition of physically treated BA has a certain amount of contribution to the hydration process from the viewpoint of heat release. Results show that BA do have pozzolanic activity but is much lower than cement, and physically treated BA is suitable to be used as filler in concrete. Additionally, physically treated BA was further activated through thermal treatment according to the result of compressive strength test, which delivered the highest strength among all the treated BA under the same replacement ratio.<br/>Finally, to extend the application of MSWI BA in concrete, the mix design was made by blending treated BA with the highest compressive strength into concrete and make it suitable for structural application. The effects of treated BA addition on the workability and compressive strength of concrete were investigated. The addition of treated BA brought slight negative impact both in workability and strength due to the existence of nonreactive phases in BA (quartz and organics).<br/>Accordingly, this study proved the potential of BA with proper treatment to be used as a cement substitute material in concrete as well as promoted the understanding of the influence of BA on the hydration process, which also brings the possibility that BA could be widely reused in concrete system in future industry.<br","MSWI BA; Cement substitute material; Pretreatment; Characterization; Cement paste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

One of these impacts is the decrease in sediment inflow towards the coast which can lead to coastal erosion. <br/>A technique that can be applied to improve the situation downstream is modifying the discharge through the dam. Unfortunately, there have not been many studies done yet on such a re-operation regime. This thesis tried to get more understanding of the possible consequences of a modified discharge regime concerning restoration of pre-dam sediment regimes based on the Volta Delta in Ghana as a case study.<br/>In this thesis, the effect of modifying dam operations on both the upstream part of the river (the reservoir) and the downstream part have been investigated. For the upstream section, a simulation was made for a simplified model for a reservoir with similar characteristics as the Volta Lake. According to this model, the modified dam operations are not useful for reservoirs like the Volta Lake. The technique might be useful for shallower reservoirs. <br/>A modified dam operation scenario aims to reintroduce flood pulses to the river. For the downstream part of the river, three aspects of the operation scenarios have been investigated: the discharge peak height during an operation, the duration of such a peak and the extra sediment load that might be brought to the river from the reservoir. The response of the river downstream was measured by two aspects: the sediment load to the ocean and the bed level changes in the river. <br/>To show the response of the river, several simulations were made with different aspects of the operation scenario. At each simulation, only one parameter was changed, e.g., the peak discharge is changed from 1500 to 5000 m3/s in different simulations. By doing so, graphs could be made to show a correlation between the three operation aspects and the two aspects of the river's behavior. <br/>It turns out that by increasing the discharge, more sediment will be transported to the ocean (with a maximum of 16% of pre-dam sediment load). There will be more non-cohesive material carried to the sea than cohesive material. When there is no extra sediment coming to the river, the river bed will degrade. This will happen at equal rates all along the river which will not change the bed slope. <br/>By increasing the sediment load from upstream of the dam without introducing flood pulses, there will be more sediment transported to the ocean. However, most of the sediment will settle at the river bed causing accretion. The accretion of the river bed will not happen at equal rates along the river so the bed slope will change. <br/>Finally, the change in peak duration will affect neither the transport of sediment nor the river bed. The reason for this might be that the river bed adapts to the different flow conditions in such a way that the same amount of sediments is transported towards the coast.","Ghana; dam; sedimentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Due to rapid urbanization and insufficient water resource planning and waste water management, the Kathmandu Valley (Valley) is facing both a water quantity and quality crisis. Annually, groundwater extractions in the Valley significantly exceed recharge rates, resulting in a serious groundwater table declines. While streams often constitute an important linkage between surface water and groundwater systems, from both a quantity and quality perspective, understanding stream-aquifer interactions in the Valley are limited. To improve this understanding, we performed topographic surveys of water levels, and measured water quality, in streams and adjacent hand dug wells (shallow aquifer) in three watersheds (total of 16 stream-well pairs) during 2018 pre-monsoon (April and May) and eight watersheds (including the same three from pre-monsoon; total of 35 stream-well pairs) during 2018 post-monsoon (September and October). In pre-monsoon, we found 88 % of water levels in wells lower than adjacent streams with an average of -0.82 m, indicating a loss of stream water to the aquifer. However, in post-monsoon 69 % of wells had water levels higher than adjacent streams with an average water level difference of 0.44 m, indicating that monsoon rainfall recharged the shallow aquifer, causing streams to transition from losing to gaining. No recurring trend in water level difference was seen longitudinally from upstream to downstream. Our results indicate statistically significant correlations between electrical conductivity, ammonia, chloride, hardness, and alkalinity measured in streams and adjacent wells. Both stream and groundwater quality of adjacent wells depletes longitudinally from upstream to downstream. In order to prevent further deterioration of groundwater resources, stream-aquifer interactions should be taken into account for sustainable water resource management. Further research is essential to quantify the groundwater flow, and to investigate the long-term trends and reversibility of the problem. Our findings highlight the importance of managing streams and aquifers as a single integrated resource, from both a water quantity and quality perspective. For example, improper waste management in the Valley’s streams is having a clear and negative impact on the shallow aquifer. The population of Kathmandu will become increasingly dependent on the government for water supply, potentially increasing the cost of living.","Groundwater; stream; Aquifer; Interactions; Kathmandu Valley","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP275","27.664401, 85.318791"

The new scientific mission scheduled to launch in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provides an opportunity for observation of asteroids. In this thesis, the feasibility of using the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) imager on the JWST for serendipitous characterization of asteroids is evaluated. The imager and the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) run simultaneously. When MRS is running, imager data could be used for detection of asteroids in infrared, where the error in size is only 10%, comparing to 100% in optical, because the thermal radiation is independent of the albedo. Combining the optical and infrared, the albedo can be determined. This prospective use is researched by simulating the sensitivity of the imager. A tool, created during this thesis, simulates realistic cases using proposal (GTO 1282) and determines the known asteroids in the field of view (FOV) of the imager. MIRISim, created by the MIRI European Consortium, simulates their signatures. The results show a 4.1% chance of an asteroid appearing in the FOV and a 96.9% detection of such an asteroid. In a typical MIRI observation, exposure time of 488.4 s, with preferred filter F1280W, the imager can detect asteroids bigger than 250 m in diameter and closer than 3 AU. This could lead to a detection of 733 256 yet undetected asteroids and 183 314 currently known asteroids in the lifetime of JWST.","James Webb Space Telescope; MIRI; asteroid; albedo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-19","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Exploration","",""

To realize this ambitious goal the domestic environment will also have to stop using natural gas and start heating, cooking and using warm water sustainably. The distribution system operator Stedin has developed a method/tool that helps munic- ipalities in identifying a viable energy carrier as alternative to natural gas. Stad aan ’t Haringvliet is the first town that approached Stedin about the prospects of hydrogen as an alternative to natural gas. Stedin has made an initial review and concluded that hydrogen could be a promising alternative to natural gas in the case of Stad aan ’t Haringvliet.<br/>The objective of this research project is to improve the existing approach for identifying the ideal future energy carrier for different locations within Stedin’s operating area by making a technical assessment of all necessary activities and changes when switching from natural gas to 100% hydrogen in an existing distribu- tion network.<br/>All identified relevant aspects of hydrogen are taken into account in the case study of Stad aan ’t Har- ingvliet. The case study shows that the local gas network can be isolated from the larger gas network and function as a hydrogen network. Also, nearly no unfavorable materials (cast iron and asbestos cement) are present in the local network which underscores the suitability. If the town is isolated from the larger network it could be fed from north-west of the town by an alkaline electrolyser. However, a stand-alone system at this scale is not a cost effective scenario in the Netherlands. Therefore, an alternative system comparison was made to verify if hydrogen is indeed a viable option for Stad aan ’t Haringvliet. In the chosen system compar- ison a scenario was sketched in which ’gray’ hydrogen was received from a large industrial hydrogen network to the east of Goeree-Overflakkee. This scenario was compared to an all-electric scenario which utilized the current electricity mix which can also be considered ’gray’, due to that the majority of the generation is from fossil fuels.<br/>The system comparison shows that with cost-effective insulation, a hydrogen scenario can be nearly as expensive as an all-electric scenario in Stad aan ’t Haringvliet regarding annual costs. The average initial in- vestment for a home owner in an all-electric scenario is estimated to be e50,000 and the initial investment in the hydrogen scenario is e11,000 on average. The annual costs are e1,540 and e1,460 for hydrogen and all-electric respectively. The carbon footprint of both scenarios is nearly equal at 4000 kg/CO2/year. The costs for adapting the local electric and gas distribution network is also significantly less expensive for a hydrogen scenario compared to the all-electric scenario. This is due to the fact that the natural gas network would have to be removed and the electric network would have to be heavily reinforced in an all-electric scenario in con- trast to light reinforcements to the electric network in the hydrogen scenario to facilitate electric cooking.<br/>No ’show stoppers’ were identified in the general part nor in the case study part of this research. Several requirements and favorable characteristics were determined which could help identify other areas in which hydrogen could be a potential energy carrier. The first characteristic of a suitable area is predominantly hous- ing which is very costly to sufficiently insulate for all-electric heating. Large consumers of natural gas in the area are also not favorable due to the fact that they might not be able to switch to hydrogen yet. The following characteristics relate to the network. Areas at the periphery of the local gas network are favorable due to the fact that they can more likely be isolated without creating capacity issues for itself or other areas. Also, areas which have little to no cast iron or asbestos cement are favorable due to increased risk of fractures inherent to these materials. Finally, a credible source of hydrogen is identified as a requirement for a suitable area.","Hydrogen; Natural Gas; Distribution Network; Power to X","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-16","","","","","",""

Several studies have addressed climate impacts on transportation infrastructure however very few focus on ports and supply chain. Ports are considered critical infrastructure that serve as a catalyst for economic growth and development of a country. Their importance is not only on a national (or regional) level, but they act as gateways to trade and constitute essential nodes in the global supply chain. The topic of this thesis on \textit{Climate Change Impact Assessment on Ports} is very broad to tackle within only 9 weeks (the length of this research). Therefore, the focus has been set on seaports within the Netherlands and more specifically, the Port of Rotterdam as main example. This thesis aims to advance research on climate change impact assessment on ports and supply chains. To achieve the aforementioned, a few research questions have been defined to help steer the research into the right direction: (1) What is known about the main impacts of climate change on ports and supply chains? (2) Which assets are vulnerable to the main impacts determined in sub-research question 1? (3) What are the state of the art strategies to perform a climate change impact assessment? And what are the available resources (frameworks, methods, software)? (4) Which knowledge gaps have been identified while answering sub-research questions 1,2 and 3? (5) How can one address the gaps identified in sub-research question 4? The methodology of this thesis has two main parts: The literature study and the expert interviews. The interviews were a very important part of this research. That is because this thesis aims to present the needs from the users perspective, to motivate researchers to continue with the exploration of this topic. Formulating the right questions to ask the experts and identifying which of the 12 experts could provide the best answer to understand the needs from different port users perspective, was the most challenging part of this thesis. The results of this thesis are research topics on the broad subject of climate change impact assessment on ports an supply chains. Due to time constrains, only 3 research topics are presented in more detail with the corresponding suggested approach. These three topics have been prioritized among the rest based on expert's opinions on what climate change issues are the most urgent (for further details see 2.4.2 \&amp; 4.1-4.3). These topics are: (1) Developing an Integrated Stochastic Model to Test Climate Change Resilience on Ports, (2) Investigating Methods to Identify \&amp; Quantify Supply Chain Disruptions due to Climate Change Cascade effects and (3) Developing a Method to Promote Awareness for Climate Change Resilient Ports. Nevertheless, chapter 6 presents a list of other potential research topics that can also be of interest to researchers. The recommendations for further research on the topic of climate change impact assessment on ports and supply chains are to follow the suggested research topics descriptions in chapter 6. Furthermore, to explore probabilistic models to tackle uncertainty issues and to understand the multivariate dependencies within ports and supply chains. Finally but most importantly, this research should be extended internationally, not only focusing on Dutch experts, to have a global perspective on the problems and the identified knowledge gaps posed on this thesis. Other recommendations can be found in chapter 7.","climate change adapation; Climate change impact assessment on ports; climate change resilience; supply chain disruptions","en","student report","","","","","","Additional thesis","","","","","","","",""

It uses its u-shaped bow to sail around an offshore platform and lift topsides up to 48.000t in a single lift. Despite being the largest vessel in the world, platforms exist that are simply too heavy, or too large to fit in between the bows of the vessel. Besides, smaller platforms also offer challenges as the capacity of the lifting beams decreases when the beams are extended towards the platform. This results in a set of platforms that cannot be lifted by the vessel.<br/>To be able to lift this set of platforms, a novel lifting method is proposed based on the twin-barge float-over method, where two separate vessels lift a topsides in a tandem lift. The method offers a solution to the described challenges as the vessels can be moved closer to the platform, resulting in an optimal utilisation of the lifting beam capacity. To improve the hydrodynamic behaviour of the concept, mechanical connections between the barges are incorporated. Allseas is interested in the technical feasibility of this concept in the North Sea. As an effect, the goal of the thesis is to evaluate and improve the hydrodynamic behaviour of mechanically coupled barges. The aim is to assess the motions of the concept using a dynamical model, improve the concept by changing the dimensions and investigate the workability of the concept in the North Sea. <br/>Throughout the decommissioning operation three limits are considered: the impact velocity between the lifting beam and the topsides, the relative pitch between the vessels (leading to stresses in the topsides), and the axial forces in the connection beams. The modelling of the concept is split up in two parts: the determination of the hydrodynamic properties of the vessels, and the influence of the connection beam forces. The potential solver ANSYS Aqwa is used to assess the hydrodynamic parameters, after which a Matlab model is created to include the connections in the model. Since preliminary results showed a standing wave effect between the two vessels for certain frequencies, an additional roll damping of 10\% of the critical damping was added and an external damping lid was included. <br/>A sensitivity study is performed to investigate the influence of reconfiguring the dimensions and the gap between the barges on the motions. For a certain width over gap ratio, motions tend to resonate for an incoming JONSWAP wave with a peak period of Tp = 7s. When the peak period is increased to 9s this effect becomes invisible and the hydrodynamic behaviour improves with increase of the dimensions. Therefore these are increased (L=275, B=70, T=25m and gap=50m) to assess the workability of the concept in the North Sea. The linear Matlab model is translated from frequency- to time-domain to make a probability distribution of the critical limits. The critical incoming wave angle is 120°, where a significant wave height of 1.3m with a peak period of Tp = 9s results in an infeasible design due to excessive relative pitch. For other incoming wave angles the workability improves, with the most favourable incoming wave angle being 180°. For the Brent field location in the North Sea, the summer period workability varies between 61% and 88% depending on the incoming wave angle and the orientation of the platform. This is sufficient enough to speak of a technically feasible concept.<br/> <br/><br","Hydrodynamics; Offshore decommissioning; Damping lid; Hydrodynamic interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-19","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Earthquakes, for example, are responsible for taking around 50.000 lives on a yearly base due to falling debris and collapsing buildings, making them one of the most deadly natural disasters known to mankind. These casualties are caused by both direct effects (falling debris) as well as indirect effects (being trapped by debris without access to air/water/food). In the first hours after an earthquake hit an area, a clear overview of the situation is hard to obtain due to inaccessible roads and damaged communication systems, which in its turn hampers setting up rapid disaster response operations. In order to assist the search and rescue teams in wide-area situation awareness, remote sensing techniques can be used to acquire and create damage detection maps which could be used to prioritize their tasks and help save more lives. <br/><br/>Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one of the most promising techniques in rapid disaster response as it is an active sensor which remains unaffected by the weather, smoke, cloud cover and/or daylight. The Sentinel-1 mission is a relatively new SAR mission that acquires data over the entire Earth's surface every 3 days in any viewing geometry. More importantly, this mission has an open-data policy and hence provides the opportunity to easily perform multi-temporal data analysis instead of the bi- and tri-temporal change detection approaches proposed in previous studies. The development of a fully automatic change detection algorithm has been done in the Google Earth Engine: an online, open-source processing tool that allows users to run algorithms on geo-referenced Earth observation imagery stored on Google's infrastructure, with one of these datasets being the global Sentinel-1 GRD dataset. The time reduction that results from bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa as well as the possibility to easily combine various geo-referenced datasets both benefited the rapid disaster response operations. <br/><br/>The processing of the data is performed completely automatically based on the date and location of the disaster as input, making it easy to use for non-remote sensing specialists. Using these two parameters, the Sentinel-1 images overlapping the area of interest are selected after which a change detection algorithm is applied to the timeseries. The resulting damage detection maps has been validated in terms of operability and accuracy for wide-area situation awareness in search and rescue operations for three case studies: the 2016 M6.2 Central Italy earthquake, the 2017 M7.1 Central Mexico earthquake and the 2018 Syria military strikes. Overall, the algorithm performs well in terms of damage detection, with a low amount of false positives and an even lower amount of false negatives, for both damage due to natural hazards and intentional or collateral damage during warfare. The algorithm experienced difficulties when identifying individual collapsed buildings in a dense urban environment as around 50\% of the collapsed buildings were detected as such. However, the accuracy of the damage detection is much better when looking at clusters of damaged buildings in urban areas or at individual buildings, which are equal to or larger than the size of a SAR resolution cell, in less dense urban environments. <br/><br/>The complete approach and final damage detection maps have been presented to the Urban Search And Rescue team of The Netherlands, whom are the potential end-users of these maps. They saw great potential in this approach in general to help prioritize their search and rescue operations, with the only bottleneck being the data latency. We showed that once a new image has been acquired after the disaster, the total data latency by ESA and the GEE is at most 72h. This is also the maximal time the USAR team has in order to move from their home base to any country in the world in case of a disaster. The data latency time frame is a maximum, so actual averages are lower and the final damage detection map will be completed and ready to use once needed by the USAR team. This illustrates that the approach proposed in this research can be used on an operational base to assist in rapid disaster response situations.","SAR; Rapid Disaster Response; Building Damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-16","","","","","",""

One of these reservoir zones is the formation Åre 6.2, which is mainly composed of tide-dominated heterolithic channel belt deposits. It contains particular layers that have excellent properties with permeabilities up to 10 Darcy. These layers are predicted to affect the production results as they can act as ‘thief zones’ within the low permeable heterolithic facies causing large quantities of water to flow through, leading to poor sweep efficiency and early water breakthrough. This study focuses on constructing conceptual depositional models of the Åre 6.2 and building detailed geological models to investigate the effect of the thief zones on overall fluid flow predictions.<br/><br/>Conceptual depositional models were constructed by determining the characteristics of the reservoir and its depositional environment. Seven cored wells were used as the primary data to interpret lithofacies and facies associations. The study showed that Åre 6.2 mainly consisted of structured sandstones and heterolithic lithofacies with features that indicate that tidal process play an important role in the deposition. The influence of tidal process on deposition is further exemplified by the identification of two different types of channel facies associations, which are tidal and distributary channels. The thief zones were found in both facies associations, suggesting that the thief zones were formed during high freshwater discharge into the channels supplying coarse sandy material influx during a phase of high-energy deposition. To make detailed models of the tidal and distributary channels, multiscale modeling techniques were utilized to better represent the reservoir heterogeneities at the lithofacies and facies association scales.<br/><br/>At the lithofacies scale, models were built in SBEDTM and the upscaled values of each lithofacies were obtained by applying the Representative Element Volume (REV) concept. The upscaled values were then used as input in the facies association scale models in order to represent the heterogeneities at the lithofacies scale to the next heterogeneity level. This step is essential since heterogeneities at a smaller scale may affect reservoir flow properties. Two different channel models were built in ReservoirStudioTM based on the conceptual depositional model and using outcrop analogue data from the Gule Horn Formation (Neill Klinter Group) in the Albuen area (Greenland). Flow-based upscaling was used to analyze the model uncertainties and determine a proper upscaling grid size. Finally, streamline simulations were performed to identify the effect of the thief zones. The simulation confirms that the thief zones influence fluid flow in the reservoir zone significantly as most flow was concentrated in the thief zones.<br","Reservoir Characterization; Reservoir Modeling; Flow Simulation; estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-31","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

The first phase of design is an excellent time to steer the design to be more sustainable. However, today's procedures, involving LCA, only provides feedback at a later phase.

It provides LCA feedback in the conceptual design phase. A proof-of-concept is developed on industrial warehouses showcasing the functionality of the framework. Lacking the required building data and LCA scoring, a fully automated script is created with the parametric plugin Grasshopper, to generate the warehouse data. Due to time constrains and performance limitations, the scope was limited to the structural system of beams, columns, purlins and braces. The script randomly iterates over its parameter domain, automatically changing the geometry, performing a structural optimisation and calculating the LCA. This assessment is limited to a cradle-to-gate system boundary. Data is automatically written to a web-hosted database on the Packhunt.io platform of White Lioness technologies.

However, the BIPV market is still a niche market, representing only 1% of the global PV share. One of the main barriers that hinder the deployment of BIPV is the lack of aesthetic flexibility. Architects and designers are often reluctant to embed PV systems in buildings due to their unsuitable color.<br/>In this thesis, the use of interference filters (IFs) as color coating solution for PV modules is proposed. IFs are optical devices designed to selectively reflect a narrow portion of the visible solar spectrum while transmitting the remaining part. The structural coloration provided by the filter is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the light. This angular dependence could be an issue for BIPV applications, since color homogeneity is often an important requirement. The objective of this work is to model, fabricate and assess the opto-electrical performance of colored crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules based on interference filters, with the final goal of increasing the aesthetics of this technology.<br/>First, the angular resilience challenge is addressed. Simulation results show that texturing the glass surface significantly improves the color stability, thanks to diffuse reflection of light. Very high angular resilience up to 80º can be achieved with a double-side texture profile made of hemispherical grooves. Secondly, five interference filters deposited on different glass substrates are used to fabricate 10 x 10 cm² c-Si colored mini-modules. The optical characterization of the demonstrators<br/>allows to partially validate the optical model and confirm the good angular resilience of the textured surfaces. Finally, the electrical performance of the mini-modules is evaluated. I-V measurements show that IFs only affect the short-circuit current of the mini-modules due to optical losses.

During the literature study, numerous articles were identified that claimed an increase of structural efficiency by using 3DPC to reduce material use. Some of these articles suggest that an increase in structural efficiency results in a reduction of environmental impact. However, these articles do not support this potential with a research study.<br/><br/>This research project therefore studies the relation between structural efficiency and the environmental impact of a 3DPC bridge. This relation is studied by developing a design model that calculates structural efficiency and determines the environmental impact. The design model is developed in a visual script environment for parametrically controlling visual design software. The parametric script specifies and combines information in an XML file used for structural analysis in finite element software. This analysis is executed on command in the parametric environment and the results are used for verifying the structural safety. The structural safety is expressed in a material utilisation ratio. This ratio indicates the used proportion of strength of the material and can be used as an indicator for structural efficiency. After calculating the structural efficiency, the design model is used to determine the environmental impact of the structure expressed in shadow costs. Shadow costs quantify the environmental impact of materials and processes related to geometric quantities defined in the design model.<br/><br/>Multiple combinations of parameters have been compared to determine the relation between structural efficiency and environmental impact. The results of the comparison show that an increase in structural efficiency results in decreased material use. A decrease in material use reduces the environmental impact because ±59% of the impact is related to 3DPC material. The environmental impact of the 3DPC bridge is then compared to a hollow-core-slab element with a similar functionality to verify the claimed potential. This comparison shows that the environmental impact of 3DPC is almost two times higher than the compared conventional method.<br/><br/>Therefore, using a novel design model and based on the results, following two conclusions can be drawn:<br/>1. Increasing structural efficiency can decrease the environmental impact of a 3DPC bridge, and<br/>2. Considering the state of 3D printing concrete technology at present, applications of this technology for bridges can result in a higher environmental impact than the compared conventional method.","Parametric design; Structural Design; Environmental Impact Assessment; Parametric design tool; Finite Element Analysis; SCIA Engineer; Grasshopper; 3D Printed Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Halswijk, Wouter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Current Ballistic Missile (BM) defence systems intercept an incoming threat in its terminal phase, and to some extend during its coast phase. During the boost phase of a BM, the initial velocity of the BM is low and the hot exhaust plume is easy to spot for infrared sensors, which provides a good opportunity for interception. To do so, the Network Centric Airborne Defense Element (NCADE) is a missile in development, which is to be launched from a 5$^{\text{th}}$ generation fighter aircraft. A tracking algorithm model has already been developed at TNO, which performs the tracking and trajectory prediction of the BM, based on the location measurements performed by the IR sensors of both the aircraft and the missile. Tracking a BM and predicting its trajectory poses a challenge, as the mass, thrust and acceleration cannot be measured directly, resulting in an uncertainty in the trajectory prediction. The NCADE therefore must be able to intercept the BM in its boost phase, considering the uncertainties in the trajectory prediction. The main research goal of this thesis is to develop a guidance algorithm for the NCADE, which plans a trajectory of an air launched missile, intercepting a BM in its boost phase. To do so, the NCADE has been modelled, and the tracking algorithm has been implemented. The actual guidance is performed using trajectory optimisation. <br/>The NCADE is designed to disable its target by means of kinetic penetration, meaning that there is no explosive warhead present. The missile is derived from the AIM120D AMRAAM, with a similar outer shape and suspension points. The NCADE consists of two stages, where the first stage is equipped with a solid booster for a fast acceleration. Control deflections are provided with aerodynamic surfaces. The second stage, also called Kill Vehicle (KV), is equipped with an IR sensor to determine the location of the target. Some sensor inaccuracy is present due to the amount of pixels used in the sensor. Control inputs on the second stage are performed using monopropellant pulses. Both control inputs and thrust of the KV use monopropellant from the same source, meaning that when the monopropellant tank is depleted, both control deflections and thrust cannot be delivered. To calculate different trajectories of the NCADE, the equations of motion are set up, where the NCADE is modelled as a 3 degrees of freedom point mass. Aerodynamic coefficients are obtained using software applying empirical methods, for which an extended database of projectiles is available. Verification of the equations is performed using a validated generic missile model, made by TNO using Simulink. <br/><br/>The calculation of the guidance relies on a location of the target in the future. Therefore, a trajectory prediction must be performed, for which the states of the BM must be determined. There are however only position measurements of the BM available, from which a more extended set of states of the BM must be derived. This is performed using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which was developed during an earlier study. The filter initiates with a guess of the states of the BM, and continuously updates those as new readings of the BM become available. Using the Kalman states, a trajectory prediction is performed. The Kalman states require a certain tracking period to converge to the correct values, to be able to calculate usable trajectory predictions. The quality of the tracking prediction is quantified by a score, which is forwarded to the guidance algorithm to be able to take the significant uncertainties in the trajectory prediction into account. The certainty score improves when the tracking duration increases and when the trajectory prediction is nearby in the future. The certainty results are forwarded to the guidance algorithm by means of coefficients of a polynomial.<br/>Due to the complexity of the control system of the NCADE and the uncertain target trajectory, trajectory optimisation is applied in the guidance algorithm. Trajectory optimisation aims to decrease the defined performance index, which is in this case the divert cone minus the uncertainty ellipse of the trajectory prediction, to maximise the probability for interception. The divert cone of the NCADE is a volume which the missile is able to reach on a certain time, given its states and reserve fuel. The divert cone is calculated using a separate shooting optimisation algorithm, which maximises the distance in three ENU frame directions. To maximise the probability of interception, a shooting method is applied, which uses candidate solutions in the form of functions describing the control input, to calculate the performance index. Using constraints, the missile is directed towards an interception point. Constraints are also applied to bound the magnitude of the controls, and at the trajectory itself to remain physical feasible.<br/>To investigate the behaviour of the guidance algorithm, simulations of interceptions of the NCADE have been performed on a modelled Scud BM, using a range of launch locations and tracking settings. The optimum results are presented in control deflection functions of the NCADE, which achieve the flight with the minimised performance index. When only the tracking uncertainty is minimised, flight time is minimised, as the prediction becomes less reliable when a longer trajectory prediction is performed. When only the size of the divert cone is to be maximised, the propellant of the sustainer, used for control and propulsion, is saved to increase the divert cone. Because of this, the altitude of the flight is increased, and $t_{f}$ must become larger, because less monopropellant is applied to increase the velocity at the beginning of the sustain phase. The optimum solution is a compromise between the divert cone size and time to flight. As the duration of the tracking time increases, the target trajectory prediction becomes more reliable, so the maximisation of the divert cone becomes more prominent. However, this results in the maximum range to decrease, since there is less time for interception, and the altitude of the target has increased. When the launch location is positioned further from the target, the reduction of time to flight becomes more prominent and the divert cone decreases. In conclusion, the optimisation routine performs the compromise between the amount of reserve propellant available, and the uncertainty of the trajectory prediction. ","Guidance; Optimisation; Weapons; Missile; NCADE; Flight; Ballistic; Booster; AMRAAM; stage; Kalman Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Starting from how we shaped our interdisciplinary approach, we explain our approach towards the project and our decision to include resiliency with the Sponge City concept as an objective. We continue by providing background information on ErQi area in Chapter 3 to get an overall understanding of the planned urban design and potential urban flooding. To provide a thorough analysis and recommendations for the selection process of adaptation measures to mitigate excess rainfall as part of the SCP in the context of ErQi area, an assessment of the Wuhan Sponge City criteria, a stakeholder analysis complemented by a spatial assessment was performed and described in Chapter 4. Setting the context allows understanding the complexity of the system and its constraints in the implementation of the SCP. Thus, we decided to first focus on the implementation of low-impact development (LID) measures using a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) presented in Chapter 4 and then developed an integrated and resilient system design later in the report. As the Sponge City is not sufficient to cope with high precipitation events (Arcadis, 2017), the project combines sponge city and resiliency principles in an integrated system approach.<br/>The guiding resilient design principles of the Sponge City are further described and explained in Chapter 5 and applied in the opportunistic design process in Chapter 6, bridging the research with the designs. Here the designs of the MengQiao Bridge and the Water Road are presented along with their proposed effects on the urban flooding. Chapter 7 serves to assess the designs through the criteria of the integrated sponge city to improve flood resilience. The following chapter serves to share our conclusions on the challenges for implementing a functioning of the SCP that includes the concept of resilience. It also touches upon the difficulty of implementing the value-based design in a profit-based context. The final chapter is composed of five parts, all of which is our recommendations. It starts with our recommendations to improve the Sponge City criteria to make them more effective in reaching the goals of the programme. Then we give our recommendations for the selection process of LID followed by what we have learned of this interdisciplinary approach. That includes what we consider to be crucial to achieving a genuinely interdisciplinary process resulting in an integrated design. The final part of the chapter is dedicated to what we believe should be researched further. We believe a more in-depth assessment of the designs with the Sponge City criteria and input of the stakeholders is required for a final design. Further, the working definitions and approach of the Wuhan city government need to be considered, and an approach that assesses the necessary maintenance protocols is necessary.<br","Sponge City; China; urban water management; integrated approach; resilience","en","student report","","","","","","Multidisciplinary project report","","","","","","Water Management","MP260","30.59280, 114.30550"

To fulfill the internet users’ demand of Quality of Experience (QoE), the way we deal with “the tsunami of data” becomes a big problem. How to transfer data, especially those very big files, as fast as possible can be a very important part of that problem. One promising solution could be using multiple paths instead of a single path transmission. Different conditions on different paths make it difficult to handle multipath transmission well. However, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), a centralized network model, provides new solutions to make multipath transmission possible. In a SDN network, the network status can be monitored. With such monitoring information, an optimal multipath solution can be found to transfer a file as fast as possible. <br/>In this thesis, the optimal multipath transmission problem is studied. The objective is to minimize file transfer time between two end systems in a given SDN network. First, we model this as a linear programming problem on a time-expanded network. The time-expanded network used makes that the complexity of this solution is pseudo-polynomial.

The spent regenerant from ion exchange (IEX) processes is an example of such streams. This study investigated the use of Nano-filtration technique for separation as a part of the treatment step for IEX spent regenerant. This research is focused on the parameters such as membrane characteristics, ionic composition and operating conditions that affect the ion rejection of the IEX spent regenerant. This research aims to select a membrane that contributes to a maximum separation of monovalent and divalent ions of the IEX spent regenerant.<br/>During this research six nanofiltration membranes and two reverse osmosis membranes were tested, of which the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) was measured. Each membrane was placed at a flow Cell unit and fed with artificial water. <br/>The MWCO of the nanofiltration membranes was varied from 115 to 508 Da. The purpose of testing different membranes was to assess how the pore size of the membrane influences the ion rejection of the IEX spent regenerant. In addition, the ion rejection was evaluated in different ionic strengths and different molar ratios. The aim was to investigate how the ionic composition influences the ion rejection. Finally, operating parameters such as permeate flux and temperature were tested to research their impact on the ion rejection of the IEX spent regenerant. <br/>Results showed that the ion rejection of the IEX spent regenerant was strongly affected by the pore size of the membrane as the charge effect was insignificant due to the high ionic strength of the feed solution (1 M). The main exclusion mechanisms were the steric and the dielectric exclusion. Loose membranes with MWCO greater than 500 Da rejected less than 10% of both monovalent and divalent ions. Membranes with pore size from 200 Da to 300 Da rejected 30-60% of Ca2+ and contributed to negative rejections of Na+. NF membranes with MWCO of approximately 150 Da, rejected 90% of Ca2+ and 40% of Na+. Tighter NF membrane and RO membranes rejected more than 95% of divalent ions and more than 70% of monovalent ions. <br/>It was also observed that the ionic composition did not influence the rejection of divalent cations as it remained almost constant in different ionic strengths and molar ratio of the solution. Contrary, the rejection of monovalent cations was greatly influenced by the molar ratio of the solution due to the presence of predominant amounts of ion of higher charge and the need of the ions to maintain electroneutrality. Higher molar ratio resulted in lower rejection of monovalent cations. <br/>The permeate flux affected the ion rejections. Higher fluxes resulted in higher ion rejection and different ion separation.

These events lead to the interaction of air and water where air can be entrained in water. The resulting air bubbles can considerably affect the evolution of the pressure caused by hydrodynamic impact loading. Besides a {cushioning effect on the impact pressure and a possible increase of the compressibility of the mixture higher than air, earlier documentation conclude that due to aeration the acting forces can increase due to long lasting time of the pressure and the resonance between oscillating air pockets &amp; generated pressure waves.Nowadays, methods used to predict these forces, assume that the fluid is incompressible. This can lead to an {underestimation of the forces. The aim of the graduation project is to evaluate the effect of a homogeneous mixture of water and air on the wave impact, specifically for a green water event. Based on the documentation of the numerical method ComFLOW, for the evaluation an improved extended numerical solver in Fortran and MATLAB is built.ComFLOW is described as a robust finite volume method which can model these impact loadings by solving the governing laws -continuity equation and conservation of momentum- for a two-phase seperated-flow using the first-order fractional step method and the second-order Adams-Bashforth timestepping scheme. Even with a coarse grid, a clear distinction between water and air can be maintained by combining the Volume-of-Fluid approach with the local height function and a constant line reconstructed free surface (SLIC-iVOF). However, the method is not capable to model the compressibility for a dispersed flow by assuming that inertial forces on the aeration are dominant: a homogeneous mixture of air and water.In this report an extension is developed based on two volume fractions: the entrained air and air above the free surface, and Kapila's five-equation model. Considering the implementation and improvement of ComFLOW itself, the representation of capillary forces is improved by a new developed Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model for SLIC. Further, taking into account the transpose of the velocity gradient in the diffusive term, not done by ComFLOW, lead to no significant underestimation of the viscosity around the free surface for Re=O(35) and an error reduction of 2.7% for the 2D rising bubble. Besides the neglected term in the diffusive term, for the interpolation of the density around steep interfaces for SLIC, like wave impacts, the cell-weighted averaging method leads to less spurious velocities around the surface than the gravity-consistent averaging method used by ComFLOW. The last revised implementation is a {modified local height function, documented by ComFLOW as strictly mass conserving, which is made more strictly mass conserving due not overlapping of the heights.The modelling of compression waves and bubble interaction is verified with the 1D shock tube and 2D helium shock bubble. For a simplified green water event, the results of the dam break tested for aeration levels 0.1, 1 and 5% showed that the effect of the aeration after the impact is most relevant and can achieve impact forces more than two times higher than the initial impact due to the combination of a plunging wave, mixing of water and air, air pocket oscillation and the longitudinal acoustic mode. The effect of aeration becomes significant for Ma=O(0.10). These observations are based on the dam break results with obstacle.","CFD; Volume of fluid; wave impacts; aeration; Compressible Flow; green water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-02","","","","Marine Technology","",""

It is such a habitual phenomenon that we have been viewing it as another ordinary task in our day-to-day life. However, owing to the current fast-paced, technology-driven generation, we are letting ourselves be sleep-deprived, giving way to serious health concerns such as depression, insomnia, restlessness, apnea and Alzheimer’s. Polysomnography (PSG) studies are used for diagnosing and treating sleep-related disorders. Although the PSG studies are considered as the gold standard, they are obtrusive and do not allow for long-term monitoring. Various wearables have been manufactured to help people monitor their sleep-health. However, these devices have been shown to be inaccurate.<br/><br/>The ubiquitous sensor technology employed by the wearables provides large volumes of data, recorded in the most natural setting of the user. There is an opportunity to make use of the highly available sensor data to model a sleep scoring system that could help individuals monitor their sleep-health from the comfort of their home. In this thesis, we aim to alleviate this problem by attempting to bridge the gap between the highly accurate but obtrusive medical diagnosis (PSG) and the non-intrusive yet inaccurate wearables.<br/><br/>In this work, we propose DeepSleep, a deep neural net-based sleep classification model using an unobtrusive BCG-based heart sensor signal. Our proposed model’s architecture uses the combination of CNN and LSTM layers to perform self-feature extraction and sequential learning respectively. We show that our model can classify sleep stages with a mean f1-score of 74% using the BCG signal. We employ a 2-phase training strategy to build a pre-trained model to tackle the limited dataset size and test the transferability of the model on other types of heart-signal. With an average classification accuracy of 82% and 63% using ECG and PPG based heart signal respectively, we show that our pre-trained model can be used in the transfer learning setting as well. Lastly, with the help of a user study of 16 subjects, we show that the objective sleep quality metrics correlate with the perceived sleep quality reported by the subjects with a correlation score of 푟 = 0.43.<br/><br/>Although our proposed model’s performance is not yet comparable to the medical standards, we show that it is possible to monitor our sleep-health using the wearable signals with the least domain knowledge and preprocessing techniques. The prediction and performance of our DeepSleep model show that it is able to learn the biological rules of sleep wherein it always follows a Deep or REM stage with a transitional Light stage. Our model treats the classification problem sequentially, thus, identifying important sleep parameters like the onset of sleep cycles and time spent in different sleep stages which are time-dependent factors. Furthermore, our user study, conducted using the SATED questionnaire, provides an insight into the difference in the user’s perceived sleep quality and model’s estimation. It shows that an automated classification system needs to incorporate various external factors such as environmental and ambient conditions to be able to strongly correlate with the perceived or subjective quality. We further discuss the future research gaps and opportunities that could improve the model’s performance and also extend it to other domains like irregular heart-beat and apnea detection. We consider this work to be a starting point for research into sleep and heart health using non-intrusive wearable sensors and deep neural network-based architectures.","Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Sleep-state classification; Sleep System; Ubiquitous; Wearable Technology; long short-term memory networks; Convolutional Neural Networks; Transfer learning; User preferences; Human health; Sleep deprivation; Sensor data; Recurrent Neural Network; Sleep quality measurement; User perception study; subjective assessment; Artificial Intelligence; Explainable Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Unfortunately, as we venture into the realm of adaptive control, commonly used robustness metrics, such as the phase margin, are lost. This fact, in addition with the lack of a well-established framework for control design, validation and verification raises an issue known as the certification problem of adaptive control. Oftentimes, theory can only take us as far as guaranteeing stability under limited conditions. The next step would be to develop quantifiable margins, or metrics, which can be translated into certifiable terms.<br/>A 2010 NASA study titled “Elastically Shaped Future Air Vehicle Concept” [1] pushes the aerospace industry towards fuel efficiency and the integration of lighter composite materials for new generations of aircraft. In turn this leads to flexible designs that show higher wing tip deflections and oscillations. A novelty control surface architecture – the Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) – is being developed to assist in active flutter suppression and enable wing shaping control in order to improve cruise flight efficiency.<br/>The work developed in this thesis and during an internship working with the Adaptive Control and Evolvable Systems (ACES) team at NASA Intelligent Systems Division revisits the certification problem of adaptive control in the aerospace industry within the context of the VCCTEF project. In particular, we focus the time delay margin as an inherently critical stability metric for flight adaptive control and integrate time domain estimation methods with simulation driven certificates into an hybrid framework to create a linear moving time window model – the Bounded Linear Asymptotic Stability (BLAS) model for Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) flight software used by the ACES team, including the Optimal Control Modification (OCM) introduced to guarantee transient response characteristics.

In that respect, European countries are investing in cleaner sources of energy and predominantly offshore wind, which has seen a rapid growth over the last years. The North Sea is a region suitable for developing offshore wind energy, given its strong wind climate and the relatively shallow waters. Many large-scale offshore wind farm (OWF) developments are currently ongoing in that region, while many more are planned and consented for the coming decades. The concept of large-scale OWF developments has spurred many discussions addressing its potential effect on the greater North Sea region. However, the long-term effect on the surrounding coastal areas has never been studied in detail. Especially for a low-lying country as the Netherlands, assessing the impact of large-scale OWFs is of great importance. This study aims at exploring the effect of future large-scale OWFs in the North Sea, focusing on the wave climate and the coastline response of the Dutch coast. Based on the roadmap for developing offshore wind energy until 2050, existing and future designated OWF areas are accounted in the North Sea region. The effect of OWFs on wind is introduced in a schematized way, with a constant decrease in wind speed of 20% inside the OWF areas, based on literature knowledge. Supplementary, based on the vision of creating an artificial energy island for storing and redistributing the wind farm generated electricity, a 5 km<sup>2</sup> island is introduced, approximately 30 km away from the Dutch coast. The effect on the nearshore wave climate is studied using the numerical model SWAN, while the resulting effect on the alongshore morphology is assessed using coastline model Unibest-CL+. The impact of future OWFs on the nearshore wave climate is found to be dependent on the size, shape, orientation and distance from the coast of the individual wind farms. Results show a mean decrease in significant wave height in the order of 1 – 2%. In addition, slight changes in wave direction are observed. The effect on wave climate reduces the alongshore sediment transport at the Dutch coast, by an order of 10% with respect to present values. This results in net-induced erosion, which requires nourishment. The study shows that the areas north of Zandvoort and Petten need the greatest nourishment volumes, in the range of 1.5 – 2.5 m<sup>3</sup>/m/year. This is an additional 1% on the current annual nourishment volumes supplied along the Dutch coast. The underlying study has proved to be effective in quantifying the chain of effects of OWFs and identifying potential hot-spots along the Dutch coast. The knowledge acquired from these effects can be used to optimize future OWF planning in relation to coastline maintenance policies.","large-scale offshore wind farms; North Sea; Dutch coast; energy island; coastal engineering; long-term morphodynamics; wave modeling; coastline modeling; coastal management; SWAN; Unibest-CL+","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Different kinds of tissues can be recognised from the different levels of contrast. Multi-echo spin-echo T 2 MR measurements can be used to obtain a quantitative map of the brain where different tissues or components can be recognised based on a certain tissue property, the T 2 relaxation time this case. This quantitative approach is also called parameter mapping. Multi-component parameter mapping makes it possible to determine the concentrations of different tissues inside a certain region, this is mainly used for the determination of the myelin water fraction. Myelin is a substance present in low concentrations in the brain and can be related to certain neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) provides a new way to such qualitative measurements. An advantage is that MRF is sensitive to both T1 and T2 relaxation times, making it possible to distinguish more types of tissues. The drawback is, however, that more combinations of the parameters are possible, leading to a more difficult problem with longer computation times. In this project a new method to perform a multi-component analysis in MRF and multi-echo spin-echo T2 measurements is developed, which is faster and less sensitive to noise than previous methods. The algorithm that is developed in this project, is called Sparsity Promoting Iterative Joint Non-negative least squares (SPIJN). It finds a small number of<br/>components throughout the region of interest without assumptions about the number of components or their relaxation times by imposing a joint sparsity constraint. This new method is compared to previously published methods in both numerical simulations and in vivo experiments. The multi-component decomposition for brain data results in meaningful structures on first sight, although further research would be required on the meaning of the matched components. Moreover, the algorithm has been used for the calculation of the myelin water fraction from multi-echo spin-echo T2 data. The obtained maps are comparable to state-of-the-art methods, show improvements in some cases and have significantly shorter computation times.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Fingeprinting; NNLS; T2NNLS; Quantitative imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-01","","","","Applied Mathematics | COSSE (Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering)","Computer Simulation for Science and Engineering",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This research describes a new method called SWDD (Klopman, Witteveen+Bos, 2018b), which can obtain information on wave propagation directions from the surface elevations at a set of positions. The primary intention of the method is to separate multiple incoming wave components, i.e. wave heights, phases and directions. The goal is to obtain the incoming wave conditions, that can among others be used in the design of (coastal) structures and assessment of moored ship response.<br/><br/>The novelty of this method is that a large number of incoming wave directions is prescribed, equally distributed around a circle. For each of these many incoming wave conditions, the wave amplitude and phase are the unknowns (while the directions are known). The main advantage is that this makes the problem linear and in that aspect easier to solve. The disadvantage is that, most often, the resulting system becomes ill-posed (having more unknowns than equations). This problem is solved by using Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977) together with the L-curve method (Hansen, 1992; 2000). The main differences with other common deterministic directional wave-analysis methods are: the SWDD method is free of user-checks after each analysis, the directional resolution is higher, the computation time is faster and a wave field reconstruction after the directional wave-analysis is possible.<br/><br/>The applicability of the SWDD method has been tested using synthetic wave signals for (the sum of) monochromatic long-crested waves, prescribed wave patterns – containing wave-crest curvature and wave amplitude variation – and model results of a mild-slope wave model (WIHA). Multiple sensitivity analyses have been applied to check the sensitivity of the SWDD method to: various physical phenomena (e.g. diffraction and wave amplitude variation), domain variations (e.g. slopes) and input parameter variation. The study shows that the SWDD method is able to analyse irregular wave-fields using an array configuration containing a low number of gauges and a dense grid containing many gauges. Based on the findings an advisory flowchart is presented on how to determine the optimum radius of the array setup for using the SWDD method in practice, both for the analysis of data from phase-resolving numerical wave models and from measurements.<br/><br/>The study shows that the SWDD method is a robust and reliable method to analyse (complex) wave fields on a (near) homogeneous bathymetry.

The issue of behavior is made computationally tractable by considering behavioral processes as various optimization problems with a single objective: minimization of Free Energy. The rationale is that to exist adaptive agents have to resist a natural tendency to disorder. This is accomplished by adopting a policy that minimizes Surprisal. To put it differently the adaptive agent has to become an expert at predicting its own sensations (eyes and proprioception) caused by an uncertain environment. The brain is therefore believed to embody a generative model. Surprisal is the measure of how good this generative model can explain the sensations experienced by adaptive agent. The mathematical equivalent of Surprisal is the negative log Likelihood. The Likelihood distribution -a typical term used in probability theory- expresses how probable the observed sensory data -sensations- is for different settings of causes. By maximization of the Likelihood Surprisal is minimized. To obtain an exact maximum Likelihood solution one however has to integrate over all possible settings of all known and unknown causes. Rather than minimization of Surprisal a minimization of a bound on Surprisal: the Free Energy is considered. The Free Energy principle formulated into a Bio-inspired Control algorithm could be the solution to the lack of adaptability and precision towards uncertain and unknown environments that the robotic community currently faces. This formulation is however not trivial. This thesis addresses the process of Learning a model of a Process according to the principles of Free Energy. It is identified the Free Energy principle to heavenly rely upon concepts from the Machine Learning methodology Expectation Maximization. In case of linearity and a Wiener process assumption on the noise affecting the Process, the Free Energy Learning algorithm is equivalent to the EM algorithm. An evaluation of the minimization of Free Energy problem with respect to the state led to a state estimation computation equivalent to the Kalman filter. An evaluation of the minimization of the Free Energy problem with respect to the model parameters led to a model parameter computation equivalent to the solution of a linear least square problem. It has been identified the EM algorithm to be quite unfamiliar in Control settings. Implementations of the Free Energy Learning algorithm = EM algorithm yielded promising results although only a naive version has been implemented. Improvements on the implementations are believed to generate a competitive algorithm for solving control problems. Next steps are consideration of the full Free Energy principle algorithm where the Wiener assumption on noise does not apply and the input is derived with a similar Free Energy minimization problem. The former could relate to the concept of incorporating a prediction horizon suggesting a intimate relationship with the Subspace Identification method. The latter is inherently different from conventional control. The full Free Energy principle algorithm does distinguishes itself from the EM algorithm.","The Free Energy Principle; Variational Free Energy; Bayesian Inference; variational Expectation Maximization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this research is to determine the trailing forces and to estimate the production of the draghead. Besides that, the goal is to get more insight into how the draghead behaves, depending on the trailing velocities. The variations in the trailing velocities, soil characteristics, control settings and draghead and suction pipe geometries that can occur do not make it easy to determine the trailing forces on the draghead and suction pipe. Because of this complexity, it is also hard to define how to estimate the production. Therefore, the scope of this research is limited to just one sand type with specific soil characteristics.<br/><br/>An analysis of the draghead and the suction pipe, with a freely suspended visor, showed the physical processes in and around the whole suction pipe system. Because the draghead is fixed to the suction pipe, the influence of suction pipe on the draghead is analysed first. After that, the draghead is divided into two parts, the visor and the visor house. With the use of force and moment balances the trailing forces are determined for every trailing velocity. In addition, the production and its production limits are defined.<br/><br/>The calculations show that the increase of the trailing velocity results in higher trailing forces on the suction pipe and draghead. For a velocity of around 2 m/s the draghead, for a Damen SLK600 used in the case study, will lift of from the bed. It should be notified that, among other variables, the dredging depth has an effect on this ‘floating’ point. Moreover, the results showed that the drag forces at common trailing velocities of 1-2 m/s are relatively low compared to the soil excavation forces and therefore have a small share in the total trailing forces. When the suction pipe system is trailed against the current the dragforce becomes more significant.<br/><br/>The interaction of the draghead with the bed causes several processes to take place. The resulting relevant trailing forces are mapped and determined. The settlement of the draghead causes a hump of sand to be pushed forwards which result in a sled force and a friction force. Besides that, the flow through the pipes will cause impulse forces in the bends and at the end of the jet pipe out of the nozzle. The jets fluidize the sand which results in the largest production contribution. Furthermore, it can be seen that the penetration depth and cavity width of the jets depend on the trailing velocity and determine the amount of sand that is loosened. The cavities can overlap at low trailing velocities, resulting in a jet production limit.<br/><br/>The jets have a significant influence on the behaviour of the visor. The freely suspended visor will drop until a solid bed layer is reached. The cutting force and vacuum force are the dominant forces working on the visor. Application of the equilibrium-moment method showed that the visor is slowly moving upwards when the trailing velocity is increased. However, the cutting layer thickness remains almost constant for an increasing trailing velocity which results in a linear increase of the cutting production. The cutting production contributes, 20-25%, to the total situ production. The total jet and cutting production lead, together with the jet water inserted and ambient water flow, to the total production and mixture density. When the capacity of the dredging pump is insufficient, spillage will occur.<br/><br/>This research shows the best possible estimate of the draghead production and corresponding trailing forces. It should be kept in mind that the calculations are based on a simplification of the suction pipe system and the geometries of the suction pipe system of Damen. Nevertheless, a lot of research can be performed into the processes that occur, to improve the results of the calculations. Suggestions for further research would be to determine the magnitude of the vacuum force, the erosion production which is not considered in this research or the on velocity depending cavity width. Validations of the results is another point of consideration. Thus, to determine trailing forces and production, the new approach used in this study contributes to a better understanding of the draghead.<br","Draghead; suction pipe; freely suspended visor; trailing velocity; trailing force; drag force; jet production; penetration depth; cavity width; cutting forces; cutting layer thickness; cutting production; production mixture density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-13","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This resulted in large investments in anti-piracy measures, but as piracy waned over the following years, so did the investments in anti-piracy measures. This could be an indication that the stage for maritime piracy has been reset. This report suggests a more efficient and cheaper approach to counteract maritime piracy on merchant vessels indefinitely.<br/><br/>SeaState5, the company at which this research is done, came up with the idea to combat pirate attacks on merchant vessels using a Fast Rescue Craft (FRC). Merchant vessels are obligated by law to carry an FRC; used for instance for man over board missions. SeaState5 focuses on developing an add-on plug and play system compatible with existing FRC. It turns these sole-purpose rescue craft into a multi-purpose craft, in this research referred to as the Beagle. This Beagle will serve both rescue and anti-piracy purposes. In this report the concept development of this add-on system is established.<br/><br/>This is done by developing a simulation in MATLAB and Simulink that mimics a pirate attack on a merchant vessel. During the pirate attack the Beagle uses a defense strategy to repel the pirates. A Beagle defense strategy is a combination of a non-lethal weapon and a set of parameters that define the trajectory of the Beagle. Different Beagle defense strategies are subjected to different pirate attack scenarios to find the most effective one. <br/><br/>The simulations resulted in a list of requirements for the Beagle.

The detection of neutrinos can help us understand various events happening in space and answer fundamental questions about the universe. One possibility to detect neutrinos is acoustic detection in the ocean.<br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to design, optimize, manufacture and test a hydrophone that can be used to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos, when implemented in a large-scale telescope. The hydrophone designed in this research is a transducer which converts acoustic pressure to strain in an optical fiber, this strain can be measured precisely. To be implemented in a telescope for the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos the fiber optic hydrophone has to meet a number of design requirements. The most vital requirements concern the sensitivity and frequency range of the hydrophone. The transducer should have a frequency range from 1 to 50 kHz and should be able to measure the softest noise in the ocean, hence there is a minimum required strain in the fiber per Pascal pressure. Within the frequency range mentioned, it is preferable that the transducer behaves linearly. Consequently, the first eigenfrequency of the sensor should be above 50 kHz. Such a high eigenfrequency means that the sensor must be stiff and as this conflicts with the objective to maximize strain, a trade-off had to be made.<br/><br/>Different design methods, such as topology optimization and parametric optimization, were investigated. Four hydrophones were manufactured and tested.

A combination of energy storage systems along with renewable energy technologies can eliminate CO2 emissions in the future. It can also lead to state development, by liberating countries from the dependency on costly fossil fuel imports. Finally, population growth will result in increased energy peaks and energy storage systems can be seen as the means for achieving those enhanced power requirements.<br/>In the current thesis, an extensive thermodynamic investigation of an efficient energy storage system based on steam electrolysis is presented. The core of the system is a reversible solid oxide cell stack. It can operate either as electrolysis (charging mode) or as a fuel cell (discharging mode). Apart from the core, around the stack, various balance of plant components can be placed for the synthesis of a plethora of fuels. In this case study, methanol is synthesized.<br/>At first, process design of a model capable of converting electrical energy to methanol and vice versa is formulated in process simulation software Aspen Plus®. Extensive energy and exergy analysis have been conducted on the system for the identification of process conditions which maximize energy and exergy efficiency of each mode of operation. Furthermore, extensive exergy flow diagrams have been drawn in order to pinpoint the components which mostly contribute to the total exergy losses. Finally, roundtrip efficiency optimization has also been performed and the respective process conditions have been reported.

Exergy and energy efficiency during fuel cell mode are still limited due to the intense refrigeration system employed for CO2 condensation. For maximization of roundtrip efficiency, a thermal energy storage system was additionally employed in the process design which stores heat energy from fuel cell mode in order to satisfy the thermal requirements during the endothermic electrolytic operation.

However, it is increasingly difficult to continue this trend because current CMOS technology cannot be down-scaled anymore due to physical restrictions. Consequently, to obtain the next major performance improvement, the focus is shifting from a technology-only optimization effort towards a system-level hardware-software co-design optimization strategy. In recent years, the move to heterogeneous computing has gained enormous traction with all the big names such as Intel, IBM, and NVIDIA investing heavily in this approach. This paradigm shift is characterized by traditional general-purpose processors offloading data to hardware accelerators, which are capable of exploiting parallelism to a significantly higher degree. An accelerator which has existed for decades but has recently risen to greater prominence is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The scientific computing community is also experiencing the need for higher computational power as their problem sizes increase. FPGAs make a promising candidate for their ability to tailor complex algorithms to specialized hardware circuits. A key algorithm to accelerate in this domain is the Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV). There do not exist many HLS (High-Level Synthesis) designs for this kernel, and the one designed using Vivado HLS exhibits significantly lower performance than the state-of-the-art. We argue that the most effective way to achieve speedup is by implementing multiple parallel pipelines so that multiple result values are produced in each cycle. Consequently, we develop an implementation agnostic partitioning algorithm for SpMV that splits the problem into independent streams. The HLS kernel performs well as a standalone unit, offering a speedup of up to 150x compared to the ARM coprocessor on the ZYNQ system and up to 4.6x to state-of-the-art Vivado HLS-based solutions. Our estimations show that the solution scales with an increasing number of resources.","Big data; Sparse matrix; HLS; FPGA; Zynq","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-07","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

To keep the Horizon Zero Dawn title still alive and relevant, the experience of the game will be translated into a physical product. Horizon Zero Dawn’s current merchandise is quite safe and standard and does not translate the experience of the game well, and therefore a product expansion is advised.<br/><br/>Based on the strengths of Horizon Zero Dawn and the opportunities derived from a trend analysis, multiple search areas were explored, of which eventually a combination of two was chosen. One of the chosen search areas focusses on interactive objects, such as radio-controlled vehicles and modelling kits, while the other one focusses on creating environmental or cultural awareness.<br/><br/>Within the two chosen search areas many ideas were explored. This eventually led to the direction of self-sufficient enclosed ecosystems. Over time, the plants inside the ecosystem will grow bigger, and “Mother Earth will slowly reclaim what has always been hers”. This perfectly fitting direction for Horizon Zero Dawn led to three different concepts.<br/><br/>One of the concepts, the main focus of this project, is a limited art “toy” aimed at the “hardcore” fans of Horizon Zero Dawn, while the other two concepts are subtilized versions of the same idea.<br/>The subtilized concepts are both jarred ecosystems with a collectible figure inside of it. The two concepts vary in size and price, while only the more expensive ecosystem also includes an internal light.<br/>The concept for the “hardcore” fanbase also includes a self-sufficient ecosystem, but this one is placed inside a massive (250x250x225 mm) scale model of a Shell Walker. Furthermore, the concept works interactive with Horizon Zero Dawn by reflecting the in-game’s events with (coloured) light effects. When not playing the game, the product can still be used as a wakeup light.<br/>All concepts keep the user interacting with the product once in a while, as they need to water or trim the plants. The concepts also add a touch of real nature inside a gamer’s house, and thereby adding environmental awareness.","Merchandise; Game Design; Videogame; Horizon Zero Dawn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Smets, A.H.M. (mentor); Mensink, Michiel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Photovoltaic Technologies in recent years have gained immense attention owing to reduced costs and increasing efficiencies. While decades of research in Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) technologies, producing thermal and electrical energy simultaneously have brought these costs further down, improving a system’s overall performance. PVT collectors consist of PV modules with a thermal absorber bonded/attached underneath them. Excessive solar radiation that is not converted into electricity by the panels is released as heat, causing their temperatures to rise. Rising PV panel temperatures have an adverse effect on their efficiency, particularly for building integrated photovoltaics, that generally lack sufficient ventilation for this heat release. Thermal absorbers for PVT systems, are designed specifically for absorbing the excess heat generated by PV modules. In practise, helping the panels perform better by effectively removing the heat present behind them, with the help of a heat transfer fluid.<br/><br/>This project has been a collaborative effort between the TU Delft, and Exasun BV, a solar panel manufacturer located in the Netherlands. At Exasun, the project has also benefited by being a part of a larger consortium project, the PVT inSHaPe, currently underway at the Solar Energy Application Centre (SEAC), in Eindhoven. PVT inSHaPe aims to realise zero energy buildings by integrating PVT systems with heat pumps alongside effective thermal storage. As a manufacturer, Exasun BV specialises in state of the art building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV). BIPV systems aim to integrate photovoltaic technologies seamlessly into building facades. In doing so, they forego essential thermal ventilation required for maintaining lower panel temperatures. Thus, a novel BIPVT design was developed in-house at Exasun, for extracting the excess heat of panels, and utilising it to match the domestic hot water and space heating demand for Dutch households.<br/><br/>A simple thermal model for concentrating PV-Thermal collectors, currently under development at the TU Delft was validated alongside widely used steady-state and quasi-dynamic thermal models. Individually calculated thermal efficiencies from the models were juxtaposed, with the simple thermal model recording an error of 1.65% against the steady-state model, and an error of 9.21 % against the quasi-dynamic model. Once validated, the model was used further for system characterisation and performance evaluations of the design.<br/><br/>Various technology concepts have been tested extensively. However, further feasibility, reliability and optimisation studies need to be performed, in order to test the novel, cost-effective, and relatively maintenance free design in mind. The performance of PVT systems rely on high irradiance levels from the sun, and module temperatures. As space heating demands are higher during winter months, even after heat pump integration, the system is not effective enough to match the entirety of the load demand, and must be coupled with an auxiliary (electrical) heater, that can be powered by the PV system. Presumptive performance analysis carried out for a simulated household, revealed an average thermal efficiency of 10 % for the design, while recording a combined efficiency of 36 %. The stand-alone system was able to match over 55 % of the domestic hot water demand. When combined with a heat pump, the system is able to meet roughly 80 % of the hot water demand, while it is able to match almost 40 % of the complete thermal demand for a household.","BIPVT; PVT; Heat pump; PVT heat pump integration; Model validation; A simple thermal model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This assignment was set up to make the MOJO backstage exhibition at Museum Prinsenhof Delft inclusive for hearing-impaired people. First, context mapping research with hearing-impaired and hearing festival visitors shows that inclusiveness at festivals is less present for hearing-impaired. To include hearing-impaired, the focus is to minimize the language barrier and create an independent and equal interaction. Combining the mapping information with desktop research and a sensitizing experiment, resulted in socio-cultural dimension diagrams (Hofstede, 2018) which compare hearing and deaf cultures. Differences conclude that deaf culture is more together, emotionally expressive and contextual. With music experience being one of the main reasons for people to visit festivals, for hearing impaired this is experienced through vibrations, live performances and dancing audiences during a music festival. In current products and theories music characteristics are often literally translated to structures of the tactile and/or visual sense, because they are capable to change over time and have a wide variety. Unfortunately, most of these abstract theories and products are not able to convey the same emotional response as people who hear songs via sound. Therefore, a test with hearing people was performed to find similarities in emotional response to music of hearing and hearing-impaired people. Hearing people were asked to elaborate on Justlin and Vastfall’s (2008) emotional responses to music. Similarities between the answers given in this test and interviews with hearing-impaired, were found within two of the categories; emotional contagion and rhythmic entrainment. During interviews and observations at several festivals, using current solutions like the Lofelt bracelet and signdance shows. It was discovered that rhythmic entrainment is experienced by hearing-impaired people by feeling bass through vibrations of speakers or floors. Emotional contagion is experienced by dance moves and facial expression of a crowd or performers on stage. The goal of this study is to design a product that uses visual dance and vibrations of the bass as means to create an inclusive interaction between hearing-impaired and hearing festival visitors. This is done by an interactive dance game that is played during a live concert. The game is played by mimicking dance moves on the beat, while the beat is felt by vibrations of the bass. A concept test concluded that the game is inclusive because it was played just as well by hearing as hearing-impaired people. Also, bystanders joined the dance game without being an actual participant. This effect is expected to be even bigger in the festival context. Hearing-impaired people mention to feel more independent and confident at a festival when using a product like this. It would be interesting to develop a portable (smartphone) version to be independent of a location. Further research could be done to develop the character into a fully automated (sign) dance character which would make hearing-impaired fully independent of their peers at every location in time.<br","Inclusive design; Hearing-impaired; Music festivals; Museum Experience; Tactile music; Visual music; Haptics; Sign language; Dancing; Rhythm; Emotion; Body language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of this study is to discover the effect and the future affordability of societal aging on health care systems across the OECD, to investigate which policies are needed to overcome this problem and to shed new light on new debates of new policies. A model-based policy analysis using a multi-region dynamic modeling method has been performed to reach this<br/>goal. In this research, a stakeholder analysis is executed to examine which stakeholders are involved in the decision making process concerning societal aging. Furthermore, a system dynamics model is built which represents the health care systems across the OECD. Within this model, four policies have been tested to examine which policies are suited to be implemented<br/>to close the future gap between the health supply and the health demand. The first policy is the automation-policy, which decreases the administrative tasks of nurses, through technological advancements. The second policy that is tested is the eHealth-policy, which supports health care institutions to make use of eHealth applications. The third policy is the additional-students-policy, which calculates the inflow of nursing students using the gap of needed nurses. The last policy is the euthanasia-policy, which helps people suffering from dementia to commit euthanasia. The results of the research show a decrease in the gap between the demand for health care and the health care supply when the policies are implemented. The implementation of the additional-students-policy performs best in terms of closing the gap, but the costs of this implementation are high. Therefore governments should make trade-offs between the costs<br/>and the quality of health care. However, these trade-offs may include ethical dilemmas like the example of the committing-euthanasia-policy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A transition from the current linear economy towards a circular economy is necessary to reach this goal. In the circular economy, products at end-of-life are no longer seen as waste but will be reused as a secondary product or resource. <br/><br/>The general aim of this research is to investigate the implementation of the circular economy concept in the public space. From this study, it became clear that Dutch municipalities are willing to implement circularity for assets released from the public space. However, the municipalities are not aware of the actions which are required to increase the circularity within its maintenance activities. A method is proposed which gives decision makers of a municipality guidelines to justify their decision for a maintenance plan of an urban area. This method includes PAVE (maintenance plan analysis tool to value enhancement of circularity in the public space): a tool which quantifies the environmental and economic impact of maintenance plans. To express the impacts four criteria were selected: the carbon footprint, financial footprint, material loss and monetary value loss. The tool follows a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. <br/><br/>In this research, the use of PAVE was investigated during the maintenance of a neighbourhood in Almere. It was concluded that to be able to implement PAVE in an effective manner, the asset database of the municipality needs to be updated to fill in the information gap. Part of the case area database was renewed to conduct an inventory of the assets in the selected urban area for this research. In PAVE, the impacts of the selected assets were calculated for both the circular project plan of the contractor and the traditional linear plan. PAVE indicated that using the new project plan for the case area results in approximately 1455 ton less CO2 emissions and is €4304000 cheaper compared to the traditional linear maintenance plan. Furthermore, PAVE demonstrated that the use of the new plan leads to 238 m3 and €424.000 less material and monetary value loss, respectively. <br/><br/>In this research, it was evident that to select a maintenance plan among others, the tool should be included in the decision-making scheme of municipalities. By implementing PAVE, decision makers will be able to compare the impacts of different maintenance plans and select the most suitable plan based on environmental and economic considerations. The implementation of the tool can be ensured by making the provided budget dependent on implementation. Finally, the proposed plans of contractors should be evaluated on their circularity. Guidelines have been formulated to support the selection of the maintenance plan for urban areas in the public space.","Circular Economy; Public Space; Decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

We became opponents instead of working together, and put up high walls to protect ourselves form the vagaries of an unpredictable sea. Somewhere along our path of progress, we lost our human connection to the sea. Before the sea became something we secluded, it was known for its reviving properties. In our increasingly intense society of busy cities and never ending incentives from globalization, leading to stress and burn-outs, there is a need to rebalance our cities and ourselves. Taking into account future projections for sea level rise, sea defence systems will have to grow intensively if land below sea level is to be kept habitable. This will result in a cumulative gap between the sea and the human system. Combined with the ever increasing amount of re-urbanisation, a whole new level of pressure on the border between coastal cities and the sea will arise. An example of this is the city of Den Helder. This city is disconnected from the sea by a eleven meter high dike, protecting the country from engulfing this geographical anchoring point of the Netherlands. The project focusses on actively leaving the city behind, projecting itself on the water in the solitude created by the dike, to return to the city revived again. The dike is presented as a public space, turning it from a border into a threshold before entering the territory of the sea. Transgressing this border generates a route of reflection from the rigid and intense city, into the wideness and freedom of the sea. The project consists out of a bathhouse, a swimming pool, a restaurant and a public roof and a viewing point. These are connected by a series of different routes. First the visitor leaves the city and enters the tower of entrance, here orientation is lost by the spiral stairs leading to the bridge. The bridge turns crossing the dike into a deliberate act of transgressing the border. The bridge ends in a high central space which is focussed on the changing, the abandonment of once responsibilities and stigma. This space splits into two elements with their own direction. From this space three routes lead through the diverse functions relating to the water, each in their own way. At the end of the two elements one finds himself surrounded by the water. One reaches for the view and the endless horizon of the sea and the other frames the touching of the water. After this experience of projecting oneself into the water, the visitor can return to the city revived again or linger a bit longer on the public landscape of the dike and benefit from the qualities of the sea.","Therapeutic landscapes; North Sea; Delta Interventions; Sea defence systems; Dike; Den Helder; Bathhouse; Burn outs; Coastal squeeze; Fort Erfprins; Healty qualities sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since it is difficult to work ergonomically correct on a laptop (i.e. the screen and keyboard are attached to each other, forcing the user in a unnatural position while working), MSD complaints among workers are expected to further increase. Based on a literature study and online research a set of guidelines is determined for an ergonomic posture and workplace. These guidelines largely defined requirements for the laptop stand. A survey among 225 students is conducted to determine the magnitude of the problem and why current solutions are insufficient in preventing or curing MSD (musculoskeletal disorders). Four qualitative interviews gave additional insight in the underlying problem. These studies showed that over 60% of participants at least sometimes experience physical discomfort during laptop use. Yet, only a small number of people actually use ergonomic tools like laptop stands. The main reason mentioned by respondents is that it takes too much effort and time to transport and setup an ergonomic workplace. Existing laptop stands do not tackle this problem as they seem to be designed with only the product in mind rather than the complete user journey. Therefore, the goal was to design a laptop stand that makes it easy for users to work ergonomically, without losing the flexibility and appearance of a laptop. As the design of a laptop stand that focuses on solving the issues found was already started during Build Your Startup, the product development during this project mainly focuses on the detailing and optimization of the product's USPs: integration between laptop stand, keyboard and cover in combination with an automatic lifting system that allows users to work ergonomically within 20 seconds. For each component of the laptop stand iterations and design decisions are discussed. One of the key features is the integration of a spring-damper system that smoothly brings up the laptop stand to the required height. Secondly, a front grip keeps the laptop in place and gradually adjusts to the position of the laptop when changing the height. Thirdly, a simple slide mechanism allows users to lock and unlock the laptop stand so it can be safely transported. The final design can be seen in figure 1. A functional prototype is built to validate the assumptions during the design phases. Based on the prototype, the design is evaluated on the requirements as determined by the research studies. Executive summary Graduation report // pag 5 Due to the entrepreneurial basis of this project, there was an opportunity to join the course BPC (ID4315-16) which resulted in valuable feedback with regards to branding and positioning. Based on these results, a proposal is written for the brand DNA of Riggid; the company as started during BYS (ID5659) by Thomas Zwart and Igo Boerrigter. Based on the brand DNA, important aesthetic qualities are determined and tested in a survey. The laptop stand should look reliable, professional, premium and stylish. The survey showed promising results and valuable suggestions regarding customisation of colour and materials and small adjustments regarding the geometry of the product. Overall, the laptop stand is not yet ready for production as some requirements have not yet been met. The most critical steps forward will be the fine-tuning of the spring-damper system, doing ergonomic and usability tests with users and additional development towards the cover and aesthetic aspect of the design. However, during the project it was managed to fit all required components and functionalities within only a 10 mm aluminium casing, delivering full proof of concept and providing a clear way forward.","Ergonomics; Laptop stand; Musculoskeletal disorders; MSD; Telecommuting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A key concept in public infrastructure management is Life Cycle Asset Management (LCAM), which aims to improve the decision making in each phase of the life cycle of infrastructure assets, such as road and utility networks, civil structures, and green areas. Traditional systems in LCAM are limited in terms of analysis and visualization opportunities due to the use of simpler tools like tables. In this respect, Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions have been widely integrated in LCAM to optimise the administration and monitoring of infrastructure assets. The incursion of semantic 3D models complements the use of GIS by introducing new and innovative modelling and visualization methods. As one of the most common design techniques in the building and construction industry, Building Information Modelling (BIM) facilitates the generation of multidimensional models to describe the physical and functional characteristics of built objects. This research studies the integration of 3D BIM models in a Web GIS system for public space management to improve the procedure in the maintenance phase of LCAM. The goal is to solve the challenges related to the acquisition, processing, and visualization of 3D models. The thesis outlines the process of the development of a 3D prototype in an attempt to demonstrate a possible solution for the integration of BIM models in an existing GIS application. The research starts with a scientific literature review to familiarise with the LCAM concept, Web GIS, and semantic 3D models. Then, the stakeholders in the project are identified and their requirements with regard to the functional capabilities of the prototype are gathered in order to create a design concept. Consequently, the BIM model used in this study is presented and processed to comply with the Dutch national standards for inspection and maintenance. The prototype is developed on the basis of Web Graphics Library (WebGL), a technology for web rendering of interactive 3D graphics and animations supported by all modern web browsers. At the end of the development process, the prototype is evaluated by experts in the LCAM and BIM fields to assess its usability by means of a questionnaire survey. The input from the participants in the survey is essential for the further improvement of the prototype and its release as fully functional product.","3D Models; BIM; Web GIS; Data Acquisition, Integration, Visualization; Infrastructure Management; Life Cycle Asset Management; Prototype Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","51.912821, 4.497943"

One important aspect of damage tolerance is crack propagation which can be investigated via 3D numerical software. This Master Thesis project focuses on investigating and implementing the submodel technique in MTU Aero Engines' own FEM (Finite Element Method) based in-house crack propagation calculation tool known as Cracktracer 3D. The key points of the project are the theoretical background behind the submodel technique, the changes that have be to made to Cracktracer 3D's Python/C/Fortran based code and the verification and validation of the method by comparing the crack propagation parameters for real engine components with the results of an already established method. It is theorized that the submodel technique will provide more accurate stress intensity factors for complex engineering applications. The need to investigate the capabilities of the submodel technique arises from MTU's desire to have a more reliable alternative to its current method. The findings could have a valuable contribution towards lowering the design safety margin of MTU Aero Engines components.

The side-by-side comparison of two different numerical routines applied on the same examples can also give some valuable insight into the advantages and disadvantages of either methods. \\<br/><br/>\noindent The main objective of this thesis project is to reduce the number of test cases in which MTU Aero Engines' crack propagation calculation tool Cracktracer 3D fails to predict the correct crack propagation parameters by investigating the applicability of a submodel method consisting of a pure tetrahedral global model followed by a hexahedral submodel calculation.\\<br/><br/>\noindent Currently a combined hexahedral-tetrahedral method is used in Cracktracer 3D. The actual initial crack shape is inserted into the structure, thereby automatically re-meshing the neighborhood of the crack in two zones. The first zone consist of a flexible cylindrical tube introduced at the crack tip. This tube contains collapsed hexahedral elements which ensures that the stress singularity at the crack tip is represented correctly. The second zone is located beyond the cylindrical tube and has a tetrahedral mesh created with NETGEN, a free 2D-3D tetrahedral meshing software. In order to determine the crack propagation size and direction, the stress intensity factor concept is applied. CalculiX is used for determining the stresses required by the postprocessor where the actually stress intensity factors are computed and the new crack front is obtained. The complex merging of the two zones together with the intersections of the resulting mesh with the crack shape and with the uncracked domain is the primary reason for the failure of the program.<br/><br/>To prevent the failure of the program due to complex crack geometry, an alternative procedure is proposed. The two zones described above are replaced by a coarse mesh containing only tetrahedral elements. The stresses obtained from this purely tetrahedral mesh are not accurate enough to predict the correct stress intensity factors. In order to solve this issue, a submodel is created at the crack front. This submodel consists of a tube-like mesh with collapsed and finer hexahedral elements. The external boundary conditions of this tube are interpolated from the tetrahedral coarse grid resulting into a smaller, but also more accurate problem to obtain the stress intensity factor values at the core of the tube. Such an approach effectively removes the need to merge a hexahedral tube mesh with a tetrahedral one and can thus lead to a much more stable program. The computation time is also decreased. While the underlying principles of this technique are not new, the scope of its applicability, the comparison with another existing technique and the implementation methodology introduced in this thesis are unique.<br/><br/>In order to validate such an approach, five different examples are used: a corner crack specimen under Mode I loading, a corner crack specimen under Mode III loading, a torque specimen under Mode I-III loading, a turbine vane carrier under Mode I loading together with thermal stresses and a shrouded turbine blade under mixed mode loading with thermal stresses. The most important crack parameters (e.g. maximum crack size during each increment, maximum equivalent stress intensity factor during each increment) obtained from both methods are compared for 100 crack increments. Generally, the results match very well as the crack shapes are almost identical. There is a slight disagreement occurring for some of the test cases at the free surface due to the tube submodel sticking out of the component which leads to different stress intensity factors being obtained. This difference is caused by interpolation errors. It is well known however that the stress intensity factors are not very accurate at this location even for the original method since the stress singularity changes at the free surface. A study into how fine the submodel mesh and the global tetrahedral mesh need to be is also conducted. The results indicate no significant improvement of a finer tetrahedral mesh but refining the tube submodel mesh does improve the computation of the stress intensity factors since there are more nodes present at the submodel's boundary where the displacements are interpolated. Any type of mesh refinement however comes at the cost of an increase in computation time. <br/><br/>The submodel method is capable of computing sufficiently accurate results faster than the original combined hexahedral-tetrahedral method. Many more types of initial cracks can be inserted for the submodel method without forcing the user to increase the tube radius to account for different crack geometries and the complex merging of the meshes as in the original method. The main focus of additional research should be on testing the submodel approach on more complex case studies with multiple load steps in order to ensure that all the relevant features (e.g. concentrated loads, distributed loads, residual stresses) are correctly transferred from the coarse tetrahedral mesh to the submodel. Additionally, a possible combination of both approaches by alternating from one method to the other during the same case study, thereby utilizing each method's strengths when needed, is also worth investigating.","Finite Element Method; Cyclic crack propagation; Submodelling; Fracture Mechanics; Mixed-mode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Nowadays it is almost rare to find places and landscapes in cities that have no function, are left behind or not taken care of. Even in the city of Rotterdam, which is less dense than Amsterdam, every square meter is very valuable and is often planned for. If it does not have a destination yet, then developers are eager to make that piece of land profitable. This capitalistic view is characteristic for our productive, accelerated and consumptive society. In this society, we tend to forget the small, but valuable things in life and stray away from our core, our existential self, which is that we are part of nature. We tend to neglect the need for spaces for reflection and being in our continuous drive for moving forward. The city needs these breathing spaces where, for a moment, the citizen is not a passive consumer, but an active and playful participant, a wanderer, a collector and an explorer in these ‘Places for Freedom’.<br/><br/>Preliminary to the design a research was done on the unfinished, abandoned landscapes of Rotterdam: places in the city that lost their formal use, are left behind and often taken over by nature. Those places fascinated me as they actually oppose the productive and planned city and the effects thereof. In order to find the proper methods to explore and close read those places, a study was done in psychogeography. Psychogeography is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and ‘drifting’ to find unexpected perspectives and therefore can create new awareness of places. Walking, the merit of wandering, as the main act of the research for encountering those places, means slowing down which allows close reading of space, remembrance and let in the invisible sensory experience. Furthermore, the methods photographing, drawing and writing were used to document, represent and make them legible for others. It allowed me to perceive the specific qualities of the observed places and lead to a categorization of different types of unfinished landscapes found in Rotterdam. For the design proposal, the three typical unfinished landscapes of Rotterdam are being exposed: the wasteland in the city, the in-between landscape and the industrial landscape. <br/><br/>With the design ‘Places for Freedom’ I create architectural structures inside those chosen unfinished landscapes to offer an alternative way of being in and thinking about the city. These structures are inviting one to be present in the moment and provides a sensory experience of a place, they are enhancing the specific qualities of each landscape. ‘Places for Freedom’ offers a break in our routinized journeys within the city, a closer relationship with our natural environment and moments for intimate informal encounters, not only with humans, but also with animals and plants which are the other inhabitants of the city. <br","unfinished landscapes; walking the city; Rotterdam; temporal structures; being; sensory experience; traces; local community; psychogeography; intimacy; folly; natural environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

In line with the rest of the world, India is, next to its increase in population, seeing a rapid urbanization, with Mumbai in the centre of it all. Considering the increase of population and the urbanization of India, it is only a logical cause that its capital is now growing at an unprecedented pace. In only fifty years’ time, the population of Mumbai has tripled, with no apparent end to be seen. Almost needless to say, the city is struggling with these numbers. What might be even more striking is the fact that in the same time span, the percentage of people living in slums has risen from roughly ten percent to as much as fifty percent of total population. And although slum dwellers form half of the population, their homes only take up 6% of the total land area. The conditions in which many of these dwellers live, are alarmingly unhygienic and according to the Census of India unfit for human habitation. <br/>Many of them will end up in so-called “Chawls”, five story high apartment blocks, closely packed together. From an economic perspective it is almost impossible to compete with the developments of the Chawls. It is simply not possible to house any more dwellings on a piece of land, without making substantially higher buildings, which would no longer be economical. The developers have maximized their profits, with hardly any regard for the dwellers needs. <br/>When visiting the village of Nalasopara, a mere 2,5 kilometres away from the Chawls, the stark contrast between the two becomes obvious. Whereas the village accommodates in many of the social and economic needs of its inhabitants, the Chawls are very monotonous and lack the richness in sociospatial layers. A large variety in hierarchy of spaces can be observed in the village, constituting a layering in the way spaces are used and the interactions between people taking place. This hierarchy is not present in the Chawls, resulting in a scarce variety of spaces and how they are used. Although most of the dwellers have broken the bonds of village community, that does not mean the spatial practices originating in the village are also thrown away. Moreover, the “village way of life” has certain qualities, which can serve also those who do not originate from the village. Not paying attention to those, which is happening now, is a lost opportunity. These qualities could be used to overcome the problem of the lack of sociospatial layers and not meeting the social and economic needs of the dwellers.<br/>This project represents an attempt to overcome some of the issues described above and will show a design that tries to combine the qualities of the village together with the reality of the Chawls. It will show a design that introduces hierarchical spaces in the overcrowded areas of the Chawls, to blur the boundaries. <br","Global Housing; Mumbai; Affordable Housing; Nala Sopara; Vernacular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","","19.4199, 72.8117"

The mitigation potentials for these measures was determined using a bottom-up approach utilizing recent literature, and where needed by up-scaling found results along assumed variables. The determined mitigation potentials are compared with the emissions gaps between a current policy scenario and scenarios limiting temperature rise below 1.5 and 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. These emission gaps are estimated to be 18-22 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e, and 24-27 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e, respectively. Further, the found mitigation potentials are compared with the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris climate accord of the G20 member states. It was found that the global mitigation potential for the nine treated measures in 2030 is 19-27 GtCO<sub>2</sub>e. Subsequently, it is concluded that the emission gaps can both be closed if the mitigation potentials for the nine measures are realized, and that the NDCsof the G20 countries can be achieved in 2030 by a large margin.

This may endanger the structural integrity when the steel reinforcement gets exposed and experiences corrosion, and must therefore be taken into account in the design process. For the design of concrete offshore structures in Arctic conditions, an accurate description and prediction of ice-structure interaction is required. The interaction between moving ice and concrete surfaces is mainly governed by friction and the so-called stick-slip phenomenon. This phenomenon has been observed during laboratory and field testing and, although the physics of this phenomenon are believed to be well understood, the corresponding static and kinetic friction coefficients reported in literature have a widespread range and are inconclusive. This thesis aims at a more accurate identification of the ice-concrete friction coefficients.<br/><br/>For this graduation project, an experimental set-up was designed and stick-slip tests were carried out at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Additionally, a numerical model describing stick-slip behavior between ice and concrete was created. For the experimental set-up, a cylindrical fresh water columnar ice sample with a 50 mm radius and 50 mm height was attached to four springs with the same stiffness. The springs were attached to a support structure and throughout the test campaign, the stiffness of these springs was varied between 20 - 70 N/m per spring. To simulate one-dimensional ice-concrete interaction, the ice sample was placed near the edge of a rotating concrete slab. The normal load on the ice sample was varied from 0.7 to 2 kg by adding weight. In addition, the concrete velocity as experienced by the ice was varied between 0.15 and 0.82 m/s by increasing the rotational rate of the concrete slab. The static and kinetic friction coefficients were obtained from the experimental data and their dependence on normal load, velocity and spring stiffness was analyzed as well. The static friction coefficients found over the whole range of tests varied from 0.1 to 0.5. The analysis showed that the static friction coefficient decreases with increasing normal load and with increasing velocity. The kinetic friction coefficient was found to be in the range of 0.08 to 0.4 and may on average be obtained as 0.7 times the static friction coefficient. The kinetic friction coefficient, too, decreases with an increase in normal load and velocity. The influence of the spring stiffness was not clearly identified.<br/><br/>The friction coefficients that were calculated using the experimental data were provided as input to the numerical stick-slip model. An analysis was performed to verify that the model displays similar regression with the varied mass, velocity and spring stiffness, compared to what was observed in the experiment. The output was compared to the experimental data, and it was found that the model describes the stick-slip behavior as seen during the experiment with an accuracy between 84 and 99%. Although some further improvements to the model can be implemented, in general it is concluded that under the made assumptions, the model is valid for the prediction of stick-slip behavior as observed during the experiment.","Stick-slip; Friction; Ice; Concrete; Offshore; Arctic; Static friction; Kinetic friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","47.573769, -52.732793"

The ‘fasten your seatbelt’ sign just turned on and the plane started descending. After landing it is time to get out of this confined space, but all the other passengers are thinking the same thing. Everyone stands in the aisle, trying to get their hand luggage out of the overhead bin and exit the plane at the same time. Arriving at the gate you feel relieved you are out and can really start your holiday. The deboarding experience is not the best experience of flying. And seeing it from the perspective of the airline, the delays caused by this process are increasing. To investigate this issue a project was executed at Brussels Airlines. A research observing the deboarding of 28 flights showed the causes for blocks in the passenger flow going out of the plane. Four out of five are related to the hand luggage people bring. An A-B test with 16 passengers shows taking away the trolleys can save up to 80% of the deboarding time. Therefore, five concepts are proposed to make the deboarding smoother by changing the behaviour of people regarding hand luggage. The proposed concepts vary from informing people about the process of deboarding, having a new boarding &amp; deboarding strategy based on the luggage people bring, convince people to bring less hand luggage giving direct feedback on their luggage at the airport, setting up a sharing community at every destination and the last concept focusses on educating people about the consequences of hand luggage in a game. The last concept is delivered as a final concept and explained more detailed. The concept called ‘The luggage games’ is a smartphone application passengers can play before they fly. It includes three different mini-games, related to 3 parts of the passenger journey while flying which include hand luggage. The passenger gets positive feedback when packing light and making sure the plane is boarded and deboarded smoothly with hand luggage. Negative feedback will be given when too much hand luggage is on board, informing the passenger about consequences of the hand luggage on operations and with direct consequence on the flying experience. This way people can learn what the consequences are of bringing a lot of hand luggage and make them more aware the next time they pack their bag for inside the cabin. This solution will therefore inform the passengers, nudging them towards taking less hand luggage in a fun way instead of simply banning the hand luggage from the plane as a rule set by the airline.","Deboarding; Handluggage; Passenger; Airline; User Experience; Turn around time; Brussels Airlines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

By all of these elements, this region is known as a natural resource area and a tourism destination for the population of the urbanized areas in the interior (Otto, 2001). <br/><br/>The Wadden Sea Region also has rich cultural heritage, which gives evidence of interaction between human and nature.

The public character or role of the typologies has partially evaporated, and as urban entities they have become (partially) isolated. Often, what was once a single department store, has now split up into several smaller shops within the original building or have gone (partially) out of use. The shift from socialist to neo-liberal economy (accompanied by a violent transition) has altered the role of the typologies. The question arises, did the typologies as a trajectory to emancipation succeed?

It is known that the transport of SPM in the Rotterdam harbor depends on marine as well as fluvial processes. SPM transport inside the harbor has been modelled in the past, but these studies did not take into account the dynamic nature of SPM concentrations at sea because they employed constant sediment boundary conditions and did not resolve wind waves. At the same time, numerous model studies of SPM transport in the Southern North Sea have been carried out, but none included the Rotterdam harbor as more than a discharge point. This MSc thesis is the first study to combine a North Sea SPM model with a detailed model of the Port of Rotterdam. By doing so, it incorporates the dynamic nature of sediment concentrations in the North Sea, and its effect on sediment transport in the Rotterdam harbor.<br/><br/>A new suspended sediment model of the Rotterdam harbor was set up with the <br/> Delft3D-WAQ software package and the NSC-Course model grid already in use by Port of Rotterdam. A validated hydrodynamic model was available for this grid schematization, and has been used as model forcing. At the open sea boundaries, the validated ZUNO-DD model for SPM transport on the North Sea was used to compute suspended sediment concentrations, which were then applied as boundary conditions. In addition, a wave buoy assimilation technique was used to include the effect of wind<br/>waves on the resuspension of sediment. A set of initial conditions was created by repeating a single spring-neap cycle with calm, virtually waveless conditions until sediment concentrations reached a dynamic equilibrium. A byproduct of this method was that it created a large sediment availability in the bed, which lead to higher than expected resuspension during storms. To investigate the response of the system to variable forcing conditions, three 14 day periods have been selected from measured environmental conditions of the year 2007, containing different combinations of storms and river discharges.<br/><br/>The model shows positive results, but does need improvement. Principally, the episodic nature of siltation in the harbor basins lining the mouth of the Rotterdam Waterway was reproduced. In line with observations, storms at sea correspond to high SPM concentrations at sea, large influxes through the harbor mouth, and increased siltation rates in the harbor basins. Furthermore, differential advection of the salinity structure and the trapping of SPM in the Rotterdam Waterway was observed. However, erosion was also observed, and harbor basins lining the Rotterdam Waterway showed a strong response to events at sea which contradicts observations. This is attributed to<br/>the wave stress assimilation performed on NSC-Coarse grid which generates large wave stresses inside the harbor and causes unwanted resuspension. Three different forcing scenarios were chosen to highlight the differences between marine and fluvial processes, but a clear distinction could not be made. This is expected to be caused by the erroneous wave shear stresses which obfuscate the effects of different siltation mechanisms.

These landscapes can only be fully understood and valued by a physical, sensory experience of it, not by looking at 2D representations. What defines a person’s relationship to the landscape they live in? And what role can (landscape) architecture play in this?<br/><br/>Norway is characterized a self-evident relationship to its natural landscapes through its cabin tradition. By looking at this phenomenon, where living in natural landscapes and the city is combined as quite an extreme contrast, the relation between landscape, architecture, and way of living can be explored. Literature study is used to explore the historical and cultural background of this specific way of living. A theoretical concept of the process of valuing a landscape through getaway architecture is formed by comparing existing theories. Through qualitative interviews with young Norwegians residing both in Oslo (urban environment) and in their cabin (getaway architecture: focussed on landscape experience/way of living), accompanied by visual techniques, their valuation of landscape through architecture is analysed. The sensory experiences present in their cabin life are analysed using architectural scores, where these are related to physical elements in the process of valuing a landscape. The outcome of these analyses is translated into a generic set of tools and strategies for designing a type of ‘getaway architecture’. <br/><br/>The transition to a contrasting situation, that of the Netherlands, is made to test these tools and strategies. The design goal is set: a revaluation of a currently undervalued landscape, the cultural polder landscape that is so typical for the delta country. In order to shape a good transition, two steps need to be taken in between the research and the design part. The first step is an investigation into the Dutch way of living, in a similar way to the literary exploration of the Norwegian way of living. The logical next step is using this information to choose a design location and analyse it. As the landscape design develops a sensory and physical experience of the polder through routes in order to achieve an understanding and valuation of it, building sites are designated within this open landscape, reacting on the historical mill structures. One of these locations, the most private one being the holiday home is chosen to elaborate upon. The layering of the – at first sight – flat landscape is unfolded through (landscape) architectural elements and the sensory experience is designed with the element of time (day/night and seasons) as a guiding theme. The new place on the dike refers to the historical mill biotope which is inherent to the understanding and thus valuation of the landscape by the visitors. <br","Sensory experience; Landscape; (Re)valuation; Environment; Way of living; Architecture; Getaway; Norway; Netherlands; Polder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Combined with sea level rise, this has resulted in continuous land loss since the fifties, making the Louisiana coast one of the fastest declining in the world. As a consequence, many communities are living on the frontline of an ever shifting landscape that is disappearing. This research examines the nature of this erasure, the counter-mechanisms of resistance fostered within these communities and ultimately proposes how the notion of space can contribute.<br/>As a site of investigation Isle de Jean Charles was chosen, a small Native American community faced with the disappearance of their island. Using the method of Forensic Architecture, through fieldwork, interviews, and workshops, an evidence file was created, assembling the narrative of Isle de Jean Charles as an incident, from which to understand the larger narrative. The project reads the evidence through the notion of value, space, time, erasure, and resistance. There is a large discrepancy in what is considered valuable: on the one had there are the industries and the state continuously choosing economic gain over the preservation of the environment, whereas on the other hand, the land is considered priceless to those who occupy it. This last story which values the environment and these small communities is largely overshadowed, unheard, and pushed aside. However, these communities do resist and are employing many tools of resistance to negate the ‘violence of erasure’ fighting for preservation of their land, their identity, and the environment as a whole. <br/>This project translates these tools into design tools, to formulate a spatial component to aid this resistance. This spatial component is the building of a line that follows the shape of the current coastline. This line makes visible the changing conditions and erasure of its surroundings, protects the land behind it, and hosts different functions to invite people to the frontline, thereby operating as counter narrative, host, and landscape. Through its modular nature it can multiply to different communities facing with land loss, to collectively tell the story of living on the frontline of climate change. When necessary it can be activated, to reach the larger audience and rewrite what is considered valuable.","Resistance; Counter narrative; Climate change; Coastal flooding; Oilscape; Frontline; Erasure; Louisiana; Capitalism; Conflict; Land loss; Sea level rise; Memory trace; Protest architecture; multiplier; Power geometries; Lived experience; Landscape; Collective action; Preservation; Identity; Stewardship; Subsistence; Lived knowledge; Protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Design As Politics","29.388325,-90.482872"

Disused and forgotten by the people not immediately involved with them, post-industrial areas are often left vacated and are quickly falling into ruin. Old factories, empty shopping malls, abandoned villages and creepy hospitals litter the urban fringes of many cities. They form an eyesore for developers and city officials and indeed many have fallen to the sledgehammer. Derelict areas like these, however, prosper in natural life and create a safe haven for people living in the margins of society. Insubordination, informal activities and people, plants and animals of all sorts can roam freely through these areas, creating an in-between zone of both material and psychological value. <br/><br/>My project, the forgotten railway line circling the outskirts of Paris, is one of these invaluable territories of human and animal transgression, an oasis in the urban jungle.

By using a more geometrically based Finite Element Analysis (FEA) type method called ‘Isogeometric Analysis’ (IGA), exact geometry description can be attained, even on coarse meshes. Furthermore, mesh refinement is relatively easy, since no communication with a geometry description is necessary. From a maritime perspective, this method seems to be very interesting. Therefore, a first step towards an all-inclusive IGA framework for potential flow problems of ships and offshore structures is made by using IGA to solve linear free surface waves in a bounded 2D and 3D domain. The goal of this thesis is twofold. The first goal is finding out which of three weak formulations is best suited for further development. The second goal is testing the advantages of IGA in a potential frame work. A secondary goal is testing MFEM, the C++ finite element library that was used. These goals were reached by testing the three formulations on (1) a sloshing wave, (2) an airy wave and (3) a step wave in a square tank of 1 square m and (4) a sloshing wave in a cubic tank of 1 cubic m3with a cylinder in the middle. The first two have analytical solutions that can be used for verification and validation, the last two are used to compare standard FEA with IGA. The three weak formulations are formed by transforming the strong problem definition into three different weak forms. The main difference between these three being the way the boundary conditions are implemented. The first, reduced formulation is formed by combining the free surface boundary conditions, the second, mixed formulation by implementing all three boundary conditions directly and the third decoupled formulation by decoupling the problem into a free surface and an interior part. The first formulation is the simplest, but is hard to extend towards more complicated problems and is therefore used as a reference solution. The mixed and decoupled formulations are more complicated but can be extended. The first two tests showed that the reduced and mixed formulations have identical results. These results were very accurate: the wave period could be calculated accurately for coarse meshes and, very important, energy was conserved perfectly. The results for the decoupled formulation were significantly worse: more refined meshes were needed to calculate the wave period accurately and the energy showed periodic behaviour. The last two tests demonstrated that IGA offers results comparable to FEA for less degrees of freedom. The more difficult geometry of the fourth problem was much better represented by IGA.","Hydromechanics; isogeometric analysis; Finite Element Analysis; Linear; Free Surface; Waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to this fact an opportunity for changing the traditional way of building and maintaining navigational locks has arisen. Because of the replacement/renovation of locks in the coming time, implementing a new owning and building strategy is relatively easy. Rijkswaterstaat is interested in how standardization could be applied to (some) lock components to save costs, and increase reliability and availability. <br/>The lock gates are the lock components with the highest potential for standardization. A parametric model for several lock gates is made in order to compare these gate types for a range of boundary conditions. The comparison of several gate types which can be made by the parametric model, could lead to a prescription of a standard gate type for specific boundary conditions. With this prescription, standardization could be implemented in the design process for navigational lock gates. The parametric model can also be used to assess the impact of design choices on the standard design. A parametric model is made to assess rolling gates and mitre gates (with and without clearance at the pivots) made in steel. The model has led to a way of optimising one design (in terms of steel volume used) per gate type for these gates for a range of boundary conditions. The model is able to prescribe a gate type for the case study used, the Prinses Marijkesluizen. The model is unable to prescribe a gate type for bilateral retaining gates, since the results of the design are too close to each other to prescribe one variant as the best variant. It is recommended to record more data, since costs can be added as optimisation criteria (instead of material volume) when this data is known. <br","Navigational locks; Parametric design; Standardization; Steel navigational lock gates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This amounts to an incentive to look at the influences of the requirements on a design, to better understand how a concept is defined. This thesis investigates the operational architecture concerning how systems are used (often in a temporal fashion). A way to quantify the operational architecture is with operability, which describes the ability of a ship to perform its mission. This thesis identified the system performance consisting of availability and vulnerability part of operability as its main topic. Markov theory was selected to assess the availability of systems in order to maximize the operability of a naval vessel. Transition rates of systems are a key element of Markov theory but are hard to obtain during Early Stage Ship Design. A network-theory-based approach allocated nonquantifiable focus points to each system to determine their importance within a network. These were then linked to transition rates, which are required for a Markov chain to calculate the availability of a system. Four case studies were performed to test the model: several configurations were compared, two different focus points approaches were used, different ranges of rates were applied, and systems were added or subtracted. The model proved to behave according to educated guesses beforehand but also gave new insights in connections between nodes. The eigenvector centrality approach used to allocate focus points was found to be better than the combined connectivity approach. The scale of the ranges of rates should not result in very high values for system availability since they do not provide data which makes comparisons between network configurations possible. Very low values of system availability were deemed too far off from real-life values. This thesis paves the road towards a total assessment of operability. It has focused on the availability of systems, and delivered a method to make preliminary decisions for systems design in the early stages.","Ship Design; Markov Chains; Network Theory; Early stage ship design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

Insights were gathered from multiple sources to analyse the project’s brief and explore its facets. The company’s intention is to create a space in which alignment on product strategy will take place.<br/><br/>Through interviewing employees, a number of problems were identified that could form the focus of this process. The three main frustrations around alignment were: the abstraction of product strategy information, the complexity of product strategy systems, and the top-down communication of product strategy.<br/><br/>Although alignment is a very broad and abstract subject, an image of what it entails could be defined. Alignment is considered to exist out of two aspects: knowledge of interrelations and a shared goal. Between people there needs to be consensus on these two aspects to effectively work as a group. To become aware of the interrelations and the shared goal, communication needs to be organised in a structured way. It was found that many forms and places of communication exist within the company. Literature showed that, although verbal and visual communication are most used in daily routines, physical communication offers collaborative means as well.<br/><br/>Another part of this project’s explorations was that of product strategy. Most companies have their own way of developing and managing product strategy, though those practices are still being explored and instituted at Ultimaker. To establish a structured product strategy a company has to create a clear overview of the systems model. A systems model is the congruence of components and their connections (Wujec, 2015). Ultimaker is currently feeding product strategy components through the product management department to the project teams with tools such as personas, applications, user values, etcetera. Information is gathered internally and externally to setup new projects and continue to feed information to projects under development. In between the product management department and project teams is where the alignment processes are most stressed because of differences in priorities between the groups.<br/><br/>Merging the two concepts of alignment and product strategy resulted in several ideas to create an organised method. The outcome of the ideation phase proposed a physical systems modeling tool to create overviews of projects which can be stored in a War room. The tool enables product management and project leads to define project compositions. Besides, the project compositions can be used as a reference to the projects’ essence throughout the product lifecycle.<br/><br/>The tool aims to increase project awareness, structure discussions, and allow for collaborations on project compositions. Employees are to use a pre-developed, magnetic whiteboard, template and building blocks to create an overview of a project.

From a simple Fourier analysis to more complicated methods such as multiresolution wavelet analysis, such techniques must be used for signal manipulation in order to reach informed conclusions on the measurements taking place.<br/><br/>In neuroscientific research, it is common practice to scan a neural recording manually to label the areas of the signal that are relevant to the research at hand. This can, obviously, be very time-consuming for the researchers. What is more, this method can prove imperfect, seeing as two different researchers can disagree on the labeling of the data.<br/><br/>In every experiment, signal epochs are isolated because they stand out from the rest of the recording due to a special characteristic, which is, in the previous case, visible with the unaided eye. In signal processing terms, this means that the signal displays specific spectrotemporal characteristics during these epochs. Thus, these characteristics can be isolated, quantified and studied independently, while a detection algorithm can be developed so that the detection and labeling of the significant signal epochs can be carried out automatically.<br/><br/>In this project, the spontaneous activity of the neurons in the Prefrontal Cortex was analyzed in relation to neural synchrony, using time-varying ARModels. It was concluded that the signal epochs of neural synchrony display common characteristics besides being visually similar. This allowed the isolation of the synchrony epochs based on model parameters.<br/><br/>However, the training of the models is very computationally intensive, so a detection algorithm was developed, based on a matched filter which made use of one of the isolated epochs as a template. The detection scheme was then validated using a recording harvested during electrical stimulation of the deep brain, evaluating the quality of the scheme was evaluated.<br/><br/>Finally, the detection scheme was applied to stimulation recordings to study the electrical behavior of the Prefrontal Cortex during electrical stimulation of deep brain structures.","prefrontal cortex; neural synchrony; local field potential; biomedical signal analysis; VTA stimulation; change detection; AR modeling; matched filters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Circular Economy is a concept, designed to help solve this problem with a financial and environmental agenda. Combined with a Product to Service model, it can offer new opportunities in resetting the way we see ownership and what should be considered waste. As the combination model of circular lease has started being applied in the market, a lot of questions have arisen about its efficiency and risk allocation between owner and user. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate the aforementioned topics, with a focus on cost, duration and legal aspects, as well as evaluating the role of Circular Economy and whether it affects these topics.<br/>Two case studies were done with the help of four interviews, while a literature research on Circular Economy, Product to Service and relevant legal aspects was conducted. The findings of the theoretical and practical research were compared and used to develop an understanding of risks occurring in circular leases.<br/>This thesis investigates the case where ownership model stays with the manufacturer/supplier. The legal strategy to ensure this is through the right of superficies. This model was chosen as responsibility and ownership are strongly connected and by giving the ownership to the manufacturer/supplier also pushes them to extend the lifecycle of products, minimise the waste during production, reduce the use of raw materials and use secondary materials.<br/>The end result of this research is that the main bearer of risks is the owner of the product. First and foremost, owners have to secure that ownership remain on his/her side. Even though having a constant income during the lease, offers a financial security, the owner must be prepared to pay in case of malfunction and any need occurring from the close maintenance offered to the client. The owner must also take care of the after-end treatment of the product and arrange for a new circle for it. Long duration leases require a strong alliance between owner and client, but also trust that both parties will be able to fulfil their responsibilities. On the client side, they may pay to avoid taking risks, but some risks are still there. The ownership issue is affecting both sides as there is always the risk of bankruptcy. Serviceability-wise the client has to ensure that the level of service is constant through the years and can cover the needs of the client. Committing to same level of needs is a risky move, especially if the type of product is a fast-evolving technology or if the needs of the client are not steady. Finally, the price point is also at risk, in case an intermediate is involved.<br","Circular Economy; Product to Service; Ownership; Cost; Duration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The specific application of the model focuses on representing populations under disaster risk. The aim of the tool is to enable public planning agencies to explore the synthesized households’ location choice under risk and different spatial, financial policy scenarios. The simulated urban system is represented as an agent-based model, where the households are the agents choosing between discrete options to relocate from one house to another. Their choice behavior is built upon a notion, that people make decisions based on regret. This is done with the help of Random Regret Minimization (RRM) model, allowing to capture varying levels of regret (profundity) and enabling incorporating multiple attributes of different dimensionality. Given the agent heterogeneity and the changing availability of the building stock, the choice sets are dynamic. Therefore, the traditional RRM approach would not return stable results: with every new option housing available it would have to be re-calibrated. As a solution, we propose re-interpreting the classical \ac{RRM} model by scaling the beta values by the choice set attribute variance. This allows to represent $\beta$ as a unit-less preference weight, associated with a homogeneous population group.<br/> <br/>We apply the framework to two different scale case-studies in an earthquake-prone area in Groningen province, The Netherlands. The data used for simulation includes several public and private spatial datasets, as well as aggregate level statistical data to synthesize the properties of the households. As a showcase, we applied the simulation assuming homogeneous and equal preference weights for 7 optimization criteria. These criteria relate to static properties of the building stock and household-related dependencies to the network (job, school locations). To further exhibit model usability within public sector agencies, we also apply the model on several financial policy scenarios. The output of which is captured on both aggregate and semi-disaggregate levels, allowing for interactive exploration of the effects of the proposed scenarios. The model outcomes correspond to the expectations set prior to simulation.

The current costs of selection are often considered too high. New, light selection methods−in which a partner is chosen based on a vision instead of a design−are suggested as a solution. However little research has been conducted about how to choose a fitting process to sell municipal land. Therefore the research question of this thesis is: ‘How can decision making regarding selection processes for municipal land sale procedures be improved to decrease transaction costs for public and private parties involved.’ A basic framework for the research was set up by performing a literature study. Subsequently, a document review was conducted and interviews were held to study two specific cases. Additionally, several general examples of processes in competitive land sale procedures that raised transaction costs were explored. The literature review and the empirical review have led to a synthesis that has set the foundation for a framework for municipalities to make improve decision making for the design of competitive land sale procedures. This has led to the conclusion that there is not a single optimal solution. Multiple factors have to be considered in light of the specific case when choosing a fitting process for a competitive land sale procedure. From this research it is deducted that it is advisable to select one process as a starting point based on a balance between goals and transaction costs for the specific plot. From this starting point municipalities can use transaction cost theory to improve cost efficiency of the preferred procedure to come to an optimal selection design for a successful competitive land sale procedure.","Land sale procedures; Urban Area Development; Transaction Costs; Market selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

And the disposal rates are increasing with it, with the absence of any waste infrastructure that can suffice. Global pollution has turned into one of today’s biggest threats for the environment, wild life, and humans. This thesis is specifically focussed on the case of plastic reaching the oceans, and how to turn this problem into value. A methodology has been developed to quantify the feasibility and effectiveness of plastic recovery solutions from oceans, rivers and waterways. It was quickly found that no source has been able to capture the totality of the problem of ocean pollution yet. When looking into feasible and effective solutions, the connection between today’s status of the problem, the potential barriers, and an investigation of its impact proved to be absolutely crucial. For this specific purpose, several models were developed, including a bow-tie model, the Strategic Solution Space (a summary of essential qualitative factors when designing for high impact), and a trajectory study as a foundation for research. These all combined supported the development of a methodology for assessing plastic recovery solutions; incorporated in this approach are a high level technology screening, a qualitative judgement of benefits, and two case studies of the most favourable concepts. Eventually, turning the problem into value is embodied by guidance in design of recovery solutions, identification of the most important parameters and its relations, a description of the willingness-to-pay, and lastly, recommending the greatest needs in scientific research. Altogether, the combined value presents the ultimate incentive to act.<br","Plastic; pollution; mitigation strategies; ocean plastic recovery; micro-plastics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Shipping Management","",""

Flow capacity values are not available from literature nor is a suitable method to determine those values. This research contributes to filling these research gaps, by developing a method to measure capacity, and applying it to case studies. The method also offers a way to calculate the standard deviation of the flow, as well as a confidence interval for the capacity. This is possible because the flow is normally distributed. Knowing the variation of the flow, predictions can be made on how often a queue will emerge. The essence of the method is to measure in an event-based manner, discard the time at which there was no queue before the bottleneck, and then divide the remaining measurements into intervals of equal duration and treat those intervals as individual capacity measurements. The method has shown to yield a capacity value that is independent of the averaging interval. The standard deviation however, does not always vary as independent data from a normal distribution would. It is hypothesised that the autocorrelation could be used to correct for that. 95% confidence intervals for capacity were found as follows; check-in: 21.2 ± 1.2 (σ=3.5), stairs: 24.78 ±0.60 (σ=1.02).","Bicycle storage; Stairs; Check-in; Gate; Capacity; flow variation; Railway stations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is one of them that stands out due to its extended coverage, high penetrability, and high reliability features. Envisaged<br/>long device lifetime and the extended coverage are important aspects of the NB-IoT radio technology that has garnered attention. With the increase in applications to connect a large number of devices over long distances, it becomes crucial for the technology to meet the lifetime expectations set in the standards. However, the empirical lifetime estimations, done as part of this work, indicate that the current devices do notmeet the lifetime estimates targeted in the 3GPP standards, lasting for 2.38 yearswhen exchanging 200 bytes of data at a rate of 1 message per day. Potential solutions include<br/>energy-harvesting to augment the battery lifetime. However, due to the spatiotemporal variation in the amount of energy harvested, the supplemented energy levels will be less than the energy consumption. Therefore, it becomes essential for the sensor device enabled with NB-IoT communication technology to implement energy management techniques to maximize the utility to the application it serves based on its energy situation. Further, the coverage enhancement techniques inbuilt in the technology forms a major contributor to the low device lifetime. With the NB-IoT radio block considered as a ‘black box’ with no access to the software stack, innovative solutions are required to reduce<br/>the energy consumption of sending payloads without losing out on coverage.<br/>To this end, this work proposes a framework called xTEND to increase the utility of the device while being energy-efficient in deep coverage scenarios. In xTEND, the decision to transmit a payload is done by modeling the problem as a 0/1 incremental knapsack problem. A threshold policy is proposed that optimally schedules payloads in a given finite horizon, with a low complexity method to compute it on the device. Furthermore, as the coverage enhancement techniques deplete the battery soon for deep coverage scenarios, we propose to increase the transmission power adaptively based on the channel conditions. The framework is evaluated with an existing scheme in the literature that<br/>performs energy management and is shown to outperform in different traffic distributions. Further, with the framework, an average 3.8 J of energy savings and 8.027 s of time savings is obtained in the shared and control channels of the physical layer. This results in an average lifetime extension of 20 % in deep coverage scenarios. With the only requirement of access to the power amplifier embedded on the NB-IoT chipset, the framework can be implemented on the deployed sensor device.","NB-IoT; energy-harvesting; lifetime extension; Energy characterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The more durable and expensive intervention of the facade as it represents itself towards the city and the cheaper more temporary interior facades that allows for change and engagement. <br/>Mostly the material considerations allows for complementing the time factor of the existing by juxtaposing the rough and damaged concrete structure.

Governments act by introducing sustainability related laws and legislation, stimulating companies to make their products ready for a circular economy. This project aimed at using the benefits of the Internet of Things to design a circular supermarket lighting product-service system for Signify. The result of this design project is StoreSight, a result oriented product-service combination that provides store owners with value that goes beyond the illuminaition of the store only.<br/><br/>Signify already offers circular lighting services (e.g. Light as a Service) in a few segments, but is aiming to also do so in the supermarket segment. However, the length of the refurbishment cycles of the supermarkets hinders Signify to offer Circular Lighting as it is offered in other segments. The length of the refurbishment cycles of supermarkets are often a lot shorter than the technical lifetime of a lighting system. As a result, luminaires are replaced and thrown away despite being in perfectly good condition. <br/><br/>Different academics point out that the Internet of Things (IoT) creates opportunities for circular propositions. The connection of physical objects through the internet enables them to sense their own and their environments status, process this information and interact with their users. These capabilities help service providers to extend the useful life of products, maximise the utilisation of products, loop products through additional use cycles, regenerate natural capital from their products, and make sure these products are used efficiently. Since Signify wants to become a player in the field of IoT and is already equipping its products with sensors and connectivity, there is an opportunity to use this for circular purposes as well.<br/><br/>The result of this design project is the StoreSight concept, a circular result oriented product-service combination that enables the reuse of retail luminaires. Over time, StoreSight will evolve from a service that enhances attractiveness of the store, into service that enhances the shopping comfort and finally into a service that gathers different types of data to enable store optimisation. The StoreSight system roughly consist of three components: hardware, a service squad, and a software platform. The first component, the hardware, consist of a modular lighting grid with movable CE ready luminaires and upgradable sensing devices. The second component, the service squad, consists of the stakeholders from Signify and its partners that will interact with the store owner during the contract period. They will make sure the luminaires will be reused when the store is refurbished. The final element is the platform, a digital software application that enables the different stakeholders to control the lighting and access data about the luminaires from so-called luminaire passports. The StoreSight concept shows how IoT could enable stakeholders to communicate with each other about the luminaires and their remaining value. These insights improve the collaboration of stakeholders in reusing the luminaires in a new lighting plan.<br","Circulair economy; Lighting; Retail; Product Service System; IoT; Internet of Things","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research resulted in a framework consisting of a digital asset and a creative session enabling KPMG consultants and clients to explore the possibilities of blockchain within their value chain. The blockchain technology has gotten more publicity over the last few. The decentralization of data in combination with an immutable ledger seems promising, but will drastically change our existing economies. It will disrupt our economy by ‘taking out the middlemen.’ As value chains will simplify, the blockchain will take over human-tasks. The aim of this research was to explore how this technology could enter our market by looking at stakeholder needs. KPMG Digital Transformation also saw an increased demand of implementing emerging technologies like blockchain. In collaboration with KPMG, the project was executed to find a structural approach for the creation of blockchain based projects. The literature review discusses, the topics design thinking, blockchain, digital transformation and the KPMG strategy. In the exploratory analysis, three analyses were executed from the perspectives of the human, technology and business similar to IDEOs three pillars of design thinking (IDEO, n.d.). From both the literature review as the exploratory analysis, insights were collected. These insights are key for the creation of blockchain applications and focus on three perspectives: technological feasibility, viability in business and human desirability. In the value proposition analysis, 80 public blockchains and 50 permissioned blockchains were analyzed on their customer values. These values were used to bridge the gap between stakeholder needs and a back-end solution such as blockchain. Answering which common blockchain values are important in the creation of a customer benefit statement if we focus on stakeholder needs. And secondly, answering how these values relate to interactions within a digital infrastructure. The tests conclude whether and how a digital infrastructure can be created using the insights (in cards) focusing on feasibility, viability and desirability. This workbook-based assignment was tested with two companies and four groups of consultants on the content and flow. Final Design The final design consists of a combination of a digital asset and the creative session design, meant for KPMG consultants to explore the value of blockchain within a digital strategy with their clients. The digital asset consists of three elements: 1. Blockchain news (on specific industries) and education. 2. A case checker: answering how interesting blockchain is for a specific case. 3. Session preparation, collecting data for the creative session. For the creative session, a workbook was designed consisting of three exploring assignments: finding stakeholder needs &amp; values, creating a customer benefit statement and exploring cases to experience the value of blockchain in a tangible and explorative structure.

The foundation of wind-turbines in the shallow water of the Northern Sea is almost exclusively (over 87%) performed by short rigid monopiles, as an efficient and relatively cheap solution. Scour formation, meaning the soil removal around the pile due to the actions of the waves and currents, is a potential hazard for the functionality and the integrity of the structures supporting the turbines. This thesis investigates the effect of scour formation in the soil-pile capacity and examines the possible contribution of the scour protection layers in the stiffness of the system both under static and cyclic loading. The methodology followed included 18 main static and cyclic centrifuge experiments and 9 basic cyclic numerical analyses. The physical modelling included an aluminum pile, equipped with strain gauges in order to calculate bending moments and ultimately derive the “p-y curves”, which was embedded in a dense dry Geba sand. Numerical analyses have been conducted in PLAXIS 3D, with a symmetrical fully drained model, in prototype scale, with the same set of materials (Geba sand, aluminum pile).<br/>The results have shown that scour formation can diminish the lateral soil capacity in the ultimate limit state (ULS). Scour depth is the most critical characteristic of the scour hole geometry, but the scour width at a specific depth can also make the difference between structure’s integrity and failure. Therefore, the term “local” scour is deemed insufficient, as it cannot be described by a unique geometry. A valid design against scour is recommended to include a series of analyses with combinations of scour depth and width in realistic ranges. Experimental derived “p-y curves” have been compared with the ones proposed by the API method, concluding that the API overestimated both the initial response and the ultimate capacity of the soil reaction. It is proposed to update the existing regulations for the rigid piles and add rotational springs to simulate the effects of the considerable shear developing in the tip of rigid monopiles. The effect of the scour width in the “p-y curves” was observed to be limited in the shallower depth of the pile, as going deeper resulted almost to the same soil response regardless of the type of scour. The cyclic centrifuge experiments focused on the load type, investigating different scenarios of “one-way” and “two-way” load patterns. It was shown that the “one-way” case is more favorable in terms of accumulating deformations compared to the “two-way” case which experienced higher residual displacements, as long as the same maximum load was applied. This was attributed to the smaller dissipation of energy and hence destruction of the soil structure by the “one-way” loading. However, when the maximum load applied in a “two-way” experiment is considerably smaller than the equivalent of the “one-way” test, smaller deformations observed in the “two-way” test, implying the significance of the maximum load. The last section of this thesis, the numerical analyses, focused on the scour protection effect in the mechanical properties of the soil-pile system when subjected to cyclic loading. It was shown that a typical protection layer can highly increase the stiffness of the system and hence decrease the accumulated displacements. The length of the protection layer is not crucial, as change in its magnitude does not alter considerably the reduction of the accumulated displacements, in contrast with the thickness which has a larger impact on the stiffness of the system. It is concluded that scour protection layers can considerably increase the soil resistance around the monopile, allowing for smaller embedment length, so their contribution in the soil-pile stiffness should be taken into account for a more economic design.<br","scour; scour protection; p-y curves; cyclic loading; physical modelling; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-01","","","","","",""

This is achieved through creating a mosaic of ""pockets"" of space; a fixed patchwork of varied characteristics designed to “kick-start” the process of user-appropriation. At the centre of each dwelling, the ornamental embedding of architectural “hardware” empowers its users with a customisable layout; to exercise choice and control in how they wish to connect or withdraw from fellow residents. In material terms, each central unit also acts as an “identity anchor”; providing each dwelling with its own powerful sense of individuality. Applied at larger scales, this combination of general coherency and individual identity, ingrained within a wider mosaic of varied qualities, establishes the forms of space required for successful “opt-in” interactions. Through this, the project seeks to invert the commonly-accepted narrative of scrutinised solitude and forced togetherness to one of restorative solitude and wilful togetherness.","Architecture; Urbanism; Loneliness; Migration; Eindhoven; Smart City; Co-Living; Politics; Appropriation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Design as Politics","51.436142,5.499997"

The fossil fuels era slowly transforms into the era of renewable energy. But what happens to the fossil fuel related industries. This project specifically focusses on the oil industry. Previous energy transitions in the Netherlands have given us much industrial heritage. The windmills of Kinderdijk, the Beemster polder and the mines in Limburg are just a few examples of such industrial heritage. Will the oil industry also give us an element to remember? The PICH Project, which is also included in the research, concluded that with industrial heritage, the physical elements of the site are preserved, but the story that comes with it, is not. Together with the current trend of storytelling and meaning of place, this is implemented in the research and design of the project. Theoretical research tells us that industrial heritage is not easy. Because of its specific and strange structures and elements, and its huge scale it is not an easy task to transform such sites and preserve them as they are. Many sources tell that re-use of such sites is still the best way to preserve them. The Emscher Park in Germany is the most famous example of industrial areas transformed and re-used in a recreational way. This project focusses on the harbour of Rotterdam and specifically on Pernis’ industrial area. Historical development research showed that the harbour grows out of the city towards the sea and Pernis is therefore the next area to transform when this development continues in the future. Pernis is not only the next area facing transformation, it is also the largest oil refinery in Europe and one of the largest in the world. This also gave a challenge in transformation possibilities in the design. To know how to deal with the area and what kind of functions are needed, future perspectives of involved stakeholders were analysed. This showed that population growth and renewable energy were subjects<br/>that occurred frequently in these reports. Therefore, the design for a masterplan contains a residential area and an energy park. The design also shows three possibilities of what a certain area of Pernis could look like in the future.<br/>A variety of images shows three different uses of how to preserve the oil industry of Pernis based on four core values that came out of the earlier research. Because the oil industry is still needed nowadays, and the future is unsure, despite the predictions of the end of oil, these images show a possibility of how to deal with the remains of the oil industry.","Oil; Industrial Heritage; Pernis Industrial Area; Storytelling; Rotterdam Harbour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.88623760000001, 4.354013699999996"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Currently one of the major drawbacks of interplanetary travel is the cost of these types of missions. Mission to extra-terrestrial bodies require a large amount of propellant to complete, which often takes up a large part of the mass budget of the spacecraft. This requires larger launchers to be used to get the spacecraft into the required orbit, which increases the cost of these missions. An often used method to decrease the propellant used during an interplanetary mission is the gravity assist. The gravity assist uses the gravitational influence of a planetary body to increase its heliocentric velocity. This is done by exchanging some of the planets momentum as it orbits the Sun to the spacecraft. The increase in velocity is limited by several factors: the gravitational influence of the body, the closest distance possible between the body and the spacecraft, and the orientation of the planetary bodies relative to each other. A new method has been proposed by McRonald (1990) called the aerogravity assist, which improves upon the gravity assist by increasing the angle over which the spacecraft can turn using the aerodynamic forces it experiences while travelling through the atmosphere of the planetary body. This increase in the velocity bending angle increases the heliocentric velocity compared to the gravity assist, and also allows for changes in inclination of the interplanetary orbit using less propellant. This report investigates both the atmospheric and interplanetary trajectory of the aerogravity assist, and combines them to understand the benefit of the aerogravity assist for interplanetary trajectories.<br/><br/>A modular simulation environment is designed using the TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox to simulate the atmospheric trajectory of the aerogravity assist. This simulator allows the selection of different types of acceleration and environment models. The waverider is selected to be the vehicle used during the aerogravity assist, as it is able to obtain high lift-over-drag ratios which reduce the drag losses during the atmospheric section of the maneuver. The specific aerodynamic characteristics and heating models of the selected vehicle are evaluated and incorporated into the simulator. From this simulation environment, the optimal atmospheric trajectories were investigated using an optimization algorithm. It was found that this specific problem is extremely sensitive to the selected optimization algorithm, the tuning parameters of the optimization algorithm, and the objecive and decision variables that are used. The MOEA/D algorithm was selected to find the optimal atmospheric trajectories for Mars, Earth, and Venus, where the objective variables were chosen to be the atmospheric bending angle and the incoming and out-going inclination difference. It was found that using the angle-of-attack and bank angle as control variables, an atmospheric bending angle of 120.5 degrees and an inclination difference of 0.2 degrees could be obtained at Mars. Using the control action instead of the inclination difference as objective variable at Mars showed that the atmospheric bending could be increased to 151.2 degrees while maintaining an inclination difference of below 3 degrees, and smoothed the trajectory in the process. For Earth and Venus the same optimization scheme was employed. They were able to obtain atmospheric bending angles between 70 and 50 degrees, while obtaining inclination differences below 1.5 degrees. For Venus, the heat load was also optimized instead of the inclination difference and it was found that the peak heat flux decreased by around 1000 W/cm$^2$, while decreasing the atmospheric bending angle by around 10 degrees. <br/><br/>A mission planner was designed to be able to investigate the effect of the aerogravity assist on interplanetary trajectories. To increase the accuracy of this mission planner, the numerically found atmospheric trajectories are used to determine the possible interplanetary trajectories. Pareto fronts were created for Mars, Earth, and Venus for a range of incoming velocities that showed the possible velocity bending angles and out-going velocities that can be achieved using an aerogravity assist. These Pareto fronts were then implemented in the mission planner to determine the influence of the AGA on an interplanetary trajectory. Several different interplanetary trajectories were investigated using both gravity and aerogravity assists. It was found that due to the fact that for Earth and Venus higher velocities are needed to travel through the atmosphere, the aerogravity assist would lose too much velocity and thus not improve upon the gravity assist. However, for Mars an increase was found of 4 km/s compared to the gravity assist for a trajectory to Saturn using fly-by's at Mars and Jupiter. Taking into account the extra mass of the thermal protection system, the decrease of mass was found to be around 60 percent, which could be used to lower the cost of the launcher or increase the scientific output of the mission by adding instruments to the payload.<br","re-entry; Optimization; gravity-assit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In particular, we create an audio data set in which UAV ego-sound and recorded aircraft sound can be mixed together, and apply convolutional neural networks to the task of air traffic detection. Due to restrictions on flying UAVs close to aircraft, the data set has to be artificially produced, so the UAV sound is captured separately from the aircraft sound. The aircraft data set is collected at Lelystad airport by capturing flyovers with a microphone array. It is mixed with UAV recordings, during which labels are given indicating whether the mixed recording contains aircraft audio or not. The mixed recordings are the input for a model that determines whether an aircraft is present or not. The model is a CNN which uses the features MFCC, spectrogram or Mel spectrogram as input. For each feature the effect of UAV/aircraft amplitude ratio, the type of labeling, the window length and the addition of third party aircraft sound database recordings is explored. The results show that the best performance is achieved using the Mel spectrogram feature. The performance increases when the UAV/aircraft amplitude ratio is decreased, when the time window is increased or when the data set is extended with aircraft audio recordings from a third party sound database. It is not desirable to train the model on distant approaches and test them on nearby approaches as the performance then drops. The results also prove that the performance increases the closer the aircraft is. Although the currently presented approach has a number of false positives and false negatives, that is still too high for real-world application, this study indicates multiple paths forward that can lead to an interesting performance. In addition, the data set is provided as open access, allowing the community to contribute to the improvement of the detection task.","Hear-and-avoid; Convolutional Neural Network; Spectrogram; Mel; UAV; MFCC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-06","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This in turn has increased the demand for rental housing, resulting in shortages in both the regulated as well as the unregulated rental housing segments. These shortages are most noticeable for lower and middle income households. The lack of supply for low income households sparked societal debate concerning skewed tenants, resulting changes in national housing policy. However, these regulations caused a further decrease in housing options for the middle income households. <br/>As a result, regional residential visions established by municipalities active in Dudok Wonen’s working area have since then had a strong focus on stimulating filtering processes: middle income households residing regulated rental dwellings should move, to make room for low-income households. To stimulate these filtering processes, housing association Dudok Wonen started to offer an intermediate rental segment (consisting out of ex-regulated rental dwellings) exclusively to middle income households, stating that the largest obstacle for the desired filtering processes is the lack of supply available to middle income households. Dudok Wonen assigned this intermediate rental segment ’50-50’ to starting and filtering middle income households. To examine the effect of this measure the following research question arose, to be answered in this thesis: ‘How do the intermediate rental segment and associated housing allocation procedures which Dudok Wonen offers contribute to the desired filtering processes in the municipalities Gooise Meren and Hilversum?’. <br/>To answer this research question, the residential visions in Dudok Wonen’s working area have been reviewed, and literature concerning the topic of residential mobility has been consulted. The selected research methods can be described as a mixed methods research, and involved a quantitative analysis of the available rental segments Dudok Wonen’s working area, a structured web-survey distributed amongst and answered by 806 tenants in Dudok Wonen’s regulated rental segment dwellings and 9 semi-structured interviews conducted with tenants of dwellings offered in Dudok Wonen’s intermediate rental segment. <br/>The quantitative analysis of rental segments was performed to examine whether the characteristics of intermediate rental segments intended for filtering households complied to the characteristics that Dudok Wonen had envisioned to trigger filtering. The intermediate rental segment dwellings were found to be larger than the regulated rental segment dwellings and to have a more beneficial price/quality ratio than unregulated rental segment dwellings, thereby complying to the goals set by Dudok Wonen. This research has also revealed that a majority of the middle income households residing in the regulated rental segment do desire to move, but that only a minority of these households is interested in the intermediate rental segment. The largest contributor to this lack of interest is the lack of knowledge concerning the segment, but the increase in price (compared to the regulated rental segment) and the lack of diversity in quality aspects in which the segment outranks the regulated rental segment are also culprits. The intermediate rental segment as offered by Dudok Wonen predominantly supplies moving triggers to households that are interested in larger dwellings. It is unlikely that households looking for other quality characteristics will be triggered to move by the addition of the intermediate rental segment. <br/>Households that did move to the intermediate rental segment did so in order to have the option to realise (prospective) life-cycle related goals, like starting a family. Although these households were looking for rental dwellings, this preference is a substitute of their actual desire for owner-occupied housing. This substitution behaviour can be attributed to the contemporary housing market situation and regulations. <br/>Despite this substitution behaviour, the intermediate rental segment, as it is currently being offered by Dudok Wonen, is contributing fairly well to stimulating the desired filtering processes in the municipalities Gooise Meren and Hilversum, as it supplies a portion of the middle income households residing in regulated rental dwellings with triggers to move. With the addition of the intermediate rental segment in the regional housing market, Dudok Wonen is stimulating the desired filtering processes not by pushing households to move, but by lowering the thresholds these households need to overcome in order to move. However, although the addition of the intermediate rental segment is beneficial for the desired filtering processes and the options middle income households have in the regional housing market, the associated housing allocation procedures negatively impact the supply available in the regulated rental segment. This report concludes by posing several recommendations for Dudok Wonen to consider, as well a point of critique towards contemporary Dutch housing policy.<br","Filtering; Housing; Middle-income; Rental; Segment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PVS are fluid-filled spaces surrounding vessels as they enter the brain. Although PVS are normally not noticeable on MRI scans acquired at clinical field strengths, when these spaces increase in size they become increasingly visible and quantifiable. To study these spaces it is important to have a robust method for quantifying PVS. Manual quantification of PVS is challenging, time-consuming and subject to observer bias due to the difficulty of distinguishing PVS from mimics and the large number of PVS that can occur in MRI scans. Many promising (semi-)automated methods have been proposed recently to decrease annotation time and intra- and inter-observer variability while providing more information about EPVS. However there are still various limitations in the current methods that need to be overcome. <br/>An important limitation is that most of the methods are based on elaborate preprocessing steps, feature extraction and heuristic fine-tuning of parameters, making the use of these methods on new datasets cumbersome. Furthermore the majority of the currently proposed methods have been evaluated on small sets of barely 30 images, as most of these methods aim to segment PVS and require voxel-wise annotations for evaluation. In this thesis we propose a method for automated detection of perivascular spaces that combines a convolutional neural network and geodesic distance transform (GDT). We propose to use dot annotations instead of voxel-wise segmentations as this is less time-consuming than fully segmenting PVS while still providing the location of PVS. This enables us to use a considerably larger dataset with ground truth locations than is used in all previously proposed (semi-)automatic methods that provide the location of PVS. We investigated two approaches of using geodesic distance transform to optimize the CNN to detect PVS. The first approach focuses on optimizing the CNN for voxel-wise regression of the geodesic distance map (GDM) computed from the dots and the intensity image. The second approach aims to predict segmentations of the PVS using a CNN that is trained on approximated segmentations obtained by thresholding GDMs. We use 1202 proton density-weighted (PDw) MRI scans to develop our methods and 1000 other scans are used to evaluate the performance of the methods. We show that our methods match human intra-rater performance on detecting PVS without the need for any user interaction. Additionally we show that GDMs are extremely useful for capturing complex morphologies when computed from dot annotations. Our experiments indicate that GDMs can be used to provide valuable additional information to CNNs during training.","Deep learning; perivascular spaces; detection; geodesic distance transform; dot annotations; weighted loss","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is also the case for TU Delft. The sustainable advancement requires renewable energy sources that do not require fossil fuels. The wastewater flow is currently not utilised as a renewable energy source at the TU Delft campus. Thermal energy is 80% of the total energy embedded in wastewater. In order to increase the amount of green energy that is produced on campus, it is useful to analyse the possibilities regarding the thermal energy recovery from wastewater.<br/>This study aims to give substantiated recommendations towards TU Delft, about how this currently dissipated flow can be used to generate energy. The main research question this research aims to answer is: “How can thermal energy recovery from wastewater contribute to the TU Delft campus?”<br/>This main research question could be answered through literature reviews and three case studies, whereafter and implementation followed. First, an understanding of energy recovery from wastewater should be gained. Based on the conclusion that thermal energy carries the most potential in a wastewater flow, different technologies on different scales were defined. This lead to a toolkit that could be used in further analyses. It was used in the three case studies that followed. This provided further insight into how the technologies on different scales on university campuses can be implemented. Locations at the TU Delft campus have then been reviewed and potential interventions have been pointed out. The results showed that small and medium scale interventions at selected locations are possible. Projects on a larger scale would not be feasible on the campus.<br/>Further research could be conducted to extend the toolkit and make a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Installation and maintenance costs should be evaluated in order to make the recommendations economically feasible.","thermal energy; energy recovery; wastewater; sustainabilty","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.001667, 4.3725"

Heat pumps are becoming increasingly more efficient<br/>which decreases energy consumption. However as heat pumps are getting increasingly more efficient, complexity is also increasing which leads to failures.<br/><br/>GEA is one of Europe’s largest providers of industrial heat pumps, delivering a variety of different industrial heat pumps for food production, breweries, waste heat recovery, and thermal power plants. As industrial heat pump systems are becoming increasingly complex, so is the task of detecting faults<br/>in the systems. Whenever a heat pump breaks down it is challenging to see what the reason for the failure is without visual inspection. A typical service engineer will have data from over 20 sensors, each<br/>with over two and a half million measurement intervals, to inspect and look for the cause of failure. Visual inspection of the heat pump systems can only be done by experienced engineers who knows<br/>exactly what to look for and where to look for it.<br/><br/>As heat pumps have been developing so has the sensor technology and computational resources available in modern computers. Over the last decades the price of sensors has decreased rapidly while the capability and reliability of sensors has improved. The computational power of modern computers has increased significantly while the price for these resources has decreased. <br/>Several other industries have, with the development in sensor technology and computational power, investigated the possibilities of implementing Fault Detection &amp; Diagnosis (FDD) programs to automatically<br/>analyze sensor data in order to detect failures and diagnose the failure cause. FDD programs were previously limited to critical processes, for example power plants, aerospace, or national defence. They<br/>were expensive programs due to the sensor requirements, the computational resource requirements and the development costs. However, as the price of sensors and computational resources has been<br/>decreasing, FDD is becoming increasingly more popular for less critical equipment. For the past two decades FDD programs have been developed for different Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC&amp;R) equipment with a special focus to refrigeration.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a FDD program for GEAs industrial heat pump systems. Following a literature study it was concluded that thus far, FDD programs have not been utilized for heat pump systems of this complexity. It was seen that most FDD programs use a quantitative, qualitative or process history based approach to detect faults. Quantitative FDD programs aim to design a digital twin of the system at hand based on physical relations, and compare measured values to defined values for<br/>faulty or fault-free operation. Qualitative FDD programs aim to mimick the behaviour of system experts and base decisions on previously seen failures and cases. Process history based FDD programs aim<br/>to learn how systems should ideally behave through an abundance of operational data, and compare systems to sampled data.<br/><br/>The FDD program for GEA uses a qualitative approaches for all faults where expert knowledge is available. For faults not seen before, a process history based approach classifies operation as faulty or<br/>fault-free. The complexity of the faults and the system do not allow for a quantitative FDD program. A predefined list of in total 23 faults was agreed upon, the FDD program further aims to detect all 23 failures and diagnose the failure cause.<br/>The project is meant as a proof of concept for GEA. By proving that an off-line FDD program is possible, GEA can ultimately implement the algorithms used in this off-line FDD program in to the control system of the heat pumps to increase the reliability of their heat pumps and detect faults as they are occurring.","Heat pumps; Fault Detection; Failure Prediction; GEA; Industrial applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-03","","","","","",""

At the moment, one of the promising designs is the transmon qubit, which is a superconducting qubit is the focus of this work. In order to analyze and design different components of a quantum chip, an understanding of the circuitry is required. By varying the circuit parameters, one can design the system according to requirements by constructing the required physical geometry that incorporates the design parameters. In this thesis work, part of the focus was to understand the transmon qubit circuit parameters, extract the circuit parameters such as capacitances from a physical geometry, build analytic and numerical 3D FEM models. Using a circuit model of the qubit system, the interdependence of the resonators that connects qubits with each other can be studied. Their resonances play a role in the qubit Hamiltonian and can be estimated by constructing accurate simulation models. This problem statement has been dealt with in the thesis work by constructing a hybrid circuitry of standard circuit components and 3D FEM simulated qubit unit cells. The quality factor of the measurement readout resonator of a qubit system needs to be characterized in a qubit system in order to target the rate and resolution at which the measurements can be done. In order to do so, the circuit parameters that affect the quality factor needs to be investigated.

To be able to provide real-time results, we need to incrementalize the type checker. This way, when a program changes, we only need to recalculate results for the changed portion of the program, and everything that depends on it. In this thesis, we discuss how we used IncA to implement a type checker for Rust. IncA is a domain specific language for the definition of incremental program analyses: analyses written in IncA are automatically incrementalized. We show in our evaluation that our type checker updates results significantly faster than its non-incremental counterpart.

An additional effect in regional PT is the increase of undesirable boundaries between train and bus, e.g. in the form of non-aligned tariffs and bad interchange possibilities. The goal of a multimodal concession is to abolish these boundaries and establish an integrated PT system by tendering regional train and bus simultaneously. When the organisational part of integration is established this way, it becomes possible establish operational integration, which is defined as the alignment of the networks, schedules, information, tickets &amp; tariffs, and Traffic Control of regional train and bus. Our analysis shows that internal coordination (in a multimodal concession), set against cases where integration is arranged by a contract or a partnership, indeed leads to more focus and better tuning of most of the five levels. In a particular case, on balance passengers are offered a better aligned PT system and the operator can operate more efficiently. However, not in each case a multimodal concession is most suitable and the risks for operators are large. Besides that, the implementation often is a difficult process.

In this thesis three data types are used which are collected by Unilever, review data which is text that contains the opinion of a customer towards a specific product. Social data, which can be tweets, Facebook messages, Instagram messages etc. and phone data which is a summary of a phone call of a customer about a specific product. <br/><br/>When conducting sentiment analysis one solution is to extract features from the data which can be given to a machine learning algorithm together with sentiment labels given by human annotators.

Due to its distinct physical and chemical properties (highly oxygenated, chemically reactive), the possible range of stable and clean operation in combustion devices is smaller than for petroleum fuel and to enable use of pyrolysis oil in a wider range of applications more insight in pyrolysis heating an evaporation behaviour is required. A surrogate oil of 6 discrete components (water, acetic acid, hydroxypropanone, phenol, eugenol and levoglucosan) is formulated to represent certain aspects of the real pyrolysis oil for computational means. A liquid phase thermal polymerization reaction is formulated to investigate the eect this reaction on the evaporation process. In this reaction, levoglucosan undergoes a dimerization reaction to form a solid dimer. For the evaporation, the Rapid Mixing Model (RMM) is applied, which (mainly) assumes innitely fast liquid phase thermal conductivity. The RMM is adapted for the multicomponent case and the evaporation process is numerically solved for a single stagnant droplet with initial diameter of 100 m in still air (T1 = 800K, p1 = 1 atm). Results of both the model without and with polymerization reaction show continuous variations of the mass fractions of individual components and (pure species) thermophysical properties. At the early stage of evaporation most of the vapor contains the lighter components, i.e. water, acetic and hydroxypropanone. At the end of the vaporization process, only levoglucosan is left in the drop. Furthermore, the results show that the multicomponent fuel does not match the d2 law; there is a high evaporation rate during early evaporation process, while a slower evaporation rate is observed in the further process. Validation with literature experimental data of a real BPO shows a disagreement in trend between model and experiment, with experiment showing a more rapid decrease of diameter over time. However, a better agreement with an experiment on a two-component fuel is observed. To improve the qualitative and quantitative predictions of evaporation rate, a model including gradients inside the droplet and representing the eects of internal bubbling would be required. The model including the polymerization reaction predicts that the eect of the proposed reaction of levoglucosan is very small, with only 0.4% lower evaporated mass of levoglucosan.","Biomass pyrolysis oil; Surrogate oil; Rapid mixing evaporation model; Thermal polymerization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the evolution in flight of various birds is specialized to increase the flight performance of the bird in the adopted habitat. The bird flight in a macroscopic point of view has been a topic of research for a long time now. A few researchers in the past have looked into the microscopic structure and have recommended further studies in the aerodynamic significance of the microstructure. The coupling of the microscopic structure on the overall aerodynamics of the bird wing is not significantly studied or known. The current project extends the understanding of dynamics of flow of air around the micro-structure present in a feather section of a Multi slotted wing. Here, the motivating researches done in the past and helpful facts are detailed to make a clear picture of the project in hand. In the course of the present project we use a structural model of a feather section from a Multi slotted wing tip of a Western jackdaw. The experimentation in this project is done by the use of computational fluid dynamics toolbox called openFoam. The experimentation is designed as a list of possible variations of microstructural morphology of the feather section. The trends in the preliminary results are used to further identify the course of later experiments to relate specific regimes of bird flight. The primary goal of the project was to study the influence of vane asymmetry, vane porosity and feather roughness on aerodynamic coefficients. Further detailed view of the fluid dynamics of such a feather section is presented and compared with the observations at the Animal flight lab, Lund University, Sweden. The primary outcome of this project is to show that the micro-structure indeed has an effect on the flow characteristics and the variation of the micro-structure would lead to variation in the aerodynamics of the feather. The final outcome would be synthesis of a hypothesis related to influence of micro-structure of the feather based on the subjected variations in the feather morphology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Riva, R.E.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In this report a first assessment is made of the impact of hurricanes on Saint Martin. Two bays at the east coast of Saint Martin, Baie Orientale and Baie de L'Embouchure, are studied under the conditions of hurricane Irma and Maria, which both have passed over in September 2017. During these hurricanes the bays were exposed to large wind speeds up to 40 [m/s]. Also the bays were subject to runoff due to large rainfall. The runoff has been flowing into the bays as fresh water, but also as high saline waters. This due to the salt ponds which are located in the region. <br/> <br/>The model has been run in Delft3D and as result large wind-setup driven circulations were obtained. These circulations caused a drop of waterlevel during Irma and an increase under Maria. The saline and fresh waters discharged during the hurricanes were mostly kept onshore and is distributed over the two basins.<br","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","SCENES","18.080603,-63.018246"

(mentor); Konstantinou, T. (mentor); Romein, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Netherlands faces climate change due to global warming and earthquakes due to gas production. To decrease both earthquakes and CO2 production, the government aims to half the gas production in the coming four years and aims for an entire stop by 2030. Over 80% of Dutch houses are heated with gas; 20% were built in the late post-war era (1960-1974) and these houses consume the most gas due to low levels of insulation. As most of these houses are very similar in construction they have a high potential for large scale refurbishment strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create three strategies with each a different level of improvement, applicable to multiple building types of late post-war era houses. <br/>A row house was used to develop and test the strategies and a semi-detached and a free-standing house were used to test the versatility. Testing was performed with Design Builder and Uniec 2.2, both energy performance programs. Based on a literature review and analysis of the case study, the strategies developed were a basic insulation strategy (A), Energy Performance Coefficient (EPC) ≤ 0,4 strategy (B), and a Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) strategy (C). Strategy A consists merely of basic insulation techniques and the upgrading of old heating systems, which lowers gas consumption with roughly 50% and has a payback time of roughly 15 years. The second strategy aims to lower the EPC to 0,4 or less as is required for newly built houses and consists of higher-level insulation techniques and the use of solar power for heating and electricity. This decreases gas consumption with roughly 75%, electricity consumption with over 45%, has a payback time of roughly 15 years, and a better balanced investment vs. yearly savings. Strategy C adds exterior insulation and installs a hybrid electric boiler, an air heat pump, and solar collectors resulting in a (nearly) NZEB and gas-free house. A very large investment is required for this strategy but the approximate 20 year payback time makes it worthwhile. <br/>The free-standing house was very similar in construction and the three strategies can easily be applied. Strategy A showed similar results, and remarkably both B and C showed both a higher reduction and shorter payback time than with the row house. With strategy C a NZEB could easily be achieved. The semi-detached house has an a-typical construction, monumental status, and air heating system and would require a specific strategy focussing on internal insulation and complete replacement of the heating and ventilation system. <br/>In conclusion, typical post-war era houses can easily be refurbished with these three strategies whereas a-typical houses will require a specific strategy. From a long-term societal perspective, I recommend the NZEB strategy. From the homeowner’s perspective, the EPC ≤ 0,4 strategy is probably the best achievable given the required investments. If we really want to reduce global warming and reduce gas consumption, major steps still have to be taken by the government and industry. <br","Refurbishment; Sustainability; Strategies; post-war housing; Climate design; Gas-free; Net-Zero Energy Building; sustainable design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The strategy to reach this target consists of the ambition to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels. However, due to uncertainties involved in the decision making on the implementation of CO<sub>2</sub> reducing measures, shipowners are uncertain which actions to take regarding their existing fleet in order to deal with those upcoming requirements.<br/>For rail transport, road transport and inland waterway transport, TNO has developed the Multi-level Energy Optimization tool (MEO). For these modalities, MEO is capable of calculating the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for a certain voyage and assessing the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> reducing measures on the carbon footprint of those voyages. The objective of the research presented in this report is to extend TNO's MEO tool with the maritime modality and develop a tool supporting shipowners in the decision making process regarding the pathway of implementing CO<sub>2</sub> reducing measures in sea-going vessels.<br/>The tool presented in this report is developed to meet this objective and is based on a Markov Decision Processes (MDP) model. The MDP method has the ability of optimizing a time dependent decision policy in the face of uncertainty. In this case, the optimal policy resulting from the MDP model is optimized to obtain the highest cost savings by implementing CO<sub>2</sub> reducing measures. For the input of the model, the vessel has to be described by an operational profile and the vessel and engine specifics such as a speed-load curve and the propulsive efficiency. Also, the environment has to be described by fuel properties, economical parameters and a regulatory framework. With this input, the MDP method can assess the optimal policy regarding the implementation of a set of CO<sub>2</sub> reducing measures with the objective of minimizing costs. The output of the tool consists of the expected values of total costs, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency for when the optimal policy is followed, in comparison to maintain the business as usual.<br/><br/>To put this tool in practice, a case study has been carried out on a 93000 DWT bulk carrier of which operational data has been provided by the shipowner. A data analysis on the daily reports of the vessel has been done to obtain the values for the vessel input and literature has been used for the environment input. The optimal policy for a set of measures is assessed and the influence on the results by varying fuel prices, the regulatory framework and the dry dock schedule has been studied. The key result of the case study is that with the implementation of several fuel saving measures and a dual fuel engine the total costs with respect to maintaining the business as usual is expected to be reduced by 12%. Also, the total accumulated carbon emission reduction over 15 years is expected to be 29% and the CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency is improved by 45% without having to reduce the speed of the vessel.<br","Maritime; Low carbon shipping; CO2 reduction; Markov Decision Processes; Decision support tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The performance of Anaerobic membrane bioreactor, photobioreactor and constructed wetlands in treating ESBL-E.coli and CRE-E.coli was evaluated. The results showed ESBL-E.coli and CRE-E.coli removal efficiencies of 99.82% and 99.69% for AnMBR, 99.62% and 99.86% for PBR and 98.1-99.3% for constructed wetlands respectively. Log10 reduction values of 2.7-3 for AnMBR, 2.8-3.2 for PBR and 1.82.3 for CWs was achieved in this study. Coupling micro-aeration with AnMBR improved the removal efficiency by 36-46%. A quantitative microbial risk assessment showed probability of infection by Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC O55) post treatment to be reduced below 10-18% for AnMBR and PBR and below 20-35% for CWs. Treated effluents accounted for a high reduction in the total DALYs pppy by 63% for PBR, followed by 41.6% for AnMBR and 12.5% for CWS. ESBL-E. coli and CRE-E.coli counts decreased below the monitoring level of 103-105 for unrestricted irrigation and 104-105 for restricted irrigation as declared by WHO.
