The company has been making work boot for over 100 years and are still in the USA one of the top brands in the industrial footwear industry. Over the years they expanded their business in hunting, hiking and lifestyle. In 2000 the heritage collection was introduced in the European lifestyle market under the name of Red Wing Shoes. The collection consists of work boot inspired styles that resemble iconic styles from the past. Unfortunately these styles are mainly perceived as shoes for the winter. Therfore the goal of this project was to improve the product offer during the spring/summer season. The stitchdown was designed as a lightweight, more flexible and comfortable shoe for the spring/summer season. There is a demand for a more sartorial modern look, as the trend of work style boots is passing. The stitchdown will speak to a younger target audience (25 to 35yrs) that is growing into a more adult lifestyle with a new job and new priorities. They will be making more conscious choices and are looking for their own place in the world. This group is in this report described as the next phaser. The target of the Stitchdown will be to convey a more easy going look suitable for multiple occasions, as the next phaser is hesitant to buy the more classic work styles. This shoe will introduce them to the brand, which gives the opportunity to nurture them to become a core consumer.","Footwear; Red Wing; Shoes; Strategy; Fashion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-01-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

One question that needs to be asked, however, is whether it is feasible and desirable to completely evacuate the high-rise building in fires. This research seeks to remedy this problem by proposing one or more efficient egress plan(s) for high-rise buildings. Investigation into a number of Dutch projects, international fire codes and state-of-the-art literature laid the foundation for this study. Four egress plans have been presented from a worldwide perspective for a specific certain building: Koningin Julianaplein in The Hague, the Netherlands. At least ten egress possibilities have been presented with respect to different fire scenarios. Assessment results of all egress possibilities suggest that partial evacuation appears to be the most appropriate strategy for Koningin Julianaplein, which results in a reduction in egress time by as much as 50% (defend-in-place) and 43% (relocation). While for office towers under relatively high occupant loading, phased evacuation has positive effect on the egress efficiency in comparison with traditional simultaneous evacuation.","high-rise buildings; building fires; egress; fire safety; evacuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-28","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology and Physics","",""

We furthermore use this analysis to improve data ownership and data interoperability on the Social Web through the use of a distributed data storage method and an ontology capable of representing all information that is commonly found on the Social Web. Following that, a design is made in which these two improvements are incorporated, showing that a Social Web using these improvements is technically feasible and interesting for use in practice.","social web; functionalities; data ownership; data interoperability; data storage; ontology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","Information Architecture","",""

Typical architectural qualities such as ‘dynamism’, ‘harmony‘, ‘lightness’ are often guiding themes in the de- sign, but hardly ever experienced in reality when the design has been built. Especially the notorious grand schemes of sixties and seventies, intended to give lots of open green space and fresh air to its inhabitants, are experienced differently — nowadays people mostly experience them as unsafe and cheap. Luckily, there are also some examples of designs that are able to bring about positive experiences in its visitors, some of which are included in this research. The fact that many designs do not afford a positive experience is the problem that is addressed in this project, of which this written research is a part. It is due to a lack of knowledge of experience and a decent method for designing an architectural experience that designers fail in their attempts to create a positive experience.

To achieve integration, one might distinguish between integration of process and product. This paper reports a quantitative study into the relationship between process requirements based on the collaborative design process and the level of integration of the architectural and climate design of a building. This study continues previous work of Prins and Kruijne (2011). Their definition of design integration is reformulated and their set of twelve criteria has been re-examined and adapted. This research provides evidence as of how to operationalize integration, as a ‘soft’ architectural quality. Through a questionnaire the design process of 168 projects was analysed focusing on several process requirements in terms of intensity of collaboration and the very nature of the collaboration of architects and climate installation engineers. Using logistic regression modelling, three process requirements (i.e. the moment of involvement of the engineer during the project, the architect as project manager during the initiative phase, and the ambition of the client) were found to significantly explain the level of integration of the architectural and climate installation design of projects. These requirements emphasise the importance of the initiative phase of the project in relation to the finally obtained level of product integration.","design management; integration; architectural quality; collaboration","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Architectural Design Management","",""

(mentor); Voortman, H.G. (mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor)","2013","The Nederrijn and Lek are presently dammed by three weirs, build in 1960 till 1970, which are located near the village of Driel, Amerongen, and Hagestein after which they are named. Weir Driel regulates the distribution of water at the IJsselkop for dammed conditions (discharges lower than 2350 m3/s at Lobith). A minimum discharge of 285 m3/s has to be diverted into the IJssel by weir Driel for the fresh water supply of the northern part of the Netherlands (the section of the Netherlands which is located above the fictive line Amsterdam-Nijmegen) and for generating sufficient draught for commercial shipping. The weirs Amerongen and Hagestein regulate the upstream water levels for commercial shipping; minimum levels of +6.0 m NAP respectively +3.0 m NAP are maintained by these weirs. The water levels of the IJssel decrease to 1 metre or lower when weir Driel fails in dry summers which results in an obstructed waterway for commercial shipping and an insufficient fresh water supply to the northern part of the Netherlands. ARCADIS made an assessment for the reliability and availability of the weirs in the framework of the project RINK-SSC (Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken Sluis Stuw Complexen). The assessment indicated that the weirs do not meet the reliability and availability norms for the present situation and that structural parts of the weirs have exceeded their technical life span. Therefore, the weirs need to be renovated or replaced within ten years from now. Furthermore, a secondary problem statement is present which concerns the application of Systems Engineering for large scale design projects. Presently, a major ‘transition’ of the substantiation of design choices made in the political domain and design choices which are made by engineering firms, which are based on the Systems Engineering methodology, is present. Design choices made before the ‘transition’ are not well traceable and results in ambiguities during the design process. This graduation research is focused on the replacement of the existing weirs. The weirs could be replaced at the same location, but a broader scope is chosen within the graduation research. The aim of the graduation research is providing an alternative design for the present canalization taking into account the changed environment and use of the waterway. This goal is reached by designing an alternative for canalization using a design methodology based on Systems Engineering (SE). Therefore, a methodology for the application of SE for large scale hydraulic projects is developed and tested for the design of the recanalization. The developed methodology is also applied at large scale design choices for interventions in the present ‘wet infrastructure’ which are, in fact, normally made in the political domain. A toolset is composed from the toolbox of SE methods for the development of the alternative design. The design is elaborated in five sequential design levels. The first design level starts at delta level, the second continues at Nederrijn-Lek level, the third proceeds at the weir location level, the fourth considers the weir build-up, and the structural design of the gates is made for design level five. The gates are designed using fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) which is a self-imposed secondary goal for the graduation research. A small requirement set is developed for each design level in order to obtain a well-structured and clear design method which is applicable for large scale hydraulic design projects. The result of the research is an alternative design of the present canalization. The Nederrijn and Lek are chosen for recanalization due to the lowest impact for the implementation of the recanalization with respect to the other rivers. It is possible to canalize the Nederrijn and Lek using two weirs when the reach located in between the Amsterdam Rijnkanaal and the Lekkanaal is downgraded to a recreational river. The upstream weir is located near the village of Driel and has to maintain the present dam regime to reduce the implementation works and time. The downstream weir is located at a floodplain near the village of Culemborg and has to regulate a minimum upstream level of +5.0 m NAP. The weir is subdivided in three gaps of 41 metres wide each. Three FRP submerged segment gates have to control the discharge and the upstream water levels of which an impression is given in Figure 1. The gates are composed of sandwich panels and four shear webs which are located in between the panels. The application of separate design levels with a limited set of requirements each turned out to be applicable for large scale hydraulic design projects for the first four design levels. So, the SE methodology could also be applied for decision making on a large scale which are normally made in the political domain. A well-structured and clear design methodology is obtained, which performed well for these levels. The method had to be adjusted for the structural design level (level five) because the set of requirements exponentially expands which results in a non-clear design method. Furthermore, using a functional analysis for the structural design results in a non-meaningful definition of the functions of the elements.","weir design; dam regime design; Systems Engineering; canalization; fibre reinforced polymer structures; fibre reinforced polymer gates; FRP; river engineering; hydraulic structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Rommens, O. (mentor); Jennen, P. (mentor)","2013","In the Msc3 semester the relation between spatial experience and navigation is being investigated. The new technology like GPS, smartphones and interactive maps (Google, Bing etc.) effects the way we move trough space and how we experience the space. We are directed trough space with a GPS instead of analyzing the space by our self and decide de route based on what is seen and experienced. The Interactive maps allow us to perceive a space from multiple perspectives and scales. At the same time a group research was done about the periphery of Madrid. A 15 kilometre strip of illegal housing along a historic cattle trail was found and investigated in the theme of accessibility. The individual research about navigation is reflected on the group work. An investigation is done about the meaning of navigation in the specific area of the Cañada Real. The focus is pointed at the infrastructural intersections with the Cañada Real. Mappings are being made of the multiple perspective experience of three infrastructural intersections with the Cañada Real. In the Msc4 semester the relation between the top down and the bottom up perspective and the spatial experience is being investigated by a further spatial analysis of one of the three intersections. From the route which is taken several spatial conditions are isolated and analysed. By the isolation of the spatial conditions a spatial lexicon is developed as a tool for design. The spatial elements are being studied by reconfiguration and exaggeration. The proposed site is an area where different infrastructural systems and with this different navigation systems meet. The existing systems and territories in this are being mapped. Based on this map focus points are being discovered where two ore more systems meet or intersect. As a design concept interventions are being created on three of these points to reconnect the Cañada Real with the existing infrastructure and neighbourhoods. These interventions are built up from the spatial elements which were investigated. One of these interventions is picked to work out further on an architectural scale. With these interventions the Cañada Real gets more connected with its surrounding in a physical and visual manner. These connections can be the start of the acceptance and integration of this exceptional area in the periphery of Madrid.","multiple perspective; Cañada Real Madrid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-11","Architecture","Public Building","","Border Conditions","",""

(mentor); Brügemann, V.P. (mentor); Sundaramoorthy, P.P. (mentor)","2013","The Dutch city of Gorinchem has great economic growth opportunities for the future, but is limited by its transport system. It is strategically located at a crossroad of two motorways and two rivers, the Boven-Merwede and the Linge. Gorinchem is home to a number of multinationals, among others Damen Shipyards and Van Oord. This sets the right conditions for economic growth. However, the city roads are congested and the limited accessibility of the area by train and car slows this economic growth. Therefore, a solution is required to make Gorinchem more accessible. The development of an aerial network is an approach that could comply with the vision of the city as an innovative regional business centre. This project, called Heliport Gorinchem, aims to provide a final design for an aerial logistic network that can be implemented in Gorinchem in the year 2020. The project consists of three main parts: the project initiation and definition, a conceptual design part, and a detailed design part. This report contains a review of the project initiation and definition, and the conceptual design part. The main focus of this report is on the detailed design part of the project. The aim of the project initiation and definition is to structure the project, come up with a time management plan and organise the group. Also, the requirements and constraints for the project are set. The goal of the project is to design a concept for a sustainable logistic network of multi-purpose aerial vehicles in Gorinchem, competitive with the current transport market, within ten weeks. A market analysis is performed after the project initiation, to identify the traffic problem in Gorinchem on a local and regional scale. Locally, the city has three connection points to the motorways and these points form the entry and exit of the city. The capacity of the roads to these points is too low for the traffic they have to handle. It is estimated that there is an overload of 4000 travellers per hour during rush hours. On a regional level, a connection with a railway to the north and south of the country fails to appear and there is no aerodrome near Gorinchem to have any connection by air. The outcome of the conceptual design part is a concept for an operational aerial network. To come up with ideas for possible concepts for the network, multiple brainstorm sessions are held. A selection procedure is executed in order to reduce the amount of possible concepts and to come up with a final concept for the detailed design part of the project. From this, a combination of a linear local and a linear regional network is selected. The verification of the conceptual design has led to the conclusion that an aerial network alone will not solve the traffic problem entirely at this moment. However, there is a demand for a better accessibility and economic growth in of the city. Therefore the aim of the project is altered into a new vision. The goal of the aerial network is to serve economic growth of the city. An aerial network will allow Gorinchem to improve its accessibility to important locations, while becoming an important link in the aerial infrastructure of the Netherlands. The aim is therefore to implement an aerial network before 2020. In the short term, up to 2030, the goal is to realise a profitable aerial network. In the years thereafter an expansion of the aerial network will allow for an improvement of the traffic situation in Gorinchem. This is the aim of the long-term vision. The detailed design part elaborates on the design of all aspects of the aerial network in the short term, while keeping its long-term development in mind. The main customers are identified to be business travellers. Other smaller markets are determined as well, like tourism, medical assistance and governmental flights. The aerial vehicle for the short term is selected to be an Eurocopter EC135 helicopter that makes use of a hybrid engine and noise reducing technology. The helicopter should operate under visual flight rules to limit the investment costs. The aerodrome is designed to be a self-sustaining heliport with a low investment cost of 750,000 euro for the landing site. For the location, the industrial estate Avelingen at the edge of the suburbs is chosen. It has a direct connection with the motorway and can be linked with the future railway from Breda to Utrecht. Furthermore, it is located at the Boven-Merwede river which has an extra advantage. An approach route for helicopters will minimise the environmental impact regarding noise and safety. A business model for the aerial network has been developed and analysed. Unfortunately, the business model shows that it will not be profitable in the short term to set up a transport service for business travellers. The main reasons for this are the high maintenance costs of the vehicle, call out costs, and airport charges. From the conducted research, it can be concluded that it is possible to realise a heliport in Gorinchem and start its operations in the year 2020. Although the implementation of a profitable aerial network seems currently not feasible, it is reasonable to invest in the construction of a heliport as there is demand for a heliport in Gorinchem. It is advised to develop a heliport that allows companies like Damen Shipyards and Van Oord to use the facilities with their own helicopter. Furthermore, this will be a first and innovative step in the development of a regional aerial network, which provides fast and high quality transport. This can offer Gorinchem the opportunity to take a leading role in aerial transportation on a regional scale in the Netherlands . Furthermore, it will support the economic growth of the city. Further research should focus on the design of a new aerial vehicle. It is recommended that maintenance and fuel cost are reduced for the new aerial vehicle in order to make the aerial network profitable. Other research should focus on the expansion of the aerial network and find alternative locations with low landing charges. In this way, the high landing fees at the airports can be avoided and the possibility to make a profitable aerial network will increase. It is recommended to perform a market analysis on the willingness to pay of the future business travellers and other markets. This will have influence on the income of the business model. In the best case scenario, the design can even become profitable in the short term.","Design Synthesis Exercise; Aerial logistic network; Heliport","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport and Operations","","","",""

(mentor); Ottele, M. (mentor); Geldermans, B. (mentor)","2013","The main objective of the thesis is to develop a design for a vertical green facade with integrated wastewater treatment. Vertical green systems provide a highly versatile type of facade that upgrades equally the building and it’s surroundings. The lack of quantitative benefits though, limit the motives for installing green facades to aesthetical and ideological reasons. The integration of wastewater treatment would provide a cost-benefit analysis for the green facades through the reduction of water consumption. In the first part of this thesis, the theoretical background, it becomes clear that the treatment of the less polluted streams of domestic wastewater (greywater) is a more acceptable and efficient way of reusing wastewater that can cover the demand for not potable water in the urban environment. Furthermore, through the literature review it is explained how constructed wetlands treat wastewater with the use of saturated soils (a mix of sand and gravel) and plants and why vertical subsurface flow (V-SSF) wetlands are the most efficient constructed wetlands. The V-SSF are selected to become the example for the water treatment procedure that will be followed in this thesis. Their interior structure and the removal mechanisms that take place are analysed and represented in a typical section that will be the starting point of the design development. Furthermore, an overview of the types of vertical green facade systems makes clear that the domestic wastewater treatment is possible through the integration of the V-SSF principles in a living wall system (LWS). This is achieved through the horizontal segmentation of a V-SSF into smaller parts and the creation of a new network with vertical distribution similar to that of a LWS. The demand of the vertical distribution for materials with low weight extended the search for an appropriate substrate to the field of horticulture (more specific: hydroponic cultivations) and green roofing which both focus on the development of lightweight hydraulic systems. The search resulted to the selection of clay aggregate, glass foam gravel, capillary mat and polyethylene drain sheet to replace the sand and gravel of the V-SSF and provide a more lightweight solution. 21 case studies with combinations of types, volumes of substrates and element sizes provided a valuable input for the assessment of the weight and the definition of the final size of the element. In parallel to that the detail design of the planter defined the structural and the hydraulic behaviour of the system.","greywater; living wall system; wetland; wastewater; green facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","Future Façade Design,","",""

Due to the complexity of relationships in these areas, conventional maps do not describe accurately the levels of information or the experience of the spaces that lie within. Through the framework of the studio, individual interpretations and self-created mappings were created to achieve an additional level of understanding. The end result of the research became a search for a design process via the mappings that lead to interpretations of the contextually discovered architectural conditions of the Cañada Real. My individual interpretations of the Cañada Real led to the research question of, ""How does visual fragmentation effect spatial interpretation?"" that began with a series of mappings in the form of physical models and ending in an architectural proposal that explores this question.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-08","Architecture","Architecture","","Public Building","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); Kok, M. (mentor); Duits, M. (mentor); Stijnen, J.W. (mentor)","2013","Due to climate change, it is expected that the design river discharge of the Rhine will increase from 16000 m3/s in 2015 to 18000 m3/s in 2100. In order to make the Dutch water system climate proof, dikes must be reinforced and raised and/or the design water level must be lowered. In this study, a flood channel as a measure to decrease water levels has been investigated, and has been compared to dike reinforcements. The investigated flood channel runs from the Afgedamde Maas towards the Biesbosch and Bergse Maas. This flood channel has been designed by architect Robbert de Koning, and is part of a larger plan to make the Dutch lower rivers climate proof until the year 2100. The length of the flood channel is approximately 20 kilometers, and the flow width is 600 meters. The flood channel is designed for a use of once every hundred years. The flood channel has been analyzed first by a simple one-dimensional model, in order to get a first estimation of the results. The second step was to model the flood channel in a two-dimensional model. This model is based on the WAQUA Rhine-Maas Estuary model, calibrated for the Hydraulic Boundary conditions 2011 (RMM-HR2011 model). This two-dimensional model has been updated to the reference year 2015. In order to add the flood channel, a new numerical grid has been created, because the flood channel lies outside the existing numerical grid. At a 18000 m3/s Rhine discharge, the flood channel’s discharge is 2707 m3/s (23% of the Waal’s discharge). As a result, the discharge through the Amer increases up to 32%, while the discharge through the Nieuwe Merwede decreases up to 28%. The maximum water level decrease at the Waal is approximately a meter, and the maximum water level increase at the Maas is 0.44 meter. The results showed that the performance of the flood channel is significantly lower than the expectations, and that the lower performance of the flood channel is mainly caused by the discharge capacity of the outlet channels. Based on the water level results and flood channel design, the costs have been calculated. The calculated costs for the flood channel are 1567.6 million euros. The cost-efficiency is estimated on 18 m2/106 , which is low for such a large measure. Due to the flood channel, the costs for dike reinforcements until the year 2100 are reduced with 266 million euros. However, practical limits to dike reinforcements and values related to landscape, nature and culture are not taken into account, which is expected to change the cost-benefit balance. Based on the water level results and costs calculations, the investigated flood channel is not hydraulically optimal, and not a cost effective alternative for dike reinforcements. However, hydraulic optimization of the channel is possible, and when values of landscape, nature and culture would be taken into account, the cost effectiveness could be more positive.","flood channel; hydraulic; climate change; Delta program","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

(mentor); Duvert, E. (mentor)","2013","In every prison and other custodial institution in the Netherlands prisoners can be secluded either for punitive reasons or for self-protection. Research shows that the manner in which prisoners are secluded in the Netherlands can seriously affect one’s brain. This project aims to improve the experience inside isolation cells for prisoners who are secluded for protective reasons. Responsibility must be taken, since one day these people will become part of society again. Current situation In the Netherlands, foreign nationals awaiting their repatriation are placed in detention centres. These people are likely to become distressed, due to their uncertain future. Their reaction to this situation can vary from having nightmares to attempting suicide. If this occurs they need to be protected for themselves. The only way to both give these people a safe environment and keep an eye on them is to put them in an isolation cell. Such cells allow 24-hour surveillance and provide as few stimuli as possible. No personal goods are allowed inside the cell, nor is distraction in the form of television or books present. This situation may lead to sensory deprivation and permanent damage to the brain. The prisoners already have psychological issues, for which they are brought to the isolation department, and the current way of treating them may do more harm than good. The research Observations were carried out in the detention centre in Rotterdam and interviews were carried out with both employees and (former) prisoners. Next to that a literature study about sensory deprivation and the context is done. The findings are clustered in two emotional situations many prisoners experience inside isolation cells. First uncertainty on the prisoner’s current situation can cause anxiety. Second is the lack of stimuli, which can lead to having negative thoughts. Next to that it is found that human contact is very important; the more a prisoner connects to the world around him, the faster he can go back to the housing department. Research also points out three undesirable situations involving the guard-prisoner interaction. The guard’s uncertainty about the prisoner’s state of mind negatively influences their interaction. Negative emotions coming from locking up a person and the strict conciseness of all moments of interaction can give an uncomfortable feeling to the guard as well. These situations negatively influence the interaction and the guard’s safety. The concept A future interaction is designed to improve the current situation. The guard needs to be encouraged to start the interaction and the prisoner needs to become involved in it. The interaction is supported by the TimeTable concept. With the concept the prisoner gets to tell his preferences and gets some freedom in forming his day programme. This will provide him with a feeling of autonomy and certainty. As both prisoner and guard sit together and have a conversation, the contact throughout the day improves and will distract the prisoner from his negative thoughts. The TimeTable helps the guard interact with the prisoner. He receives tools, which help him feel secure in the situation, next to that it allows a more humane way to treat the prisoner and therefore a more positive feeling for the guard. The five elements of the TimeTable and their properties are: Table – Instead of having to put the meals on the floor, the guard can now bring and leave the food on a table the prisoner can comfortably eat from. Pouf – The guard brings his own pouf; in this way he does not use any of the ‘prisoner’s furniture’ when having a seated conversation. Notebook – A manual for the guard, which contains questions the guard can ask the prisoner. The prisoner’s answers are written down in the notebook. Poster – The prisoner’s answers are copied onto a poster that can be hung on the wall as a record of the interaction, and a schedule of his day programme. Whiteboard – The guard writes down the agreements made with the prisoner on a whiteboard in the team office. His colleagues from all disciplines are aware of and can act to these agreements. It is also a tool to easier talk about the interaction and reflect on that.","isolation cells; design for emotion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Delft Institute of Positive Design","",""

(mentor); Rudinac, M. (mentor)","2013","In the near future the elderly population will increase in size up to a point that there are not enough people to provide support. One solution would be developing service robots, that can perform household tasks and in that way allow elderly to live longer independently. These service robots have to be able to adapt to changing environments, which requires a flexible framework that can recognize and learn objects regardless of the environment or the robot architecture. In this thesis such a framework, consisting of localization, description, classification and learning modules structured as a pipeline is introduced. Various types of objects require different methods to be used in each of the modules. For efficient memory usage these methods are dynamically loaded into the pipeline in the introduced framework. For human-robot interaction users have to be robustly identified and learned online. Exist-ing state of the art methods for face recognition, such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), do not support online learning of faces and lack the recognition performance required to be used in real-world situations. Hence the Class Average Principal Component Analysis (CAPCA) method is developed in this thesis as a descriptor. This method provides the required performance by increasing the separability of the classes by maximizing the inter-class and minimizing intra-class variations. The speed is increased significantly by selecting only the most representative samples. Additionally to allow for classification of unknown faces, the novel Certainty K-Nearest Neighbours (CertKNN) method has been introduced. The main benefit over the state of the art methods is finding the relation between the distance of classification and the certainty of that classification. This relation is automatically calculated from the data belonging to each class. In that way nearly optimal unknown classification can be done. Finally to further improve recognition performance a method has been developed that utilizes multiple frames in classification. To prove the benefits of the introduced methods extensive experiments have been performed on a state of the art face recognition database. The best performance was achieved with a F-measure of 96% and 90% for respectively known and unknown classification. Training speed was increased up to 100 times, which allows for online learning of faces. Lastly the introduced methods were applied on the Delft Robotics service robot and extensively tested in the RoboCup@Home challenge.","face recognition; cognitive robots; robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Arnhems Buiten is een bedrijventerrein aan de rand van Arnhem, dit gebied was vroeger een landgoed, maar is in 1938 omgetoverd tot het industrieel bedrijventerrein van Kema (Arnhems Buiten). Het gebied is in de loop van de jaren een hoop veranderd, maar de groene structuur van het landgoed is nog steeds zichtbaar. In 2005 heeft Kema het terrein verkocht aan de vastgoed ontwikkelaar TCN, die vanaf dat moment nieuwe plannen heeft gemaakt voor de toekomst. Kema en Tennet, de belangrijkste huurders op het bedrijventerrein, krijgen nieuwe kantoorgebouwen, hierdoor komen een hoop ouder gebouwen leeg te staan vanaf 2013-2015. Nieuwe plannen moeten zorgen dat de leegkomende gebouwen, in de toekomst weer gebruikt worden. Leegstand leid over het algemeen tot verval. In heel Nederland staan kantoorpanden leeg, dus nieuwe huurders vinden is niet gemakkelijk, een andere functie voor het gebouw vinden is dan misschien reëler. Nederland zal in de toekomst een grotere vraag krijgen naar huisvestiging voor ouderen. Leegstaande kantoor gebouwen zouden na transformatie geschikt kunnen zijn, om in deze toenemende vraag te voorzien.","herbestemming; ouderenhuisvestiging","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-30","Architecture","R-mit","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Civil structures, especially hydraulic structures, are subject to influences from the environment around the structure. As a result of these influences the structure degrades, which lowers the strength of the structure. Several actions are available to lower the speed of degradation and/or restore the structure to a certain condition. Within the operations and maintenance of a structure, the question is whether regularly small reparations or once a large replacement needs to be performed. In order to make a founded decision a quantification is needed. One of these is using risks as part of the decision making process. Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence times the consequences. Since this can be expressed as costs, it can be compared with the costs of the reparations or replacement to find the value of this action. In this thesis, a framework is presented to aid in the development of a one replacement-multiple reparations-strategy. The method describes the steps needed to find all information to make a stochastic based deterioration model. Also the steps to calculate the costs for each strategy, where the moment of replacement and reparation interval are variable, are shown. The framework ends with an optimisation, resulting in the most optimal strategy within the set boundaries and assumptions. Testing of the framework has been performed with a case study of a fictional lock. After collecting all needed information about the degradation models, distribution and parameters, several calculations have been performed. With both a level II as a level III method these calculations have been made. The framework proved to be a good guideline for the determination of sought-after strategy. Since degradation models can have a more complex (than adding and multiplying parameters) shape, the level II method became significantly more complex than what it is used for (an indicative calculation). Even though level III method (the Monte Carlo method was used) requires more processing time (on a commercial laptop) than the level II method, the time it took to program was equal. A level II method is therefor only of use when a comparison with an analytical method is wanted.","risk; maintenance; hydraulic; structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","In this research a comparison has been made between on one side the Dutch signalling system with ATB-EG train protection and on the other side the European signalling system ETCS Level 2. The minimum feasible headway times at bottlenecks for both systems have been compared. A selection has been made of the 22 most relevant train sequences on six often occurring infrastructure layouts. For each layout, the positioning of signals (for ATB) or block limits (for ETCS) has been sought that leads to the lowest feasible headway time for between one and four train sequences. To enable fast calculation and comparison of the headway times at different signal positionings a spreadsheet calculation model has been developed for both signalling systems. In 15 of the 22 train sequences, the European system ETCS L2 yielded a shorter headway time than the Dutch system ATB-EG. The improvements ranged from 1,1s to 21,3s, which corresponds to savings of up to 21%. In the other 7 train sequences, the headway times found in this research for ETCS L2 were higher than those that could be reached in the Dutch signalling system when applying the appropriate signal positions. When averaged over all 22 train sequences, ETCS L2 gives a 4,5% reduction of the headway time. When only averaging the 16 train sequences that don’t involve freight trains, the reduction more than doubles to an average of 9,3%. The main differences between the two signalling systems that contribute to the better performance of the European system are the fact that the braking curves are block-independent, train-dependant and speed-dependant and that there is a very low minimum block length. The research presented three types of limitations that could prevent signals from being placed on the exact location where they would be needed (level crossings, overhead section breaks and neutral overhead section breaks) and investigated the sensitivity of the found minimum headway times, which showed that the values found for ETCS L2 are much more robust and that the required block limit positionings contain much more flexibility. The results from the research were applied on the corridor Weesp – Almere Oostvaarders, showing again that ETCS would bring more buffer time increases and require less infrastructure adaptations. To improve the accuracy of future studies comparing the Dutch and European signalling systems, focus should be put on obtaining more certainty about the ETCS braking curves of the representative Dutch passenger rolling stock.","ATB-EG; ETCS L2; bottleneck; headway time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The goal of this graduation project is to architecturally transform Moerwijk-North towards an attractive neighbourhood with a high level of middle-income families and higher level of social cohesion with the preservation of the architectural qualities. The creation of an ‘imagined’ community with ground bound dwellings for sympathizers will be amplified by the masterplan of Berlage, with the higher building blocks on the edges than the ones in the centre, where the daily life should take place. On urban scale the closed building blocks configuration surrounding the communal inner garden will be turned inside out. The communal inner garden will be transformed to a new and active front side. The former front (street side) will become the new ‘communal’ space for the whole neighbourhood. With this inside out concept the goal is create a higher rate of meeting between the neighbours of Moerwijk-North. The porch dwelling typology will be transformed. The 8 former apartments that are situated around 1 porch staircase will become 4 groundbound single-family dwellings of 200 m2. The merging will be vertical and by degree, which means that floors are rotated 90 degrees from each other. In this way an unusual identity, interesting spatial interior space and high surface of facades will be created, what connects with the demands of the target group I try to house in the transformed Moerwijk-North. The existing load bearing structure will be transformed to this new dwelling configuration with a minimum amount of interventions. A second intervention to the dwellings is to apply the passive home concept on the existing. With this the dwellings will be insulated so well, that there is no need for any traditional heating or cooling systems to create a comfortable indoor climate year round. These interventions will give insight in the consequences on the existing.","Transformatie; Transformation; Den Haag Zuiwest; Moerwijk; Moerweg; Porch; Portiek; Inversion; Omkering; Inside-out; Binnenstebuiten; Passive home; Passiefhuis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","RMIT","","Ar3Ar111","",""

(mentor); Sobota, M. (mentor)","2013","Reflection on open-ended and metastable architecture. Metastability is a term which describes the extended duration of certain equilibria acquired by a complex system when leaving its most stable state after an external action. The parameters of such ""excited"" system may eventually reach and hold stationary values (a metastable state) but then, after a long time, (spontaneously or under a slight external action) parameters will start changing again. Considering the contemporary technological level and multiple scientific insights into natural systems that reflects similar tendencies, it is not hard to imagine an open ended architectural design that across its life span reveals metastable qualities. Even the most sophisticated building, designed in reference to a particular environment, is not permanently suitable. First of all, due to the impact of the building on its environment, for which it was initially designed. Second, due to an unpredictable and dynamic field of external stimuli that might trigger changes in the environment. In both cases, a solution that seemed to be suitable for environmental embodiment, turn out to be a more or less accurate experiment, that has no embedded capability to facilitate environmental feedback for the means of its adjustment. Creating fixed built environment solutions, that do not incorporate feedback into building evolution across its live span, can be literally compared with creating a house with fixed glazing, without the possibility to control the air flow throughout the building. Informational system developed for Almere Pampus Transferium assumes the absence of permanent stasis and operate onto metastable frames. An associated research incorporates computational mechanisms inspired by natural form emergence and evolution, not only in the design process, but also in its execution and evolution. Those mechanisms, while inspired by nature, do not necessary mimic its aesthetics. Their value is rather in providing effective and adjustable embodiments, whose emergence can be directly linked with the environment, initiating a mutual and continuous self-regulating feedback loop. The application of developed informational systems in an architectural design goes in parallel with embodiments capable of handling fluctuating data flows. Parametric structural system used in a building is a the same time modular and customised, which means that within its parametrical boundaries new extensions of the building required in time, can be automatically adjusted to current conditions and connected with the existing parts of the building. Even more flexibility along buildings life span is provided by double skin system. Main structure of the building is covered with single glazed facade that provides condition for functionalities where precise climate control is not required. Internal volumes, at the other hand, placed inside the main structural frames, provides advanced climate control for all sorts of potential activities. At the level where big and open spaces, created by main structural system, meats internal volumes curving particular fragments of interior for their own means, spatial negotiation occurs. Final design admits relations between dynamic systems, and understand that those relations stand for its fitness criteria adjustment and survival capabilities. It is a design that incorporates contemporary tools as a communication medium with the cultural environment and assumes uncertainty to be a planed and valuable part of the process, producing architecture that facilitates environmental feedback and drive its evolution towards internal and external homeostasis.","hyperbody; transferium; metastable; CNC; parametric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","Hyperbody","",""

(mentor); Schaap, S. (mentor); Künneke, R. (mentor); Veenstra, S. (mentor)","2013","The Water Board in Lilongwe, Malawi is facing enormous challenges in providing access to urban citizens to safe and affordable drinking water. These challenges includes; keeping production levels up with drinking water demand, reducing the amount of physical and commercial water losses and collecting sufficient revenue to cover operational cost, repayments on loans and investments. This study analysis the incentives and disincentives that contributes to improve accessibility by reducing water losses and safeguarding continuity of drinking water supply to citizens of Lilongwe, Malawi. This study undertakes a qualitative in-depth analysis. First a conceptual framework is made by using the IAD framework distinguishing exogenous variables and action situations. Second, exogenous variables are described by highlighting incentives and disincentives from two data sets of two different countries; Lilongwe Water Board, Malawi and Vitens NV, the Netherlands. Third, by using game theory five action situations have been analyzed in depth to extract institutional lessons. The analyses suggest that the presence of an external donor organization which provides funds to make necessary investment displaces local efforts to contribute to maintenance efforts. To ameliorate donor disturbances a more effective allocation of institutional capacity is needed. This study concludes that first, better information gathering and information management will reduce uncertainty and improves decisions making by management and planners. In addition, an increase in transparency through bi-directional communication and ownership of information management will provide an incentive to commit to decisions of participants involved. Second, the frequency of encounters between a government institutions and a drinking water supply company will provide a government institution with more credible institutional instruments to withhold funds or conversely reward funds for new investments. Third, given limited institutional capacity of government offices, creating transparency on maintenance outcomes of different urban regions will create competition among maintenance teams, managers and planners. Consequently, this will provide an incentives to improve maintenance efforts to achieve better outcomes.","Institutional Analysis; Institutional Transplantation; Game Theory; Policy Analysis; Drinking Water Supply","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-01-12","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","","",""

The development of these creative and innovative companies have therefore been divided into four phases of development, with each a different supportive urban environment. This graduation project is an alternative strategy to the current policy of developing new work and live environments on the outskirts of the city. This project pleads for the locating of starting companies on more centrally located sites, where they benefit from the proximity of knowledge sources and facilities. Therefore small-scale industrial sites will be transformed for the facilitating of these starting entrepreneurs. Together with knowledge sources and business and science parcs, the starter environments form a network through the city of Eindhoven. These hotspots will be mutually connected through a Bus Rapit Transport network. The spatial interpretation of such a starter environment is presented in an urban design of the Hoogstraat, in the southwest of Eindhoven.","brainport; Eindhoven; knowledge economy; life cycle; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-01","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

(mentor); Jimenez, J.C. (mentor)","2013","Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorder, affecting between 3 to 5 percent of children worldwide. Characteristics of ADHD are hyperactivity, inattention, impulsiveness and lack of self-control. Current research shows an increased interest in the perception of time in children with ADHD and some believe it is the ground on which the characteristics build. Children with ADHD can experience problems at school as well as in social settings because they are easily distracted and have difficulty focusing on one task or a conversation. For a child with ADHD to be able to adjust its behaviour, it needs almost constant feedback and encouragement from caregivers. Next to medical treatment, behavioural therapy is available to make the symptoms less disruptive. It is believed to only work as it provides motivation to the child as the child does have the skills but has difficulty showing it. Current products for children with ADHD lack as these do not provide this much needed motivation. The required feedback is often sent too late while children with ADHD need feedback on their behaviour at the point of performance, on the spot. A Personal Informatics system, a tool that collects and displays personal data for the purpose of self-reflection and self-monitoring, can support children with ADHD. By collection personal information about their behaviour and presenting information on it to children to reflect upon, they can increase their self-awareness and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Observing children with ADHD at school and interviewing them, their parents and teachers showed the need for support in classes they work independently. Teacher nor the child itself is able to provide the motivation needed and together with their uncertainty about time this leaves them inattentive for large periods of time. The designed bracelet offers a Personal Informatics system which presents information on time and attention to increase on-task behaviour. The bracelet is worn during the day and used in classes with independent work. Time is presented, showing the child how much time is left and creating a reminder to work. When the child gets distracted, his or her amount of movement will increase. An accelerometer inside the device measures the movement of the non-dominant wrist and gives a signal as soon as the child shows signs of inattention. First stopping the distracting allows children to reflect on what they should be doing. To allow deeper reflection, colours show after class how well the child did. The child is motivated to improve its behaviour as it influence the score shown on the bracelet. These different kinds of reflection complement each other and support self-awareness. Where the bracelet provides options for short-term reflection, an additional software program at home allows more long-term reflection. A prototype to test the reflection on presented information is made. Three children participated and were able to reflect on their own behaviour using the device. They enjoyed wearing and using it and were motivated to change their behaviour in order to get a good score. The design of this device shows what is possible to achieve for children with ADHD by using a Personal Informatics system. Hopefully this project works as an inspiration for other designers to use tools like this more often for similar target groups as it can support them greatly.","ADHD; Personal Informatics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design Conceptualization and Communication","",""

(mentor); Meyer, V.J. (mentor)","2013","In the Southwest Delta are the main assignments flood defence, freshwater supply, ecology and fragmentation of the urban delta. This fragmentation occurred because urban regions developed on the edge of the estuarine landscape of Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt. The characterless in between landscapes are disturbing the relation between urban regions and delta landscape. Due to climate change are interventions for flood defence and the freshwater supply necessary. However, these interventions can also be utilized for the assignment of an ecologic restored delta and an improved relation between urban regions and delta landscape. In the transition between the urban region Rijnmond and delta landscape are these assignments most related to each other. Research and design on this transition is the answer on the research question: How can interventions for an ecologic restored and climate proof delta contribute to a dynamic connecting landscape between urban region’s and the delta landscape, but also to an enhanced spatial quality of the transition between settlement and water? The main themes are climate change and current spatial structures and how they can contribute to a connecting landscape. Awareness of the spatial structures in the Southwest Delta is important in adaptation to new economies and ecologies without loss of identity. These spatial structures are defined by economic and ecologic networks which needs to be able to adapt to changing environments. These networks become better integrated if meaningful and vibrant public spaces are connected to them. There are three important economic networks on the scale of the Southwest Delta. One consists of urban regions linked by railways and highways. The other one is the shipping route between the ports of Antwerp, situated in the basin of the river Scheldt, and Rotterdam, situated in the basin of the rivers Rhine and Meuse. The last one consists of a parallel infrastructure of roads across the Deltaworks which makes the delta accessible for recreation. The ecologic networks of the delta consists of the main water system and the regional water systems. The main water system forms a structuring element on the scale of the Southwest Delta. Adaptation to climate change is utilized for restoring ecology and contributing to a connecting landscape between urban regions and delta landscape. The ecology can be restored by reconnecting the water basins, return of tides by reconnection with the North Sea and river discharge through the delta. Restored dynamics of the delta contribute to an improved spatial quality of the transition between land and water. The dike, which forms the current border between land and water, is transformed into a transition area which integrate nature, recreation and flood defence. Besides that discharge of the river through the delta contributes to a restored ecology, it also contributes to the safety of the urban region of Rijnmond in case of peaks in river discharges. The manner in which the urban region Rijnmond is temporary closable for peak discharges affects the potential of the connecting landscape of Voorne-Putten. Hellevoetsluis occupies a strategic position in the connecting landscape between urban region Rijnmond and delta landscape. In the past Hellevoetsluis was strategically located and part of a water defence line of which the fortress still is a remnant. Thereafter Hellevoetsluis was situated on networks which connected the city Rotterdam with the delta. The Canal of Voorne used to be the access to the ports of Rotterdam. Later a network of steam trams and ferries connected the islands in the delta with Rotterdam. In the current situation Hellevoetsluis has lost its strategic position. In the connecting landscape are networks enhanced, accessible and restored for recreational purposes to make Hellevoetsluis a strategic node for recreation in the connecting landscape between urban region and delta landscape. As result of the restored dynamics and ecology in the Southwest Delta is a reduced availability of freshwater in the main water system. The demand for freshwater from the regional water systems needs to be adjusted to the availability of freshwater from the main water system. Therefore are two strategies which consists of resisting salinisation and allowing salinisation. Because of the contrast between saline and non saline zones arises a dynamic landscape. Water forms the spatial carrier and structuring element in the saline landscape which integrate agriculture, nature and recreation. The concept of a zoned landscape fits well in the spatial structure of Goeree Overflakkee with its ring-street-villages. These villages lost their relation with the water, which only consists because of a harbour canal due to further land reclamation. Additional landscape architectonic elements enhance the spatial composition of the saline landscape, which is structured by the elements of saline aquaculture. These elements are axes of cultivation ponds and constructed wetlands. Adaptive ecologic and economic networks are the structuring elements in the connecting landscape. On the scale of Goeree Overflakkee forms water the structuring element in the zoned landscape in between settlement and main water system. Underlying ecologic and climate-related changes are the result of internal salinisation and reduced availability of freshwater from the main water system. On the scale of the Southwest Delta is the transition between urban region and delta landscape structured by networks. The potention of the connecting landscape of Voorne Putten is influenced by the chosen interventions for an ecologic restored and climate proof delta.","connecting landscape; recreational networks; saline landscapes; aquaculture; zoned landscape; internal salinisation; climate change; collective memory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Urbanism","","Delta Interventions","",""

(mentor)","2013","The United Nations Environmetal Council (UNEC) is a proposed 6th UN Council and shall have a global coordinating function in sustainable development. It will be a central organisation that collects, produces, propagates and exchanges information on sustainability worldwide, concerning ecological, social an economical issues. This UN Council should therefore have an icon function in sustainable building design worldwide. The building will be located next to the existing UN Headquarters (UNHQ) on the East Riverbank in Manhattan, New York City. The new headquarters for the Environmental Council of the United Nations has to be designed as an icon in sustainable building design worldwide, but how should it look like? Of course one of the main topics is sustainability, but how to express sustainability in the design of a building? Should it be expressed in the exterior of the building, clearly visible and shown in the façade? Can it be shown in the dimensioning and relations in between all building parts? Or is it something that is part of a more integrated system within the climate- and structural design of the building? Obviously it is not enough to claim that the design of this building will be sustainable ones the façade of the design looks green by applying a façade system with greenery. Maybe this will show a more sustainable image to the public on the street, but to me the integration of sustainability within a building design is far more then creating a ‘green’ image to the public. To me it will be a challenge to generate more awareness among the public about the topic of sustainability by integrating this main topic within the design of the new UNEC headquarters. In a same way the existing main building of the UN administration, designed by the Swiss-French architect and urban planner Le Corbusier and the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, also showed the more technical possibilities for the use of materials like reinforced concrete as icon for industrial improvements of the last century. We are in a unique moment in architectural and building engineering history when shifting world needs has asked us to question some of the fundamentals of how we have built for the last century and how we will build in the next. The image of ‘the primitive hut’ by Laugier shows not only the true beauty of architecture in form and composition, but also the use of natural materials in the build-up of a structure. For me this image embodies the subconscious wish of mankind to live (all human activities) in a structure that is formed and created by only the use of natural formed materials like timber. Therefore it is the role of the architect to fulfil this wish by the design of sustainable buildings, in which the use of structural timber for high-rise also shows the possibilities of this material as sustainable icon. High-rise timber buildings are not a new concept. 1400 years ago tall pagodas in Japan, like the Horyu-Ji Temple were built up to 19 storeys in wood and still stand today in high seismic, wet climate environments. Current innovations worldwide have triggered a race to create taller wood buildings, including a 12 storey building in Melbourne Australia, a 17 storey building in Norway and a 30 storey hybrid timber and concrete building in Austria; the LifeCycle Tower. The case for tall wood buildings introduces a new way of constructing tall buildings with a renewable, durable and strong building material that is manufactured by nature. To find truly sustainable solutions to buildings for the future, we must look at the fundamentals of the way we build and live. To achieve this, we have to go back to the origin of our inner self and build with natural materials in combination with modern technologies: highrise in timber, the new ‘hut’ as sustainable icon for the future.","sustainable highrise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Materialisation","","Strategic Architectural Design Development","",""

(mentor); Zonneveld, W.A.M. (mentor)","2013","If we think of large scale infrastructure projects in the Netherlands that have been developed recently we might come to the conclusion that the number of completed projects in terms of rail infrastructure is very limited. And if someone might ask to give a successful example of a railway line that has been developed last years it is hard to give a positive answer to this. We probably all know the ‘Betuwelijn’ or the recently completed ‘HSL’ (FYRA) (both connecting the Netherlands with its neighbouring countries), because of the issues around these projects; the extraordinary budget and their outranging costs in particular. It even might be argued that such projects have put large railway projects in a negative perspective. But also projects of smaller scale have been realized, at regional level: the ‘Randstadrail’ for example – a tramline that connects The Hague and Rotterdam. This project is probably more successful, partly because the line has been built together with its surroundings. Nevertheless, what these projects have in common is that they are defined by high complexity; for instance, they require participation of many different stakeholders and ask for integral planning approaches because these projects interact with their spatial and programmatic environment. The research of this master thesis draws on these constraints regarding integration of infrastructure planning and spatial development, and addresses the related issues of governance at regional level, between provincial and municipal administration - the ‘regional gap’. Both issues come together with projects in regional transport infrastructure. In order to understand the context of this ‘arena’ the thesis contains a survey on the system of spatial planning in the Netherlands, including the latest practices related to integrated transport planning. Secondly, in order to find potential and appropriate concepts that anticipate on these critical issues, various theories on integrated transport planning (e.g. nodal development or ‘transit oriented development’) and regional governance (e.g. institutional capacity building) are derived from literature research. As part of the empirical research, a regional transport infrastructure project has been taken as a case study: the ‘Rijn Gouwe Lijn’ (RGL) between Leiden and Gouda. In this case the critical issues regarding regional transport infrastructure are addressed and appropriate concepts from the theoretical study are applied. This thesis ends up with some final conclusions and recommendations for the case study area, from which the latter is translated in a proposal of three alternative design suggestions (a spatial concept together with a regional structure vision, an institutional framework and a planning strategy) in order to demonstrate the use of a design from a collaborative approach. Finally, some recommendations are done for future research.","policy integration; TOD; regional gap; institutional capacity building; strategic spatial planning; Rijngouwelijn; governance culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-24","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

In de publieke en private sector zijn uitstekende crisispartners om in de crisisbeheersing te ondersteunen. Maar waarom worden de woningcorporaties en andere publieke en private partijen dan niet betrokken in crisisplannen. Vanuit het wettelijk kader blijkt dat de crisisbeheersing is gericht op de traditionele actoren namelijk de gemeente, de brandweer, de geneeskundige hulpverleningsorganisatie in de regio (GHOR) en de politie. Deze actoren hebben verantwoordelijkheden, taken en bevoegdheden die omschreven staan in de Wet veiligheidsregio’s en de Politiewet. Dagelijks zijn er incidenten waarbij woningcorporaties zijn betrokken, zoals keukenbranden, stroomstoringen en gas- of water lekkages in het woningbezit. In de meeste gevallen zijn het kleine incidenten, maar het komt voor dat incidenten escaleren en grote gevolgen hebben voor meerdere woningen. Het is voor woningcorporaties zeer belangrijk om te kunnen reageren bij incidenten in het eigen woningbezit. Niet alleen om de hulpdiensten te ondersteunen, maar ook om de bewoners te voorzien van primaire levensbehoeften. Aedes heeft hier op gereageerd door het calamiteitenhandboek aan woningcorporaties te verstrekken.

Deze gebieden worden steeds dunner bevolkt maar het is vooral belangrijk voor de mensen die er blijven wonen dat de leefbaarheid behouden blijft. Dit onderzoek gaat over regionale strategieën voor demografische krimp. Hierbij wordt het planningsconcept Netwerkstad ingezet om de leefbaarheid in regionale krimpgebieden te behouden. Wat opvalt in regionale krimp-, en anticipeergebieden is dat gemeenten niet met elkaar samenwerken, maar elkaar beconcurreren wat betreft het aanpakken van de krimpproblematiek. Het idee van Netwerkstad Achterhoek is dat alle gemeenten met elkaar gaan samenwerken en dat niet alle kernen en dorpen meer dezelfde voorzieningen hoeven te hebben, maar dat deze per knooppunt worden geclusterd. Door een goed netwerk aan te leggen, blijven alle voorzieningen toch bereikbaar en blijft het voorzieningenniveau van het gehele gebied op peil. Om dit mogelijk te maken zijn condities als vergaande bestuurlijke samenwerking, het toepassen van 'soft planning' en 'mixed scanning', het creëren van bewustwording en urgentie, en het in ogenschouw nemen van de specifieke lokale situatie van groot belang.","(demografsiche) krimp; netwerkstad; leefbaarheid; concurrerende gemeentes; regionale schaal","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-19","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

Problem statement Many construction projects suffer from cost and or time overruns. A lot of research has been done into causes of these overruns. In order to prevent overruns, an early warning is needed by an early recognition. When indicators with a predictive value for cost and time overruns are known, a steering or intervention method can be used to reduce or prevent the overrun. This research will reveal these indicators. Objective By revealing indicators, steering and intervention methods, it might be possible to respond to possible cost and time overruns in an early phase. Next to that, a look has been taken into which party should have the responsibility of recognising and responding to these indicators and in which phase the indicator should be taken into account. By also taking a look at possible contracttypes, the amount of information that is shared between parties during a construction project, the party which is currently harmed most and the role of the projectmanager, these themes and their relation with cost and time overruns have also been researched. The result of the research can be used at the beginning and during construction projects by all the parties that are involved. Research method A literature research has been done into causes of cost and time overruns. Interviews have been done with different types of parties involved in construction projects who have experience with overruns. Based on their experience with projects, indicators and related themes have been discussed. A small amount of reflection interviews took place to see whether indicators that arose in the first round of interviews also appear in projects without an overrun.  There has been a cost or a time overrun;  Utility buildings;  Project value > 5 million Euros;  At least 10% of cost or time overrun, excluding scope changes, knowingly having a planning which is too strict or knowingly having a budget which is too short;  The project has been completed. Results It is possible to recognise indicators with a predictive value for cost and time overruns in an early phase of construction projects and several ways to respond to them have emerged. The final overview in the report shows the indicators, causes, steering and intervention methods, the responsible party and the phase of recognition that have emerged in this research. The intervention methods are harsh. Steering on the prevention of an indicator from the beginning of a project will be most effective and should be aimed for. The related themes all have a relation with cost and time overruns and the indicators. Sharing information, the choice for a specific contract, the role of the project manager, responsible parties and the project phase all play a role in preventing indicators from happening or in recognising them. Therefor it is advised to start cooperation between all the parties involved in the project from the very beginning.","indicator","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-17","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

(mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Luger, H.J. (mentor); Versteijlen, W.G. (mentor)","2013","Monopiles are being used more extensively for offshore wind turbine foundation. Current guidelines on the construction of fixed offshore foundations still base the design of laterally loaded piles in sand on empirical data (p-y curves), originating from the oil and gas industry, from field tests executed in 1974 on 0.61 m diameter piles. However, large diameter monopiles can be considered short and rigid, which rotate rather than bend when subjected to lateral loads. As a result, numerous experimental studies have been performed on the response of monopile foundations by means of a geotechnical centrifuge. During these tests there was no consistency in installation conditions (ether at low stress levels (1g), elevated stress (Ng) levels or pre-installed), partly because the effect of the pile installation is still not completely understood. Research into the behaviour of these large open-ended piles generally does not examine the installation effect on lateral capacity. This research contributes to (i) investigate the effect of pile installation on the lateral response of an open-ended pile in sand and (ii) increasing reliability in the interpretation of existing and future centrifuge research on the investigation of lateral cyclic large strain deformations. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of monotonically jacked open-ended pile installation, at low and elevated stress conditions, on the large strain lateral soil-pile response during two-way cyclic loading. A series of tests was executed to compare the differences on the lateral pile response from monotonic jacked pile installation at low stress levels (1g) and at elevated stress levels in the geotechnical centrifuge (Ng). In order to study the effect of monotonic open-ended pile installation on the cyclic lateral capacity a novel actuator, which allows installing the pile in-flight and subsequently loading the pile laterally without interrupting the test, was developed. The load mechanism on the free pile head was designed in a way that no bending moment was transferred to the pile head by means of a hinged connection between pile and actuator. The load mechanism - instrumented with strain gauges - was calibrated for stiffness by means of static loads in the laboratory and for hysteresis at 1g and Ng in the geotechnical centrifuge. The brass model pile was designed to properly scale the lateral bending stiffness and prevent plugging during installation. In order to investigate influence of the soil state on installation effects a total of two sets of tests have been performed with varying installation conditions and relative densities. The first set (76g and ID = 60 +/- 3 %) was executed in duplex to determine the consistency and the accuracy of the preparation method. In the second set (48g) the relative density was varied (60 +/- 3 % and 80 +/- 3 %). The second set of tests provided a clear insight into relation between load and displacement during two-way cyclic loading (load - displacement loops). The results indicate that elevated stress installation of an open-ended pile has a small positive (1 - 5%) effect on the lateral capacity. This effect is mainly visible during primary lateral loading of the soil and decays with the number of load cycles. Hence for open-ended model piles the installation effects are negligible. Moreover, these tests indicate that in all cases the stiffness and lateral capacity increase with the number of load cycles, stress level and/or initial density. These gains in capacity and initial stiffness are much more substantial than the differences found between 1g and Ng pile installation. The results in this study present an incremental advance in fully modelling the installation effect and subsequent lateral cyclic loading of monopiles.","monopile; installation; cyclic; lateral; centrifuge; modelling; physical; offshore; foundation; effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

The performance of work zones with specific layouts cannot be accurately determined, because changes in individual driving behaviour at work zones are unknown. Therefore, the research objective is: “Gain insight into possible adaptation effects related to the layout of work zones, in empirical individual driving behaviour and subsequent in macroscopic effects, by presenting the applied method”. Unmanned helicopter and observed layouts. Empirical individual driver data have been collected using an innovative method: the unmanned helicopter instead of a manned helicopter (to reduce costs and collect more data). The three observed configurations vary in lane widths, channelizing devices, and presence of reverse curves. Data processing. To analyse individual driving behaviour, vehicle movements have to be extracted from stabilized frames, but difficulties appeared by stabilizing imagery and detecting and tracking vehicles. Therefore, new methods are introduced to detect vehicles:  ‘Edge detection’;  A program identifying mouse clicks locations; Also a method is implemented for tracking vehicles:  A shortest-path algorithm: the Dijkstra algorithm. Data analysis and results. For each configuration, empirical variables, e.g. time headway distributions, and the speed - following distance relationship are analysed and compared with consistent results: Driving speeds at corresponding following distances decrease by applying a work zone (and even more when also applying a reverse curve). Macroscopic effects are analysed by performing simulations, using a calibrated car-following model (the extended IDM) with individually -on their definition- estimated model parameters:  Smaller lane widths and a barrier as channelizing device reduced capacity with 1.5%;  When also applying a reverse curve, the reduction was even 6.2%.","driving behaviour; work zone; unmanned helicopter; vehicle detection; vehicle tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Yu, Z. (mentor)","2013","The motivation behind this thesis is that cardio-vascular diseases claim the highest number of lives each year globally. In order to enhance the accuracy in diagnosis, construction of 3D images of the heart is required. From these images, precise information can be obtained regarding the 3D anatomy of the heart and its functioning. Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is a promising technique to achieve this kind of precision in diagnosis. The objective of my thesis is to perform optimization at the system and circuit level, in order to improve power-efficiency and area-efficiency of the front-end receiver electronics. This electronic circuitry is integrated at the tip of a miniature TEE probe, which will be inserted through the esophagus close to the heart of the patient for diagnosis (via a gastroscopic tube). The signal processing chain of the receiver electronics consists of a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), a Micro-Beamformer that performs delay and sum operation, and a Time Gain Compensation (TGC) amplifier. A novel low-power high-dynamic-range micro-beamformer is designed in TSMC 0.18 µm CMOS technology. The dynamic range is enhanced substantially compared to a previous implementation. This has been achieved by employing an Offset Calibration Loop (OCL). The proposed design is power-efficient, such that the total power consumption is almost a factor of 5 lower compared to the state-of-the-art design. The increase in thermal noise level is marginal (6.5%) after incorporating the OCL.","Offset Calibration loop; Micro-Beamformer; switched-capacitor circuits; ultrasound; Auto-Zeroing loop; dynamic range; delay line; time-gain-compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2013","Funderingsproblemen bij panden op houten palen hebben voornamelijk in het westen van Nederland een grote omvang. Geschat wordt dat ruim 250.000 panden op dit moment te maken hebben met deze problemen. Men verwacht dat dit aantal in de toekomst nog flink zal stijgen (CURNET/SBR Rotterdam, 2012). Gezien het feit dat het herstellen van een fundering nogal kostbaar is, zijn de verschillende conventionele hersteltechnieken onderzocht. Deze zijn vervolgens kort samengevat in dit rapport. Op basis van deze kennis en een aantal kostenramingen van de conventionele herstelmethoden is gezocht naar de grootste kostenpost bij het herstellen van een fundering. Niet geheel onverwachts blijken de grootste kosten te zitten in nieuw in te brengen palen en in het betonwerk. De verschillende paalsoorten die bij het herstel kunnen worden gebruikt zijn vervolgens uiteengezet. Hierbij blijken slechts een beperkt aantal paalsoorten in aanmerking te komen, namelijk palen die trillingsarm zijn en niet grond-verwijderend. Bij het heien aan de buitenzijde van het pand kan men gebruik maken van stalenbuis palen. Dit is de meest praktische paal aangezien er voldoende variabiliteit is in de diameter van deze buis. Er kan dus een verscheidenheid aan belastingen worden opgenomen. Voor inwendig heien moet de paal in te brengen zijn bij beperkte werkhoogte. Ook hier zijn maar enkele paalsystemen voor te gebruiken. De kosten voor de verschillende paalsystemen blijken al jaren constant en nieuwe methoden zijn nog niet beschikbaar (Everts, 2012). In dit onderzoek is daarom gekozen om besparingen te zoeken in het betonwerk. Bij de methode met voorspanbalken blijken de kosten voor het betonwerk hoger te zijn dan de palenkosten. Daarbij ondervinden de bewoners bij deze methode weinig hinder, aangezien er geen beganegrondvloer hoeft te worden verwijderd. Dit gaf de aanleiding om te onderzoeken of bij deze methode een besparing kan worden gevonden in een alternatief. Voor dit alternatief is onderzocht of het gebruik van (ultra) hoog sterkte beton en het plaatsen van voorspankabels buiten de betonbalk, een besparing kan opleveren bij het herstel. Er is naar aanleiding van bovenstaande onderzoek gedaan naar de betonmortelprijzen. Aangezien deze niet bekend waren voor C100/115 en C200/215 is er een extrapolatie gedaan van de bekende prijzen. Theoretisch blijkt het te kunnen om de balk zodanig slank de dimensioneren dat nog steeds aan de veiligheidseisen wordt voldaan. Als de kabels een bepaalde kromming en kracht hebben, kan dit namelijk worden gezien als opwaartse qSlast. Van dit principe is gebruik gemaakt bij de berekening. Er valt dus wel degelijk te besparen op de betonkosten. Verder onderzoek zal wel moeten worden gedaan naar het inleiden van de voorspankracht bij het anker en de inleiding over de lengte van de balk. De voorspankabels moeten op dusdanige manier met de balk zijn verbonden, dat deze zijn kracht kan overdragen op de betonbalk. Tevens is er onderzoek gedaan naar het effect van meer terreinonderzoek. Een duidelijke conclusie die hieruit volgt is dat een gedegen grondonderzoek, gezien de geringe kosten per sondering, bijna altijd voordelen heeft. Zowel in de berekening van de draagkracht, als bij het verkrijgen van een beter beeld van de ondergrond. Op basis van deze kennis weten de ingenieurs beter wat zich in de ondergrond bevindt en kan mogelijk een betere oplossingen voor het probleem worden gevonden, en waar mogelijk wellicht ook een kostenbesparing.","funderingsherstel; funderingen; voorspanning; beton; sonderingen","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","The scientific foundation to maintain the Holland Coast shoreward of the -20m depth contour is limited. It is assumed that profile perturbations shoreward of the -20m depth contour influence the coast within a time scale of 50 to 200 years. Hence, seaward of -20m NAP dredging companies are allowed to dredge sand. The dredged material is amongst others applied in nourishments near the beach. In order to naturally preserve the shoreface of the Dutch Coast, coastal policy in The Netherlands prescribes that the sediment volume of Holland Coast should be preserved shoreward of the -20m depth contour. The volume required to accomplish this can be significantly reduced in case a shallower depth contour can be assumed. In order to investigate the influence of perturbations shoreward of -20m NAP and to validate the scientific foundation of the -20m depth contour, cross-shore sediment transport on various depth contours will be analysed. The emphasis of this research will lie on sediment transport on the lower shoreface (deeper than -10m NAP). Sediment transport will be evaluated with the model Unibest-TC. First, sediment transport sensitivity on a straight slope due to varying parameters (wave height, wave period, grain size, slope steepness, water depth and magnitude of Longuet-Higgins streaming) is analysed. Besides, non-dimensional numbers and transport equations were considered to extend the analysis. In the analysis the dominance, direction and magnitude of the wave related and current related transport of both the bed load and suspended load is investigated. Subsequently, sediment transport due to variable wave conditions on various depth contours is examined from the shoreface profile of Noordwijk. Also the situations with a variable wave angle and a tidal current was considered. Finally, morphological simulations, including a 100-year profile evolution and profile perturbations (e.g. sand pits) located on the lower shoreface, were performed. Shoreface sediment transport depends on the wave steepness in combination with the slope steepness for every depth contour. This was concluded by analysing sediment transport sensitivity for a range of parameter settings. Sediment transport due to wave action is particular present on the upper shoreface. Although, the onshore directed bed load transport is dominant on the lower shoreface (provided that the orbital velocity induced shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress), its relative contributions is negligible in case a tidal current is included. It was found that low amplitude waves are responsible for the largest profile changes. On the lower shoreface, the tidal current induced offshore sediment transport is dominant. Onshore transport on the upper shoreface and offshore transport on the lower shoreface induce a lower shoreface flattening and an upper shoreface steepening. Perturbations located at the -15m, -20m and -25m NAP depth contours propagate shoreward caused by tidal current induced concentration gradients. Sediment transport induced by waves result in diffusion of profile perturbations and a limited shoreward shifting. Only at -15m NAP a clearly visible propagation is visible. A situation including a tidal current, results in a larger shoreward propagation of the sand pits/artificial ridges at -25m NAP than at -15m NAP. A larger depth dependent tidal velocity induced sediment transport gradient at -25m NAP is responsible for this phenomenon. So, the interaction of waves and tidal currents is of great importance on the entire shoreface profile and may have a large impact on cross-shore sediment transport.","Cross-shore sediment transport; shoreface; Unibest-TC; Profile perturbations; Holland Coast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Pont, S.C. (mentor)","2013","have everything to do with the topic adressed in this project. For this project a research is performed on what the next accent lighting for fashion stores should be. Lighting in fashion retail is crucial because the colors of the clothes and the perception of the clothes has everything to do with the purchase behaviour of the customers. An important aspect of this research is to understand the fashion retail and listen to the people that are actually from the business. Therefore prejudices and general known items should be put aside and a clean sheet should be gained to actually learn what the key values of the fashion retail are. During the research it became clear that the design of the accent lighting is not the core value or core problem. The core value is fl exibility, to distinguish a store from another store brand identity becomes more and more important. To keep this fresh and new, everything should be fl exible. Flexibility is not only needed in appearance but also in aiming the light. In that way the light design can also help to keep a fresh and renewing image. Especially in the target area of young industrial stores is this very important. The core problem pops up with this idea of fl exible light aiming. Light is one of the undervalued costs on the total budget for a store, which means that regular personnel is not trained in re-aiming light, this also results in fear for breaking the luminaires when handling it. After several ideas a concept came up which supplies a total ceiling structure. The system is called Luce Pilota and has 4 components: ceiling tiles, luminaire, aimballs and a screen interface. With this system it is very easy and fast to change the light design and it can even teach in creating a better light design. The whole handling of the light happens from the ground without climbing up and down due to motor steered luminaires. The perception is based on where the light has to come, not where the luminaire is. This a whole new approach in working with light systems. Until now everything was based on getting a luminaire as fl exible as possible. But within Luce Pilota the luminaire is just a part of the total system and is used to get the light on the right spot. The pointing out of location where light should be with aimballs is also a innovative solution in the ease of aiming light. In this way multiple people can work together on one light design in a very fast way. With just one push on the button the complete light layout can than be positioned to the requested settings. The concept is validated by people from both the headquarters of fashion retailers as by people from the actual shop floor. Especially the ease of aiming the light and the fl exibility the system offers is seen as a huge advantage. It creates freedom in changing the shop experience and can be even brought further in highlighting special areas with for example new clothes or sales. The shop window can kept fresh by focusing on different aspects each time, without putting different products or mannequins in it. One downside on this concept is that it is rather expensive and a lot of development is needed to cut those costs. Also the implementation of the system needs a perception change from the retailers. They need to see that lighting is more important then how it is perceived now. Therefore a phase by phase implementation is needed, which means that the actual concept can not be implemented at once. In that way the industry can get used to this renewment of light design.","retail; lighting; accent lighting; spots; aiming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-01-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design - Retail Design","",""

The aim of the project is to understand how home users conduct the home lighting design activities and design a tool based on the user-centered insights. The project comprises of three phases, research, conceptualization and evaluation. In the research phase, literature on light and lighting design was studied to form a theoretical basis for further exploration. The literature research has found that most of the knowledge, principle and design process are developed for professionals and commercial spaces. The necessity of developing a tool for home users is outlined, in which the professional knowledge should be translated in a plain and simple way. A contextual study was performed to gather insights by approaching the targeted users. The contextual study has revealed a four-step framework, Problem-Design-Evaluation-Execution, which demonstrates how home users conduct the lighting design process. Under the framework, insights are classified into contextual facts, problems, wishes and demands. Similar solutions on the market were also analyzed to find a unique positioning for the new tool. It is found that no current solution supports the process of home lighting design very well. The link between different design phases is missing whereas the supports for each phase are not adequate, especially for the phase of design evaluation. The research findings led to the formulation of design focus in concept development, which was “To develop a tool which assists users with their creative activities in the process of home lighting design.” A number of design criteria were also created to guide the conceptualization. - Link the various phases in design process - Cater to individual situations - Preventing the obtrusive experience - Response to user habits - Utilize the characters of online interaction - Novel and creative - Feasibility In the conceptualization phase, 6 concepts were proposed, selected with user-centered design methods. The final concept is a home lighting design APP that provides users with fast and extensive information of a lighting fixture through augmented reality. By scanning the image of a lamp from magazine, shops and websites, people are able to see a great number of design examples, product specifications, customer reviews and the lighting effect in their home. For the light setting designed by the users, the tool also gives diagnosis based on the intended atmosphere. The final evaluation was done with an interactive prototype of the concept. At the end of the report, suggestions are made that in short-term the concept should fix the usability problems as well as improve the key functions based on the user test feedbacks; in long term, some features of the concept can be developed into independent applications with advanced functions. A group of home lighting design tools will be arranged as a tool kit to meet more personalized demands of the targeted users.","Iphone application; lighting; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); De Wit, L. (mentor); Van der Goot, F. (mentor)","2013","Dredging and reclamation works are known to generate significant amounts of turbidity. In most coastal zones around the world, the resulting clouds of suspended fine sediment bring along environmental risks. Dredging contractors take mitigating measures to prevent free spreading of turbidity, which is usually also demanded by their clients and the local authorities. One possibility is the application of hanging silt screens, which are flexible, virtually impermeable screens. They are intended to divert the sediment-laden current towards the opening between the screen's lower edge and the bottom, which is thought to result in rapid settling of the dredging spill. The effectiveness of hanging silt screens when subjected to cross flow is doubted by those parties experienced with their application, because sediment can still pass the screen by horizontal or vertical diversion (around the screen’s side edges and below the screen’s lower edge respectively). Hence this research aims to obtain insight into the most important processes determining transport of suspended sediment in the vicinity of hanging silt screens and to determine the effectiveness of hanging silt screens under varying circumstances. A large series of numerical simulations with varying flow velocity, screen height, screen width, settling velocity of the sediment, water depth and upstream sediment concentration profile is conducted. The process of vertical diversion is investigated in a 3D modeling approach using large eddy simulation (LES). Performance of this numerical model is validated by means of laboratory experiments. The process of horizontal diversion is assessed with a two-dimensional horizontal (2DH) modelling approach. It appears that the turbulent structures resulting from flow separation at the screen’s lower edge give rise to intense downstream mixing. This process prevents the screen from being effective when compared to a reference situation (without a screen) in terms of reducing the environmental threat posed by suspended fine sediment. The figure illustrates this finding. Furthermore, significant amounts of horizontal flow diversion occur when lateral restrictions are absent. This counteracts the intended use of silt screens as a vertical current deflector. Finally, flow contraction around the screen’s lower edge causes high near-bed flow velocities, which enhances erosion if erodible bed material is available. Efforts should be made to convince all parties involved in dredging practice of these findings, so that protection of the marine environment can make another step forward.","silt screen; dredging; LES; turbidity; mitigation measure; environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

Long term missions require supplies, which can be transported to the Moon by a new promising solution: the Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) stage. The goal of this study is to create a conceptual system design (phase 0) of such a SEP stage for Earth-Moon cargo transfer missions. The design is driven by the propulsion and electric power system, which are the main focus of the study, although all other subsystems are also covered to obtain a holistic system design. Designing a SEP stage is a multi-disciplinary task, in which the trajectory analysis, propulsion system and electric power system are tightly coupled. A mission analysis program is created for simulation of the spiral transfer, while flexible design tools are developed to create the conceptual design. The tools provide the possibility to quickly evaluate a different mission scenario, such that the most suitable scenario, in consultation with the customer, can be selected. Aconceptual design is created that meets the mission objectives and requirements. During the design phase it was identified that the concept of a solar electric propulsion stage, accommodates some critical issues and technological challenges. Especially the high power demand, leads to the usage of highly conceptu l power conditioning techniques, which still have to be proven in space, possibly by a precursor mission. It was also found that the SEP stage, compared to a chemical rocket, is capable of transporting 32% more payload, while having the same initial mass. This number can even increase to 90% in case a different mission scenario, with a longer transfer duration, is selected.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

Deze veldwerk onderzoeken zijn verricht in het midden en noorden van Irak. Dit onderzoek bestaat uit vier delen om deze formatie te beschrijven. In het eerste hoofdstuk wordt de dikte en diepte van deze formatie bepaald. De dikte bedraagt van 125 tot 310 m en de diepte van de bovengrens van deze formatie bedraagt tussen 2800 en 4500 m. De informatie over de diepte wordt gebruikt voor het maturatie onderdeel; hierdoor kan de gemiddelde temperatuur bepaald worden. In hoofdstuk twee worden de geologische ontwikkelingen voor, tijdens en na de afzetting van de Chia Gara formatie behandeld. In dit deel wordt ook het afzetting milieu besproken. Er wordt geconcludeerd dat in de onderliggende formaties van Chia Gara grootschalig evaporieten werden afgezet. De schalies en kalksteen van de Chia Gara formatie zijn diep mariene afzetting, waarbij hoge organische hoeveelheid in deze twee gesteentes terug gevonden worden. In het derde deel van dit onderzoek wordt gekeken naar het TOC (Total Organic Carbon, oftewel totale organische koolstof) gehalte. Door boorkernen in het laboratorium te onderzoeken wordt het TOC gehalte exact bepaald. Een andere mogelijke manier om het TOC gehalte in te schatten is door metingen te verrichten in de boorputten. Dit geeft weliswaar niet de exacte waardes aan, maar geeft een schatting van het TOC gehalte en organisch materiaal. Dit kan worden gedaan door het bepalen van het uranium gehalte. De TOC kwaliteit van de Chia Gara formatie is goed tot uitstekend. De formatie bevat een minimale TOC percentage van 0.7 en een maximale waarde van 18 procent en is daardoor een uitstekende moedergesteente. In het laatste hoofdstuk wordt een link gelegd met hoofdstuk één. In dit deel wordt teruggekeken naar de diepte, zodat de maturatie van dit gesteente bepaald kan worden. Dit wordt gedaan met behulp van de temperature-time index. De Chia Gara formatie heeft een temperatuur van 60 OC tot ongeveer tussen 110 en 140 graden ondergaan. Dit is een zeer gunstige temperatuur voor maturatie, waardoor koolwaterstoffen zijn ontstaan.","moedergesteente; Chia Gara","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-27","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

Disturbed integration is suggested to underlie many movement disorders. Cortical and afferent signals can integrate in the spinal cord and at supraspinal centres, though the exact location and mechanism of integration are unknown yet. The goal of this study is to assess the cortical involvement during the stretch reflex response. Mechanically induced stretches of the muscle flexor carpi radialis where combined with subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, 97% of active motor threshold) at interstimulus intervals ranging from 35 to 80 ms. Muscle response was measured using high-density electromyography (EMG), providing additional spatial muscle activation patterns. Magnitude of resulting EMG reflex activity, i.e. short (M1, 20-50 ms) and long (M2, 55-100 ms) latency reflex responses were compared to stretch-only trials. Subthreshold TMS was found to significantly increase the stretch evoked EMG response (p < 0.001) when TMS pulses were timed to arrive at the muscle in the time window of the M2 response. Absence of facilitation of the spinally mediated M1 response indicates that integration of cortical and afferent feedback signals in M2 occurs at a supraspinal level. Spatial muscle activation patterns of suprathreshold TMS were consistent over trials, while spatial patterns due to stretch reflexes were less consistent. Spatial patterns of combined trials are therefore not conclusive about the mechanism of integration.","stretch reflex; transcranial magnetic stimulation; high density electromyography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2013","Background The general objective of this research is to investigate the use of ferrofluids in planar bearings for precision stages. Ferrofluids are suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles in a base fluid. When in a magnetic field, these particles are attracted and the fluid is pressurized. The induced pressure can be used to carry a load. This principle is sometimes applied in rotational bearings, but the intended use in planar bearings is new. Planar ferrofluid bearings are promising because of the expected absense of stick-slip, which allows high precision positioning. In contrast to other hydrostatic bearings, no pumps or seals are needed. The attainable loads will likely not be as high. So potentially, planar ferrofluid bearings can be a cheaper alternative for a high precision application using low loads, such as microscopy. Objectives The first aim of the research was understanding the static behavior of ferrofluids in magnetic fields and—using this knowledge—predicting the load capacity of a bearing. The second goal was finding the dynamic behavior and showing the absense of stick-slip. Finally, the possibility of precise positioning was to be proven within the scope of a future application in a microscope stage by building a linear demonstrator stage. Methods After finding the important static ferrofluid effects, a method to predict the load capacity was developed using multi physics finite element analysis. This method was validated with measurements. Then, using theory on ferrofluid viscosity, a model for the fluid friction was made. Friction measurements were performed to check its validity and test the absence of stick-slip. Finally, a linear stage including all the nescessary electronics was designed and realized to prove the possibility of high precision positioning. Results The pressures calculated with the FEM model were within 20% of measurements. The developed modeling method is therefore a useful tool for designing ferrofluid bearings. Friction measurements showed no stick-slip and only displayed viscous friction, as expected. The damping turned out to be non-constant with stroke length and speed. The designed stage can be positioned with a precision of ? = 10nm at sensor location in one direction, over a range of 2[cm], proving the ferrofluid bearing concept to be suitable for high precision positioning.","planar ferrofluid bearings; precision stages","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","The optimization of high-thrust interplanetary trajectories continues to draw attention. Especially when both Multiple Gravity Assists (MGA) as well as Deep Space Maneuvers (DSMs) are included, the optimization is typically very difficult. The search space may be characterized by a large number of minima and is furthermore very sensitive to small deviations in the decision vector. Various options are available to model these high-thrust trajectories. The trajectory may be modeled using a simple MGA trajectory model as well as using models including DSMs. Both a position and a velocity formulation variant may be adopted and also unpowered or powered swing-bys may be used. These trajectory models were implemented to study the effect of both DSM as well as powered swing-bys. Especially the option to perform DSMs proved to be vital for obtaining good trajectories. Also powered swing-bys may improve the efficiency of the trajectory. The velocity formulation variant proved to be much easier to optimize than the position formulation model. By analyzing the sensitivity and dependency of the various parameters in both models, a proposal for an even better trajectory model is suggested. Also regarding the optimization of these trajectories many options are available. Especially metaheuristics have proven to be very successful in optimizing these trajectories. Various studies have shown the importance of proper tuning of the basic versions of these metaheuristics, which is however often overlooked. This study applied a very rigorous tuning scheme to find the optimal settings for DE, GA and PSO. The results clearly reveal the superiority of DE above other methods. The tuned variants of DE outperformed other settings by one or multiple orders of magnitude, revealing the importance of this tuning scheme. The tuned variants of DE helped to improve a large number of instances in the Global Optimization Trajectory Problem (GTOP) database of ESA. Also the efficiency of these DE variants was shown to be competitive with, and sometimes better than, the best algorithms encountered in literature.","Deep Space Maneuver; optimization; GTOP; high-thrust; interplanetary; trajectory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-26","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

We have set out to demonstrate the possibilities of such an accidental infrastructure in the field of indoor localization. An ambient device in itself is not intentionally prepared for localization purposes, but using many of them together and combining the collected data can surpass the devices' limited individual capabilities. Our approach was to build a prototype system based on a homogeneous array of radio-connected nodes and an additional entity with a higher magnitude of computing power. This central entity then controls the data collection from the nodes and executes a custom localization algorithm, based on probabilistic methods and a Kalman filter. We have evaluated our system both by simulations with ideal input data and by real-world measurements. The results show that the system is able to track and update the location estimates, but due to the heavy multipath effect it is only capable of very moderate improvements.","accidental infrastructure; embedded wireless sensor networks; internet of things; kalman filter; probabilistic localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","","",""

An adhoc approach towards tourist accommodation developments may have major, economic, social and environmental impacts. If in the future Curaçao only maximizes economic benefits and ignores environmental issues, it may experience the pitfall of unsustainable mass tourism. Tourism developments have been identified as a tool for local economic development and could also contribute towards social development of communities, and conservation of the natural environment. If managed and developed in a sustainable way. In order to determine what the effects of physical tourism developments are on the economy, society and the environment, a set of sustainability indicators (SIs) has been selected and assessed which has lead towards guidelines and a sustainable vision for plantage Santa Catharina located in Curacao. The objectives of the study were to determine the elements of sustainable tourism developments from existing literature; to identify a framework for selecting both generic and site-specific SIs; to select appropriate indicators for tourism developments in Curacao context; and to do a baseline assessment of three tourist development sites to determine the suitability of the selected methods and indicators. Data were collected by making use of structured interviews and collected data from Curacao tourism bureau which served as primary source of material in the attempt to develop sustainability assessment maps (SAMs). The research draws on the work of Ko (2005) in which he developed a conceptual approach for conducting a sustainable assessment. His work is used as a basis for the research, because of the scope of this study only three dimensions has been analysed. The results of the study show that the identified indicators provide a means of determining overall sustainability of physical tourism developments. Visualizing research findings is a good way of presenting data to interested parties that are involved in planning, monitoring aspect of tourism developments. Throughout the process of the research and study for this paper, it has become obvious that there are a huge number of directions for future research in relation to this similar area. In order to conduct a further and deeper research study, some indications are provided as these are: -Further analysis of Ko (2005) Sustainable assessment the other nine dimensions. Example this research was based only on three dimensions. -Further analysis of Sustainable assessment on tourism developments. Example this research was based on SIDS, it is better to sample from a worldwide level. -Further analysis of the development of good practice in sustainable tourism through developing a transparent measurement, monitoring and reporting system. - Further analysis of eco certificate for tourism developments, awarded good practice examples, e.g. Fiskars Village (Finland), the winner from the Royal Awards for sustainable tourism. The above recommendations are made for improving the overall sustainability of tourism developments. Finally there needs to be a more manageable overview of indicators.

As a result, secondary changes such as increased passive stiffness and plastic CNS rearrangements aggravate the paresis. We propose an intervention that compensates the passive stiffness, enabling the remaining muscle force to initialize movement to prevent immobilization and disuse and to maximize controllability. Passive stiffness compensation is achieved by applying negative stiffness. The research question is: Does negative stiffness increase active RoM and how does this effect controllability of the ankle joint. Methods: By applying, subject speci?c, negative sti?ness on an electrical joint manipulator the change on active RoM and controllability of the ankle joint by di?erent levels of stiffness compensation is assessed. Ten healthy and two UMND patients participated in this study. Results: Active dorsi?exion RoM increased with 27.81% with the largest negative stiffness (50%) compensation (p=0.001) compared to the RoM in normal (0%) compensation. Muscle activation did not differ between the conditions. Jerk of the ankle was 59.51% (p<0.001) of the normal (0%) compensation condition with 50% negative stiffness. Conclusion: Negative stiffness compensation enabled the subjects to achieve a larger dorsi?exion RoM using the same voluntary muscle activation.

The purpose of this thesis is to get a better understanding of the hydrodynamic and morphological behaviour of the St Lucia inlet with the additional effect of the Mfolozi River discharge. The focus in this thesis is on the period after 2001 till present, where the management policy is to let the St Lucia inlet function in its natural state and with the possibility to join with the Mfolozi River. A model with a schematized situation of the estuary with representative inlet geometry is forced with representative waves and tide conditions. Important factors determining the inlet stability such as tidal prism, longshore sediment transport, inlet geometry and river discharge are investigated in this thesis. The Mfolozi River mouth and St Lucia Estuary entrance are situated in a seasonal varying climatic regime with long drought periods with low riverine flows followed by wet periods and cyclonic events. A high energy wave climate in combination with a micro-tidal regime and a high rate of longshore sediment transport are the most important factors of the instability of the St Lucia inlet. According to Bruun (1978) inlets that are classified with a P/M ratio below twenty are found to be unstable and the inlet may be closed by deposition of sediment during a storm event because the tidal prism is relative small. In line with Bruun, the St Lucia inlet can be classified as an unstable inlet with a low P/M ratio of approximately two. Three scenarios were developed with different estuary dimensions; a small, a medium and a large basin. The inlet geometry is the same in the scenarios and each scenario is modelled with five different simulations. The simulations are forced at the boundaries by a varying range of tide and wave conditions. The tide is varied from average to neap and spring tide. The wave height is varied from average to higher and extreme wave heights. Higher waves are responsible for a higher rate of longshore sediment transport and with both varying tide and wave conditions a wide range of P/M ratios are modelled. In addition the influence of a lower D50 was investigated, and the influence of the Mfolozi River was simulated. The results of the simulations show that they are in line with expectations. Small P/M ratios show that inlets are unstable and different closure mechanisms are observed. Similar to what is found in nature regarding the A-P relationship, a decreasing cross-sectional area with a lowering tidal prism, is also found with the Delft3D models which suggest that the model is capable of giving a good representation of the morphodynamics.","St Lucia; Mfolozi River; closure mechanisms; tidal inlet stability; process-based modeling; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

A serious game on flood risk management and housing/urban development for the most urbanised island of the California coast. In the California Delta the flood protection for most islands is not up to the required standards. This is also the case for Bethel Island, one of the most urbanized islands in this region. The Bethel Island Improvement District (BIMID), the local agency concerned with maintaining and upgrading levees is seriously hampered by money shortage and a lack of support by both higher government and residents of the island. The failure probability for the levees on Bethel Island, caused by seismic events and high water levels, is estimated at 8% per year although no major floods have happened for about a century. Statewide environmental issues such as increasing salinization and pressure on wildlife habitat play an important role in flood risk management for Bethel Island, several reports suggest that failures caused by seismic events which are likely to happen in the near future could paralyze the freshwater supply for the Central Valley and urban areas in the Bay area and Southern California. Currently Bethel Island has around 2,600 residents and especially in summer time many tourists are visiting the island. The island has several marinas and most houses are built on or close to the levee. The levees are to be upgraded to the PL84-99 standard according to the Five Year plan (2011 - 2016), however this was already initiated 15 years ago and the improvements are not on schedule. The levees are not at the required standard to be eligible for emergency aid by FEMA in case of a flood, so there is a problem with weak levees and if they fail there will be no emergency aid to help recover from the disaster. Serious gaming is a tool to give insight in decision processes of investing in levee maintenance and upgrades over a long time period and raising awareness amongst people involved such as residents and potential project developers. Therefore, it would be an excellent tool to take a look at some possible future strategies of Bethel Island, and facilitate a discussion with people involved about these strategies to initiate some movement in the current deadlock situation. Hence: SimBethel, a serious game about flood protection and risk management on Bethel Island. The SimBethel game is based on the Multi Layered Safety-game by Matti Janssen, which simulates development in a Dutch polder. This game is adapted and several aspects such as the factors time, money, levee strength and seismic events have been added. The game consists of a board game supported by a flood risk model and an economic model; certain specific problems on Bethel Island are discussed by the use of chance cards. The game is played by 3 players, each representing a stakeholder on Bethel Island: BIMID, project developers and the residents. The flood risk model is based on the Dutch VNK2-method, a state-of-the-art method for assessing flood risks in the Netherlands. However due to a lack of detailed information, especially on the levee conditions this method could not be fully implemented. In the game BIMID can execute levee projects to decrease the risk, however costs money which they can achieve by subsidy or taxes. The economic model simulates the money flow between the different players and other stakeholders. The framework of a board game supported by two models was tested on whether the project goals could be achieved with this game. It was concluded that the model had so many variables that the game was not suitable for raising awareness amongst residents. Therefore a simplified version of the game was made called 'SimBethel Educational'. This game is based on Monopoly and players are each in control of a levee reach. The game is won by the player who has raised his levee reach to the highest level first. Players can fund this with tax money collected from house owners and subsidy. To create more tax revenue players can build more houses, thus creating more income. The consequence is however that the risk is increased and in case of a flooding, players encounter more damage. This version of the game is also tested and was received with enthusiasm by both testers and Bethel Island residents. It was also observed that the game indeed raised awareness and created a better understanding on the principles of flood protection, risk and economic development amongst the residents who played the game. In conclusion, the SimBethel game has shown to be a tool to give a good overview of the different problems on Bethel Island for professionals. However the game is fairly complicated for first time players. This version of the game has been altered to become a better understandable version, but has not been properly tested yet. The SimBethel Educational game has shown first signs of being a very useful tool in raising awareness amongst Bethel Island residents. This game needs to be fine-tuned and tested more extensively but after that, developing the game for a larger audience such as other islands or polders specifically or schools in general could be a serious option.","serious game; flood risk; flood protection; California","en","student report","TU Delft, section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This report presents in structured way the development of a new port master plan for the Port of Beira. In Beira, waiting times are known to be very long and the port authorities have the desire to improve the port performance on this matter. Therefore a Harboursim model of the present situation of the Port of Beira is built, which is used to simulate the maritime traffic. For Beira Port, processes are added to the Harboursim model code to make a good representation of the reality. Furthermore, the Harboursim model is improved, by fixing errors in the model code. The adaptions made in the code are generally applicable for all future Harboursim models. This study is a case study for the ‘Adaptive Port Planning’ (APP) framework, which is an addition to the master plan development. Using the framework, differences in the robustness of the master plan alternatives are determined. Furthermore, the robustness of the chosen alternative is increased, because actions for dealing with the vulnerabilities and opportunities associated with each alternative are determined.","master plan; Beira; Harboursim; Adaptive port planning; APP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and waterways","",""

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor); Paus-Buzink, S.N. (mentor)","2013","Nurses who work in care and nursing homes have to work hard. They have to fit a lot of tasks within a relatively short period of time, which makes them experience a high workload. In addition, it can have a harmful effect on the clients if the nurses who take care of them are in a hurry. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how an ICT solution could support the nurses in their communication and planning of work, to help them do their work better. The design brief comes from software developer helpLine B.V., who wants to investigate the possibilities for extending their business from solutions for homecare to the field of intramural care. First the work and work environment of nurses in care homes and nursing homes were investigated through interviews and observations in the field. Participants included nurses, managers and a planner. The research focused on the tools nurses use for communicating and organizing their work. Based on the findings from the research conclusions were drawn about how ICT could support the nurses in their work. The main conclusion was that nurses should be helped to spend their time more efficiently. A lot of time goes wasted because they have to walk a lot in the generally big homes. Information is stored in different places in the home. The individual client’s records must be stored in the clients’ apartments, which makes the nurses have to walk all the way there if they need to look up a birth date or a telephone number. The first criterion for an ICT solution is therefore to bring all that information together in one (virtual) place for the nurse. The different media and tools that they have to use should be reduced, so they have to keep an eye on less different things. The second criterion is that the ICT solution should provide nurses with a clear overview on their tasks. It should facilitate the making of task divisions among nurses and it should enable nurses to manage their personal ‘unofficial’ tasks. The third criterion for the ICT solution is that it should facilitate and stimulate a good communication among nurses. This means that it should include contact information from clients and other relevant people and institutions and it should show reminders if the nurses forget to read a message. The fourth criterion is that the solution should be simple in use, it should have a clear layout and the features should be unambiguous in their function. In addition to these four criterions requirements were formulated for a number of features that the ICT solution should include. Based on the discussed criteria a first design was generated. The design consisted of a web-based application with a number of features, i.a. a digital phonebook, the possibility to report about clients and the possibility to make ‘route lists’ (i.e. lists of tasks, based on the care needs from the clients). The design was iteratively evaluated by means of a mockup and improved on the basis of the results. First it was evaluated with two nurses from a nursing home, to assess each of the proposed functionalities on its usefulness and to determine how the features of the application should be structured. Based on the results the design was slightly altered. This process repeated two more times. After these three iterations a final design was made, in which each of the features was worked out in more detail. Subsequently, an online prototype was made. This prototype was subjected to a series of evaluations: Two group sessions with nurses and an interview with a manager. The evaluations mostly yielded results about the validation of the design, i.e. the appropriateness of each of the identified design criteria. The conclusion can be drawn that the main requirement and the four criteria as described above were well-chosen: Participants confirmed that they spend a lot of time walking because they have to search for information. They were pleased with a concept that presents all their information and tools in one place. An important conclusion for helpLine B.V. is that the concept is probably most successful when the application can link with other applications, e.g. with the program for staff scheduling and the HRM system. The strength of the design will be in bringing all the information from the different work aspects together, to present it to the users in a uniform and usable way.","ICT; Participatory design; Nurses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Besides the conventional GMRES algorithm, several approaches are discussed which supposedly reduce the computational costs of the method, and reduce the number of iterations needed to satisfy the convergence criteria. GMRES is one of the most popular methods for solving non-symmetric systems. The method is robust, i.e. the solution of the least squares problem always exists. GMRES does have full recurrences since the basis of the Krylov subspace needs to be stored completely. Also, orthogonalisation of new basis vectors becomes increasingly more expensive when the iterations proceed. GMRES minimizes the residual norm, as a result the residual norm decreases monotonically and the convergence is smooth.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Van der Horst, A.Q.C. (mentor); Terwel, K.C. (mentor); Robbemont, A. (mentor)","2013","During a design competition held in 2010, a preliminary design was made for an extension on top of the Oval tower. The Oval Tower is an existing building with a height of about 100m. However, following that competition, this design was never put into practice. According to experts in the field, this project still has a great potential. It was therefore chosen to further investigate the feasibility of this extension project and the feasibility of extended high-rise building in general. In the general building process, one of the first steps is to analyse whether a project is feasible, concerning the structural feasibility. The objective of this master’s thesis is to give insight in the multitude of factors which determine this feasibility and make-ability of an extension on top of an existing high-rise project. For the determination of these factors several reference projects have been investigated. Both existing research projects as well as existing extended buildings have been taken into account. Subsequently a Quick Scan of three buildings has been made. Using the results of the Quick Scan and the results of the research into existing projects and buildings several key factors were derived, of which an initial diagram was composed. In this diagram a division was made between a technical, a functional and a financial inventory. It was chosen to mainly focus on the technical feasibility factors in the further research. The most important technical factors were found to be: use of materials, loads, level of safety, load bearing capacity of structural elements and construction methodology. Further investigation has been done throughout these factors. As a starting point for the calculations on the Oval Tower case study the diagram was used. Using this diagram and remaining data, calculations were made for the existing Oval Tower structure. It was shown that the core and the columns subjected to wind loads are the leading structural elements. Next to that it turned out that various other elements contain overcapacity. Using the findings on the present overcapacity in the Oval Tower structure, three alternatives for the extension were derived. The design alternative that posed minimal structural adaptations was eventually chosen to be most suitable. For this design alternative three construction methods were compared with the help of a trade off matrix. Investigating the three construction methods through this matrix led to a choice on the most appropriate building method. A detailed plan for this construction method was composed. Which factors determine the feasibility of an extension on top of a high-rise building? This question and its corresponding answer is the main topic of this master’s thesis. A diagram was composed in which the most important factors are shown and explained. Using the diagram as a starting point, a case study for the Oval Tower was conducted. The intention of this case study is to answer the question whether it is structurally feasible to extend the Oval Tower with two floors and a crown on top of the existing structure. Considering the Oval Tower extension case study it can be concluded that it is structurally possible to extend the tower with two additional floors as well as a crown structure on top. However the research also showed that structural strengthening of several building elements is necessary. For the functional and financial inventory several assumptions have been made, additional research on these inventories is needed.","high-rise; extension; existing building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

The congestion caused by incidents is an important cause of the unreliability of travel times. Travel time reliability should be incorporated in social cost benefit analyses for infrastructure investments. With an accurate forecast of travel time reliability a well-educated decision of the consequences of infrastructure investments on travel time reliability, can be made. A large number of incidents (car accidents and breakdowns) are simulated in marginal traffic models MIC (marginal incident computation) and MaC (marginal computation). The research shows that it is possible to forecast travel time variability from door to door in case of an incident, with explicit simulation of incidents in a dynamic traffic model within reasonable calculation time. This could be done because of the usage of marginal traffic models, MIC and MaC, reducing the number of calculations needed and therefor the calculation time.","travel time reliability; dynamic traffic assignment; travel time variability; incidents; car accidents; marginal traffic models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Papp, Z. (mentor)","2013","A fundamental problem in networked embedded systems is to know the runtime behaviour. Especially, the behaviour of self-organizing and adaptive systems is difficult to predict, because of the strong coupling with the environment. Monitoring this at runtime is difficult, because the only access is via the network. However, some properties need to be satisfied irrespective of the situation. Therefore the goal of this thesis is to monitor correctness properties at runtime efficiently. The focus is on temporal and distributed system-level properties. The system is modelled as a network of communicating finite-state machines, that operate asynchronous. Each node produces a stream of locally observable primitive events. High-level knowledge can be obtained by specifying an interest in temporal and distributed patterns in the events. From the specification an event detection tree is generated, which monitors the runtime behaviour by detecting the patterns. We show that event ordering is of fundamental importance for the implementation. To make efficient use of the scarce resources the tree is distributed in the network with a centralized distribution algorithm. A proof-of-concept is developed to evaluate the taken approach. Experiments run on a network of wireless nodes show that the cost of distributed monitoring is lower than when centralized in certain topologies. Simulations show that this is not the case with a random topology. Further, in the experiments only a few seconds delay is measured in the detection process. A limitation of the taken approach is that the unreliability of the network has a negative impact on the performance; missing events is an issue. Finally, the applicability is shown to the verification of an application for structural integrity monitoring.","Distributed; Event; Pattern; Networked; Embedded; Monitoring; Order; Verification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor); Groenendaal, T. (mentor); Nagtegaal, Y. (mentor)","2013","Evening Breeze is a Dutch company founded in 2008. What Evening Breeze provides is an innovative and sustainable alternative to traditional air conditioning products, focusing on specifically the sleeping context. The Evening Breeze products offer comfort cooling experience while ensures a tremendous amount of energy saving, to not only the clients from tropical high-end resort market, but also the up-scale residential market. The purpose of this report is to help Evening Breeze exploring the market opportunity in China, due to the huge consumption power and increasing living standard among Chinese high-end consumers. Same as in the revolutionary theory, “Survival of the fittest” is also proved in the marketing competition, especially for the import brands that doesn’t yet have much awareness in the target region. Numerous foreign brands entered the Chinese market wanted to hold a share, some of them achieved big accomplishment while most of the remaining didn’t market well despite of their great success in their originate country. Under what strategy Evening Breeze should enter the Chinese market will require contemporary study on the relevant industry, competitors, consumers and as well as the resources of Evening Breeze itself. From the desk research conducted on the relevant domain and field study in pre-selected first-tier cities, it was concluded that Evening Breeze's market potential in China is big, and is beneficial for a long-term market development. From a product perspective, the Chinese audiences were impressed by the innovative and sustainable cooling idea of Evening Breeze, however most of them find the appearance of current model too radical/organic, and of limited options in product form as well as functionalities so that the added value is not high enough for a high-end positioning. Another vital finding from the research is that the communication focus of Evening Breeze product should vary from current situation. For the Chinese residential market, healthy attribute is significant, which have not been stressed adequately; for the hospitality on the other hand, practical benefit such as energy-saving is vital which did not taken as important selling point for private consumers. Thus a product redesign needs to be realized before formulating the launching strategy for Evening Breeze to enter the Chinese market. A concept development process was conducted, under the inspiration from particular Chinese context and latent need from the target audiences. The new design of the Evening Breeze climate system is implemented in a way that, more stable and classic from the appearance, so that the new product portfolio together with the current model could appeal more taste. And new functions were designed which is more emotional appealing and higher the added value of the product. The Chinese air-conditioner market is big yet highly homogeneity. Most high-end models are already featured with ""energy-saving"", ""comfort"", ""healthy"", ""silence"", etc. that Evening Breeze is communicating, yet with cheaper price. Thus Evening Breeze should communicate itself towards a high-end climate system not only providing physical benefit but also elicit inner satisfaction by the innovative design, unique cooling experience and premium quality from a Dutch-originate brand. From a marketing campaign point of view, Evening Breeze is suggested to targeting at hospitality market from the short-run, in order to have market breakthrough. The residential retail market is much stable and lasting comparing to resort projects, thus is suggested to be focused from a long run. Various promotional/retail channels are possible in China, while cooperating with B2B channels (e.g. interior designer or hotel development company) is with top priority, due to the higher profit and less fixed cost required.","Redesign; ViP; Launch strategy; Chinese market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-01-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design, Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Tata steel is a big and interesting plant which handles all the production steps from raw materials to strip products. The total supply chain is a balanced chain of products prepared for the client. This research is done in the Oxygen Steel factory (OSF2), the “kitchen” of the steelmaking process. OSF2 is a critical chain in the total plant in IJmuiden. The blast furnaces provide a continuous flow of hot metal, which is a continuous input for OSF2. If the production in OSF2 falls still, this results in immediate production loss for Tata Steel IJmuiden. For the production process the resources around the process play an important part. Since OSF2 was build in 1968 all kinds of problems occurred concerning ventilation problems and dust distribution. A lot has been changed around the factory with new developments around the steelmaking and to provide higher production rates. Research on this has been done in the past but a lot of the recommendations has not been implemented. The production process is very dependent on the resources used around it. These resources are cranes, materials and employees working with and around the process. Because of the increased production volume the disturbances for the resources because of heat and dust has increased as well. The emissions from some sections of the factory have increased significantly through the years, and the dust in the factory causes a lot of inconvenience. Waste flows are identified per location and combined with different aggregates injected into the process. Heat points within the factory are mostly causes by the production process. On these points heavy cooling is installed. Heat losses also come from the steel pans transported through the factory; but not as heavily as the production process affect the factory. All these questions and information lead to a problem statement; “Develop an overall concept to reduce the disruptive influence of heat and dust inside the factory”","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Models that provide predictions of race performance already exist for individual time trials. It is proposed that with a performance model for team time trials, the performance of different strategies can be compared and optimised.<br/>In literature combinations of mechanical resistance models and physiological models are used to determine the performance of individual time trials. The aerodynamic interaction between cyclists is very important to the effectiveness of a strategy. Coefficients of drag reduction between cyclists in a team time trial are presented in several studies, however most studies use groups of only four cyclists, which is not useful for a team time trial with eight cyclists. Only two studies report data for groups up to eight cyclists. These two models show different behaviour and are both used to asses the performance of strategies. Also two physiological models were used.<br/>In the model provided in this study the resistances are calculated from the kinematics resulting from the evaluated strategy. The mechanical resistance model, including the aerodynamic interaction model calculates the power required to perform the strategy. The physiological model calculates the physiology during the race, which determines if the cyclists are able to sustain the prescribed strategy.<br/>Genetic algorithm optimisation is used to optimise the strategy parameters, such as initial position and times spend in first position. The velocity is optimised for each evaluated strategy configuration. A convergence test was performed to determine the parameters for the genetic algorithm, which are used in the optimisation of strategy.<br/>Using the standard strategy, where cyclists only change from first to last position, different orders are compared. From this study it was determined that the mean velocity over a 30 km team time trial could be raised by a maximum of 0.228 m/s by improving the order, depending on the model configuration. It was found that the best performing orders were those where the mean performance difference of following cyclists was lowest.<br/>Two different strategies have been assessed where cyclists still always change from first, but not necessarily last position have been assessed on their performance. With those more complex strategies the mean velocity could be increased with 0.358 m/s over a 30 km team time trial. <br/>The model still lacks validity, but gives a relevant insight in the performance of different team time trial strategies. The validity can either improved by using track test to validate the drag reduction coefficients or by using power data from a team time trial to show that the model predicts realistic physiology. Of those two methods the last is preferred.","Cycling; Optimisation; Physiology; Aerodynamics; Modeling; sports engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-09","","","","","",""
