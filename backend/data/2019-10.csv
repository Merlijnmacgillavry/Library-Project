Meanwhile, construction activities have been carried out by both government and private developers to provide more affordable housing for the urban poor. However, there is a tendency that what a megapolis should look like is judged mainly by its form rather than the process, which gives chance to the real estate construction industry. High-rise and mid-rise towers have been built for slum dwellers, mainly migrants, which completely ignores their existing living habits and economical features. The 'modern' life differs from original rural life of migrants, leading to the social isolation as well.

In addition, the overlooking of socio-cultural values can contribute to the expansion of performance issues since it affects directly the work approach and behaviour of biogas owners. In a technical point of view, gas leakage is the most common issue occurred, and the plant design is a crucial aspect that influences the future performance of the biogas system. The main operational issues that negatively affect the biogas performance are the blockage of the inlet pipes, insufficient feeding activity, and the corrosion of biogas appliances. The amount of feedstock and water added in the plant is the most important information that necessitates a daily control but also other important parameters such as temperature, gas production, pH value, and agitation system. In terms of socio-cultural factors, it was possible to notice a common hierarchical attitude towards their workers among the biogas owners interviewed. This aspect was supported by a lack of communication between workers and owners hindering the interest of the first to share opinions and to take initiatives. The general context is characterised by the presence of vertical networks where limited cooperation among members of different groups dominates. As a result, the lack of technical support after the installation of the system from the biogas providers to biogas users hinder adequate maintenance. since the owners usually don't have sufficient technical knowledge to evaluate any problems.","biogas; Africa; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Scaling the model parameters is necessary to represent the muscle characteristics of the subjects and thus to pinpoint the differences in force capacity. Optimal Fiber (OFL) and Tendon Slack Length (TSL) have been identified as the two most influential parameters in muscle force generation. The goal of the current study is adjusting a lower-limb scaling algorithm for OFL and TSL to the Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model (DSEM). Furthermore, we evaluate the effect on the preservation of model consistency and muscle force production. Firstly, we scaled the DSEM geometrically. That drove twenty-two muscles to work out of the physiological range in the F-L curve up to 41% of the shoulder ROM. Moreover, the consistency of the model dropped by 78%. We tested three approaches to scale OFL and TSL. The constrained method delivered the best results reducing these percentages to 8% and 2.9%, respectively. It also increased the muscle force production of the DSEM 1.2%BW compared to the geometrically scaled version. The adaptation of the constrained scaling algorithm to the DSEM provides consistency values in the same range observed in lower-limb models. Therefore, we state that it is necessary to scale OFL and TSL whenever the dimensions of the DSEM are modified to obtain reliable muscle force estimations. We recommend further validation of the procedure developed in this article, for example, against data from instrumented endoprosthesis.","Musculoskeletal Model; Delft Shoulder and Elbow Model,; Optimal Fiber Length; Tendon Slack Length; Scaling; Upper-limb; Muscle-tendon parameters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-31","","","","","",""

For a spacecraft to be captured, its gravitational interaction with at least two celestial bodies has to be taken into account. Because of their fail-safe nature (eliminating the possibility of single point failures), their fuel efficiency and their wider launch windows, ballistic capture trajectories are of particular scientific and engineering interest. Capture orbits are characterized by a specific qualitative dynamics, defining almost-invariant regions in a given space, guiding transport phenomena; the introduction of structures, defining and bounding such domains, naturally follows. Traditionally, the set of initial conditions leading to capture, the Capture Set, has been computed by sampling the domain of interest, and hence analysing the forward and backward behaviour of the orbit associated to each sample. The main limitations of this approach reside in its large computational cost and, even for a dense grid, in the non-smooth approximation of the aforementioned boundary regions; the theory of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) has the potential of overcoming both limitations, allowing at the same time for a more insightful description of the phenomenon. In fact, Lagrangian Coherent Structures identify transport barriers in dynamical systems, separating regions with qualitatively different dynamics. The development of heuristics applicable to ballistic capture trajectory design and informed by such theory (i.e. flow-informed) appears desirable. In this research, different flow-informed approaches are presented and their relations with ballistic capture are discussed: following, a new heuristic, the Stroboscopic Strainline, is introduced. This new tool is therefore applied to different case studies at Mars, in order to approximate the capture sets associated to different numbers of revolutions and geometries. While a real-ephemerides model has been used to model the dynamical environments, different levels of fidelity have been investigated: perturbing forces have been introduced not only to obtain more accurate results, but also to test the robustness of the proposed technique with respect to different features of the underlying dynamical model. Finally, it is shown how Stroboscopic Strainlines are a good candidate for characterizing the qualitative behaviour of ballistic trajectories, both forward and backward in time.","Ballistic capture; Weak Stability Boundary; Low-energy transfers; Lagrangian Coherent Structures; Lyapunov exponents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Charles Darwin has suggested that “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change” Could this land pressure be controlled by re-thinking the existing building typologies ? Hybrid infrastructure could be another key innovation to control the expansion of cities, the idea is not to design more but rather to re-think the current process of infrastructure design to make it more eﬃcient. Is it possible to hybridize ‘the elements of space making’ to create spatial hybrids. Elements that serve multiple purposes behaving in duality. Will the hybridization of these ‘spatial elements’ result in hybridization of building types eventually leading to an evolved hybrid building typology which could reduce land pressure as well as expand the existing vocabulary of the built environment. The research focuses on identifying this language of architecture and then hybridizing it to evolve the built environment by demonstrating a case of a hybrid of a bridge (infra structural element for movement) and a cultural center (infra structural element of habitation) and hence proposes an ‘Inhabitable Bridge’ in the east of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The hybridization of these elements could also lead to questioning ‘the way of looking at things” .For instance, a staircase is always perceived as a means to go from one level to another. This creates a construct in the designers head and limits its perception as a transition element. This new architectural language could forces users to experience and question there pre-conceived constructs by generating arguments within a persons mind eventually questioning ‘types’ and ‘typologies’ in design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The urbanisation is so rapid in many areas that it is not beneficial to carry out expensive surveys which are quickly out of date. The work carried out by community-mapping project Dar Ramani Huria (Swahili for ""Open map"") aims to make a detailed map of Dar es Salaam, to enable the hydrologic models to approach the real situation more closely. However, the surveying methods used until recently are not sufficiently accurate. However, an alternative emerges in the form of community members using a low-cost, dual-frequency global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver during surveys. However, before this receiver can be implemented a detailed research has to be done. In this thesis the horizontal and vertical performance of the U-blox ZED-F9P receiver in Delft (the Netherlands) and Dar es Salaam is studied. The research is divided into two parts: performance and case study. For the performance study a series of post-processed kinematic (PPK) experiments were conducted in Delft and Dar es Salaam. The experiments have been designed in order to provide a variety of location, antenna-performance, baseline length, software package and movability. In addition, two re-initialisation experiments were conducted to measure how fast the interrupted GNSS signal is regained by the receiver. The case study focused on the desirability and feasibility, mainly focussing on accuracy, of implementation in the project of Dar Ramani Huria. Structured and unstructured interviews with employees of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tanzania were held to find out the requirements of implementation. The positioning performance of the receiver varies between the different experiments. The conclusions regarding the positioning performance are based on the scatter plots in the horizontal plane and the positioning over time for the three separate directional components; East, North and Up. The values for the horizontal performance (RMS East, RMS North) and for the vertical performance (RMS Up) of the fix solutions insofar as they fall inside the 95% confidence ellipse are decisive. Only the relevant experiments, namely those who can map a larger area with a single reference station are taken into consideration. The horizontal positioning performance ranges from 1.13 till 16.83 However the latter, high value is from the 9 baseline Dar es Salaam experiment with a very low percentage of fixed solutions. If we disregard the experiments with low percentage of fixed solutions then the horizontal positioning performance ranges van 1.13 till 9.42. The vertical positioning performance shows less accuracy ranging from 3.56 till 14.75. If we compare this performance with the requirements for Dar Ramani Huria’s project, even the strictest of 2cm, the performance is more than adequate according to the ""few cm accuracy"" requirement. The experiment with the high-end antenna shows with values 2.44mm (RMS East) and 3.42mm (RMS North) the best horizontal and with the value 3.75$mm(RMS Up) the best vertical performance. Another factor influencing the performance is the location, in particular the aspect of atmospheric delay that varies between Dar es Salaam and Delft. This research thesis concludes that the implementation of the receiver in Dar Ramani Huria's project is well possible and that the performance of the receiver is adequate. This conclusion is confirmed by what is actually occurring in the field: HOT Tanzania and Dar Ramani Huria already started using the GNSS receiver and carrying out surveys with this receiver.","community mapping; performance study; GNSS; low-cost sensors; dual-frequency sensor; GNSS Positioning; Hydrological Modelling; Dar Ramani Huria; Humanitairian OpenStreetMap Team; GNSS receiver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The energy demands keep rising due to growth in population, increasing demand for healthy, comfort and productive indoor environment, global climate changing, and so on. This rapid increase in energy use in buildings represents a major issue especially in regions with extreme climate conditions. For instance, in tropical climates the major reason for the high energy consumption for any type of building is the use of air conditioning. Before the implementation of refrigeration technologies in the building industry and the increase of thermal comfort levels, designers in tropical climates used to tackle the climate conditions using natural methods to prevent the building from unwanted heat and to control the heat gains from the surrounding environment. Thus, this research investigate the possibility of designing a purely passive building in order to reduce at minimum the energy consumption of an office building in tropical climates, combining the bioclimatic approach and passive cooling strategies. In particular, the design objective is to define to what extent can the cooling consumption of an office building be decreased. Different design strategies are implemented and tested through Building Performance Optimization (BPO). In specific, two optimization rounds are run. The first to investigate the impact of envelope parameters, and the second to investigate the impact of the envelope and indoor comfort parameters on the cooling consumption.","sustainabilty; Cooling; Tropical Climate; High Rise; Passive Design; Computational Design; optimization; building performance optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","1.290270, 103.851959"

Using clear zoning plans as a base, much was promised to the new inhabitants. These promises consisted of low rise houses for big families with children, surrounded by abundance of greenery, plenty of (public) space and – as one of the first in the Netherlands – separated traffic. Unfortunately, with altering the layout of Lelystad and moving the city centre away from Lelycentre, as a result of the refusal of realising the fourth polder Markermeer, this composition of different functions has radically changed and this changing is still ongoing. With the changing of composition, also the state of the area and the inhabitants changed. Of the 120.000 expected inhabitants, only 77.000 came at its peak. This resulted in lots of real estate as well as social problems, such as vacancy, neglection of public spaces, isolated groups with no interaction and a constantly aging population, accompanied by the migrating youth, which the municipality of Lelystad is, still to this day, trying to deal with. Amidst all the solutions the municipality is envisioning – which are strongly focused on helping the inhabitants with low-income with social-housing and the elderly with nursing homes – they are forgetting two important groups in the society. Those two groups are the migrating youngster – who find it difficult to find decent housing and jobs – and the wandering migrant workers, who likewise find it difficult to find proper housing and often end up with twenty-plus people living in private rented houses all over Lelystad. This graduation project focuses on those two forgotten groups. Transforming the partly vacant Smedinghuis – former Rijkswaterstaat office building – which stands in the area as a monumental icon and functions as a gateway to Lelycentre, into housing for the youngsters and the migrant workers, will not just give those two forgotten groups fitting housing, but it will also solve the vacancy problem of one of the first office buildings in Lelycentre. By giving the migrating youngsters proper housing and give them reason to stay, will help repulse the aging problem in the area as well. The same applies for housing the strayed migrant workers. Adjoining to that – which is not less important – this transformation will preserve a monumental icon in the area; Smedinghuis. For the design part of this graduation project, the use of Virtual Reality as a design tool was important.

The project therefore aims to create accessible and meaningful urban spaces, soften boundaries among income groups while having appropriate<br/>borders, provide opportunities for people participation in the development process, accommodate and encourage diversity, and combat segregation that has kept inhabitants from appropriation and participation, which all together bring The Right to the City to the people. Using Sriprastha, an existing deteriorating cooperative housing in the West of Nalasopara<br/>as a starting point, I would propose three new housing typologies that cater aspirations of different income groups, while being relatable to the existing buildings. These typologies would be offered to the existing residents as choices to redevelop their existing societies on a case by case basis. To show how these new typologies would be applicable in other areas, they would also be built from scratch on a neighboring empty plot, with a different configuration from the existing urban fabric. Ideas of participatory design, levels of intervention and control, mixed income housing, and cross subsidization would be explored. Ultimately, the project hopes to propose an alternative scenario from the current situation of complete exclusion of the urban poor, creating borders that act as “zones of exchanges”, rather than harsh boundaries.","India; Mumbai; Affordable Housing; Cross subsidized housing; Mixed Income Housing; Participatory design; Open Building Movement; Global South; Spatial Inequality; Global Housing; zones of exchanges; Nalasopara; right to the city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","19.422500, 72.808667"

Bundles already offer high-quality Miele washing machines on a “pay per wash” model to consumers. However, high lifecycle costs hinder the competitiveness of the business. This high cost is a result of the product (washing machine) and service (subscription model) not being developed in tandem with each other. The current washing machine is not designed for the Circular Economy (CE) and not designed for multiple use cycles.<br/> CE, Digital Technologies and Product Service Systems Different academics point out that digital technologies create opportunities for circular propositions (e.g., Ellen MacArthur Foundation,2016; Pagoropoulos et al., 2017; Bressanelli et al., 2018). The connection of products through the internet enables them to sense their own and their environments status, process this information and interact with their users. These capabilities help service providers to extend the useful life of products, maximise the utilisation of products, loop products through additional use cycles, regenerate natural capital from their products, and make sure these products are used efficiently. Bundles currently, uses a smart plug to connect their devices to the internet which generates little insights for users and the service. Washing machines that last forever Through the knowledge of the condition and status of a WM, PSS can increase the useful service life of the WM eternally by enabling lifetime extending strategies like maintenance, service, refurbishing and remanufacturing . With washing machines, proactive service and maintenance is important for the service life of a washing machine. Users are critical stakeholder in enabling proper maintenance and service as if they do not participate in the service and maintenance process, the actions do not succeed. Fogg (2009) describes in his behavior change model three elements needed for a behavior to occur – Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. If a person has high motivation to do an action and the ability to do it and triggered in the right way, the action will occur. <br/><br/>Design Solution<br/>The result of this design project is a User Interface framework for enabling easy and efficient maintenance and service of the WM. The concept looks at the different faults and maintenance actions for a washing machine and describes three different states of a WM.<br/>Green State – the Most desired state where the machine is functioning perfectly and does not require any user action<br/>Yellow State – A state where the functionality is intact but the machine requires maintenance action to be done<br/>Red State – A state when the functionality is seized due to a fault and requires a service action to fix it.<br/>The concept also looks at the transitions between the different states and what causes them and what action is needed to bring the machine to the green state. On the basis of the different actions, and a behavior change model that is aimed at motivating users and giving them the ability to carry out the maintenance and service actions, a UI concept is generated.

They are however subject to dissolution and may be heavily karstified often resulting in large cavities which may impose major hazards in drilling and production. In many cases, difficulty remains due to poor understanding of karst geometry and how it is distributed. This research presents a geometry and stability analysis using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data on cave systems in Brazil that can serve as direct analogues to subsurface carbonate reservoirs and therefore enhance our ability to predict them. Our study area lies in the state of Bahia in Brazil and consists of five caves: Diva De Maura, Torrinha, Ioiô, Lapinha, and Paixáo. These cave systems occur in Neoproterozoic carbonates of the Salitre Formation in the Irecê basin of the São Francisco Craton. Analysis of the geometry shows existing preferential karstic developments and tunnel shape patterns mainly classified in two, horizontal ellipse and vertical ellipse. Analysis of geologic structures and orientations of cave passages show that these caves exhibit marked structural guidance with two main orientations N-S and E-W. This aligns with the regional phases of deformation corresponding to collisional events that occurred on the margin of the São Francisco Craton. Stability analysis shows that tunnels aspect ratio is a major parameter controlling the stability, whereas the dimension of a tunnel has a much less effect on stability. Tunnels with aspect ratios less than 1 show a collapse depth greater than 1000 m and are more stable than tunnels with aspect ratios greater than 1. Results show that almost all tunnels with a horizontal ellipse geometry are supported with rock that is already undergoing severe deformation at a depth of 500m. Sensitivity tests show that overburden and rock mass strength parameters namely cohesion have the largest effect on the stability results.","Carbonates; Karst; LIDAR data; Geometry analysis; Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

When the application of energy storage technology starts to prosper gradually over the world, there are some problems showing up while lots of advantages are being advocated. There are plenty of batteries staying unused or being wasted for over half of the lifetime of the system, especially for the behind-the-meter energy storage system. The business models are usually built just for one or two primary services for customers and grid that makes only a limited part of time occupied, leaving the essential untapped values aside. And also, it is common that the energy storage system is coupled with PV panels or wind turbines. In this case, how to increase the on-site solar energy self-consumption becomes an attractive issue considering the sizeable financial benefit it can bring. What is more, when putting the attention on the neighborhood or community level where there is more than one participator in this picture, how to create the extra value or bonus benefit using the existed system and equipment can be an interesting topic. This report will focus on the grid-size battery installed behind the meter within a commercial community. A methodology of the energy hub with two different lays providing all kinds of services will be proposed.

Due to increasing urbanisation, climate change and an ageing population, health risks for urban populations will continue to increase in the coming years. The effect of urban heat islands on the health of vulnerable groups where especially the elderly population is hit the hardest, is widely recognized in literature. In past studies the effect of heat has been modelled for the entire population of a city or state where outside temperature measures or land surface temperature is the hazard. Research on specific vulnerable groups such as the elderly is relatively sparse to this date. In this study various datasets have been combined with the aim of providing a method for the development of a heat-related elderly risk index (HERI) for the elderly population of The Hague. The final composite risk indexes have been constructed for three moments in the day on the 27th of July which was the hottest day of the heat wave of 2018. The structure of the index is based on Crichton’s Triangle of Risk, which states that risk is a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. By selecting the following indicators to represent the spatial layers: physiological equivalent temperature, indoor temperature, facade orientation, being 75 years or older, loneliness among people over the age of 75, and population density. The indicators are assigned a weight trough the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), after which the indicators can be combined into a HERI maps for the three timestamps. Different configurations of indicators have been used for creating the HERI maps, yielding different weights for each set. This resulted in two types of HERI maps: HERI-2 and HERI- 3. HERI-2 exists of physiological equivalent temperature, being 75 years or older, loneliness among people over the age of 75, and population density. HERI-3 is composed of the same indicators as HERI-2 but instead of physiological equivalent temperature, indoor temperature is used as the hazard. The HERI maps for the three timestamps have been validated by performing a Pearson Correlation between the HERI maps and the mortality numbers among the elderly in the days after the heat wave. The indicators and mortality are non correlated except for the indicator ’being 75 years or older’. However when the indicators are combined into the HERI index maps a weak positive correlation with mortality can be seen. The results indicate that it is necessary that the indicators have to be re-evaluated and several weighting methods have to be considered in order to improve the HERI.","Urban heat island; Elderly; mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The actual decline rate may be higher than estimated as many of the species are data deficient or not yet assessed or became extinct before assessment. We have far surpassed the sustainable or natural limit of reductions in populations of freshwater species. With an unprecedented increase in global energy and water demand, planetaries boundaries for sustainable use of freshwater may be overstepped in the near future, as presently visible at a local scale. A staggering decline in freshwater biodiversity is a first warning signal of a looming global water crisis. With continued pressures like river fragmentation, flow regulation, overextraction of surface or groundwater, pollution, invasive species and climate change, on freshwater habitats, this crisis may shift one level higher and impact human species severely. <br/><br/>Environmental flows forms the link between ecological health of a river and the ecosystem services we derive from it. It can be a great tool to achieve twin objective of maintaining the ecosystem integrity of freshwater habitats and deciding trade-offs for ensuring sustainable water management in a river basin. This study focuses on developing a holistic methodology for preliminary assessment of ecosystem integrity or ecological health of a river basin, which can be easily adapted to other river basins using open source global datasets. The proposed methodology was applied to Kaveri basin to test its applicability and identify the limitations of available global datasets. A widely accepted regional environmental flow assessment framework, ELOHA (Ecological Limits of Hydrological Alteration) was adapted by using global datasets. A global river classification dataset was used to identify the river classes in Kaveri basin. Monthly hydrological alteration in magnitude at the location of gauge stations was calculated, using PCR-GLOBWB data as reference for natural flow conditions, in absence of records for natural flow in a highly modified Kaveri basin. An ecosystem integrity indicator framework was developed to assess the hydrologic, geomorphic and ecological modifications in the river basin. Indicators grouped under four main categories - Connectivity status, Land Use, Biodiversity, Water Quality were adopted using exiting global datasets and values for all the sub-basins of Kaveri basin were estimated.<br/><br/>Finally an attempt to derive flow alteration-ecological response was made. Threatened fish species percentage, quantified using IUCN spatial dataset, showed an increase in value with increase in alteration in flow magnitude. No clear relationship was observed when data for other taxonomic groups like plants, molluscs, odonata, shrimps and crabs were used. Hence, species of concern (IUCN red list category - CR, EN,VU) data can be useful in deriving preliminary flow alteration-ecological response relationship. An attempt to find linkage between flow alteration and floodplain gross primary productivity was also made. In dry season an inverse relationship was observed at few gauge stations but in general other climatic factors like rainfall and evapotranspiration had greater influence on gross primary productivity. Impact on gross primary productivity due to flow alteration could not be isolated using existing datasets because of coarse resolution.","Environmental flows; Biodiversity; Ecosystem Integrity; Flow Alterations; Species Richness; Connectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

The focus of this thesis shall lie in two aspects of this process: the heat load resulting from the high power and the contamination resulting from the rapid phase change of the droplets. The wavefront of the laser suffers aberrations from the variations in the surface profiles of the mirrors in the system. The variations are dominated by the thermal load that exists due to the imperfect reflectivity of the mirrors. A new mirror design seeks to limit the negative aberrations due to the high power laser. Additionally, the act of firing on a tin droplet creates contamination on surfaces in proximity of the EUV generation. The contamination results in a reduction in performance of the mirror and an associated swap time for the mirror decreases availability of the machine. The proposed design leverages principles not classically seen in high power mirror design. The design seeks to demonstrate that the shortest thermal path (resulting in the lowest temperature) is not the only avenue to create a high performance, high power mirror; and indeed, there exists opportunity for performance improvement.

Classification with Neural Networks would enable capturing both the nonlinear and time-varying human manual control behaviour characteristics, an approach that is absent in current literature. In this thesis, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network is used for classifying the adaptation of human manual control behaviour between single integrator (rate control) and double integrator (acceleration control) controlled element dynamics based on small time-samples of human control data. Datasets from two different previous human-in-the-loop experiments with compensatory manual tracking tasks are used to train the classification model and assess its capabilities. In addition, an application of the proposed model is tested on data from a third experiment, with a compensatory tracking task with time-varying controlled element dynamics. The LSTM model achieves 96% accuracy in classifying single/double integrator control behaviour, as well as for the application to detection of time-varying controlled element dynamics. This makes this approach a promising extension of the traditional “cybernetic” methods for (online) detection of adaptations in human manual control behaviour.","manual control; Cybernetics; time-varying identification; long short-term memory networks; Neural Networks; classification model; human operator; adaptation detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

This research presents a novel method for fast and robust detection of actuator failures on quadrotors. The proposed algorithm has very little model dependency. A Kalman estimator estimates a stochastic effectiveness factor for every actuator, using only onboard RPM, gyro and accelerometer measurements. Then, a hypothesis test identifies the failed actuator. This algorithm is validated online in real-time, also as part of an AFTC-system. LOE is induced by ejecting the propellers from the motors. The robustness of this algorithm is further investigated offline over a range of parameter settings by replaying real flight data containing 26 propeller ejections.

They are usually non-intrusive visualization techniques that provide a major advantage by not influencing the flow properties. Most of the developed measurement techniques estimate vorticity by computing the gradients of the measured velocity fields. In this project, the idea is to directly measure the mean vorticity using polarized emission of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are excited using vertically and horizontally polarized laser. Accordingly, the emission from these nanoparticles is separated into vertical and horizontal polarized emissions respectively. Depending on the percentage of fluorophores in the nanoparticles whose absorption dipole moment is parallel to the excitation electric vector of the laser, the polarized emission is varied. The nanoparticles in the quiescent fluid state have a characteristic polarization (or anisotropy) depending on the chemical composition of the nanoparticle. However, in turbulent flows, depolarization of the particles can occur because of the rotation of the nanoparticles due to vorticity. Based on this idea, the vorticity can be estimated by quantifying the depolarization in turbulent flows. To verify the above phenomena experimentally, steady-state polarization measurements were conducted. An experimental setup was built specifically to measure depolarization from these nanoparticles. Important preliminary tests like lifetime measurements, spectroscopic studies, and photo-bleaching experiments were conducted. Based on these results, hybrid europium based chelated spherical particles were chosen. To further understand the properties of these particles in a quiescent flow, a consolidated set of anisotropy measurements were conducted to study their oxygen sensitivity in the surrounding medium, viscosity dependence and the effect of its concentration in the fluids. Analytical correlations which was developed in-house to translate the depolarization of the nanoparticles to vorticity was used in this thesis. Flow in a square duct was studied to estimate the vorticity along the edges and further compare it with the DNS data. <br/>Two additional non-dimensional numbers ND1 and ND2 were introduced to interpret the underlying physics behind the problem. The variation of synthetic signals was studied for different Re, fundamental anisotropy r0 and the non-dimensional number ND2. These synthetic signals showed a drop in anisotropy near the edges of the square duct that has occurred probably due to vorticity. Emission polarized intensity signals and the anisotropy contours for Re = 0 and Re = 4434 were analyzed. Due to the measurement error, the contours were column averaged and respectively compared their variation along the width of the square duct. A drop in anisotropy was observed for Re = 4434. Using the ratio of emission intensities for each excitation polarization, the vorticity was estimated using the optimization algorithm. The estimated vorticity Ѡy shows similar trends compared to DNS data which is a promising evidence for the proof of concept. However, the results are not overlapping from the repeatability studies due to the high sensitivity of the optimization algorithm and the random error from the measurement equipment. To improve this technique in the future, transient experiments have to be conducted to estimate vorticity accurately and to capture the underlying physics.","Turbulent flows; Vorticity; Polarization; Measurement Technique","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The cascade system’s chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile solid (VS), protein and carbohydrates reduction, and methane production could be maintained despite the decrease of SRT, which was associated with an increase in organic loading rate (OLR) (15 d = 3.33 gCOD/L/d, 12 d = 4.16 gCOD/L/d).

Hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis analysis indicated that shorter SRT accelerated the hydrolysis rate of cascade system from 1.29±0.23 gCOD/L/d (SRT=15 d) to 1.59±0.19 gCOD/L/d (SRT=12 d), leading to the increase of overall degradation of WAS. The enhancement of hydrolysis rate was supported by the increased protease and cellulase activity detected at shorter SRT. Recirculating the effluent from reactor3 (R3) to reactor 1 (R1) was also essential to maintain the performance. The results not only showed deteriorating performance of cascade system regarding lower COD, VS, protein, carbohydrates reduction and methane production, but also presented lower hydrolysis enzymatic activity at 2% RR compared to 10% RR. 10% recirculation of solid phase, which contained biomass and sludge-attached enzymes, was beneficial to recover the performance of cascade system but the performance was not as good as that with 10% recirculation of both solid and liquid phase of R3 effluent. The cations analysis revealed that the required quantities of Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni) and Zinc (Zn) was highest in R1 while the concentration of soluble Co, Ni and Zn was lowest in R1. The concentration of Co, Zn and Ni was increased along AD of cascade system, providing the opportunities of offering increment of trace elements to the growth of microbial community and enzymes formation in R1. In conclusion, cascade system had better performance at shorter SRT compared to single CSTR. The recirculation played an important role to maintain the superior performance of cascade system under high OLR.","cascade system; waste activated sludge; hydrolysis; sludge retention time; recirculation ratio; hydrolysis enzymatic activity; trace elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","The confidential period of this master thesis is 2 years.","","2021-10-31","","","","","",""

This master thesis investigates the possibilities of using a Semi-flexible terrestrial solar panel in a low Earth orbit space environment. A Semi-flexible solar panel is a sandwich of polymer films with the solar cells in between, these layers are laminated to create the end product. This, for space, new process is applicable to all major solar cell types. It enables a wide range of possible designs and could result in a drastically lower price, shorter production time and a lighter and smaller end product. By using system engineering methodology, the risks of Semi-flexible solar panels in space are identified after which the major risks have been tested. The risks investigated in this report are: outgassing, temperature cycling, vacuum UV radiation, charged particle radiation and the stiffness in deployed and stowed position. The results show no red flags for a seven-year 600 km Earth orbit. A transmission degradation of 10% is observed, resulting in lower power output for the selected material. When entering higher orbits, the amount of radiation leads to delamination and potentially no power output. When comparing the Semi-flexible solar panel to a conventional solar panel, a price difference of factor 4 and a power output difference of 33% is expected. The vast price difference shows the potential for the concept, but further investigation is needed to find out if the transmission degradation could be mitigated and whether designs comply with stiffness and vibration requirements.","Space; Solar; Panels; System; Engineering; Airbus; Wattlab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Systems Engineering divides each stage into three main processes. They are the definition of requirements, functional analysis and allocation and design synthesis. This research attempts to automate the functional analysis and allocation because this process is repetitive, laborious, and time-consuming. The proposed system uses natural language processing to analyse the requirements and allocate them to objects in object type libraries (OTL). The OTL that is used in this research uses the OTL developed by Rijkswaterstaat. This OTL contains typical objects and sub-objects that an asset should include along with its metadata. This metadata constitutes a description of the object. The proposed system uses a dependency parser to add syntactic information to the requirements and object description. The requirements and objects are then subjected to Noun Chunking. Noun Chunking is an operation that breaks down the requirements and object description into meaningful phrases. Next, these chunks are compared for semantic similarity by plugging it into a word embedding to allocate each chunk a vector. The similarity is measured by finding the dot product of the two vectors. This system is converted into an NLP pipeline that identifies the correct requirement chunks to object chunk. The system is then compared to a neural classifier. Verification and validation are performed by measuring precision and recall, along with semi-structured interviews with industry experts. This research concludes that the proposed system can use process improvements. Still, the word embedding and cosine similarity is the suitable technology for the automating the allocation of requirements to object libraries.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

To improve the failure diagnosis efficiency in ASML, this paper proposes an attentional long-short term neural network into log sequence analysis. The LSTM neural network extracts the underlying dependencies in the event log and an attention layer is appended after to measure the importance of earlier events on the prediction of future events. The model learns the normal patterns from a large number of event logs from successful tests and detects deviations from normal patterns as anomalies. The likelihood of being abnormal of an event is measured by how far it deviates from the prediction. And the prediction process of the model can be understood by visualizing the attention scores of earlier events when the model makes decisions. Moreover, a visualization tool is built to illustrate the locations of anomalies and interpret the causes of anomalies through the attention maps.","Anomaly Detection; LSTM; Root cause analysis; ASML","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Understanding and having a critical attitude towards the media content that we “consume” and being able to work with media devices and platforms has become as important as learning to read and write. Sound and Vision, thé institute of media in the Netherlands therefore wants to offer a product for children in group 7/8 (Dutch education system, age 10-12) that can be used in the classroom, to make them more media literate. My context mapping research with several groups of children throughout the Netherlands, showed that children use many different media devices and are very active on social media. They are competent in accessing information and creating their own media content. Among these children, YouTube is the most popular platform on which countless hours of influencer videos are watched. However, children are very influenceable in this stage of their lives and take the information provided by the influencers often as the truth. The children have too little analytical skills and have to improve their ‘analyze’ competence: understanding a media message through textual and contextual analysis. Additionally, interviews with several teachers gave insights in appropriate teaching methods for this age group and in this context. In group 7/8, children learn best by doing and experimenting. They prefer to work together and with theme that is connected to their personal life. Based on these insights, the workshop ‘de media schatkist’ was designed. The workshop’s learning objective is ‘critical examination and viewing comprehension’. The children will take a better look at media content and think about missing or misleading information. In the workshop examples of earlier and recent influencer advertisement videos are used. These videos are short and easy to compare for the children because they always contain the same elements and structure. The elements serve as subthemes in the workshop: the setting, the sound and the actor in the advertisement. The children discover these themes in three parts. The first part contains analytical questions about the original audiovisual content from the Sound and Vision archive. In the second part, they discover the effects of content alteration of the original content. In the last part, the children are invited and supported to create media content themselves and to create a visual story. In the museum of Sound and Vision, the visitors are taken into a media world with all kinds of installations. To also bring this experience to the school, the classroom will be transformed into several small media environments. The children will receive boxes that through opening will create the environment, see figure 1. In the boxes, the children find products and attributes for their playfull active and coorperative media production assignment. Every theme has its own environment: a film set, a sound studio and the actors dressing room.","media literacy; children; workshop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MR safe, small size pneumatic stepper motors that produce high resolution motion however, do not exist. The goal of this thesis is to design and prototype such a pneumatic stepper motor and test its performance. An MR safe, high resolution pneumatic stepper motor was designed. This motor, called the PneuScape, was designed to fit in the orientation module of the NPS. The design of the PneuScape is based on an escapement mechanism. A torque is applied to move the output and the escapement anchor indexes this movement, creating a step. The PneuScape currently has the smallest designed step size s<sub>t</sub> = 0.83º of any MR safe pneumatic stepper motor. A prototype of the Pneuscape was developed using rapid prototyping techniques and its performance was evaluated. The total prototype did not meet all design requirements, in particular the requirement of maximum positioning error. Torque application does not work reliably and results in the motor skipping steps, diminishing the motor's accuracy. The escapement mechanism however, shows promising results in its performance. Recommendations were given to improve the prototype. If the prototype is improved with aid of the recommendations, a future version of the PneuScape is expected to meet the design requirements. Finally, the work in this thesis has made science take a step towards high resolution MR safe actuation. <br","Actuation; MR Safety; Pneumatic Stepper Motor; MR Safe Actuation; Motors; Pneumatic Actuation; Escapement; Mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

In this regard, the scope of this work is to investigate the applicability of data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve the performances of industrial printers manufactured at Océ Technologies. Two critical aspects of the considered printing process are analysed and multiple algorithms are developed. Temporary failure of printhead nozzles, a well-known issue in inkjet printing, is first addressed. Available data are used to real-time estimate the health status of each nozzle. This allows for a prompt identification of problematic scenarios and lays the foundations for the introduction of condition-based maintenance. The analysis is further enhanced by the application of machine learning. Gaussian process regression is used to predict the evolution of nozzle failures. The designed solutions show to be precious tools for nozzle prognostics, providing great accuracy and a high level of flexibility. Problematic nozzles can be restored by performing automatic cleaning actions. However, because of the costs and limited efficiency of these, their appropriateness is highly questionable. Such delicate matter is tackled by designing an autoregressive model that enables to define an advanced cleaning strategy. The presented method allows to decrease the cleaning costs up to 5-10%, leading to a considerable operational cost reduction. All the proposed solutions are thoroughly evaluated and compared, considering both their efficiency and implementation costs. Therefore they represent valuable proposals, ready to be factually implemented on an Océ printer.","Data Analysis; Prognostics; printing; Gaussian process regression; performance improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Literature on SWI describe the effects of SWI, model SWI scenarios and explain possible SWI mitigation strategies. To our knowledge there are, however, no studies that combine socioeconomic data with groundwater simulations to estimate SWI mitigation prevalence within an area. In this study, we demonstrate how a socioeconomic model can be combined with groundwater simulations to explore the possible role of behaviour willingness in finding suitable SWI adaptation/ mitigation strategies. The coastal province of Tra Vinh, located in the populated Vietnamese Mekong Delta, is an area affected by SWI and was used as case study area. Data collected from 313 households spread over nine communes, within the province, was used to construct a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model. The model integrates both socioeconomic (e.g. education, age) and psychosocial (behavioural) characteristics, to predict the willingness to change of the population; willingness to change from groundwater to a different source of water. The validated BBN model showed good model performances. The research found amongst others, using three model analysis, how the BBN model could be used on both regional (province) and local (commune) scale. The two different scales can help in defining both target groups and suitable locations for SWI mitigation/ adaptation interventions. Moreover, this study did not focus on finding suitable alternative water sources, that can serve as a substitute for groundwater abstraction. Though, the model analysis can help to more effectively define the possibilities of alternative sources and/ or water-saving interventions.","Saltwater intrusion; Groundwater abstraction; Bayesian Belief Networks; Behavioural model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-21","","","","","SALINPROVE","9.812700, 106.299300"

There are various developments ongoing within cancer care and its complexity. A task reallocation which is boosted by the government and new standards from SONCOS make it compulsory to have a fixed point of contact for cancer patients. Dijklander Ziekenhuis wants to introduce case management for cancer patients. Hereby, it is needed to investigate the needs and wishes of the patients and the caregivers and take into account the status quo and strategy of the hospital. Based on the research activities, the advise to Dijklander Ziekenhuis is to implement case management to prevent patients for referral and communication errors. At the same time it is advised to take a unique position by offering guidance throughout the treatment process and especially in the approach towards consults. This could be done by providing extra support, coaching and (informational) tools during the treatment process. This advise is transformed into a design of three deliverables. A care pathway, a Business Case and an Implementation Manual. The new care pathway is designed in such a format that it gives substance to the future vision of the Cancer Centre. The modular format meets the wishes to deliver bespoke and patient-centred care while expertise is retained and the overall process is monitored due to the new module within the pathway: the bridge. The care pathway also can be a ‘secret weapon’ to be leading in cancer care due to the design in three layers what makes possible better communication towards patients. This is essential for shared decision making. With all these characteristics, the new Care Pathway appears to be a gold mine on the way to better (colorectal) cancer care within Dijklander Ziekenhuis. The Implementation Manual literally describes the promising way towards better (colorectal) cancer. The aim of the Implementation Manual is to transform the current Cancer Centre into the desired future Cancer Centre in which the new Care Pathway is integrated. There is chosen for a phased implementation approach including pilots. In this way, there is expected a minimal disruption to the patient care and possible problems can be resolved quickly. The Business Case is written to make sure that the preconditions that are necessary to work towards better (colorectal) cancer in Dijklander Ziekenhuis will be met. Preconditions were mainly budget and formation related. Within this study, it became clear that there are extra nurse specialists needed. On the other hand, relatively less medical specialists are needed.","care pathway design; Case management; business case; Implementation; Hospital; Care pathway; healthcare design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Global warming and, at local scale, Urban Heat Island phenomena are among the primary effects of the increased building carbon emissions. Nevertheless, understanding and controlling the parameters which intensify, or mitigate, the increasing in temperatures in the surroundings of a building are pivotal, as sustainable design can significantly reduce the buildings’ energy demand. Micro-climate simulations can provide more accurate input for building energy simulations since they can accurately simulate the interactions between those parameters to calculate detailed weather data. Despite the increasing knowledge about the significance of the microclimate, energy simulation users still rely on derived, or interpolated weather data from sparsely located weather stations, located generally outside the urban environment. The reason behind this commonly adopted approach is that the generation of microclimate data is costly in terms of time, and currently standards for storing this generated data have not been developed. ENVI-met is a microclimatic simulation software that requires a model of an urban area and weather parameters on its boundaries to generate a large extent of data like air, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed etc. Constructing this model manually contains a number of significant limitations, such as high design cost in time and need for data collection from different sources – thus the chance of design errors is high. In this thesis a novel approach is introduced where the ENVI-met software is used for microclimatic simulations at district scale. However, the input model in this case is created by data extracted from a CityGML-based 3D city model. In addition, the generated microclimatic data is stored back to CityGML, where it can be re-used. The proposed methodology is implemented via a Graphics User Interface, divided in two main phases, serving the required bi-directional data flow. It was designed and implemented based on the following specifications: i) the user involvement in the whole process needs to be minimum, ii) the interface should create simulation-ready input models of various resolutions and iii) it must work with different CityGML datasets.<br/>A data requirement analysis indicated that a CityGML-based city model can feed its data to ENVI-met by the interface, so that the input model required by ENVI-met can be constructed fully automatically. In return, the storage of the generated results data is also possible. Therefore, an automated data flow between a CityGML-based city model and ENVI-met can be achieved, offering the following advantages: i) the ENVI-met input model can be constructed fast and automatically and ii) ENVI-met outputs can be translated to real world coordinates – thus can be visualized and processed in GIS software and ultimately stored back into the CityGML-based 3d city model.","CityGML; ENVI-met; Coupling; Microclimate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Sandwich-structure composites assume particular relevance in this industry due to their favorable trade-off between bending stiffness, weight and cost. These structures have stiff and thin layers of composite sheets on the top and bottom of a very light and thick core of a foam material. The lack of understanding of the mechanical behavior of these structures has limited their application in the maritime context, thus Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding has proposed the investigation of a composite bulwark that could replace a metallic one. Studies in the elastic domain of the composite structure show that the foam will yield before the composite fails, thus a plasticity model is required. In addition, intra- and inter-laminar damages of the composite plies need to be accurately simulated. Therefore, multiple material models are necessary to successfully simulate these structures. As a result, in this thesis the main motivation was to develop a general computer code that facilitates the implementation of different material models. The focus here is on plasticity models, but similar strategies can be devised for other material models. The program leverages a powerful commercial symbolic and numeric computing environment (e.g. Maple) to perform the necessary computations that create a user material in a commercial finite element software (ABAQUS Vumat subroutine) by only providing the fundamental inputs of any plasticity model (yield surface, flow rule and hardening law). An extensive analysis of the bulwark structure is not provided herein, so future work should focus on the joint implementation of the constitutive models proposed for the foam and the composite sheets. The author believes that the developed program will be helpful in future endeavors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This resulted in an increasing amount of district heating systems (DHS) in the horticulture areas. A DHS in a region called the ”B3-Hoek” connects multiple producers with horticulture companies in a single-buyer market model with long term bilateral contracts. This market model has some undesirable aspects that contribute to the willingness of introducing a short term heat market model in the system. However, such a short term market is still prone to market failures, if producers have considerable market power. The aim of this research is to investigate how a short term market can be designed for a DHS in the Netherlands, how producers and large consumers behave on a short term market and how this affects the performance of the market. An interactive simulation of a short term heat market was created, based on the DHS in the B3-Hoek to investigate this.<br/>The findings in this research give a conceptual model of the new market design and it showt that in a short term heat market prices will converge to marginal cost levels when market conditions are not tight. There is a balance of market power between the producers and the horticulture companies collectively. The results of short term market will not be comparable to the case of a perfectly competitive market due to Cournot competitive behaviour, but they can still be considered desirable for both horticulture companies and producers.","District Heating; District Heating Network; Heat Energy Market; Short Term Trade; Wholesale; Horticulture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The industry is witnessing massive strategic shifts, routine upgrades to new drug technologies in a dynamic regulatory and market environment. The growth rate of the global pharmaceutical industry is projected to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2022 (Lervolino &amp; Urquhart, 2017). There are increasing expectations from pharmaceutical companies to introduce advanced products and technologies for the welfare of the people. This objective of this descriptive study is to analyse market, technological and strategic trends, the interrelations, and to some extent, the impact of regulatory environment on the pharmaceutical ecosystem. Secondly, this study lays a special emphasis on personalized medicine and assessing its current and future scope amid these changing dynamics. A combination of systematic literature review and expert interviews was undertaken to achieve the above stated objective. The study is qualitative and involves analysis of opinions derived from expert interviews cross verified with scientific literature. The key findings are stated below: Since traditional pharmaceutical companies now face increasing market and regulatory pressures to differentiate their products, they are looking for alternate business models. This pressure is supplemented by a change in payer preferences and healthcare budgets set by governments across the world. High risk of drug failures further adds on to this. Many companies are experimenting with radically different product lines such as biologics and biosimilars. In the recent years, pharmaceutical companies in conjunction with biotechnology companies have identified the potential of technologies such as genetic profiling, advanced diagnostics etc. to understand the effects of drug interactions with the human body. However, the use of such technologies remains largely confined to highly specialized therapeutic areas such as oncology. The main reason is the economic barrier it faces. The costs of most personalized drugs are extremely high, and this affects the market access of a drug. It was also found that, the readiness of the facilitating environment (patient data repositories, Information technology infrastructure) etc. is also essential for commercializing personalized medicine. Healthcare Institutions, service providers are still not equipped to deal with personalized medicine on a mass level. Hence personalized medicine is predicted to remain as a niche offering limited to a select few therapeutic areas such as oncology in the foreseeable future. Two promising avenues for rapidly commercializing personalized medicine were identified: The first relates to develop financing mechanisms for pharmaceutical companies so that they can develop novel drugs for people with serious medical conditions. The second avenue which was identified was designing optimal risk sharing agreements between pharmaceutical companies and the payers. For a detailed understanding of all trends, the relationships amongst them and the industry readiness to transition to personalized medicine, please refer to this report.","Pharmaceutical; personalized medicine; drug; trends; interrelations; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); de Bruijne, M.L.C. (mentor); Ester, Fedor (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Several high-tech companies that develop creative new technological products fail to enter the market. For entering the market, some companies aim to use a transition from a customer engineering project to a so-called product platform. A product platform is a technological design that meets the needs of a core group of customers and can be modified by the addition and substitution of features. Scaling to a product platform enables a company to receive a higher profit margin on sold products then possible when performing projects. However, companies that seek to transition from a project to a product platform experience challenges in their decision-making of the functionalities of the product platform. So far, there is no literature on how companies should approach a transition from project to product platform. Furthermore, this research tries to answer a scientific follow-up question of a literature review on technology-push (TP) and demand-pull (DP) mechanisms (Di Stefano et al., 2012, p. 1291): ""How can firms capitalize both technology and demand in the process of innovation development and commercialization?"" Successfully capturing both demand and state-of-the-art technology in the product platform could enable the company to let the technology diffuse into the market. This research aims to help high-tech companies and contribute to scientific research. Therefore, this explorative research executes a single case study and delivers a framework to communicate the captured knowledge. The formal research objective is: ""Design a framework to support companies decide on the minimum functionalities for a product platform when the company wants to transition from project to product platform."" This study delivers a framework that helps companies decide on the minimum functionalities for the product platform. The framework structures the process and ensures that all employees can find a balance between knowledge of technology and knowledge of customers. The result can be a product platform that contains unique selling points and meets the shared actual needs of the customers of a so-called unique selling market (USM). In this way, a company can find a balance between TP and DP mechanisms, which enables the company to diffuse its technology into the market. This research was conducted through multi-method research. A single case study at a high-tech company developing an unmanned surface vessel (USV) enabled the research to discover and define the empirical problem. The literature study on TP and DP mechanisms discovered the applicability of the factors ’technology adaption and diffusion’ and ’organizational competences’. Both provided input for a first framework design. Interviews validated the framework 1.0 and a set of functionalities were developed for the product platform of the USV, which enabled the development of framework 2.0. Finally, a workshop delivered the results of the interviews to the employees and validated framework 2.0. The framework provides valuable knowledge to high-tech companies that want to transition from project to product platform. Implementing the decision-making process can enable the company to select the minimum functionalities that capture both technology and demand in the product platform. Framework 2.0 contributes to the scientific literature by elaborating on the discussion how companies can balance both TP and DP mechanisms (Di Stefano et al., 2012; Lubik et al., 2013) by the use of existing literature (Ortt and Schoormans, 2004; Ortt et al., 2013;Moore, 2014; Lubik et al., 2013; Gawer, 2014).","Product platform; Diffusion; Market adaptation phase; niche strategies; Product development; Functionalities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To achieve this goal, we depart from an extensive selection of variables drawn from the literature review. The initial selection is discussed, refined and enriched by carrying out interviews with knowledgeable actors in the ecosystem. At the end of the study, a total of eight significant predictors are used to construct three predictive models on startup success. The first model predicts a startup having total funding of one million euros or above, the second model predicts a startup having ten or more employees, and the third model predicts a startup having an average annualized return of at least 20% in the past three years.

In everyday practice, AI will be used as a co-pilot for image interpretation (Beregi, 2019). Additionally, public health records (PHRs) offer a tremendous opportunity to generate support in reducing costs, improving health outcomes for populations, and improving the experience of care for patients and their families (Ford, 2017). These are just two developments that will have a huge impact on the needs and the roles of the patients, doctors and managers and therefore their needs concerning Barco's products. Moreover, legislation might change, other interesting markets might emerge and competitors might take the competitive advantage. What is the most profitable, most viable and most sustainable future for Barco in this changing landscape? A company like Barco cannot simply change to get to this future. There might be a need to collaborate between departments, collaborate with other companies, different jobs, change of processes. These changes all have their own timings and relevance and they should be defined carefully beforehand. When plans and processes are created for the 'near' future (one or two years), Barco managers and employees can execute these. It is different when these plans must be made for a longer term. This is because over longer periods of time things can change drastically. What was once created out of a certain vision can now be completely different because there are different employees/managers working on the project or the context has changed. This creates the need for a visually comprehensive overview of the future. Not only does this need to be communicated to the top-management level, but also to the relevant departments and stakeholders. In summary: For Barco to be at their full potential they will need to plan their future carefully and be able to communicate that to all relevant stakeholders. When planning for further in the future than a year or two a roadmap helps in communicating the essence of a project, department or even an organisation. As defined by Simonse in 2017: ""In essence, a design roadmap offers a tactical plan on design innovations to turn a future vision into a reality."" It can provide a quick overview of the general plans, addressed values and overall strategy for people that are not yet involved. Besides creating an overview, a roadmap supports the innovation strategy of an organisation (Simonse, 2017). For the healthcare department, the diagnostic imaging products in particular, I created a future vision and a Design Roadmap. The future vision describes the desired future within 10 years. The roadmap describes relevant business models, user values, markets, target groups, products, technologies, resources and competitors towards the future vision.","Design Roadmap; Radiology; Diagnostic Imaging; Future Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

With the integration of further RES into the power grid, the need for a resilient and smart power grid has never been greater. For meeting this necessity, the electrical power grid is undergoing a massive overhaul in terms of infrastructure, catalysed by the advent of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Integration of ICT layers onto the power grid, has furthered the use of data analytic and processing tools, in the field of electrical power systems. Utilizing the plethora of data being collected from the power grids, and the modern ICT developments, such as, in the field of Machine Learning (ML), the quest to make the grid smarter and stronger continues. However, this being the infant stages of research, in ML implemented power grid protection, there is a vast variety of problems, yet to be discovered. This thesis, explores the efficacy of ML, used in tandem with Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) and trained using basic statistical features of current and voltage signals in detection of a variety of disturbances in the power grid. The thesis can be summarised as follows: Identification of signal processing tool: The current and voltage signals, collected from the power system, can be utilised directly, for analysis of the characteristics of disturbances in it. However, by utilising signal processing tools, a greater insight into the signal can be obtained. DWT is one such tool, used for decomposing the signal, based on frequency, while also retaining the time domain data of the signal. The decomposition utilises special functions, called mother wavelets, and an infinite number these can be developed. A study, comparing a variety of family of these mother wavelets, yielded db11, of Daubechies family, suited for detection of disturbances in electrical signals. Disturbance signature generation: Disturbance signatures for commonly occurring events in a power system, along with rarer and harder to detect events such as HIF were simulated using PSCAD for multiple system voltages. Further, data for equipment failure related incipient faults were obtained from the PES work group of IEEE. These disturbance signals were decomposed using DWT, for training the ML module. ML implementation for detection and classification of disturbances: Using the signature of disturbances generated and obtained, supervised ML modules were trained to detect and classify the disturbances by analysing the basic statistical features, mean, standard deviation, variance, RMS, number of zero and mean crossings, Shannon entropy and energy, extracted from the DWT decomposition of the current and voltage signals. A comparison of the accuracy of, two of the common classification models, Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting, yielded Gradient boosting as more accurate at classification of the disturbance. A comparative analysis of the statistical features, also provided an insight into their contribution towards the accuracy of ML.","Machine Learning; discrete wavelet transform; disturbance; detection and classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is developing a state-of-the-art autonomous solar PV powered methanol micro-plant. By using air, sunlight, alkaline electrolysis and synthesis reaction, renewable liquid methanol is produced. The electrical system of the micro-plant is complex and comprises of various components and actuators. In order to understand the dynamic short-term electrical behaviour of the system, a simulation tool is developed in MATLAB and Simulink. Mathematical models of a 300 W PV panel, alkaline electrolyser cell stack, DC-DC (buck) converter, cartridge heater, Peltier element, a compressor, a brush-less DC fan and solenoid valve are built or adopted. Joined together in a model of the micro-plant system, they predict the electrical interplay on a 20 μs timescale. Simulations using various scenarios and different irradiation levels show several bottlenecks, prohibiting desired operation. The main problem uncovered is the discontinu- ous switching behaviour of the buck converter, causing distortions in the main circuit and badly influences the power generation of the PV panel. The addition of a buck converter input filter showed significantly improved micro-plant performance and more stability during operation. The observations regarding plant performance and response to disturbances show the importance of the dynamic simulation tool that was developed. It gives a realistic insight in the dynamics of the electrical interplay of components, as well as it shows the shortcomings and improvements of the original system design.","Dynamic Analysis; solar-to-fuel; Alkaline electrolysis; Methanol synthesis; micro-plant; electrical; simulation; system; autonomous; Direct air capture; direct coupling; Renewable Energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-23","","","","","",""

The algorithm can focus on the wrong part of the image. Instead of focusing on the foreground (cow), it could focus on the background (meadow). This way, by focusing on the background, it could produce a false output (e.g. a horse instead of a cow). To show this, an explanation is needed. For this reason, a variety of methods have been created to explain the reasoning behind these algorithms, called explainability methods. In this paper, six local explainability methods are discussed and compared. These methods were chosen as they were the most prominently used approaches for explainability methods for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

When using the display, participants could better estimate whether an aircraft was going to adhere to the altitude restriction. A decreasing trend in the number of control commands for difficult scenarios was found. Possibly, because participants had a better understanding of the situation, and fewer control adjustments had to made. Moreover, a difference in performance between the participants was observed.

To protect and recover these areas, different types of permeable structures consisting of bamboo have been proposed and applied. However, these structures are currently based on engineering judgement, as design rules are not available. The goal of this research is to make a step forward in the design optimization of permeable structures and gain a better understanding of the processes causing the wave dissipation inside the structure. In this study, scale experiments are conducted in the wave flume at Delft University of Technology. An array of aluminum cylinders is used as a schematization of the structure, with an element diameter of 4 cm and a minimum spacing of 2 cm. The tested wave height is 0.13 m,with a water depth of 0.6 m for the first set of experiments. These experiments evaluated wave transformation through a selected number of configurations. The water depth was 0.55 m for the second set, where the velocities and forces were also measured inside the structure. As the applied wave periods are short (T = 1 − 2 s), the tested wave conditions are in the range of small KC-numbers (4 &lt; KC &lt; 13). The first part of this research focuses on effect of different configurations and arrangements on the amount of energy dissipation, by measuring the incoming and reflected wave heights in front of and behind the structure. For the short waves, the horizontal arrangements dissipate more energy, as energy is dissipated by both the vertical and horizontal drag forces. However, the effect diminishes with increasing wave period. Considering the total dissipation and the amount of dissipation per element, the placement of the elements in rows perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation is found to be the most effective. To study the effect of the element diameter on the dissipation, the results are compared with previous research by Haage (2018) on a model with a diameter and spacing of 2 cm. As with the change in diameter also the structure porosity changed, a direct comparison was not possible and a comparison based on a simplified drag coefficient is done. No direct effect of the diameter is observed, as the obtained drag coefficients show the same trend and magnitude when plotted against an adapted Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC∗), which is based on the element spacing instead of diameter. Small KC∗-numbers result in large drag coefficients,which decrease when KC∗ increases. The second part of this research focuses on the processes inside the structure that cause the energy dissipation. A force and velocity sensor are applied at three locations inside the structure in separate experiments, to determine the relation of the force and velocity inside the structure with the undisturbed values. Two methods are applied for the analysis, based on two different principles. Method 1 is based on the assumption of a constant pair of force coefficients and an increase in velocity inside the structure, method 2 is based on the assumption of a constant velocity and an increase in force coefficients inside the structure.By comparing both methods, it is found that an increase in velocity is the most important factor for the increase in drag force, which is the driving factor for the energy dissipation. It is also found that the amplification factor for the velocity is dependent on both the structure porosity and frontal porosity.","Building with Nature; BioManCo; Drag coefficients; Wave dissipation; Physical scale model; Dalrymple; Permeable structures; Force measurements; Velocity measurements; Morison's equation; Cylinders; Mangroves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

Due to its fast adaption in the residential sector, new algorithms to facilitate its design are needed. In order to understand and analyze its operation, the essential components of the power balance: PV generation and consumption are modeled. The PV generation profiles are obtained from Solar Monkey B.V. monitoring data while the consumption is modeled via the Load Profile Generator (LPG) software, that simulates the behaviour of people in their house. Using a simulation approach, the battery performance can be estimated in various metrics. In this thesis, 7 different metrics were considered, such as, loss of load probability, investment revenue and resilience to power outages. Due to its estimation difficulty, the lifetime metric is further investigated by analyzing three approaches from the literature. This approaches are found to have difficulties with estimating the lifetime of large batteries. In order to fix it, a correction factor that considers the calendar lifetime of the battery is given. However, since this correction is not validated and, therefore, cannot be used for commercial applications at the moment, the warranty lifetime of the battery is used. In the quest of finding by which metrics should the battery design be optimized, the market research pointed to the existence of an entire preferences pectrum. Consequently, having a pre defined algorithm that only considers the physical aspects of the system (generation and consumption) will not give an adequate design. For this reason the battery satisfaction model (BSM) is developed. This algorithm incorporates the clients preferences into the fundamental game theory concept of payoff function, to rank the batteries according to their outcome desirability. In the results chapter, the main aspects that constraint the battery profitability are analyzed via a simplified approach. Later, the BSM is examined and is found to give an appropriate design according to client’s wishes. Moreover, when tested in extreme cases, it is found to behave as desired.

The first approach uses mean-shift clustering algorithm to find 5 general personas to represent the common views in the market and the second investigates the correlation between the different metrics.

Within this graduation project, we propose a methodology that can be used to optimize such a deployment and thus, increase the performance of an Indoor Positioning System that a) is based on Received Signal Strength Fingerprinting and b) is orientated towards providing location or zone estimations instead of exact positioning. The optimization process involves 4 fundamental components. Firstly, the modeling of the obstructions in the indoor environment and also the zone modeling. Then, the definition of the performance metric that can be used to evaluate each different deployment scenario, in which case, our proposed metric considers the separation area and distances between the zones in the RSS vector space. The third component is the radio propagation model, required for simulating the transmitted signals from each node, where a model based on the ray tracing technique is selected. Finally, the last component is the selection of the optimization function that will control and drive the whole optimization process by choosing which deployment schemes to evaluate. For that, the utilization of a Genetic Algorithm has been selected. The evaluation of our methodology showed that the most problematic regions in terms of localization accuracy are, as expected, those where different zones become adjacent. Yet, comparisons between regular node deployments and our optimized solutions indicated that, regardless the number of nodes, our optimization introduced in each case an overall localization improvement that was especially concentrated at the most problematic regions.","Indoor positioning system; Zone distinction; Location Fingerprinting; Node Placement; Optimal Deployment; Performance Optimization; Localization Accuracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Based on analysis of a current densification project in Rotterdam (Rotta Nova) different problems with current densification designs are formulated. From these problems an alternative design for inner city dwellings is suggested, using the advantages of computational design and robotic manufacturing. The first problem with current densification strategies has to do with the bounding volume of the building, which does not take into account the negative impact on its surroundings (mainly with regards to shading). Secondly, the configuration of the apartments themselves does not take into account the limited space available. Ideally, in a high-density environment we would assign as much volume to every space that it actually needs; living rooms would desirably be spacious, while bedrooms can be smaller. Thirdly, current densification designs often replace green areas within the city. This greatly worsens the urban heat island effect, especially in Rotterdam. Based on these three problems I propose an alternative densification strategy, materialized as an alternative design for the apartment building I analyzed. This densification strategy consists of three scale levels. On the macro scale level, a bounding volume is generated which ensures minimal shading impact on surrounding buildings and public spaces. On the meso scale level a generative algorithm is developed which populates this bounding volume with apartment spaces of different sizes, with exactly the dimensions they require; functional areas are minimized, while living quarters are maximized. On the micro scale level, a building system is developed using concrete 3D printing which allows the production of the resulting non-standard building. These efforts result in an alternative design on the site of Rotta Nova. On one hand, this is site specific; the bounding volume of the generative model is based on local site conditions. However, the workflows on all three scale levels are applicable in other dense urban areas as well, be it with slight modifications.","computational design; housing; robotic building; generative design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Robotic Building","","51.920752, 4.486389"

Microfluidics research carried out at the Laboratory for Aero and Hydrodynamics is currently working on designing such devices which can carry out different manipulation tasks.<br/>This thesis is aimed at designing and fabricating such a device where two particles can be manipulated simultaneously. The application of designing such a device would be to study cell-cell interaction, droplet coalescence and so on. To achieve this, a microfluidic device is designed as a Hele-Shaw flow cell. Since the height-averaged velocity in a Hele-Shaw flow cell is irrotational, analytical solution is possible for such a design. Although a Hele-Shaw flow is viscous flow between two closely spaced plates, it produces same streamline patterns as a 2D ideal flow. This enables the use of basic building blocks of an ideal flow field such as sources, sinks, uniform flow and so on. In this case, sources and sinks are superimposed to get the flow field inside the microfluidic device. The microfluidic device is fabricated using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a commonly used polymer to fabricate microfluidic devices. The design of the device is validated by comparing experimental flow fields, streamlines and stagnation points to the corresponding analytical solution. Single particle manipulation activities are carried out in the device. This is executed by manually controlling the flow rates or the strength of sources and sinks. Firstly, the particle is trapped at the stagnation point for a certain timespan. Finally, some manipulation activities are carried out using a single particle with the aid of streamlines produced by the sources and sinks.","microfluidics; Particle manipulation; Hele-Shaw cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It is being widely used in small scale aircraft, helicopters, ships, wind turbines, to name a few. The study of noise generated by the rotors is an important subject of research. This project aims to characterize the open rotor tonal noise using the experimental and analytical model with a primary focus on Blade Tower Interaction (BTI) noise. The objective of the project is to implement an analytical acoustics model with input from an aerodynamics solver for calculating the noise radiation from a rotating blade. Fan noise experiments are conducted in the anechoic chamber at IMSIA, ENSTA ParisTech, France, which are used to validate the model and also characterize BTI noise. The acoustic model is based on Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy for moving sources. The analysis is performed in the frequency domain. The implemented model can be used to obtain noise radiations from propeller, wind-turbines or any rotating source, given the appropriate aerodynamic inputs. The implementation of the model is validated with the benchmark results in literature. The steady loading noise predicted by the analytical model matches very well with the experiments at first blade passage frequency (BPF) harmonic. The experiments offer a deep insight into the mechanism of noise radiation focusing mainly on tonal components associated with blade tower interaction. Different configurations with variation of pitch angle, blade tower distance are employed to study the impact on BTI noise. The effect of BTI noise is more pronounced at smaller blade tower distance and is almost negligible in front of the rotor when the blade tower distance is equal to the tower diameter. Further, pressure taps are used to study the pressure variations on the tower as the blade passes. An empirical model is suggested based on the pressure tap results to mimic the pressure variations on the tower.

Removal of brain tumors poses a big challenge for neurosurgeons, pediatricians and neuro-oncologists. An important aspect of this challenge is to adequately differentiate between tumor tissue and healthy brain tissue. Tumors that are located within the eloquent cortex (functional brain cortex and major white matter fiber tracts) pose a particular surgical challenge due to the high risk of postoperative neurological deficits. Together with the In-Body Systems department of Philips Research and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Delft University of Technology is participating in a new research focusing on adding diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in a neurosurgical instrument that can aid in better identifying the brain tumor margin. Previous research has used diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or a combination of diffuse reflectance and tissue fluorescence from endogenous (e.g., NADPH), exogenous (e.g., fluorescein), or exogenously induced fluorophores (e.g., PpIX) to identify spectral differences between healthy brain tissue and brain tumor tissue over a range of 400-900 nm. This master thesis presents the spectral differences between healthy and tumorous tissue over a range of 400-1600 nm, while using a spectroscopic tool, to better determine the demarcation of brain tumor margins with increased accuracy. The differences in optical characteristics in healthy brain tissue (i.e. white and gray matter) and human brain tumor tissue were identified. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the optical characteristics can provide a means to quantify the distinction between healthy and brain tumor tissue. Clear differences were found in the spectra between the different tissues. In the visible region higher values for the absorption coefficient were identified as indicators for tumor tissues. In the near infrared region clear distinctions in the diffuse reflectance spectra were observed between gray matter, tumor tissue and white matter, with gray matter presenting the highest value. The reduced scattering coefficient showed especially a clear distinction for white matter, presenting the highest values, compared to gray matter and tumor tissue. This was in line with the measurements of the scattering parameters and the fat fraction, with white matter presenting the highest value which can be explained due to its myelinated axons. For the other investigated parameters, an increased level of blood concentration and lower levels of StO2 were indicated as biomarkers for the tumor tissues. However, both physiological parameters are likely to change from in vivo to ex vivo settings which require that they should be investigated in in vivo experiments first before statements about their reliability can be made. The study was followed with a clinical workflow analysis, to identify the most promising neurosurgical instrument used during craniotomy in which diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be integrated. Based on observations at brain tumor surgeries, open interviews with neurosurgeons and an investigation on several instruments, the suction cannula was found to be the most promising neurosurgical instrument to combine with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Finally, a prototype was designed and tested. In addition, it was investigated whether different amounts of suction power had an influence on the accuracy of the measured spectra while performing measurements with the prototype on healthy pig brain tissue. Overall, it can be concluded that spectral differences between healthy and tumorous tissue can be observed with the prototype and future research should increase the amount of data to verify these results. Furthermore, in vivo measurements should indicate whether these findings are consistent when the physiology of the tissues changes.","Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Optical fibers; Brain tumors; Neurosurgery; Craniotomy; Optical characteristics; Suction cannula; Brain tissue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-29","","","","","",""

This level of steel production has brought significant employment and economic growth to the Netherlands, but has come at a cost to the environment. The Dutch steelmaking industry was responsible for producing 12.6 million tonnes of CO2 in 2017, making it the greatest CO2 emitting entity within Dutch industry. A broad range of technologies are being researched aiming to achieve deep decarbonisation of the steel sector. One of the most promising CO2-reducing technologies being developed directly uses electricity for the electrochemical reduction of iron oxide to produce iron, and ultimately steel. However, the high CO2-reduction potential is compromised by inhibiting significantly greater energy costs then other decarbonisation options. By 2050, the electricity system in the Netherlands is expected to be primarily based on renewable energy sources (RESs). The shift towards intermittent sources of electricity is expected to increase the fluctuation and uncertainty of electricity prices. The ability of electricity-based steelmaking technology to operate flexibly, with respect to its production rate, may aid in reducing overall energy costs. By responding to electricity prices, through ramping up and down of production, peak prices can be avoided and low prices can be capitalised on. Alongside the potential cost-saving, this may also serve to increase the integration of RESs. This study analyses the potential of flexible operation of such technology in the Netherlands based on two scenarios of the European electricity system in 2050. Based on these scenarios, it is found that for such technology to benefit from flexible operation, capital costs must inhibit some economies of scale, or be lower than anticipated, for electricity cost savings to outweigh additional capital costs of oversizing the steelmaking technology system. Relative to other European countries, the Netherlands is able to achieve greater electricity cost savings. This is likely due to the expected high penetration of offshore wind in 2050, which helps to provide more consistent periods of low-priced electricity due to its high annual capacity factor relative to other RESs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The most commonly used method, probably the only practical procedure, in nonlinear time-history analysis is the direct time integration method. In general, every direct time integration method could be classified as either an implicit method or an explicit method. Understanding the differences between the two categories in both theoretical and practical aspects is very important for engineers to make the best analysis strategy for a specific dynamic or seismic analysis. In this treatise, the most popular method in each category, i.e., implicit Newmark method and explicit central difference method, will be introduced and used in transient analyses and results comparisons. In total, five cases studies are included in this thesis, including three cases with linear elastic materials and two cases with quasi-brittle masonry material. These five cases are studied to answer the main research questions of this research: What differences can be observed in comparisons of solutions obtained from implicit and explicit methods for linear elastic material in transient analysis and for quasi-brittle material under seismic load? Also, how are the performances of both methods with respect to the stability and accuracy aspects? The results comparisons show that for linear elastic material, both methods could generate accurate solutions with proper time steps. However, the explicit method shows a better representation of the high-frequency response of the structure. For quasi-brittle masonry material, both methods are possible to generate good results. However, the implicit method may have convergence problems during the iterations, which could lead to inaccurate predictions of nonlinear behavior of the structure. The explicit method shows very good predictions for nonlinear behavior, but the computation time is quite long and the critical time step is highly influenced by many factors in the finite element model. Moreover, the mass scaling technique, which is generally used in the explicit method, is also investigated in this thesis.","Finite Element Analysis; DIANA FEA; Direct time integration; Implicit method; Explicit method; Nonlinear Dynamics; Masonry material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large proportion of its success has to be credited to the explosion of big data in the past two decades. Structured data sets are essential to deep learning systems. The rising amount of automatic identification system data is a key example in the current big data boom. The automatic identification system produces spatiotemporal movement data of vessels. It was designed as a collision avoidance system, but researchers have been looking into ways to leverage its data for other tasks. Analyzing behavior in the movement data of vessels can help policymakers and monitoring operators with decision making processes. Improving these processes lead to safer and more resilient marine environments. Unfortunately, the possibility of applying deep learning on vessel movement data is an underexposed topic. This project attempts to explore the research gap in this topic. The objective is therefore to give an overview of the possibilities, complications and opportunities given the current state of the art.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Background - Hamstring strain injuries (HSI’s) in soccer occur most frequently during the latter stages of each half. Neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) may induce changes in hamstring contractile strength and sprinting technique, which are potential causes for the observed increase in HSI risk during each half.Objectives - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of soccer specific fatigue on hamstring maximal voluntary torque (MVT), hamstring rate of torque development (RTD), and alterations in sprinting technique. Moreover, the possibilities to detect alterations in sprinting technique as potential markers for increased HSI risk were explored using inertial measurement units (IMU’s).Methods - Ten amateur soccer players executed a 90-minute soccer match simulation. Before and after each 15-minute segment hamstring MVT (Nm), hamstring neuromuscular activity (%EMGmax), hamstring RTD (Nm.s), and sprint performance and technique were assessed. Sprinting kinematic data was obtained using IMU’s. Repeated measurement ANOVAS were used to assess changes in hamstring contractile properties, sprint performance, and sprinting kinematics. Repeated measurement correlation was used to assess common within subject associations between hamstring MVT, sprint performance and sprinting kinematics.Results - Significant time dependent reductions in hamstring MVT (푃 &lt; 0.01), corresponding hamstring EMG activity (푃 &lt; 0.01), and sprint performance (푃 &lt; 0.01) were observed. Significant positive within subject repeated measurement correlations were observed between hamstring MVT and knee angle at peak knee extension in the final part of the swing phase (푃 &lt; 0.05), between hamstring MVT and hip angle at peak hip flexion (푃 &lt; 0.01), and between hamstring MVT and peak hip flexion velocity (푃 &lt; 0.01).Conclusions - The findings of present study suggest that the capacity of the hamstrings to decelerate the lower limb in sprint running is limited during soccer-specific NMF, resulting in greater peak knee extension during the terminal swing phase. As a consequence, the risk of excessive hamstring strain, and thus HSI risk, may be elevated. Moreover, present results show that IMU’s can be used to detect NMF-induced changes in sprinting technique as potential markers for increased HSI risk.","Soccer; Neuromuscular fatigue; Hamstrings; Injury; Inertial Measurement Unit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The goal of this pilot study is to design and test adequate controllers on the shoulder exosuit for the main study with human trials. In this paper, three controllers, namely a direct force (DF) controller, a direct force controller with a friction compensation (DFF) and an indirect force (IF) admittance controller, are introduced and tested for their feasibility and performance on the exosuit on a human. The controllers were initially tested on the test bench and the DF and IF controllers were selected and compared to a no-controller condition as a pilot study on the exosuit with four participants. Three different conditions did not show significant difference in tracking error, smoothness and bandwidth in arm elevation. However, the IF controller showed better performance in force than the DF controller for the tracking error of 2.95±0.15N (mean±standard deviation) and 9.34±2.99N, and for the smoothness of movements (SPectral ARC length) of -4.70±0.61 and -7.07±0.89, respectively. The force error between reference and measured force noticeably increased from 0.5Hz of elevation movements which is similar to their force bandwidth of 0.55Hz for the IF controller and 0.4Hz for the DF controller. Despite the fact that the obtained results may not suffice to verify that the controllers provide sufficient assistance to a user, the indirect force admittance controller with the given experiment procedure shows promising results and performance with the exosuit which can later be used for further studies and human trials.","Upper limb exoskeleton; soft exoskeleton; exosuit; robot-assisted; activities of daily living; Cable-driven; Controller Design; Admittance control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Mostly this is due to the rise of the world’s population and the drive towards a green energy transition and low carbon economy. Prices are rapidly increasing, and there is an identifiable risk of an increasing supply shortage of raw materials, including those identified as critical to Europe’s high technology sector. The development of surveying techniques and advances in new technologies in remotely operated vehicles (ROV) has allowed detecting that the most valuable and rare mineral resources are spread out in the sea-floor and international waters. Currently, the most significant setback towards exploitation licenses is not because of lack of technology but because of a lack of knowledge on deep-sea biodiversity and the impacts of mining on ecosystems. The ISA (International Seabed Authority) is responsible for the regulation, and the control of mineral-related activities in the international waters is currently working on drafting environmental regulations. This presents significant opportunities for research on the development of technologies that incurs in the least environmental impact possible. Currently, the main concerns are regarding the horizontal sediment-laden plume that is generated as a result of the mining process. Therefore, the industry is working towards the development of equipment that lessens the plumes spread. Work done in this research focuses on small scale sized laboratory experiments in which the sea-floor crawler’s outlet shape is varied, and its plume’s effects of the sediment waste and other effluents (SWOE) are measured. Besides gaining insight in the horizontal plume spreading under different conditions and geometries, the outcome of the research is to provide a set of measurement data that can be used for future numerical model validation towards determining an optimal outlet shape for the seabed crawler. For this purpose, a total of three diffusers were designed and tested based on a specific scaling factor and input parameters defined by IHC Mining. Experiments consisted of capturing visual imagery of the generated plume on both top and side views for further analysis and performing velocity and concentration profile measurements in different locations. The offset jet transition from jet to plume and the respective impingement point for all diffusers was compared. Velocity and concentration measurements were analyzed and compared to determine an ideal diffuser. Using diffusers reduces the plume’s initial momentum while maintaining the density differences and therefore reduces the transition from jet to plume, allowing for gentler deposition over the surface and resuspending less material. All experiments show similar behavior in which a free jet can be observed initially. Then, after substantial entrainment takes place, the jet impacts the bed due to the negative buoyancy. Once the discharge impinges the lower boundary, it forms a radially spreading layer along the boundary which transitions into a wall jet. Lowering the momentum of the jet by diffusing the outlet gave better results in terms of drawing the impingement point, and the deposition profiles nearer to the diffuser. Also, the measured velocity and concentration profiles considerably decreased, reducing the plumes spread.","Deep-sea mining; small-scale experiments; horizontal plumes; offset jets; diffusers; velocity profiles; concentration profiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A recent development in renewable energy is the application of offshore floating solar systems. A prototype design for this application, as developed by the company ’Oceans of Energy’, consists of multiple floating platforms (floaters), moored to the sea bed. One of the challenges for offshore floating solar systems is the continuous wave induced force acting on the floater that can become significant in severe weather conditions. Numerical simulations are often used to analyse and predict these forces. Combined frequency-time domain solvers are the most promising tool for this design to obtain reliable results within reasonable computational time. However, it is unknown what the capabilities of this solver is for the novel offshore floating solar system. The goal of this study is therefore to determine to what extend the frequency-time domain solver is able to accurately simulate the behavior of the multi-body, offshore floating solar system. A numerical model was developed in the simulation tool ’aNySIM’. Experiments conducted in the offshore basin at MARIN were used for the model structure development and validation. Additionally, viscous damping effects were implemented from empirical data based on the experiments. Decay tests were used for damping determination. This resulted in inaccurately determined forces and motion amplitudes for regular and irregular wave tests. A new damping determination method was introduced, using regular wave results as input. The accuracy of the model improved with 4% using this method. Nonetheless, inaccuracies in mooring line forces, oscillating behaviour and motion amplitudes are present. These inaccuracies have been addressed with an uncertainty analysis and sensitivity studies. Trends within the accuracy of the simulation model were linked to physical phenomena that occurred during the experiments. Analysis showed that several effects, related to the novel design characteristics, influence the model accuracy. Multi-body (e.g. shielding of floaters) and mooring system aspects (e.g. hydrodynamic loads on mooring lines) have been identified, influencing the viscous damping of the system. Additionally, nonlinear effects due to, amongst others, breaking waves have been identified. For regular wave tests and lower irregular wave tests, the simulation model gives reliable results with errors in the mooring line forces below 10%. These errors are mainly ascribed to viscous damping effects. For higher sea states the simulation behaviour shows discrepancies and errors in the mooring line forces increase. In these tests, nonlinear effects due to breaking waves become more relevant. For future work, different uncertainty causes must be further isolated in the simulation model. This can be done by obtaining more experimental data. To quantify the effects, studies in other numerical tools can be performed (e.g. CFD calculations) and more extended sensitivity studies must be executed in aNySIM.

Public transport operators worldwide are experiencing an increase in popularity of their network and are experiencing ridership growth on their metro networks. To accommodate ridership growth, many transport operators are tasked with increasing the capacity of their metro network. While widening or elongating trains can be a too costly alternative to increase capacity, increasing frequencies can be interesting. However, the offered level of service might be jeopardised. Increasing frequencies might lead to higher delays and irregular services, resulting in a lower level of service than when lower frequencies are maintained. With the use of microscopic simulation tool OpenTrack, this research has given a quantitative analysis of the effects of increasing frequencies on timetable reliability. For a case study of the Rotterdam metro network, this research has developed four growth scenarios in which the frequencies are increased. It has found that a timetable with trunk section intervals up to 150 seconds still yield reliable services, however lower intervals yield more unreliable services. The implementation of moving block signaling can reduce delays of 40-50 percent, depending on the timetable. However, for irregularity, removing the driver from the front of the train, creating more buffer time at terminal stations, yields higher improvements than moving block does. This research has shown that moving block and metro automation can enable reliable services for timetables with very high frequencies. However, the operator is still faced with a choice to either strive for punctual trains, or to strive for regular trains.","metro networks; timetable reliability; punctuality; regularity; microscopic simulatino; OpenTrack; case study; metro automation; moving block signalling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Besides, current estimation methods are not suitable for large areas with a low beacon coverage. The goal<br/>of this thesis was therefore twofold. First, a simple bias model was proposed to reduce the influence of the UWB bias while still being implementable on a micro-processor. This model was shown to reduce the measurement error with 50% on validation data. Using this model, UWB-localization in a static beacon-configuration can be quickly improved. Second, an adaptation of the standard Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) method was proposed that uses a time-window of range measurements to increase the robustness to outliers and is still real-time implementable on a micro-processor. This Moving Horizon Model Parametrization (MH-MP) does not estimate every state in the complete time-window, but only estimates an offset of the initial state in the window. An analysis of simulation data and data gathered in flight has shown that the proposed MH-MP outperforms the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in both the<br/>position and velocity estimate and has a comparable computation time.

This is achieved by a well-coordinated sequence of energy generation, transmission, and absorption by muscles. Knowing the energy exchange between the body segments can explain the mechanisms that govern the dynamics of walking. In the case of disability, injury or disease, these mechanisms are often altered. In some disorders, such as cerebral palsy, the contribution of the ankle plantar flexors to power generation decreases that may lead to an increase in medio-lateral trunk movements. However, the direct cause or effect between increased sway and decreased contribution of the ankle is unknown. We asked how power generation and the energy balance of all segments were affected by the lateral movement of the trunk? To answer this question we evaluated the impact of voluntarily increased medio-lateral trunk movements on the mechanical energy generation and transfer during gait using a human musculoskeletal model.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"" style=""text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"">11 healthy subjects walked on an instrumented walkway and were asked to walk normally and with exaggerated medio-lateral trunk sway while measuring kinematic and kinetic data using motion capture cameras and force plates. To determine the effect on the energy generation and transfer, three estimates of total body power were computed using an inverse dynamics model consisting of 13 segments and 12 joints.

Work during the Rebound phase (at ~15-30% of the gait cycle) increased while work during the Push-off phase (at ~45-65% of the gait cycle) decreased. The power contribution of the ankle decreased, while the knee, hip and -most significantly- the lumbosacral joint generated more power. Segment analysis revealed that the contribution of the individual limbs to the total energy generation remained the same, while the head-arms-trunk (HAT) contributed more. Both parts of the push-off work, Pre- and Post-strike work decreased. Therefore, the voluntarily induced trunk movements did not impact the division of push-off work into Pre- and Post-strike work.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"" style=""text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm"">Our analyses reveal that the human musculoskeletal system is able to redistribute the power generation of the joints during different walking styles. With increased medio-lateral trunk movements, the human musculoskeletal system compensates for the increase in upper body energy with a decrease in push-off by the ankle. While these different walking styles make use of different muscles, they accomplish the same objective: moving the body forward. The increase in total positive (and negative) work suggests that walking with increased trunk movement is a less efficient mechanism of moving the body forward.","Gait; Trunk Movement; Push-off; Inverse dynamics; Joint work; Segment work","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, buildings today can perform better when being a ‘smart’ building and smart tools can help optimise buildings, by first measuring something about the building or something is requested from the user; This data is then used to achieve a goal.There are some studies about smart tools, but these studies are not focussed on integrating smart tools in the outpatient department. Therefor, the following research question has been developed: Which ‘smart’ optimisations of the outpatient department could improve patient experience, medical specialist’s workflow and utilisation of space? Qualitative research is conducted, whereby literature is reviewed in combination with comparative research of four different Dutch hospitals. Based on the case study, in total fourteen potential optimisations are distinguished in three different focus areas (from most desired to nice to have): (1) Workflow: Diagnostics, finding workplace, digital forms, finding colleague, information (EPD), self measuring / controlling, and e-consult. (2) Patient experience: Information provision, wayfinding, check-in, and senior service. (3) Utilisation of space: Space use, Maintenance / tracking of (medical) equipment, and cleaning. The focus of potential optimisations is mainly focused on functional objectives with supporting user activities, increase patients’ and employees’ satisfaction, and improving productivity. Therefor, the advice is to look at mutiple potential optimisations at the same time and try to come to an integrated solution. This will create new valuable insights, improve the performance of the individual optimisations and stimulates automation. And ultimately, improving the patient experience, the medical specialist’s workflow and the utilisation of space.","Smart Tools; Outpatient department; Medical specialist; patient; utilisation of space; Real Estate Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Demand driven population influxes combined with a lack of planning and infrastructure leads to massive problems of sustainability. The city faces the twin paradoxical problems of flash floods and the chronic lack of access to drinking water. Land use changes in the Bandung catchment are largely responsible for these water issues. The climate change dynamics only hasten the process of humanitarian disaster. Within this context, it is extremely important to find cost- efficient, sustainable solutions that can alleviate these problems and enable human activity to sustain without suffering. Research suggests that spatial solutions with circular systems may allow for the appropriate channelling of rain water and use it for sustenance. Landscape interventions aim to improve the hydrological order in the catchment, whereby sustained efforts are made to convert hard surfaces resulting from unregulated growth into water absorbing surfaces appear promising. Besides water retention and prevention of floods, these interventions have aesthetic appeal and spatial relevance to intervention through landscape design. They also achieve goals of more sustainable agriculture that further contributes to the appeal of the city and its aesthetic aspects. The efforts have the possibility of promoting eco-tourism for a city that already has abundant natural beauty owing to a volcanic terrain and evergreen rainforest cover (albeit covered under a layer of pollution today). Thus, proposed efforts through phased spatial interventions can create a positive circle of reinforcement where the benefits are much more far-reaching and sustainable beyond the primary goals of the project. Strategies for living with water need great innovation in developing countries where the fast pace of city expansion and population growth cannot keep up with the very slow pace of infrastructure development. The city can be restored to its former glory through a series of affordable hydrological and bio- engineered strategies in such challenging circumstances, creating case study for vulnerable catchments around the world. There is great promise that landscape infrastructural solutions and circular systems can transform the developing world.","Landscape infrastructure; Peri urban areas; Bandung, Indonesia; Agroforest community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

However, demand for food and economic development in the last century had driven many wetlands in the world being completely drained for cultivation and to the extent that no longer retain any natural wetland characteristics such as the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in the United States. The ongoing drainage results in large amounts of peat soil loss and following the decrease of crop production, which has brought the sunset to the agriculture in the EAA. At the same time, it is urgent in South Florida to stop the damaging discharges to the coastal estuaries, to restore the flow of clean water to the Everglades preservation area and to guarantee the freshwater supply in the whole region, which also requires the transformation of the EAA. <br/>This thesis develops an integrated approach for returning the Everglades agricultural lands to nature in order to recover the lost ecological assets in South Florida while balancing the economic value and improving spatial quality. Water is conveyed from lake Okeechobee and adjacent agricultural lands into the restoration area to be retained and purified through bioremediation process.

Surface EMG signals are inevitably contaminated by noise and artefacts from the site between the skin and electrodes, non-target muscles and recording hardware. After recording, signal processing methods like filtering, are used in an attempt to determine the underlying active state of the muscle, portrayed by the motoneuron pool firing. As EMG is in fact a deformed representation of the actual muscle activity, processing is used to extract a more veracious description of the active muscle states. <br/><br/>This study investigated the effects of random noise - which in practice resembles transducer noise -, and filtering on the simulation accuracy of short and long latency muscle stretch responses, extracted from simulated EMG signals. To obtain the deviation from the noiseless signals, a fiber potential model was developed to simulate the EMG surface potentials that used an existing motoneuron pool firing model by Schuurmans et al. 2009. The resulting EMGs were the muscle responses to stretch perturbations at different velocities and amplitudes combinations (1.5, 2, 3, 5 rad/s and 0.06, 0.10, 0.14 rad). Consecutively, the EMG signals were contaminated with different noise intensities (SNR: -1, 2, 5, 7, 9 dB) and then filtered with a \nth{3} order Butterworth low-pass filter, with cut-off frequencies between [1-200Hz]. Finally, the short- and long latency stretch responses areas were calculated and compared between the filtered noiseless and filtered noisy EMG signals, by calculating the difference between the values as a fraction of the value from the noiseless simulated signal. It was found that a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5 dB with a 85Hz cut-off low-pass filter was necessary to keep the error below 10\% maintaining M1 and M2 characteristics. It was also seen that M1 was more affected than M2 under the same amount of contamination, suggesting different spectral frequency contents between the stretch responses, and different underlying neuronal firing behaviour. The described signal-to-noise ratio thresholds and proposed cut-off frequencies resulting in acceptable signal error, can be used as a reference on accuracy of latency response simulations. The error courses provide information about the way error and signal are attenuated or preserved. Besides, the differences in error course comparing the two latency responses provides an insight into the difference in behaviour between the underlying reflex mechanisms. Apart from the findings the combination of adapted and developed model can be used in future research where noise-free surface potentials are required, and can be further developed to produce veracious EMG signals.","EMG, Motor Unit Action Potential modelling, Filtering, Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A version 2.0 was launched in 2018. The core of this website is an online PV system performance calculation model which involves three main functionalities: (i) a figure with a breakdown of the real-time system efficiencies, (ii) a national solar electricity production (NSEP) estimate, and (iii) an analysis of the economics for several types of PV systems. The goal of this Master thesis project was to create a Dutch PV Portal (PVP) version 3.0. The first part of this project involved investigating the vision and the purpose of this PV modelling website, as well as evaluating the performance calculation model of the version 2.0. A user-centered approach was followed to better understand the needs of one identified target group using this website: anyone who considers to opt for a PV system at a certain location. This means that, besides adding new features and upgrading the scientific models, also attention was paid to improving the usability of the website. Next to this, the potential of the NSEP model to perform large-scale sensitivity studies was researched. The Dutch PVP 3.0 contains several new design possibilities. A flat roof design option is implemented, the orientation (portrait/landscape) of the PV modules can be specified, an input option for row-to-row distance in field and flat roof designs is added and a design possibility for an East-West setup is created. Furthermore, the performance calculation model now contains a model that calculates the system's self-shading loss for field of flat roof designs: a so-called mutual shading model. Other new features are a load model that estimates the PV system size based on a specified yearly electricity use and a system size model that calculates a layout of the PV array based on the system size input specified by the user. A first validation study of the overall performance model for tilted roof designs found that the calculated energy values deviate between -10% and +5.4% from measured values of 26 real systems. The usability of the Dutch PVP is improved by implementing a framework that considers how the performance model fits within the bigger picture of the 'PV system design process'. It resulted in a step-by-step, responsive user interface that aims to better guide the user through multiple stages of this design process, and that relates to several identified questions they have in mind. An improved visual appearance contributes to this. <br/>The future application possibilities of the NSEP model were found to be promising, but many more research and professionalization is needed in order to create a large-scale research tool based on this model. The results of an executed sensitivity study with this NSEP model show first estimates of the quantitative impact of changing climate on the national solar electricity production.","Photovoltaic systems; modeling PV systems; Solar energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this research is to evaluate planning choices in repetitive construction projects. In order to evaluate the planning of these projects to quantify the risk of overruns, an adaptable digitized model is needed which can run realistic probabilistic simulations. The model was supplemented with realistic effects such as probabilistic distributions and learning curves to represent the inherent uncertainties in the progression of the project. The model is able to estimate the total duration of a project, the time-dependent costs and resource utilization percentage. Even more so, the model was used to give an estimation of the risk of overruns as a probability. The model has been used to evaluate decisions that can be taken when planning a project. To test how these planning decisions affect the project outcomes, they were tested in a test case set-up. The influence of one planning decision was increased and the outcomes measured. These planning decisions consist of 1) the use of multiple resources crews per process, 2) the use of batching, 3) using time buffers and 4) multiskilled crews. For decreasing the project duration, extra crews can be added. Time-dependent costs are decreased by adding buffers or working with larger batches. Improving the utilization percentage is done by using multiskilled crews and adding buffers. The results are relative and can be interpreted as rules of thumb, but are indicative of the power of planning decisions to steer project performance without altering the scope or the construction method. To show that the model indeed corresponds to these rules of thumb, they were applied in two projects, yielding promising results, both for total duration and time-dependent costs. Using the understanding of the effects of planning decisions, repetitive construction projects can be improved to increase productivity and decrease time-dependent costs significantly.","Project planning; Planning decisions; Construction performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

However, their emergence is being hindered due to the lack of reliable fault protection techniques. DC faults exhibit extremely fast current rise rates as compared to faults in AC grids. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a fast fault detection and isolation technique applicable especially in LVDC networks. Fault isolation was achieved via solid state circuit breakers (SSCB) due to their fast functioning capability and high controllability levels. For quick fault detection two distinct techniques were selected. The first measured the distribution line’s rate of change of current while the second technique determined the current magnitude by measuring the on-state voltage across the SSCB’s semiconductor device. The complete design of the fault detection circuits leading to isolation has been presented in this research work. The performance of both the designed detection circuits and fault isolation via the SSCB have been validated through practical experiments. The results demonstrated that isolation of the fault subsequent to its occurrence is achievable in just a few microseconds. Hence, this implies that the fast rising DC fault currents can be detected and interrupted in adequate time prior to resulting in any hazardous consequences.","LVDC networks; Fault detection; Fault protection; Power electronics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Knowledge of the location of these large reflecting surfaces can help to better estimate the sound field behavior inside the room. This work focuses on exploiting the inherent information present in echoes measured by microphones to infer the location of nearby reflecting surfaces. The investigated application uses a loudspeaker to emit a known signal and record the resulting sound field with a co-located microphone array. A signal model is proposed which provides a relationship between reflector locations and measured microphone signals. The locations of reflections are estimated by fitting a sparse set of modeled reflections with measurements. We present two novelties with respect to prior art. First, the method is end-to-end where from raw microphones measurements it outputs an estimate of the location of reflectors. For the case of a compact uniform circular microphone array, the symmetry can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the inference process. Secondly, the model is extended to include a loudspeaker model that is aware of the inherent directivity pattern of the loudspeaker. The performance of the proposed localization method is compared in simulation to the existing state-of-the-art localization methods.

However, testing is taking place over legacy automatic train protection systems , such as ATBNG, as well. ATO requires information from the automatic train protection system. The goal of this master thesis is to determine the data gap between ETCS and ATBNG in relation to ATO. First a generic ATO model is developed from literature. This model presents the information required and produced by ATO. The model is used as a framework for the analysis of ATO over ETCS and ATO over ATBNG. This analysis resulted in a conceptual model of both ATO over ETCS and ATO over ATBNG. The conceptual model shows that ATBNG can provide the required information if the ATBNG operational envelope is used as the relevant safety envelope. However, currently the operational envelope of the NS’54 signalling system is the relevant safety envelope. Additional information is required to allow ATO to determine the NS’54 operational envelope. Furthermore, ATBNG is not capable of presenting ATO information to the train driver. A new ATO DMI is required. Moreover, the ProRail traffic management system is not yet capable of providing ATO with the required information for both ATO over ETCS and ATO over ATBNG.

The single operating point optimized design leads to a problematic phenomenon called ‘local optimization’ which means that the design has a very narrow range of better performance around that point and deteriorates significantly at other points and thus requires the machine to be robust enough with stable and maximum average performance over the operating conditions range. The principal aim of the thesis is to develop a design model for the conceptual design of a robust multi-stage axial turbine for the given operating conditions range and distribution by employing an optimization approach along with developing a procedure to incorporate the number of stages decision in this framework and quantify the efficiency gain of the robust machine over a single design point optimized machine The two methodologies i.e. RO (Robust Optimization) and MO (Multipoint Optimization) to achieve robustness in any application are implemented in the model and are compared in terms of computational expense and ease of implementation. In MO methodology, two sampling algorithms i.e. FSA (Fourier transform-based Sampling Algorithm) and SSA (Slope-based Sampling Algorithm) were developed for the selection of the most appropriate points from the given distribution. To check the effectiveness of the developed model, two different test cases have been chosen i.e. one operating with the near-ideal fluid and the other one with an organic liquid. From the acquired results, the overall performance of the robust machine design obtained from the model is better than the single point optimized machine design. The obtained gain values for both the test cases can be very significant if the time window of the variation of the operating conditions is lower. The model was validated with the results of efficiency values and its trend obtained by using an opensource code for turbomachinery design i.e. Multall by performing CFD simulations.","Robust Optimisation; turbo-machinery; Conceptual design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Characterisation of the materials, by techniques like XRF, XRD, optical microscopy, and SEM, is conducted before and after hydrogen exposureso that it was possible to evaluate the effect of hydrogen ingress.The results showed that the chemistry of the surfaces is irreversible changed after the electrochemical induced hydrogen sorption/desorption process due to the formation of oxides.

The performance profile, a cumulative distribution function, is said to reflect all major performance characteristics of a solver. This, combined with a clustering algorithm, is used in this thesis in a classifier to detect performance anomalies. The performance profile needs a performance measure, for which three options were introduced: the area under the chart, the quality at the same time and the maximum difference. Through experimentation, 18 measure configurations were tested and rated on their accuracy and apparent issues. Three of the measure configurations have promising results, with an accuracy of roughly 80%.","heuristics; performance evaluation; anomaly detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van der Cammen, JJ (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Turret structures within FPSO's are subjected to a variety of repeated loads, due to the harsh environment they operate in during their service live, meaning that fatigue is a governing limit state in turret structural design. Turret structural components are connected by arc-welded joints which are considered particularly susceptible to fatigue damage. Due to the complexity of the structure and its loading, welded details may be subjected to a multiaxial stress state. Currently fatigue design of turret structures is predominantly based on a uniaxial fatigue criteria assuming governing mode I (i.e. normal stresses). This design approach can be non-conservative for welded details subjected to a multiaxial stress state, especially when these are non-proportional (i.e. out of phase). The estimation of multiaxial fatigue live for details subjected to a multiaxial stress state is still an extremely complex task. There is still a discrepancy in obtained multiaxial fatigue live between different design rules (i.e. as presented in ISSC), meaning that future work on this topic is required.<br/>Due to the size and complexity of turret structures, identification of welded details (i.e. in the order of hundreds) subjected to a multiaxial (non)-proportional stress state is a rather complicated and laborious task. This thesis proposes a new screening method that identifies sensitive locations where multiaxiality occurs, either geometry or loading induced. Component stresses (i.e. Mode I and III) are determined from finite element models using a mesh-insensitive structural stress method. The stress state (i.e. multiaxiality and proportionality) of these stress components is determined using the parameters of an ellipse that encloses the stress data (i.e. component stresses) in 2-dimensional stress space. Making this a practical and efficient method to identify sensitive locations within the turret where multiaxiality occurs. <br/>For the multiaxial fatigue damage calculations of welded details subjected to a non-proportional multiaxial stress state, the accumulative Moment of Load Path (MLP) concept is used. Within this concept the multiaxial fatigue damage for any given non-proportional load path is assumed to consist of two parts. The first part can be considered damage due to the effective stress range Δσ_e (i.e. stress due to direct path), and the second is the ""load path non-proportionality"" fatigue damage due to excursion of the reference load path. By implementing the MLP-based method as part of the path dependent maximum range (PRMD) cycle counting procedure, half cycles and their corresponding MLP-based equivalent stresses ranges are computed. Given the MLP-based stress distributions from PDMR cycle counting, the well know Palmgren-Minor rule is used to determine the accumulation of fatigue damage considering a proper fatigue resistance curve. By implementing both the screening and the proposed multiaxial fatigue damage method onto a relatively simple tube-to-flange connection, a comparison study is used to determine whether the screening method is capable of identifying sensitive locations that may be susceptible to multiaxial fatigue. For five considered load scenarios, the screening method showed to give relatively similar results with respect to the actual fatigue damage calculation, making it a suitable structural screening method. Using the same tube-to-flange connection the multiaxial fatigue damage is calculated based on DNVGL and compared with those calculated using the MLP-based concept. For uniaxial proportional loading scenarios similar fatigue damages are observed, however for the non-proportional load scenarios the MLP-based method gives significant higher fatigue damage results w.r.t DNVGL. Performing structural screening on complex structural systems like the turret considering each load signal during its service live would be very computationally expensive. Therefore five load scenarios are considered to be sufficient to perform the structural screening. For this thesis a certain domain of the turret of the Aoka Mizu vessel is screened using the defined screening load scenarios. Within the scope (i.e. evaluated domain) details resulting in relative high fatigue damage due to high levels of non-proportionality are not encountered. Even though details exist with high non-proportionality factors the stress ranges of these details are usually relatively small compared to details subjected to a dominant uni-axial stress state.","Multiaxial fatigue; welded joints; out-of-phase; welded structures; FPSO; maximum load path; Path-Dependent maximum range; non-conservative; arc-welded joints; service life; cycle counting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The objective of this thesis project is to utilize revealed preference data in a case-study of KLM Royal Dutch Airways to better understand the customer relation towards ancillaries. Therefore, the willingness to pay for bundled flight ancillaries, also called branded fares, is estimated. Discrete choice modelling offers the opportunity to estimate the willingness to pay of the customers from the given data. A multinomial logit model was chosen and designed to enable the estimation of the parameter. Therefore, revealed preference data has been extracted, combined and cleaned with Python. A total of 47.350 flights have been analysed from 10 medium-haul destinations within Europe. For a better model fit the travel motive of the customers has been used to split the dataset into multiple actor specific constants being used to calculate the willingness to pay from. The results indicate far less willingness to pay for the ancillaries as currently asked for, namely 8.06 EUR for the Standard fare for business customers and 2.95 EUR for leisure customers. The Flex fare is estimated for 26.33 EUR for business customers and 4.82 EUR for leisure customers. The estimation result leads to the conclusion that it might be useful to implement price discrimination for the ancillaries as it is already in place for the airfare. Beyond the application on the willingness to pay, the revealed preference data has been analysed to reflect on the propensity and the amount of customer wish to pay for C02 offsetting. It shows that compared to stated preference data of other research the customers in this case-study pay far less frequently (only 1.02 percent of the passengers) and offset a tremendously less amount (on avg. 0.63 EUR) compared to the research based on stated preference.","discrete choice modelling; revealed preference data; airline ancillaries; multionomial logit model; CO2 offsetting aviation; willingness to pay estimation; WTP estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This has been further mitigated by the increased usage of fossil fuels, deforestation, increased livestock farming, and chemical emissions, as a result of the large-scale industrialization of developing nations, combined with the increased consumption of goods and services all across the world (Steffen et. al., 2018). While separate research can be conducted in individual fields, it has become increasingly apparent that interdisciplinary research is imperative. The Kaya Identity was formulated by Yoichi Kaya to form a relationship between carbon emissions and economic and technological factors, particularly in the form of ‘growth factors’ in this thesis. The Kaya Identity has since been a mainstay of analyzing carbon emissions by internationally acclaimed bodies like the United Nations. To specify the research objectives a few research questions were asked: What form have policies to curb carbon emissions taken until now and what are the main points of differentiation between developed and developing countries? Using the Kaya Identity framework, what have been the main trends in energy efficiency and carbon intensity, thus identifying the main factors that policies have been aimed at correcting? What are the trends in energy efficiency and carbon emissions in each of the main sectors of the economy: transport, industry and manufacture, energy and heat, and buildings? What are the main deep decarbonization pathways which can be implemented by a developing economy (India) and a developed economy (the United Kingdom)? <br/>To find answers to these questions, metadata over a period of thirty years was decomposed over the different sectors in India and the United Kingdom. The results of the decomposition showed that while the United Kingdom showed a decreasing trend in carbon emissions over time, India has shown an opposite trend. Also, technological factors have had a sufficient impact in offsetting carbon emissions in the United Kingdom, shown by negative growth percentages. Similar trends are observed in most individual sectors in the UK, except for the building sector, where the technology factor has not sufficient to offset the scale factor, showing us that it is a sector which needs particular focus. In India it is evident that the effect of technological factors needs to be enhanced, since the scale factors will. In each of the chapters, policies which were implemented for corresponding sectors looked at as well. <br/>A regression analysis was then done till the year 2050 to predict the future trends of carbon emissions, followed by a stakeholder analysis of a possible technology in each sector. A two-phase solution is suggested since the demand for energy will never cease; first by integrating carbon capture technologies into existing industrial methods, followed by large-scale investments into the research and development of technologies with a much higher efficiency which have a greater chance of mass acceptance into society and industry without discounting important stakeholder values. This will reduce the rate of carbon emissions released into the environment till a truly sustainable result can be achieved.","Decarbonization; Policy; kaya identity; Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Research has shown that mineral processing is of major influence, due to the use of heavy chemicals that are both expensive and polluting. Currently, electrowinning (the electrodeposition of metals) is only used in the last purification step of the process. So far, the majority of the studies on cobalt have focused on non-electrowinning possibilities. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the electrochemical behaviour within different environments to obtain more information and gain a better understanding. This thesis focuses on the electrochemical behaviour and deposition of cobalt-bearing minerals, which will be evaluated with the help of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). These techniques use the help of multiple variable input parameters, which will be investigated and compared to gain the optimised condition to perform the experiments. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the techniques to different input parameters and different solutions will be investigated. This is done to investigate what the origins are for the differences in the electrochemical behaviour of copper-cobalt minerals in aqueous solutions using analytical, synthetic and real ores, and to find a correlation between the obtained results using the graphs generated using CV and EQCM-techniques. This is done to investigate to possibilities using selective electrowinning, meaning the electrodeposition of multiple elements within the same electrolyte solution. Based on a review of the literature, the experimental setup used for the experiments will be discussed to gain better understanding of the specialised equipment and corresponding software. Cobalt chloride, cobalt sulphate and copper sulfate solution will be evaluated first, after which two synthetic cobalt-bearing minerals containing iron will be tested. With the help of CV, the electrochemical behaviour, e.g. redox- reactions, can be analysed. Using the EQCM, accurate measurements of the mass change per unit area of the electroplated cobalt will be recorded. Synthetic minerals will be used to discover how much can be recovered using this technique. Finally, six samples from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will be evaluated to obtain the same data as for the synthetic minerals. For this QEMSCAN data is used to evaluate the mineral composition. Analysis of the results demonstrated that under different circumstances in different environments, similar electrochemical behaviour and the occurrence of copper, iron and/or cobalt deposition is observed. However, for special cases these reactions do not occur. This difference can be explained by a varying mineralogy, where bornite and chalcopyrite have a positive effect on the electrochemical activity. Regarding the shape of the voltammogram, the number of electrons involved in the reaction has the largest influence. Furthermore, alkaline conditions have a positive effect on the electrodeposition of cobalt. No overall correlation has been found between the samples. For all experiments similar reactions and electrochemical activity is observed regarding the peak potentials and within the same environment, correlations can be found. Recommendations for further research are to investigate the influence of changes to parameters such as temperature, magnetic field and impurities on the electrochemical behaviour of the reaction and changes in the yield of electrodeposited material, to generate more data to validate and calibrate the characteristic potentials that can be used for selective electrowinning and to gather more data of the selective electrowinning experiments in terms of additional (rare) elements, such as lithium.","Electrochemistry; Cobalt; Copper; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance; CoG3-project","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-09","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Cobalt: Geology, Geomicrobiology and Geometallurgy",""

However, this implementation does not come without risks. There are important ethical concerns that should be addressed beforehand to ensure public trust and acceptability. Privacy, safety, transparency, reliability and potential biases are some of the issues to consider. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) frameworks have been designed by academics to tackle this sort of problems but there is no application of these frameworks in the field of AI in healthcare. This problem is even more salient in the private sector, due to the unawareness of the RRI concept in industry. Consequently, the research objective of this project was to offer recommendations on how to implement RRI practices to avoid potential risks and improve the social acceptability of AI. For this, we studied the case of Philips and carried out interviews with the company’s experts in AI and corporate social responsibility (CSR). This information was complemented with a comprehensive study of the literature on topics related to AI in healthcare and RRI. The results from these activities were used to create a roadmap to introduce RRI practices in the AI innovation activities within Philips. The results showed that large companies should build upon their existing CSR practices to develop RRI. This will increase the acceptability of RRI within the research and development (R&amp;D) teams. Based on that, we came up with 14 recommendations for the case of Philips. These actions range from current practices, such as continuing with the rigorous process of patient data selection and curation, to novel solutions such as including better interactive features in the design of telehealth platforms (i.e. virtual reality, video calls or social networks). Further research can be carried out in different companies to come up with common principles that contribute to the creation of a more comprehensive RRI framework for AI in healthcare.","Responsible Research and Innovation; Artificial Intelligence; Healthcare; Philips; PRISMA Project","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To produce drinking water, removal of natural organic matter has been of importance due to formation of DBPs. Of the many available treatments, ion exchange (IEX) has the potential to remove natural organic matter (NOM). However, IEX resins need to be regenerated upon saturation with NOM, which generates brine. Usually, NaCl is used to regenerate the resins, hence the desorbed NOM ends in the brine with sodium chloride and other ions like sulphate and nitrate which are present in surface or ground water. The disposal of high saline brine is complex due to aftereffects on the environment and the associated costs. Therefore, an interesting physical alternative is to separate the NOM from brine that can be further reprocessed as fertilisers for agriculture. Ceramic nanofiltration (NF) appears to be an alternative to treat the brine. This type of membrane is chemically and mechanically robust, can be operated at extreme pH conditions, withstands backwashing and chemical cleaning. Besides, ceramic nanofiltration membranes have the capability to separate multivalent ions which makes it suitable to treat the brine. However, NOM possess a complex matrix and relies on various factors for its high removal. In this research, it was interesting to recognize the NOM fractions and the behaviour alleviating NOM retention. Various IEX brines from water treatment plants were studied. For this, NOM was characterised using two different methods i.e., LC-OCD and NSM. The LC-OCD characterization done by Het Waterlaboratorium characterized NOM fraction based on the size of fractions into Humic substances, building blocks, Low molecular weight neutrals and low molecular weight acids. Characterisation of NSM was done by Udine University, Italy wherein the characterization of humics was done on the principle of the selective resin adsorption and precipitation. The characterisation of NOM by LC-OCD predicted the NOM rejection on membrane quite accurately. The effect of ionic strength was investigated to reflect NOM removal. NOM rejection for same NOM source and membrane pore size remained unaffected by the ionic strength of the brine. However, when different membrane pore sizes (600Da and 900Da) for different NOM source, NOM removal by ceramic nanofiltration was governed a combination of steric exclusion, electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic nature of the humic content and. In longer duration, ceramic NF membranes may foul due to filtration process. To reflect the same, fouling test was conducted. Fouling test was conducted with the high ionic strength brine because during the filtration experiments, it showed highest permeability drop. The sudden drop in permeate flux was due to osmotic pressure difference. However, during NOM filtration period, the flux and permeability were quite steady which suggested no major fouling in that phase. Irreversible fouling did not affect the membrane pore size.","Ceramic Nano-filtration; NOM rejection; IEX brine; LC-OCD; Humic substances; Sodium chloride and Sodium Sulphate; New standardised method; Osmotic pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

That is because, as the population expands, so does the energy consumption. Considering that the building environment is accountable for 40 percent of energy consumption and 36 percent of total CO2 emissions, the building sector has to conform with specific guidelines and targets, in order to reach neutral energy use. Newly constructed buildings are already targeting better energy performance. However, more than one fifth of European building stock has been built before 1945, and together with low renovation rate in Europe, heritage buildings are struggling to become part of the new energy reality. In order to complete the energy transition, every sector of building environment should commit on energy saving and producing interventions. On one hand, by renovating heritage building stock energy is saved and buildings are performing better. On the other hand, it is challenging to apply energy production interventions in such buildings in order to balance the energy demand. This is the reason why, the current research is focusing on how photovoltaic technology could be applied on heritage buildings, without compromising their architectural character. The application guidelines, which are going to answer the latter question, are going to be tested on a heritage case study in Greece. Moreover, the legislative framework for energy transition is going to be described with the purpose to explore the extension of the guidelines, since they are covering all sectors of human activity. Additionally, the building stock in Greece is being presented and how the European legislative framework is applied in this country’s concept. What is more, photovoltaic technology is going to researched in depth, specifically how the photovoltaic cells are producing and how do they produce energy. In order to get more explicit about solar interventions on heritage cases, such as where is the best place for the application and why. In addition to that, more criteria for suitable solar application on heritage are going to be researched, such as color, transparency, size and functionality. After the literature research on both heritage culture and photovoltaic technology, and also the applied version of them in reference buildings, a list of design requirements has formed. Therefore, the only way to test if these guidelines could be used for photovoltaic application in a random building, then it could be very valuable to similar future interventions. Thus, a heritage case building in Greece, specifically in the city of Florina of north-western Macedonia. Regarding the design process, up next, the photovoltaic application is going to be analyzed based on the design requirements of the technology upon heritage and the specific demands of the building case. Supplementary to design guidelines, a matrix is formed in order to present all the different options for the interventions. By the end of the matrix, two energy scenarios are forming in order to perform the application in situations as close to reality as possible. Regarding the design, public opinion upon energy interventions is very valuable, and especially when it comes to solar application on heritage buildings. Moreover, the acceptance of similar interventions is going to be discussed. In addition, and in order to have specific overview about public acceptance in the local community of this research case study, a questionnaire is going to be conducted. The results are going to be presented and the public’s influence is going to be examined. Ultimately, the final design proposal for the case study is going to be demonstrated and the different applications are going to be analyzed. Finally, an overview of the design proposal is being inspected, as far as it concerns the building itself and the urban environment in total. To sum up, general conclusions re going to be presented and also the limitations of the research itself. A few suggestions are additionally to be explored for investigation of future possibilities on the subject.","photovoltaic; pv; heritage; Heritage; Building technology; Greece; Photovoltaic Systems; Solar energy; PV potential; PV application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","40° 46' 55.09"" N"

The report analyses various existing electrification projects identifying the characteristics of their approaches in order to recognize the shortcomings of market available products and to build a design criterion. Given that the main target application is aimed at rural areas, a modular approach has been the base of the design criterion with the purpose of tailoring the SHS to developing countries with limited resources. The project analyses each step within this modular process together with the power electronics involved in every stage. The main objective of the project is to perform direct charging between the charging station and the power bank, which consists in feeding power directly from the bus voltage of the charging station into the battery cells with only one active converter. This feature is implemented as a result of the introduction of the power delivery protocol released together with the USB type C connector . This offers a wide variety of possibilities which includes negotiable voltage levels ranging from 5 to 20V. The first element taking part in the direct charging is the charging station .This thesis addresses the challenge of designing and building a circuit with dynamic adjustment of voltage and current in a cost-effective and reliable manner. By adding a digital to analogue converter and 2 operational amplifiers, it is possible to add this feature to a wide range of standard voltage converters available in the market. The report analyses this circuit in 3 steps: first with circuit theory, secondly by simulation and eventually by including the results obtained in an empirical test implemented in one of the prototypes. The power delivery protocol is also beneficial for a power-bank application, which is the second element of the direct charging. It is one of the purposes of the thesis to evaluate the performance of direct charging. Eventually, the report presents the main conclusions derived from the analysis of the aforementioned elements and also covers future lines which include improvements to be implemented within the components of the solar home systems.","Rural electrification; Solar Home Systems; Prototyping; Modularity; USB type-C","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This has raised the interest in electrolysis and has boostedits development. Water electrolysis produces hydrogen and oxygen from water using direct current,nowadays often with an electrochemical efficiency of around 80%. Although much effort has beenmade to reach such high efficiencies little research has been done on the excess heat produced byelectrolysis. This thesis intends to cover this topic, mainly focussing on Proton Exchange Membrane(PEM) electrolysis. All of the inefficiencies of the electrolyser translate into heat and it is the objective ofthis research to investigate how much of this heat can be extracted and contained for use in a separateapplication. Furthermore, in the second part of this thesis, the available applications are studied in anoffshore and onshore production scenario to better understand potential of this heat.In order to accurately simulate the thermal behaviour of a stack of PEM cells an electrochemical andthermal model was created representing the average largescalePEM electrolyser of today. Furthermorea basic integrated cooling system was designed in order to assess how much heat can be extractedfrom the stack and at what temperature. The system consists of separate channels for coolingwater inside the bipolar plates that separate the individual cells. It was found that well over 90% ofthe heat produced by the stack can be extracted in the form of cooling water at a few degrees (&lt;3표퐶)below stack temperature without impeding the performance of the stack. The largest contributor to heatbeing lost, was found to be the production of water vapour on the anode side of the cells which can bereduced significantly by operating with an elevated pressure in the anode chamber (5 bar).In the onshore case study it was found that an electrolyser is very well suited to be connected to adistrict heating network. The low temperature heat serves well for applications such as space heatingand/or water heating. In an offshore scenario the excess heat can serve to aid in thermal desalinationhowever it proved to be more difficult to find an adequate application for the full amount of producedheat.In conclusion, the models presented in this thesis have shown very satisfactory results in terms potentialof excess heat. It has proved to be a very interesting field of study and more indepthresearchas well as broader studies on possible heat applications can be conducted to fully understand thepotential of excess heat from electrolysis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of those struggles is related to the diminishing appetite for food and drinks. In Dutch hospice care institutions this struggle has also become apparent with their residents. When they see those near and dear urge their loved one to eat more, in the hope that maybe it will help extend the life of their loved one. Unfortunately, this approach of food care does more harm than it helps. This master thesis explores the food care in a Dutch hospice institution, it studies the areas of concern within that scope, and what may cause these concerning circumstances to come about. The analysis reveals how hospice residents may lack a sense of autonomy over their meals, and how the food care can be inconsistent between different care provider. It results into situations where residents receive unsuitable meals that are difficult to eat, or too large to finish, leading to concern and guilt about the unfinished, and sometimes conflicts with relatives, who urge their loved one to eat more. Furthermore, it becomes clear that the food care can lack in social and emotional values, over-prioritizing the nutritional intake. Finally, those near and dear may struggle to let go of food, however interventions from the hospice to stimulate them to let go usually are too abrupt and therefore unnatural. As a response to these concerns a hospice diary for eating and drinking is presented. It is a diary that centralizes everything that has to do with food care. It provokes a registration of the food and drink preferences of hospice residents, to ensure instantly well-adjusted food care that can be provided consistently between different care provider groups. Furthermore, through daily questions on topics related to the emotional and social values of food, those values are (re)introduced to the context, to distract from the prioritized nutritional values. Finally, fill-in pages stimulate the daily assessment for desired meals. Combined with “instructions” for the assessments, the care providers should become more aware of the necessity to make correct and complete assessments of what the resident truly desires for their meal.","food; interaction design; end-of-life; palliative care; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of this research is to design a flat dynamic hand orthosis finger for DMD patients with Brooke scale grades 4, 5, or 6 and to test its functioning. The design consists of a silicone outer part, and an inner part from polylactic acid. The presented prototype is small, can generate a flexion movement and has a finger mass of 20 g.

The reached output forces in horizontal and vertical direction with a certain pressure were 3.4 N (10.5 N target) at 1.75 bar and 0.6 N at 2 bar, respectively. The bending angles were 35◦ for the MCP joint, 78◦ for the PIP joint, and 58◦ for the DIP joint. To conclude, this paper presented a new design of a finger for a hand orthosis. The prototype is flat, can generate flexion movements and has a finger mass of 20 g. Except for the MCP joint, the bending angles meet the requirements. Only the output forces were too low.

The hand cart should furthermore be suitable for up to three children to sit in and suitable to transport goods. Research was done on current hand carts on the market, on users' experiences with them, and on the current sustainability and circularity of Greentom's currently produced product. This research resulted in a list of users' needs and wishes in a hand cart, including the ideal dimensions, needed safety norms, needed requirements for it to be easy to use, and the selling price preferred to be under €250. Furthermore, the research concluded that rPP and rPET are the most suitable and sustainable materials to be used in the hand cart chassis and textile respectively, and that an end-of-life scenario where new Greentom products are sent back and refurbished into 2nd-life products would result in hand carts with 62% lower eco-costs and 71%€ value capture compared to the product with a linear incineration end-of-life. By using these concluded required elements of a hand cart, and by defining the Greentom form family and future hand cart style, several ideas were developed after which five product ideas were proposed. The five ideas showed promising iterations on the basic frame structure, folding principle, push/pull bar design, and bottom design. By detailing their ergonomic and constructional aspects, which concluded the exact dimensions, necessary wheel types, push/pull bar positioning, weight-support beam construction, and necessary folding structure iterations, the ideas were concretized into three concepts: 'Horizontals', 'Twofold', and 'Diagonal'. The concepts were evaluated based on three main criteria from the list of requirements, after which the 'Diagonal' was concluded to be the most promising concept to be further developed into detail. Detailing the concept was done by defining the to-be-improved points with a structural mock-up model, and by defining and further developing satisfier and exciter attributes to ensure a high degree of customer satisfaction using the KANO model. Lastly, after building a 1:1 functional prototype of the improved final concept, the prototype was evaluated by means of a user test, and showed to successfully satisfy all users' needs and wishes with positive reactions on all attributes. The final design, the 'Greentom Go' concludes to be 1) simple in its design since it complies with Greentom's form family style while also expressing its own Hand Cart style, 2) easy to use as it is easily (un)foldable, enables children to independently step in and out of the hand cart, allows attachment of Greentom accessories and a baby car seat, and is well manoeuvrable by having large wheels, a pushable handlebar, and by being lightweight (7.57kg), and 3) affordable since the reuse of existing and future moulds as well as the refurbishment end-of-life scenario allows for lower total costs enabling a selling price of €220. Therefore, the stated design goal is concluded to be successfully achieved by the Greentom Go.","sustainability; circularity; hand cart; product life cycle; end-of-life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Compared to coal and oil, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel and may serve as a transition fuel. To meet future demands for gas there is a desire to optimize the production from existing reservoirs with their production facilities. In case of wet natural gas wells this gas production can be hampered by the presence of liquids, namely water and condensate, thus creating a multiphase flow in the production tubing. The maximum gas well capacity is limited by the ever reducing upward gas flow velocity due to the subsurface reservoir pressure that is reducing over time. The reduced gas velocity results in the inability to transport the liquid upward from the downhole location to the surface. The accumulated liquids will then block the well bore (so-called liquification), making further gas production impossible. One solution it to decrease the cross sectional flow area by inserting an inner pipe in the existing tubing, thus creating an annulus. This results in a higher gas velocity. The multiphase flow characteristics in the annulus tubing are not yet fully understood, such as the pressure drop, the liquid hold-up and the different flow regimes. Therefore in the present study lab experiments were carried out to further investigate those characteristics to enable optimisation of predictive flow modeling. The main focus is on the behaviour of the liquid film along both pipe walls. In this study a 12 m mid-scale vertical annulus with a 124 mm diameter outer pipe and a 100 mm diameter inner pipe was designed and constructed. The experiments were conducted at atmospheric conditions using an air-water mixture as the working fluids. Multiple combinations of gas and liquid throughputs were studied. The liquid at the inlet could either be injected on the inner pipe, the outer pipe or equally divided on both pipes. The position of the inner pipe with respect to the outer pipe was adjustable to create different eccentricities. To measure the local film heights flush mounted conductance sensors were designed, built and installed in the half circumference of both pipes. The efficacy of the sensors was thoroughly studied and the sensors were subjected to multiple test cases. The concentric annulus experiments showed that the pressure drop does not depend on the method of liquid injection. However, the liquid hold-up fraction at lower liquid throughputs was observed to be lower for the single wall liquid injection as compared to injection on both pipes. The redistribution of the liquid film for the single liquid injection depends on the liquid throughput. Larger liquid throughputs gave thicker liquid films containing a wavier gas-liquid interface from which droplets are atomized and subsequently migrated to the other pipe wall. Furthermore, it was found that the critical superficial gas velocity at which liquid loading occurs is 14 m/s, which is neither dependent on the method of liquid injection nor on the liquid throughput. The designed sensors were able to provide a good indication of the film heights. Single phase experiments, using air as the working fluid, showed that the pressure drop is reduced by 30$\%$ in the fully eccentric case in comparison to the concentric case. The eccentric annulus configuration with air-water flow showed that the liquid films along both pipe walls may merge. This so-called liquid bridging mainly occurs at higher eccentricities and causes flow reversal in the narrow gap. This results in a much higher liquid hold-up and pressure drop. Eccentricity induces redistribution of the liquid film from the inner pipe to the outer pipe at higher superficial gas velocities. It was found that eccentricity promotes an unequal film height along the circumference of each pipe: the film height decreases when going from the narrow gap towards the wide gap.","Annulus; Annular flow; Disturbance waves; Film height sensors; Two-phase flow; Eccentricity; Velocity string","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

To counter the problem of possible collisions between the growing turbine blades and the tower support structure, downwind turbines might be a solution. For this configuration, blade flexibility no longer forms a problem and besides that passive yaw systems can be applied. However, the fatigue lifetime of the turbine components might significantly decrease due to tower shadow effects. This thesis aims to decrease the uncertainty in the difference between downwind turbines and the conventional upwind turbines. An aeroelastic blade model is constructed using a finite element model of the NREL 5MW turbine blade. This model is subsequently converted to a downwind model including a wake behind the tower structure that temporarily slows down the inflowing wind on the blade when the blade is in the tower shadow area. This wake description follows from a literature review and should be valid for the flow conditions around the turbine. History dependency of the aerodynamic forces on the blades is included in the model using the Küssner function. A comparison in tower wake effects is done using simulations of upwind and downwind turbine blades which result in the blade motions caused by the tower shadow disturbance. From these motions also the root moments are deduced over time as well as the angle of attack variations for the different blade elements. A comparison with other software confirms the order of magnitude of the blade position in equilibrium and a check for dynamic stall issues is done to show the possible influence on the blade lift after the tower shadow disturbance. The root moment variations are used as a fatigue indicator using rainflow analysis. Concluding from this, wind velocities near cut-out speed for downwind turbines cause the biggest wake effects. The static blade deflections and root moments are at the highest for rated wind speed at upwind turbines. Compared to upwind turbines, the downwind turbines are prone to higher wake effects and therefore increased fatigue damage. The overturning root moment and flapwise deflection variations for downwind turbine blade have shown to be up to 88 % and 100 % higher compared to those for upwind turbines respectively.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last years, the VGM noticed they were not reaching a diverse group of youngsters even though our society is becoming more diverse so, to welcome everyone and be ready for the audience of the future, they felt the need to change their attitude. To create a concept that is successful and supported, the youngsters have been involved in every step of the user centred, loosely applied, Design Thinking framework. Literature shows that to change the museum into a place where inclusion is enhanced Sandell (1995) three cultural dimensions of inclusion are defined; representation (of a person’s cultural heritage), participation (opportunities in cultural production) and access (opportunities to enjoy cultural services). To gain insights on what the users need to find these three dimensions in culture, 6 interviews and 2 museum visits were carried out. It was concluded that in experiencing culture, youngsters find it important to be able to do their own meaning making, feel a personal connection and have a fun and exiting experience. Instead of the VGM feeling distant, not relevant and at times boring, which is currently the case. From these insights a new museum mindset is formulated, to help the VGM to communicate more in the ‘language’ of the youngsters. This means that their communication should focus more on identification, with Van Gogh, then adoration, communicate more evocative that informative, provide more guidance than autonomy and present themselves more boldly than conventional. In the ideation phase it emerged that the personal letters Vincent van Gogh wrote during his life to his friends and family could be a great source of inspiration for youngsters nowadays. This led to the development of the ‘Van Gogh, the other story’ concept, where youngsters with a migration background get acquainted Vincent van Gogh's personal life story in a meaningful way, find connections between his life and their own and create an artwork in cooperation with a professional artist. Based on his original letters, five modern letters have been written, and made into a booklet, with themes that are of interest to young people today. When implemented continuously, multiple exhibitions can be made with the newly made artworks and be presented in neighbourhoods like the Bijlmer or Nieuw-West, making them easy to access for everyone. This way the youngsters can tell their own story through art, something that Van Gogh did too. After testing the concept it became clear that the participants felt more connected with Vincent van Gogh, the letters provided personal insights for them and the creation of an artwork felt like an exciting adventure, showing the potential impact of the ‘Van Gogh, The other story’ concept on the tree cultural dimensions, representation, participation and access.","Inclusion; Social Design; Museum Futures; Museum Experience; User Centered Design; Framework design; Van Gogh Museum; Meaningful design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The main purpose of this luminaire is to positively influence the state of mind of bystanders and improve the residential quality of the city centre. It does this by creating distinct atmospheres with adaptive light features, based on the use of public space. To determine all the preconditions of such a design, an extensive analysis was carried out on all facets that are related to light. This covers both the physics concerning light and the (psychological) perception of that light. After an analysis of the current role of light in the public space, the interests of all stakeholders have been framed. Based on this, a design vision has been drawn up; ‘‘DEVELOP A PROGRAMMABLE LUMINAIRE WHICH HAS THE MAIN FUNCTION OF POSITIVELY INFLUENCING THE STATE OF MIND OF BYSTANDERS BY USING ITS ADAPTIVE LIGHT PROPERTIES TO CREATE DESIRED ATMOSPHERES’,’ Within this vision, after several brainstorms, four concepts have been developed. The concept with the most viability has been used as the basis. The “iterative design” method has been applied within the thesis, with multiple models/prototypes being made; at first simple models (spuugmodellen), later more detailed scale models. Hereby, making prototypes has always been seen as a means, not as a goal. Physical models have been used to explore design areas and to validate design choices. Because designing with light context is very important, a case study has been developed within this thesis; the centre of Tilburg. By dividing the city centre of Tilburg into three areas “residential area, shopping area and catering area”, light scripts have been developed that respond to the (subconscious) needs of residents and visitors of city districts with their unique specific functions. These light scripts are based on the adaptive (programmable) light properties of the developed luminaire. A hierarchical system has been developed for this that can determine light properties based on several external factors. These light properties are converted to a numerical system, which is used as input for programming the luminaire. The impact of the different light properties on the atmospheric perception of the light was determined in a test setup, for which a scale model of the final design was used. In this study, the prototype also functions as a proof of concept. Based on the results of the research, a conceptual model has been drawn up, in which the light properties of the luminaire can be determined on the basis of the desired atmosphere. The thesis concludes with a feedback on the established preconditions, whereby a proposal is made for future research.","Atmospheric; Lighting; Public space; Luminaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and the second most common in women after breast cancer. Literature shows how it is difficult to find a proper diagnostic and treatment technique for this problem, especially in an early-stage phase. CT-guided needle aspiration, surgical resection, and bronchoscopy are used for lung cancer treatment, all show encouraging results for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer but also limitations and complications. In the past decade, innovations were introduced for bronchoscopy in order to approach, diagnose, and treat the pulmonary lesions in the peripheral areas of the bronchi. Among these, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy shows impressive accuracy results in the diagnosis and treatment of these peripheral lesions, but many complications and challenges are present. These complications are mainly associated with the long learning curve for trainers and the slow process of implementing new innovative instruments that could improve the technique. These challenges could be linked with the unavailability of a proper medical real-life model that could mimic both the complex geometrical structure and the physical characteristics of the bronchial tree and lung tissue and could be used as a testing and training environment. For this reason, the main objective of this research is to create a lung model that mimics both the geometrical and mechanical properties of the lung and bronchial tree. The medical phantom was created using additive manufacturing (3D printing) as production technique and polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel as production material. The research approach for this project involved the definition and validation of two main design criteria: mechanical and geometrical. The mechanical criterion was evaluated by preparing and testing different configurations of PVA hydrogels, created via freeze-thawing cycles process, and then compared the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, in particular, the elastic Young Modulus, with data from literature reporting lung tissue elasticity. The geometrical criterion was evaluated by creating a 3D model from CT scans and inspect this model with a bronchoscope and endoscope to identify similarity with real lung anatomy. The analysis of results produced with the experiments confirms the behavior of PVA hydrogel as a biomaterial that could mimic the mechanical properties of organic tissues. In particular, the results confirm the correlation of the mechanical properties of the hydrogel with the number of freeze-thaw cycles and the molecular weight of PVA powder in the solution, as already stated in the literature. In addition to that, a specific hydrogel configuration, with 10wt% of PVA and after four freeze-thaw cycles, was identified as a valuable mimicking material for lung tissue, where the values of the elastic module of the hydrogel match the bronchial tree and lung tissue on different strain levels. Furthermore, the inspection with the bronchoscope shows a similarity between the geometry of the model and the anatomy of the lungs, although just a qualitative analysis was done for validation of the geometrical criterion. Overall, the research goal of this project was satisfied, and the final prototype tested with successfull results. However, this is the first 3D printed lung model created with biomaterials, and different limitations are present.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

To facilitate data analysis, it was implemented in an application that allows for EIT parameter calculation of selected sequences. EIT recordings of three patients recruited in an observational study were used to develop the algorithm. A reference standard was defined as the majority vote of five biomechanical engineering students performing manual classification. Frequency and time domain properties were compared between the signals that these graders classified as reliable and unreliable, and were used to define classification rules for the algorithm. Matlab was used to create the classification algorithm and implement it in an application. The developed algorithm was validated with a new data set containing EIT recordings of an additional three patients, classified by the same volunteers. Qualitative analysis was performed to investigate the causes of conflict between manual and automated data selection.<br/>The resulting algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 92.8% (95% CI, 92.6%-92.9%) and a specificity of 85.5% (95% CI, 85.1%-85.8%) on the EIT files used for development. On the validation set the algorithm accomplished a sensitivity of 86.5% (95% CI, 86.3%-86.7%), and specificity of 79.7% (95% CI, 79.4%-80.0%).<br/>Most differences between manual and automatic data selection were found to be around the edges of the selected sequences. Other discrepancies can be explained by difference in data selection behaviour for varying recording qualities during manual selection. The presented algorithm proves its potential for quick and reliable data classification of EIT recordings. It not only provides a new standard for data selection in EIT research, but also reduces the time investment of researchers. The freely available data analysis application enables easy implementation of the algorithm. The presented study therefore provides a first step towards a uniform approach in EIT research, improving comparability of studies and increasing the scientific value of their findings.","electrical impedance tomography; Neonatology; data classification; Algorithm Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Chu, Q. P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Higher levels of autonomy in aerospace systems is an urgent requirement, considering the increase in control task difficulties, and the need for adaptability of the complex systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) control is one of the promising approaches for adaptive control of air vehicles that are designed for automation. Conventional discrete reinforcement learning methods fail in providing satisfactory performance for flight control systems (FCSs), especially for a complex configuration of a tailless over-actuated aircraft. The lack of efficiency of the discrete controller in exploration for finding the optimal policy, the so-called problem of 'curse of dimensionality', results in an approach that is not suitable for online implementation. Also, the achieved discrete non-smooth control policy usually does not apply to the real world control surfaces. This paper studies the experiments with Heuristic Dynamic Programming (HDP), a method obtained from adaptive critic design (ACDs), as a continuous reinforcement learning approach. ACD methods can capture the nonlinearities in the complex dynamics of the aircraft while solving the control problem computationally efficient by using continuous states and action spaces. Such qualities make ACDs suitable for online FCS design for unstable systems like tailless aircraft. In this paper, the ACD-based controller is developed and implemented for the Innovative Control Effector (ICE) aircraft, a highly maneuverable aircraft with redundancy in its control effectors suite. The coupled control effectors configuration has strong interactions and, therefore, proposes a need for proper control allocation. The online simulation results show the accuracy of the designed continuous RL controller in the longitudinal control of the aircraft using different sets of control effectors. The proposed approach also shows significant improvements in the tracking performance and control policy smoothness (e.g., compared to discrete methods).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The Prodrive-Select Rectifier shows excellent mains current total harmonic distortion, especially when interleaving of the converter branches is considered, and achieves competitive efficiencies by utilization of three-level buck circuits and a capacitive midpoint which allows for complete zero-voltage switching of the high-frequency power MOSFETs. In this work, two modulation schemes are proposed and analysed with regard to their zero-voltage switching capabilities. In addition, the complete converter analysis including steady-state analysis, transient closed-loop control and component-level volume and loss modelling is thoroughly described. In order to obtain an objective performance indication, the topology is compared to a state-of-the-art buck-type rectifier, namely the Swiss Rectifier. The proposed modelling techniques are implemented by means of a virtual prototyping routine yielding a Pareto-front in the power density versus efficiency performance space from which an optimal design is selected using multi-objective optimization. This Pareto-optimal design operates under partial soft-switching conditions and achieves a conversion efficiency of 98.3% at 2.9kW/dm3 power density. The modelling and optimization techniques are verified by an 11-kW, 1.3-kW/dm3 hardware demonstrator for conversion of a 400-V rms line-to-line AC input into a 400-V nominal DC output. Measurements show efficiencies higher than 97.5% in the range of 4kW- 11kW, with 97.7% peak efficiency and &lt;4% total harmonic distortion at full power.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-18","","","","","",""

The TC system has been subject to multiple experiments spanning over decades due to the instability phenomena that occur in the flow. When the rotation rates of the cylinders are increased beyond a critical value, instabilities appear in the system that result in the formation of different flow regimes. Single-phase flow in the TC system has been studied extensively and the various flow transitions have been catalogued for different geometrical parameters and rotational conditions. In the current experiments (Radius ratio= 0.917, Aspect ratio= 22), flow visualisation with anisotropic reflective particles has been used to obtain qualitative and quantitative information about the different flow regimes using Space-Time (S-T) plots and their spectral analyses. An aqueous glycerine solution was used as the working fluid for single-phase flows. The critical Reynolds number (calculated based on inner cylinder shear rate) for the transition from laminar Couette flow was found to be slightly higher for the current setup in comparison to other experiments found in literature, but the order of flow transitions and their spectral characterisation for all the flow regimes showed good agreement, serving as a validation for the setup. With the established single-phase flow as a base, the effect of particle loading on the flow transitions was studied. A neutrally buoyant particle-laden suspension was prepared using an aqueous glycerine solution with Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles of 619-micrometer diameter. The volume fraction of the particles was varied from 0.05 till 0.40 and the flow map was constructed for multi-phase flow. The primary effect of particle addition is an earlier onset of the first transition from laminar Couette flow, thus indicating a destabilisation of the flow by particles. In addition to this, several non-axisymmetric flow structures appeared in the suspension experiments which were absent in the single-phase flow experiments. The particles caused the appearance of flow regimes such as spirals (Taylor vortices that move up the cylinder axis in a helical motion) and ribbons (block-like structures that have alternating light and dark squares), which normally occur in the case of counter-rotating cylinders for single-phase flow. The transitions across all volume fractions were characterised based on the S-T plots and/or spectra to obtain a consolidated flow map for particle-laden suspensions. The results presented point towards intriguing flow behaviour that provides a large parameter space for further research in the years to come.","Taylor-Couette; Multiphase Flow; Fluid dynamics; Particle-laden flow; Flow visualization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To tackle this problem in a practical and holistic way, innovative wastewater treatment solutions are needed. This is the goal of LOTUSHR project - to research and build a holistic and resource-oriented wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) to treat the Barapullah drain water in New Delhi, India. To achieve this goal, Dissolved air flotation (DAF), due to its ability to withstand fluctuating flows and low area requirements was identified as a possible technology in the LOTUS wwtp scheme. This research is focused on identifying and investigating critical operating parameters of a bench-scale DAF column set up with various influents for a comparative and deeper understanding. To achieve this, different influent at the site - Barapullah drain water and anaerobic sludge from a Delhi wwtp, and their counterparts in the laboratory - canal water and anaerobic sludge from a Delft wwtp were tested with the DAF. As there were potentially many critical factors that could have an impact on the DAF performance, experiments were conducted based on the Plackett-Burman experimental design. Furthermore, to understand the effect of particle characteristics and morphology on the DAF performance, microscopic images of the influent and clean effluent samples were analyzed using ImageJ-Fiji. Finally, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis was done to gain insight into the characteristics and behavior of the particle-bubble agglomerate and its relation to the DAF performance. Additionally, pathogen (E-coli and C.Perfringens) removal potential of the DAF was studied with Barapullah drain water. The results obtained suggest that for canal water the critical parameters are Time of Coagulation prior to the DAF, Retention Time and Influent TSS Concentration. Whereas, for drain water, it was only the Influent TSS Concentration. For anaerobic sludge from the wwtp in Delft themost significant parameter was found to be Pressure and a similar trend with higher removal was observed for anaerobic sludge from Delhi. Image analysis with canal water, drain water and sludge samples showed that for higher TSS removal runs, a general trend of average influent particle sizes of 12 um,3-5 um and 80-100 um respectively was observed. And, clean effluent particle sizes were found to be 2-3 um for drain water and canal water. Furthermore, for drain water runs with high removal, the particle-bubble agglomerate rise velocities were found similar to the theoretically calculated values of 1.69E-03 m/s. Bubble to particle ratio for high TSS removal runs was calculated to be 34 bubbles/particle for drain water and 50 times more for sludge. In terms of pathogen removal, E-coli removal for drain was found as high as 1.65 log for higher influent TSS runs. No significant correlation was found between the TSS removal and E-coli removal by the DAF. It is recommended that for future research further optimization (with experimental designs such as CCDR) of the significant parameters identified should be done. More extensive research in addition to results found in this study is suggested to be done on the effect of different coagulants<br/>and coagulation conditions on the DAF performance. To further understand the differences observed in the significant parameters of the influents, research on the influent properties such as hydrophobicity and density is recommended. More experiments with adequate site equipment are suggested to be done to understand the removal of Giardia and Cryptosporidium to further understand their relation to the TSS removal by the DAF.","dissolved air flotation; Particle size distribution; Image analysis; Plackett Burman; E coli","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Šavija, B. (graduation committee); Schlangen, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The performance of concrete is usually governed by its ""strength"" and ""stiffness"" properties. As most of the concrete structures are usually designed to last in service for a period of about half a century, it is important to understand the development of these ""strength"" and ""stiffness"" properties over the course of time. Based on the standard codes and practices, these properties are assumed to continuously increase with age assuming standard conditions (moist curing environment and temperature of 20° C), or at least remain constant in case of other curing conditions. However, few studies [27] [13] have reported a reduction in the trend of the strength and stiffness properties with time for the ordinary concrete of different strength mixes, when exposed to drying at different relative humidities after an initial moist curing period. Moreover, such decrease in trend has also been reported for a Geopolymer concrete upon drying at controlled lab conditions (20° C and 50%RH) after an initial moist curing period of 28 days [35]. It is not clear if the reduction in the trend observed is only temporary as a result of the imposed shrinkage deformations and eigen stresses, or if it is a permanent reduction as a result of microcracking. In this regard, it is aimed to understand the uncertainty in the development of the strength and stiffness properties of particularly the ordinary concrete mixes, which have been used across the world for a long time. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that a similar reduction upon drying in the trend of mechanical properties as reported by Prinsse [35] for a Geopolymer might also occur for the ordinary concrete mixes of various grades, which are cured and tested in the same way as the aforementioned Geopolymer concrete. Based on that, parameters such as the curing conditions, specimen size and the grade of concrete mix are assumed to influence the trend and a comprehensive literature study is performed in order to understand the influence of these assumed parameters on the mechanical properties - namely the compressive strength, splitting strength and elastic modulus over time. From the literature study, it is understood that there is some uncertainity in understanding the trend which is aggravated by the complex inter-dependency between the assumed parameters. Accordingly, an experimental program is set up to firstly verify whether there is a similar reduction in trend like the Geopolymer concrete and secondly to give more clarity on the complex inter-dependency between the assumed parameters. Further, the development of eigen stresses is understood to play a huge role in the trend of the measured mechanical properties over time and their influence might vary for the different tests. However, due to its temporary occurrence and larger testing frequency days, they are difficult to capture in the experiments. Accordingly, a FEM tool known as ""FEMMASSE"" is used, which can simulate the concrete behaviour by incorporating the heat and moisture models. Apart from considering the material effects like hydration, FEMMASSE can also capture the eigen stresses developed as a result of the thermal and moisture gradients. The software mostly finds application in the design of bridges and tunnels. Although, in this research study, the main purpose of using FEMMASSE is to firstly capture the shrinkage induced eigen stresses by simulating the tests at smaller intervals and secondly single out the influence of the studied parameters in order to give more clarity on the obtained experimental results. The obtained experimental results indicate no major reduction in the trend of the studied mechanical properties in time as compared to the Geopolymer concrete. With regard to the studied parameters, it is found that for the chosen curing regime (28DM regime), the trend of both compressive and splitting strength is seen to be affected by the development of the eigen stresses. Interestingly, for the trend of splitting strength, a general pattern of increasing and stabilizing behaviour is observed which seems to be dependent also on the specimen size. However, due to the lack of knowledge of the actual magnitude of the eigen stresses coupled with other phenomena like the size effect and current state of hydration, it becomes challenging to explain the trend merely on the basis of experimental results. In this regard, the use of numerical tool FEMMASSE is shown to help understand the experimental results at greater depth. Owing to the limitations of the software, only the tensile tests are simulated. Initially, it is understood that the attainment of the hygral equilibrium is dependent on the specimen size and the type of concrete,with the smaller specimen sizes and lower strength mixes reaching the equlibrium relatively quickly. The model is then extended to simulate the tensile tests - splitting and flexural and direct tension tests. It is concluded that drying after a moist curing period of 28 days affects the these tensile tests differently. In case of the splitting tests, drying results in the temporary increase of the strength owing to the apparent prestressing at the core of the specimen, with the gradual stabilization of the trend as the specimen attains moisture equilibrium. This trend of temporary increase and gradual stabilization is dependent on the specimen size with the smaller specimens stabilizing at a relatively quicker time due to the faster attainment of the moisture equilibrium. However, in case of the flexural and direct tensile test, drying results in the temporary reduction in the flexural strength due to the reduction in the tensile capacity at the surface, followed by an increasing trend as the specimen starts attaining hygral equilibrium. This indicates that the surface failure tests like the direct tension and flexural are negatively affected (temporarily) by drying as compared to the interior failure tests like splitting test which is positively affected (temporarily) by drying. From the research study, it is evident that there are no major reduction in the trend of strength and stiffness properties over time obtained experimentally until the period of 155 days. However, the presence of the eigen stresses, which not captured in the experiments, does influence the trend of the measured material properties over time. As long as these eigen stresses are present, the material strength determined experimentally might be deceptive, as evident from the simulations of the tensile tests performed in the study. It is understood that unless there is hygral equilibrium (no eigen stresses) across the specimen, the measured material properties might underestimate the actual material strength in case of the flexural and direct tension tests and overestimate in case of the splitting tensile tests. In the engineering practice, especially in mass concrete structures, the eigen stresses could be present throughout the service life of the structure. Thus, the experimentally obtained material strength used for designing the structure might be deceptive due to the influence of the eigen stresses.","concrete; FEMMASSE; strength; stiffness; time; eigen stresses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

However, there is a group of people, and their cost of mistakes might be higher than the average. They are therefore protected by others, and their opportunity to explore the world is deprived. This protective behavior could be unnecessary or excessive, which is defined as overprotection. To detect the overprotection issue in the field of pediatric cardiology, the researcher, together with Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, set up a collaborative program. The ultimate goal of the program was to design a smart product-service system which can prevent overprotective behavior in children with congenital heart disease. The present thesis is the initial step of the collaborative program— investigation of overprotection in pediatric cardiology. It addresses the concept of overprotection (OP) and vulnerable child syndrome (VCS), studies on the health-related life of children with congenital heart disease (CCHD), and their parents (PCCHD), then proposes a reformulated design goal and three tangible design missions as the final result. In the literature review, theoretical knowledge of overprotection and vulnerable child syndrome is elaborated. Three factors are especially highlighted, respectively risk factor, challenge, and indicator. The risk factor indicates the event that may trigger overprotection development; challenge means the parental barrier of performing proper protection; indicator expresses the theoretical assessment of overprotection. These factors are further brought to the empirical study to see how they influence life of CCHD and PCCHD. Empirical insights are captured during the empirical study. A total number of eight interviews were conducted, and the researcher also attended a sharing event in which five CCHD gave speeches on their grown-up experience. Collecting the medical history, interaction with people around, and narratives or opinions about overprotection was the main purpose of the empirical study. Factors derived from the literature were continuously reflected and compared with the empirical data. Theoretical knowledge and empirical insights were further integrated and synthesized. Based on the empirical narratives, the applicability of the theoretical overprotection indicators in pediatric cardiology is evaluated. Two indicators are found to have the highest significance and thus are suggested as the prioritized behavior that needs to be prevented. In addition, extreme quotes and narratives are selected and formulated in a positive case and a negative case. The positive case indicates good patient-parent relation without overprotection reported, while the negative case means tension in patient-parent relation with overprotection reported. Each case contains a patient persona, a parent persona, a health journey map, and an interactive map. Besides discerning the existing factors, four beneficial triggers are generated and highlighted as the main determinants which contribute to the difference between the positive case and the negative case. The insights provide a hint for potential design directions— prevent risk factors, support users to overcome the challenges, and guide users toward the beneficial trigger. Based on the design directions, a reformulated design goal and three corresponding design briefs were proposed as the final result of the thesis. The design goal was framed as “Design a product-service system which facilitates rational discussions within children with congenital heart disease, their parents and medical experts, in order to achieve a consensus upon diagnosis-specific and personalized boundaries between proper-protection and overprotection.” The three design briefs are further written as three dependent design assignments that provide guidelines and suggestions to the following designers.","Healthcare; cardiology; parenting behavior; overprotection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is an orthotropic material model for low bond strength masonry that uses a smeared cracking approach. It was developed as an improvement of the Engineering Masonry Model (EMM) and adopts that model’s constitutive relations for the behaviour normal to the bed joints and for the compressive behaviour normal to the head joints. However, the shear failure criterion and the tensile head joint failure options are replaced by a new failure criterion for diagonal staircase cracks that is based on the observation that these cracks often open up horizontally. This failure criterion, the equivalent shear failure criterion, is derived from horizontal force equilibrium and evaluates both the shear stress and the tensile stress normal to the head joints. The combined constitutive relation is based on the Coulomb friction shear behaviour of the bed joints, that consists of linear loading, linear softening and a residual stress plateau. The softening is dictated by both the total shear strain and the total horizontal strain. This thesis first describes the development of this theory and its implementation into a user supplied subroutine for Diana FEA. This code was then verified for a single integration point and compared to the EMM’s Diagonal stair-case cracks option for a selection of load paths, among which combinations of shear and horizontal extension. This verification showed that the ESMM is more stable and provides more probable stress-strain diagrams. Subsequently, the model was validated against a micromodelled masonry unit cell for the same selection of load paths. This validation showed that the ESMM’s stress-strain diagrams are realistic, save some details that could be improved. Finally, the model was validated at a structural level with a macromodelled prediction of shear wall experiments. This validation showed that the ESMM is able to model post-peak behaviour, with both softening and a residual force plateau. The model featured inelastic deformation, hysteresis and even peak force reduction. Compared to the EMM’s Diagonal stair-case cracks option, it had less convergence issues and more realistic crack localisation. Some adjustments to details of the theory and the code are suggested. Also, further validations are required, for more load cases and other applications. Altogether, the Equivalent Shear Masonry Model shows promising characteristics and it is recommended that it is further improved and developed into a convenient, practical material model for low bond strength masonry.","Masonry; Material Model; Diagonal Cracking; Shear; Horizontal Tension; Equivalent Shear; Staircase Crack; Diana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Despite this advantage, herewith there exists the substantial risk of discrimination. Moreover, machine learning models with the highest prediction-accuracy are often the least explicable (i.e. explainable). Nonetheless, explicability is needed to create accountability of automated credit decisions by machine learning systems. Furthermore, there exists a regulatory need for explicability of machine learning systems in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Consumer Credit Directive (CCD). Besides that, an ethical- and societal need exists for explicability. Within the exploration of literature, it becomes clear that research lacks on how to move from a high-level principle like explicability, towards a prospective assessment of a machine learning use case on this principle, it lacks a multi-disciplinary perspective, and it misses an assessment framework that can guide decision-makers within machine learning use cases, aligned with a multi-organizational development lifecycle. This research aims to design a prospective pragmatic assessment framework that can guide decision-makers, within machine learning applications in European credit underwriting cases from the point of view of explicability. To accomplish this, the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), complemented with the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach, is utilized. To this end, the Explicability Assessment Framework (EAF) was developed. This framework is adapted to the context- and explanation characteristics of the case, and aligns with the CRISP-DM development lifecycle. It was found in two case studies that the framework helps with the decision-making whether a machine learning system is sufficiently explicable or not. Lastly, a wide range of future research areas is identified that needs attention: empirical validation and expansion of the framework, the relevance for automated explanation creation, the scalability to other context and a large amount of explanations, and the practical perspective regarding adoption in the industry.","Explicability; Assessment; Machine Learning; Ethics; Credit underwriting; Framework design; Value sensitive design; Design Science Research Methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

But there is a serious challenge with the increasing popularity of traditional ANNs is of energy consumption and computational complexity. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to be next-generation neural networks that are capable of doing complex deep learning applications at fraction of energy that is needed in current deep learning applications because of its similarity to biological neurons. However, SNN is still not able to match the classification accuracy of ANNs which poses a big challenge for wide acceptance of SNN in various applications as traditional learning methods like backpropagation are not possible in SNN. During training of a neural network the weight matrix is of the highest importance as it eventually decides the trajectory of learning. Currently, one existing solution is to just manually convert ANNs into SNNs to get weight matrix which doesn't focus on getting weight matrix from a small dataset and doesn't consider spiking neuron parameters. We propose a novel N-shot training methodology that is capable of providing a weight matrix for SNN and can give sufficient classification accuracy. The methodology not only provides the weight matrix but can perform training with a very small dataset(up to 1 image per class) and still obtain considerably higher accuracy. For a reduced MNIST dataset, the method can give an accuracy of 71.68% 10 images per class.","N-shot Learning; Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs)); Learning Methodology; Neuromorphic Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-24","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Hunyadi, B. (graduation committee); Goos, T.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In the Netherlands the preterm birth rate is around 7%. The problematic part is that these preterm infants make up for 72% of all deaths during or shortly after birth. To provide a way to aid these infants the following question was stated by the doctor: ""turn on a light in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit when the preterm infant’s development is not as expected"". This question was interpreted as following: first of all, find an informative signal present for preterm infants which can provide knowledge on the state of development. Secondly, find a way to quantify this signal through measurement and provide a way to automate the detection. Based on literature the delta brush was selected as a promising waveform in the neonatal EEG, which can be used to follow the maturation of the brain. The spectral behavior of the EEG is used to identify the specific waveforms, but this analysis of the EEG is still mainly based on visual analysis, which is a subjective and time-consuming task. A way to quantify and automate this process was found in the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Using the Morlet mother wavelet, a time-frequency distribution of the EEG was calculated. The CWT’s redundant behavior was found to provide a finer sampling which could be used to reinforce specific waveform behavior. A third goal was to investigate the troubles that new innovations face in being accepted by the medical field. This was found to be related to the building of trust. The key elements for building trust in this work were identified as: interpretability of the results, transparency of the process, and ease of operation. These elements will be taken into account in the proposed solution. A set of high-density EEG measurements of preterm infants was acquired through collaboration with the the Academic Hospital Antwerp and the Erasmus Medical Center. This high-density consists of 19 electrode channels instead of the more commonly used 11 electrode channels. The measurement was done at 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). These measurements were accompanied with annotation for the waveform of interest. An interactive application for visualization of the EEG data and wavelet coefficients was designed in MATLAB. This application can run standalone and can be used to visualize the detector’s results for the end user. Based on the inherent characteristics of the target waveform two detection features were chosen. The first feature is a measure of the ratio between peak in the high-frequency region (3.3-40 Hz) and the low-frequency region (0.1-3.3 Hz). The second feature is an energy calculation based on a windowed Squared Energy Operator (SEO). A triple-threshold multi-channel detector, based on these features, was initialized and performance was tested over the full threshold range. A Precision-Recall (PRC) curve was provided showing the total solution space for both feature thresholds. Based on the point closest to (100,100) in the training set PRC, a single threshold was selected for validation with the validation datasets. This has resulted in a detector with a sensitivity of 73.66% and a precision of 21.71%. This performance is expected to increase with cross-validation, due to lower quality EEG datasets in the validation set. The differences in performance can be explained by the uncertainties in the exact delta brush behavior and the incomplete annotation set, which causes possible detected delta brush activity to be labeled as false positives. In the end an informative waveform was found and a suitable quantification method has been proposed. A delta brush detector has been designed based on the inherent characteristics of the waveform. A standalone interactive application has been developed to visualize the EEG signal in combination with its time-frequency behavior. The application can also be used in combination with the detector to provide insight into the decision-making process and to visualize the detector’s output.","EEG; Delta Brush; continuous wavelet transform; Morlet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

More notably, in the case of an over-constrained dynamic vehicle routing problem as there is no solution which can satisfy all the constraints in real-time with a limited number of vehicles. This also resembles a real-life situation. However, as humans are good at problem-solving, there is a proposal to introduce a human to improve the performance by presenting an interface. Thus, the automation will be used to acquire and analyse the necessary information and display it in the interface, the human can then use this information to decide a preferable action and then implement it during mission operation. An interface design from previous research, with additional features, was used for a payload delivery mission to control Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The human performance and the interface effectiveness is evaluated in an over-constrained dynamic vehicle routing problem for different mission objectives. Results show that the interface supported the humans, and additionally, the participants came up with a solution to satisfy the individual goal for a particular mission objective by relaxing specific constraints. It could be established that humans can come up with a solution for the over-constrained problem in a limited time required, thus it is an acceptable alternative which can be used to be able to come up with solutions.

The removal of these compounds by anaerobic biodegradation was assessed with a mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The bitumen condensate contained over 800 compounds, out of which some were p-cresol, o-cresol and 2-napthalenemethanol. The inhibition to the methanogenic activity and toxicity to the biomass of this wastewater on three different inocula were studied under batch-test conditions. A phenol-degrading sludge was less inhibited (IC<sub>50</sub>= 870 mg COD<sub>bitumen</sub>/L) and more resistant to the toxicity than granular sludge from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant (IC<sub>50</sub>= 187 mg COD<sub>bitumen</sub>/L) and a municipal sludge (sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, IC<sub>50</sub>= 127 mg COD<sub>bitumen</sub>/L). In continuous operation, the bitumen condensate was degraded efficiently with 89%±12% (S.D)COD removal from the influent of the AnMBR. Maximum organic conversion rate of the bitumen condensate was 26.0 mg COD/g VSS.d. This research demonstrated the efficiency of AnMBR technology to degrade bitumen condensate.

Within this process, the preliminary design phase is a highly iterative process, which requires many calculations. From these calculations many different initial designs of the structure are derived. Generally, these possible configurations are compared to the design requirements. An important requirement is the safety of the structure over its lifetime. This can be reasonably accounted for by applying different reliability methods. Within these methods, different elements of uncertainty are considered. In the preliminary and final design stage, depending on the engineer, the quantification of these uncertainties and the safety of a structure during its service lifetime are often based on expert judgement, partial safety factors or are not considered at all. It is generally perceived that a full probabilistic approach gives more insights into the reliability and safety of the design. Due to the complex nature of this process and the mathematical workload, computer automated designs are becoming more popular. One possible automation method is the parametric design method, which translates different mathematical relations into parameters which can be easily altered. This research aims to develop a model which parametrically determines multiple solutions for a probabilistic design approach of a rubble mound slope protection, which takes into account uncertainty.

The market is poised for growth but in the Netherlands there are many roadblocks and these need further exploration. The study concluded that these vehicles are bound to stay and grow and implementation depends on regulatory climate, enforcement of safety standards, technology standards and infrastructure. Technology trends also project better vehicles in the future. Innovation in types of implementation of shared micro-mobility is still a big question.

First, preliminary research including literature review and field study was conducted to gain the basic knowledge of a passenger's boarding experience (What is to be found in theory and real-life?). Following from this, research questions are: What is a passenger's interaction during boarding? How does a passenger fell during boarding interactions? Why does he/she feel this way? How do the interactions happen? Due to the project is in cooperation with Safran Cabin, which is under developing a luggage reservation system called the ""BINSIGHT"", consisting out of an overhead bin with sensing technology and an user application for reserving luggage space. Therefore, the fourth research question is added: Can the ""BINSIGHT"" system take away passenger uncertainties to improve the boarding experience? To find answers, the ""BINSIGHT"" system and the aircraft cabin context were examined. By applying the contextmapping approach, an empirical research took place in a simulated boarding context. 12 participants were recruited and provided rich insights during the user test. Afterward, data is collected and analyzed. From the cultural analysis and user interview, it is concluded that the uncertainties to the cabin environment cause an inefficient boarding experience. For example, a queue is created due to every passenger wants to be the first entering in the aircraft cabin (the value of achievement). Furthermore, passengers also care their own safety and privacy during boarding (the value of security). Therefore, inter-personal distance has become a critical issue. By applying Proxemics theory (Hall, 1966), aircraft boarding can be seen as a territorial behavior. Keeping a proper distance between passengers/luggage serves as a starting point for the design process. Other findings from the user test are listed as follows: (1) Hand luggage as part of passengers' body, (2) Passenger-unfriendly Interactions, (3) Multitasking, and (4) The trade-off between passenger experience and boarding efficiency. By integrating all the findings, 6 ""micro delays"" which cause inefficient boarding and negative experience were defined: (1) Checking boarding pass on the aisle, (2) Finding seat signage, (3) Searching luggage space, (4) Repacking luggage on the aisle, (5) Closing overhead bin while others are still boarding, and (6) Inappropriate luggage stowing behaviors. Based on outcomes from the user tests, the Socio-cultural dimensions (van Boeijen, 2015) was applied to indicate current value orientations. 3 dimensions were targeted and listed as follows: (1) Identification: Identification stands for the balance between individual freedom and connectivity with a group. (2) Aim: Aim values the purpose between caring each other and achieving success. (3) Space: Space copes personal privacy in a public space. After the definition and analysis of current problems, 4 concepts were created through creative sessions based on the design goal, “Take away boarding uncertainties by showing air passengers a worried-free path from entering the aircraft to their seat in the economy class cabin.” Then, all concepts were evaluated through rapid prototyping and role-playing sessions, and they were integrated into the final concept ""ready to fly"" by applying persuasive game design (Visch, Vegt, Anderiesen, &amp; van der Kooij, 2013 ). Through gamification, a game world is created to provide a feeling of enjoyment and engagement, also to reduce the real-world consequences. Furthermore, by using the game elements such as avatars, points, rewards, storylines, and etc., a user’s behavior and attitude in the real world can be formed, altered and reinforced, which can be applied for achieving the design goal and promoting better boarding behavior. Overall, the prototype ""ready to fly"" is about a retrospective mobile game experience of helping a caterpillar find a space for making a cocoon in a virtual aircraft cabin. This experience gives air passengers a rehearsal of their boarding experience while waiting at the departure gate. A personalized avatar for each passenger and airport related scenes can allow passengers to adapt to the unknown environment, which can provide guidance to reach their seats. By beating the level through cooperation, can put down the barriers between strangers. Finally, real-world rewards can motivate the passengers and alter the behavior (adjusting luggage position) for creating more space in the cabin, and moving the interactive screen from the bottom of the overhead bin to the top provides more space for window passengers to locate their seats. Overall, the passengers get better experience by cooperating together and winning the rewards, and the boarding efficiency can be improving by a better boarding flow and more luggage capacity. For the redesign user test, an interactive prototype of ""ready to fly"" was built and tested by 6 participants. The test shows that the ""ready to fly"" concept provides better boarding experience and efficiency. Participants can easily find their seats and luggage space without spending extra time on the aisle. It is also worth mentioning the reward system, by correcting passengers' stowing behaviors, more capacity is created. However, combining numerous elements in a short interaction might overwhelm the users which creates more confusion while boarding. Therefore, it is suggested that to take the passengers step by step. Making small changes for a bigger impact. Lastly, it can be concluded that correcting passengers boarding behaviors by seducing with rewards can increase passenger experience. In the meantime, the boarding efficiency can be improved due to good boarding behaviors lead to less conflicts and delays in the cabin. Therefore, seducing with rewards for better passenger behavior is a promising solution for both passenger experience and boarding efficiency. Finally, a model of reward system for better boarding experience is made and a modified concept is proposed for future research. I believe this research opens a door for a better and efficient aircraft boarding through gamification. Upon further development, more research is required in order to improve the acceptability for the public and also to test with larger amount of passengers. It is also suggested that designing a gameful or playful interaction instead of a mobile game experience to enhance the acceptability and the flexibility of usage.","Passenger experience; Gamification; Persuasive Game Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Next, multiple aspects of the ideal scenario are ideated upon, such as the Priva Portal which supplies restaurants with their growing supplies, and working out specific details regarding the physical design and technical aspects. Following ideation, three concepts are proposed, with one being chosen through objective criteria. In the first iteration, the concept now known as Microfarm is further worked out and a business model and prototype are developed and validated. In the second iteration, a customer journey is set up for generating new ideas in enhancing the guest’s indoor farming experience, resulting in Nanofarm, and Microfarm’s design is changed to be smaller and compacter as a result of the first iteration. The last phase of the report describes the final designs of Microfarm and Nanofarm as well as Priva Portal and the business model. Recommendations are given and the project is evaluated. The project is concluded by stating that a small indoor farm is feasible and that high end restaurants are a fitting context for such a product, but there is a considerable chance that such a product will ultimately not work regarding the small impact such a product will have compared to the amount of resources a restaurant will have to invest.","Indoor farming; Context mapping; Conceptual design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As a result, there is an increase in traffic density and decrease in free navigational space, potentially causing a higher incidence of dangerous navigation situations that may lead to ship collisions. This thesis establishes a hypothesis that there are coastal areas where the risk of collision is unexplored and abnormally high and has not been analysed yet. Therefore, the thesis aims to develop a method suitable to assess the risk of collision in coastal waters. A thesis literature review primarily focuses on the current collision risk assessment methods, circumstances of collisions, and sources of navigational information for coastal waters. The literature review concludes that a promising and novel approach is to detect near-collision situations based on the data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The near-collision exists when a ship's safety domain is violated and, simultaneously, the ship performed a last-moment evasive manoeuvre, which is identified by an abnormal ship's rate of turn. Building on a previous basic version of the near-collision detection method and AIS data provided by Safetec Nordic AS, this thesis develops a collision risk assessing tool that significantly outperforms the original method. The performance of the designed method was evaluated using AIS data from the Vestfjorden area in Norwegian coast during 2013-2015. The case study shows that this approach effectively detects near-collision situations but identifies a considerable number of new false near-collisions. The details and spatial distribution of detected near-collisions provide valuable insight into navigational areas vulnerable to collisions, collision circumstances, and frequency of collisions.","risk assessment; Collision detection; Automatic Identification System; coastal areas; near-collision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beginning from the societal nature of human civilisations and medieval kingdoms to its modern uses in trade and politics, collaboration has shaped the world in its many forms by creating significant impacts in the society. The field of education and innovation are also impacted by the merits of collaboration in developing new knowledge and implementing a wide array of innovative solutions to the benefit of society. In recent years, collaborative activities between universities and industries are regarded as a source of knowledge production and technological advancements by fostering the economic and innovative competitiveness of the involved stakeholders. Industries can benefit from the outcomes generated by scientific research at the universities. These outcomes include the fundamental understanding of a particular phenomenon, in the form of theories or principles that are channelled through scientific publications. Universities can benefit from the opportunity to explore the industrial context to generate knowledge and obtain additional sources of funding for research activities. Thus, the importance of University-Industry (U-I) collaborations is considered relevant for the primary operations of the stakeholders involved. With factors that continually support the collaboration between universities and industries in the present and the foreseeable future, it becomes necessary for the context of collaboration to be explored further. Hence, a real-time collaboration between a university and several industry stakeholders is selected for further research using design thinking methodologies, and its underlying factors and future needs of the stakeholders of the collaboration are identified, and a future context is developed that defines the characteristics of the collaboration in the future. Through the process of understanding the current context of the collaboration, it is understood that there are unfulfilled needs among the stakeholders that lessen the impact on the outcomes of the collaboration activities. To address these unmet needs and also to adapt to the future context of the collaboration, the future context is extrapolated to design future scenarios that can be used as an opportunity to add value to the collaboration by devising a Hub collaboration and evolving its activities across various points in the future. Initially, the collaboration can be improved by creating a knowledge platform that acts as a modified repository for knowledge that is created by the collaborative activities and also as a social network that connects the stakeholders, thereby providing new opportunities for collaboration. Further, the concept of a collaborative laboratory that is functionally connected to other laboratories that offer new expertise and knowledge domain is proposed to develop and execute multi-stakeholder projects involving interdisciplinary research. Following this, an Innovation Transfer office is proposed for the collaboration to integrate the elements of the society into the collaboration thereby developing a system of infrastructures that enables the implementation and the integration of the innovation outcomes into a desirable, viable and feasible systems. These solution concepts form as steps towards a vision for the stakeholders of the collaboration to create gainful impacts on knowledge, business and society by spearheading innovation through collaboration. Thus, a collaboration of this kind is not to be seen merely as a union of stakeholders trying to develop innovation but has the potential to improve people’s lives by providing the best travel experiences without compromising on the operational factors of the collaboration.","Collaboration Hub; Future Collaborations; Knowledge Platform; University-Industry Innovation; Triple Helix Innovation; People in Transit; Passenger Journey; Social innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Soleymani Shishvan, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The transition from open-pit to underground mining operations is a frequently occurring procedure for mines around the world. The Akyem Gold Mine in Ghana is an example, where the transition is to be optimized with regard to the significant reduction in yearly throughput. The current processing plant is commissioned to efficiently process up to roughly 7.7 Mt of ore per year. The planned underground mine is likely to start operations in 2022 during the<br/>final stages of the remaining open-pit operations, with an estimated yearly production of 1.6 Mt of ore. This implies that a major plant modification is recommended in order to prevent unnecessary high operating costs, once a full transition may occur. However, opportunities are seen to discard the plant modification and instead to add incremental open-pit material, which is currently considered as mineralized waste. The suggested option will be considered once the analyses prove that a certain incremental open-pit head grade will generate more value in combination with the underground activities. This analysis is based on financial modelling of the potential options, where a major trade-off is conducted between the plant modification for the planned option, and the incremental open-pit mining, processing and tailings storage for the suggested option. The analysis is tested by changing all different decision parameters to indicate the optimum solution. Prior to this head grade determination, blending optimization of the potential sources of ore is conducted, in order to determine the optimum period where the potential plant modification may occur. Results show that the open-pit mine will directly supply the processing plant until 2023, whereas its stockpiles will be depleted by the end of 2025. For this reason, the suggested plant modification is suggested to take place at the start of 2026. Subsequent results related to the option evaluations are in favor of the full transition to only underground mining. Despite any changes in the set of decision parameters and gold prices, the incremental open-pit head grade will not be possible to obtain. This results from the fact that the calculations indicate a deficiency of required gold ounces based on the remaining open-pit reserves. It may be concluded that the potential transition from open-pit to underground operations with a reduction in yearly throughput, is optimized through a full transition to underground mining. The planned option, with the cohering plant modification, is proven to be optimum and is currently considered as the solution for future mining at Akyem Gold Mine.","strategic mine planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-23","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

Numerous studies have focused on conceptualization of an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the potential benefits that may be accrued regionally by effectively developing a bedrock for start-ups. This study is one of the first to compare two technically oriented regions, to find insights into intricate relationship between entrepreneurial supportive ecosystem and start-up growth from firm-level point of view. The data for this study was collected in Delft, The Netherlands, and Vilnius, Lithuania, to see the effect of these entrepreneurial supportive ecosystems when contextual factors are taken into consideration.A literature review was conducted to understand the macro-level perspective of an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the firm-level critical junctures during the development process of these high-tech start-ups. An entrepreneurial ecosystem model highlighting the most important support factors, and a simplified start-up life cycle model are presented. A conjoint model including contextual regional differences is designed as the foundation for the study - to understand to what extent an entrepreneurial ecosystem supports firm-level business activities.The data for this study was collected through a digitally distributed survey, desk research and several expert interviews. The qualitative information was used to highlight main business activities at each start-up life cycle stage. The quantitative information, regarding start-up perceptions at these stages, was analysed using an independent samples T-test, correlation matrix and mean ranking.It was found that start-ups in Vilnius mostly occupy IT Service, Fintech and Hardware industries, while Delft start-ups operate in deep-tech/high-tech, hardware and Med-Tech industries. These differences in combination with contextual interpretations explain some of the differences occurring in entrepreneurial ecosystem support evaluations. The results show that the entrepreneurial ecosystem is most supportive in the early stages of start-up growth with diminishing effects on later stages. Raising financing capital has been found to be highly supported by entrepreneurial ecosystems in both regions, even though start-ups did not perceive this activity as very important in neither of growth stages. Research and Development support in both regions was perceived as average from founders in both regions. Considering that Delft bolsters a high-quality university which should induce R&amp;D activities, the support is cancelled out by the differences in occupied industries and their respective competitiveness. This means that more R&amp;D support is needed for start-ups in Delft. Moreover, legal support has been found to be higher in Delft and attributed to a more robust regulatory system in The Netherlands. Lastly, it was found that considering important business activities at growth stages, start-ups mostly rely on internal capabilities to grow in later stages. This thesis report contributes to paving way for the conjunction of entrepreneurial ecosystem and start-up life cycle academic research field using a firm-level and holistic approaches. The study and its results should provide insights for entrepreneurial ecosystem facilitators, such as incubators or accelerators, and start-up founders alike. Entrepreneurial ecosystem support strength changes from early to latter stages shows facilitators the need to closely study start-up requirements to navigate stage-contingent critical junctures in order to provide effective support. ","Entrepreneurial Ecosystem; Start-up Life Cycle; Start-up Growth; Comparative study; Start-up Activities; Entrepreneurial Ecosystem support; Entrepreneurial Context; Context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (graduation committee); Molenkamp, T. (graduation committee); Versluis, M (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Liquid storage tanks are used worldwide to contain liquids such as drinking water, fuel and chemicals. Loss of containment during a seismic event can add to an earthquake’s destructiveness by posing a fire hazard, spilling toxic substances or reducing the supply of drinking water. It is therefore important that they remain operational at a pre-defined level of functionality during and after an earthquake event. Two effects that are recognized to play a role in the seismic behavior of liquid storage tanks are fluid-structure interaction and soil-structure interaction. Numerical models have the ability to describe the dynamic behavior of each domain accurately, but they tend to be time consuming compared to many of the available simplified analytical models. While the latter can be useful for design purposes, they do not necessarily yield accurate solutions to the complex system at hand. In this thesis, a semi-analytical model is put forward based on previous work by Canny (2018) and Molenkamp (2018) that combines both fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction with a dynamic substructuring approach. The model offers a computational efficiency and ease of use comparable to the aforementioned analytical models, but the only sacrifices to accuracy are the limitations imposed by the underlying assumptions and a number of discretizations. The tank, soil and fluid domains are treated separately. The tank is considered with Love's thin shell theory and the soil as a visco-elastic continuum. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, irrotational and inviscid, allowing the application of linear potential theory. The solutions to the homogeneous equations of Love's shell theory, describing the behavior of the tank's bottom plate and wall segments, are found as eigenfunction expansions. By satisfying the boundary and interface conditions of the different tank parts, an eigenvalue problem is formulated that leads to the eigenfrequencies and mode shapes of the tank. The fluid velocity potential is rewritten as the superposition of three fluid velocity potentials that each satisfy a set of conditions regarding the velocity continuity at the wall and at the plate, and the free surface condition at the fluid surface. The velocity potential in addition needs to satisfy Laplace's equation and solutions are found again as an expansion of eigenfunctions that represent the fluid's modes. For the soil, Green's influence functions for uniform horizontal and vertical loads on a circular area at the soil surface have been used to assemble a dynamic soil stiffness matrix. The influence functions are again in the form of an eigenfunction expansion that is the solution to the homogeneous wave equation describing the soil's motions. Through satisfaction of a set of conditions at the fluid-structure and soil-structure interfaces, respectively velocity and stress continuity, and displacement and stress continuity, a final set of equations is obtained. The only unknowns remaining in this set are the modal amplitudes that after solving can be used to linearly combine the mode shapes to give the full dynamic behavior of the tank-fluid system. Motions and stresses at the soil surface can be found with the dynamic soil stiffness matrix. The dynamic soil-structure interaction is taken into account in the model by considering all wave fields present in the soil, namely the free-field (or incident), the scattered and the radiated wave field. Subsequent satisfaction of the soil-structure interface conditions ensures that soil-structure interaction is properly considered, and it yields a simple result in which the usually known free-field wave field can directly be applied in the excitation term of the plate's equations of motion. <br/>Results are obtained in the frequency domain and can be transformed to the time domain with the inverse Fourier transform. Output can be obtained similar to the output of FE models with stresses and displacements at each location of the tank domain. In the fluid domain, velocities can be found as well as related variables, such as the fluid pressures at the fluid-tank interfaces and the fluid elevation at the fluid surface (sloshing). Regarding the soil, stresses can be obtained at the soil-structure interface and displacements at the soil surface. Besides, the model can give more insight in the effects of SSI, compared to a tank-fluid system founded on a rigid soil. Limitations of the model include the inability to model nonlinear effects, as a result of the linearity of the model, so that nonlinear failure mechanisms as buckling cannot be modeled, or nonlinear stress-strain relations. At the same time, nonlinear effects are not extensively covered in the other available analytical methods either. With regard to engineering practice, roofs, ring stiffeners and anchors are commonplace, but have yet to be included in the model. Similarly, the capacity to model multiple soil layers would bring the model a step closer to reality. Besides more accurate modeling of the soil composition at a greater depth, it would admit a more realistic model of the soil directly underneath the tank, which is often improved in case of initially unsuitable grounds. Before the model can be applied in practice however, it needs to be validated, for example with a FE model or experimentally. To increase the model's competitive advantage of computational efficiency, measures can be taken to improve it. The greatest improvements can be made in the assembly of the dynamic soil stiffness matrix by reducing the number of elements of the soil-structure interface. With the applied axisymmetric discretization, many of the matrix entries are the same, so that only a small number actually needs to be computed. However, a large number of very small elements is concentrated in the center of the soil-structure interface that does not add to the accuracy of the solution. Other discretizations could reduce computation time by reducing the number of elements and thereby the size of the dynamic soil stiffness matrix.","Liquid Storage Tank; Soil-Structure Interaction; Mode-Matching; Earthquake Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

The aggregation of these analytic processes along with the software and hardware infrastructure implementing and facilitating them, comprise the field of big data analytics, which has distinct characteristics from normal data analytics. The systems executing the analysis, were found to exhibit performance weaknesses, significant front-end-bounding Level 1 Data cache miss rates specifically, for certain queries including, but not limited to, Natural Language Processing analytics. Based on this observation, investigations on whether, for data using the Apache Arrow format, its metadata could be used by certain prefetching techniques to improve cache behaviour and on the profile of the datasets and workloads which could profit from them, were conducted. Architectural simulations of the execution of various microbenchmarks in an In-Order and an Out-Of-Order core were performed utilising different popular prefetchers and comparing the produced statistics with those of a perfect prefetcher. During this process, the performance of systems featuring the tested prefetchers was found to lag behind this of the perfect prefetcher system by a considerable margin for workloads featuring indirect indexing access patterns for datatypes of variable width. As a result, those patterns, which are readily available in the access mechanism of Apache Arrow, were identified as possible candidates for acceleration by more sophisticated prefetching techniques. The first step in the investigation of such techniques was the introduction of a software prefetching scheme. This scheme, which is using prefetching and execution bursts, was embedded in a synthetic benchmark, specifically designed for the investigation of the effect the computation intensity of an algorithm has on the successful prefetching of indirect indexing access patterns. Its performance approached closely the performance produced by ideal prefetching for all the computation intensities except for the very low ones, with its resilience to possible variance in memory congestion being questionable though. As hardware prefetching is more adaptable to runtime parameters like memory congestion, subsequently such a module was designed, with information about the memory locations and hierarchy of the Apache Arrow columns’ buffers communicated to it by the software. Using this information, the prefetcher is able to distinguish between index and value accesses and prefetch the regular, iterative ones successfully. The hardware technique was able to almost match the performance of the ideal prefetcher for medium and high computation intensities and approach it, to the extent the bandwidth constraints allow, for the rest. In terms of speed-up, the maximum attained of the hardware prefetcher over the top performing reference prefetchers was almost 7x and 4x for In-Order and Out-Of-Order execution respectively with the software prefetcher performing marginally worse in both cases. Those speed-ups were achieved for those algorithm’s computation intensities which resulted in execution neither constrained by memory system’s bandwidth limitations, nor by in-core computation resources’ limitations.","Cache Prefetching; Big Data; Apache Arrow; HPC; Computer Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The research for this thesis is part of a bigger project on injury prevention and sport performance called Citius Altius Sanius (CAS). Two data sets from two different projects within CAS are analysed, with two different goals; one focusses on sports injury prevention in soccer, the other on performance prediction in baseball. First we analyse a data set on acceleration during exercise from project P6, generated while testing a prototype of wearable sensor trousers during soccer drills. The aim of P6 is to design special leg wear with wearable sensors in order to gain more knowledge on hamstring injuries. Therefore, an algorithm needs to be developed to identify the intensity of certain movements using sensor data. Features were extracted from the acceleration data in order to classify the intensity. Four methods are then tested on the data, of which the decision tree seems to produce the best results. Analysis showed that this model seemed to be able to predict low intensity well (99.1% accuracy), although it struggles signicantly more with medium and high intensity exercise (75.5%). The second data set covered the growth in throwing speed of a group of young baseball athletes between the ages of 12 and 18. The aim of the research was to identify a common growth curve for throwing speed of pitchers during adolescence and provide personalised growth curve models. A mixed effects or multilevel design was chosen to model the growth in throwing speed, due to its ability to model the hierarchical nature of the longitudinal data. After analysing the data set and covariates, we found we could reduce the number of predictors, and thus the cost of collecting data. Furthermore, it is possible to predict throwing speed on a personal level using only age and one measurement on the predictors and throwing speed, although predictions are improved when more measurements are available. The results of this research can be implemented in the projects, although some complications and opportunities for improvement still exist. Recommendations for future research have therefore been discussed.","data science; multilevel models; Classification trees; mixed effects models; sports; baseball; Soccer; Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Green hydrogen in this respect has been proposed and researched into as a possible replacement for currently used fossil fuels. Despite hydrogen being a relatively cleaner source of energy and a good energy storage medium, the transportation and storage of hydrogen acts as a barrier for the large-scale implementation of a hydrogen economy. The low density of hydrogen requires it to be compressed to high pressures or liquefied to transport and store it while the explosive nature makes it difficult to handle hydrogen. These drawbacks open up opportunities for other hydrogen energy carriers to be considered instead of hydrogen. The aim of this thesis is to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain of hydrogen and hydrogen energy carriers which include production, storage, transportation, imports and reforming of the energy carriers. The hydrogen energy carriers that have been shortlisted other than hydrogen include ammonia, methanol, dimethyl ether and synthetic methane while the transport modes considered include road transport, maritime shipping and pipeline transport. The Netherlands is chosen as a case study taking into account the demand for hydrogen across the six industrial clusters for the year 2050. The demand for hydrogen includes hydrogen for energy and for feedstock which resulted in a total demand of 444 PJ for the year 2050. Hydrogen production which also serves as a starting point for the production of the other energy carriers, is based on the predicted 15 GW surplus offshore wind energy available in the Netherlands from the North Sea wind farms by the year 2050. Considering the supply and demand, the supply chain of each energy carrier within the three transport modes are modelled resulting in the estimation of the energy efficiency and the system costs. Further, region specific costs are estimated to identify what factors affect the costs of delivering the energy carriers to the different regions in the Netherlands. The results indicate that pipeline transport was the most economical transport mode followed closely by liquid road transport. Compressed road transport was not as attractive, as the high transport pressures resulted in high loading and unloading costs and lower system efficiencies. Hydrogen pipelines was the most economical energy carrier and transport mode followed by liquid hydrogen road transport and ammonia pipeline. Transporting synthetic methane was the most expensive energy carrier across all transport modes while methanol and DME had very similar system costs. The production and import costs were the two main factors determining the system costs while transport costs had an vital impact only in the case of compressed road transport. Storage and reforming costs of the energy carrier were almost negligible in most cases. The Capex and the efficiency of the hydrogen electrolyser played a major role in determining the production costs of all the energy carriers. Ammonia reforming was identified as a bottleneck pushing the system costs of transporting ammonia higher than the system costs of transporting hydrogen. Liquefaction of hydrogen and synthetic methane resulted in higher import costs for these energy carriers and higher transport costs when transported as a liquid by road, in comparison to the other three energy carriers. Estimating region specific costs for hydrogen pipeline transport resulted in a variation in the costs of hydrogen delivered to the different regions in the Netherlands. The allocation of cheaper imports and relatively expensive domestic production across the six industrial clusters in the Netherlands was a major factor in determining the costs of the energy carrier delivered to the industrial clusters.","Hydrogen; Techno-economic analysis; Transport; decarbonization; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-22","","","","","",""

The third part of this thesis translates this new theory into practice. Three new prototypes are developed, which should together affect the change in purchase behaviour. These products are validated with five participants over three weeks. The results of the interviews show three categories of psychological long-term product value: products that carry memories, products that satisfy basic needs and products which enable human goals. These last two categories complement each other. The research on behavioural change shows that the human goals should be discovered first, which results in a personal set of long-term product values. Next, consumers have to be reminded of their values during the purchase process. Finally, sufficient commitment should be created to resist the products that do not fit the personal set of long-term product values. For this, a game is proposed to raise awareness and discover this personal set of long-term product values. This game enables the consumer to train the reasoning behind the desire for products. The validation test showed that the game is successful in creating awareness and in training consumers to reason about products with personal long-term product value. To make the consumer remember their set of personal long-term product values in the purchase process, two reminders are proposed: the ‘Product Calendar’, and a sticker set ‘Stick to your values’. These designs remind the consumer of their long-term product values, translate the game into real life and create commitment. In conclusion, this project enables designers to understand long-term psychological product value, gives them a framework to design for purchase behavioural change, and the designs of this project enable consumers to make more sustainable purchase decisions.","Product Longevity; Purchase Decisions; Environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The role of hydrodynamics in “self-steering” of the particles in a low Reynolds flows is explicitly dependent only on the particle’s exterior geometry. Thus richer responses can be achieved by controlling the transport and orientation of asymmetric particles under external flow. In this work, we study the universal behaviour of particles with any arbitrary shape, strongly confined along direction involving height. The particle both translates and rotates in-plane, until a stable orientation is reached, after which it drifts cross-stream. By combining analytical, numerical and experimental techniques, we establish the generalised equations of motion for a particle sufficiently far away from the channel walls along width. Thus, the total motion of a particle is characterized by estimating only a few timescales, intrinsic to its exterior geometry. We discuss the shape properties defining the dynamics, and use them to derive an analytical framework. The results are then validated against the numerical solution utilizing an improved 2-Dimnesional Brinkman formulation for highly confined particles. Experiments are performed using stop-flow lithography, where the dynamics of the photo-polymerized particles are observed by driving it out of equilibrium using an externally imposed pressure difference. We confirm the universal behaviour of the particles, except for a few cases, only when close to the stable orientation. Our experimentally observed rotational timescales consistently match the numerically computed values when multiplied by a factor of 1.8.","microhydrodynamics; microfluidics; quasi-2D flow; confined Stokes flow; creeping flow; self- steering; microparticles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This subject also has a fundamental interest as strain highlights the interaction of various scales of turbulence. This scale interaction<br/>essentially dictates transfer of energy in turbulence and hence is fundamental in understanding turbulence dynamics itself. The present work deals with the experimental study of the response of pipe turbulence to axisymmetric, irrotational strain using high-resolution planar Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A mildly rapid strain (<i>s<sup>*s</sup></i> ~ 3.2) is imposed on turbulence via a spatial contraction. It is seen that turbulence is suppressed upon straining. As a response to mean strain, transverse Reynold stress increases at the expense of streamwise Reynolds stress and anisotropy is induced in the turbulence. Despite strain being only mildly rapid, Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) is found to predict the correct trend of normal Reynolds stress although traverse Reynolds stress is over-predicted. The effect of strain on different scales of turbulence is discerned. The large scales of turbulence are seen to get compressed in the radial direction although they do not get affected significantly in the streamwise direction. Near-wall coherent structures which were initially inclined w.r.t. the wall are seen to get aligned with the flow as they also get severely compressed in the radial direction. On the other hand, the small scales of turbulence are found to be spatially organised in the form of sheets or layers. Upon straining, these sheets are found to get aligned with the mean flow. Further, they get elongated in streamwise and compressed in the radial direction. It is observed that the small scales are more severely distorted than the large scales upon staining inside the contraction. At the Reynolds number (<i>Re</i>) range employed in this thesis, there is no substantial difference in which turbulence is strained inside the contraction at disparate Re. Downstream of the contraction, at the axis of the pipe, the anisotropy of Reynolds stress is found to recover slowly. Further, this relaxation is seen to be Re dependent with higher<i> Re</i> turbulence relaxing slightly faster.","pipe turbulence; strained turbulence; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

The prime objective is to find the optimal steering strategy for the photonic sail to get captured in Alpha Centauri after a minimum-time transfer from Earth. By extending the idea of the Breakthrough Starshot project with a deceleration phase at arrival, the mission's scientific yield is increased. In addition to capture into an orbit at the center of the habitable zone of one of the stars, a transfer trajectory to an orbit around the other star and an orbit-raising maneuver to the outer edge of the habitable zone are also investigated and added to the proposed mission scenario. The trajectories are optimized for minimum time of flight with the trajectory optimization tool InTrance, which makes use of evolutionary neurocontrol. The results show that an increase in technological development is required to obtain a feasible time of flight of approximately one century, using a two-sided reflective sail. The optimized time of flight from our Solar System until capture in Alpha Centauri ranges from 20,000 years for current sail technology to less than 80 years for a futuristic graphene-based ultralight sail. The latter allows a maximum injection speed into Alpha Centauri of 5.5\% of the speed of light. The results in this work show an average improvement of 30\% in terms of time of flight for lightness numbers smaller than a graphene-based sail. A sail as proposed by the Breakthrough Starshot project, however, would need over 2000 years to travel from our Solar System until capture about Alpha Centauri B, such that a fly-through mission that arrives within a lifetime is arguably the best option for a near-term mission to Alpha Centauri.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor); Peters, D.J. (mentor); van Dalen, K.N. (mentor); Chen, X. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The submerged floating tunnel (SFT), also known as the Archimedes bridge or suspended tunnel, is a conceptual idea for a tunnel that floats in the water, supported by its buoyancy. The tunnel would be placed underwater, not too deep in order to avoid high water pressures, but deep enough for it not to be exposed to extreme weather conditions or obstruct shipping traffic. The tunnel is kept in position with tethers that are anchored to the sea bed or floating pontoons at the water surface. This thesis focuses on the tether supported SFT. The dynamic response of a tether supported SFT, in a hydrodynamic environment, is different from the tunnels that are widely used nowadays. The SFT is always in contact with open water in which it is moving due to the hydrodynamic environment. The dynamic response of the tether supported SFT is still a gap in our engineering knowledge and this contributes to the fact that world-wide no tether supported SFT has ever been constructed. Many research has been performed in the last years. A broad range of models has been used to study the dynamic behavior of the tether supported SFT. The key in all these models is to capture the fluid structure interaction. Waves and current exert forces on the tunnel body but at the same time, the presence and motion of the tunnel body affects the wave-current environment. To model the dynamic response of a tethered SFT incorporating fluid-structure interaction, a new model has been developed. The dynamic SFT model describes the cross sectional motion and tether forces of a rectangular tubular tunnel which is pinned down by two inclined tethers, excluding longitudinal effects. The tunnel is forced by waves and current only. When assuming the SFT system to be linear, the motion of the SFT can be seen as a superposition of the motion of the tunnel body in still water and the forces on the restrained tunnel body in waves and current. The tunnel motion in still water is modelled with a dynamic module while the hydrodynamic forces on a restrained tunnel body are computed with a wave force module. The two independent modules are combined in a coupling module which makes it possible to describe the dynamic response of a tether supported SFT in a wave-current environment. The advantages of this model choice are the fast computational time and the convenience of physical interpretation. The wave force module computes the wave-current forces on the restrained tunnel body with a modified Morison formulation. This formulation is capable of computing, besides vertical and horizontal wave-current forces, the rotational wave force. Rotational wave forces are essential in the determination of tunnel roll motion and cannot be determined with the classical Morison theory. Just like the classical Morison theory, the modified Morison formulation does not take into account wave field deformation due to the presence of the tunnel structure. Therefore, for waves that are short compared with the dimensions of the SFT, diffraction effects cannot be taken into account. The absence of the diffraction effect is corrected for by integrating the dynamic pressures, water accelerations and water velocities with respect to the tunnel height and width. It should be noted that the applicability for short waves is only valid in case of structures that are submerged at a depth of at least 1.5-2 times the structure height. For shallowed submergence depths, the diffraction effects in combination with wave deformation become too large which cause prediction errors in the force determination. The force on the restrained SFT due to a uniform current can be modelled with the drag force expression from the classical Morison equation. To correct for the wave current interaction, the hydrodynamic mass coefficients are adapted as function of the Keulegan-Carpenter number. The dynamic module describes the oscillation of the SFT, in still water, with a dynamic system. A free floating tunnel has three degrees of freedom which are roll, sway and heave. This dynamic system assumes the tunnel is connected with two in-extensible tethers. Adding two rigid constrains to the free floating tunnel reduces the SFT to a single degree of freedom system. This single degree of freedom system describes a coupled translational (sway) and rotational (roll) motion around an instantaneous rotational point which can be found at the intersections of the tether axes. When assuming small vibrations, the instantaneous rotational point remains fixed at the intersection of the tether axes when the tunnel is at rest. The moment of inertia of the SFT is obtained by using the Lagrangian approach which is based on energy conservation. Because the structure is submerged in water, added damping and mass terms are used in the equation of motion. The magnitude of these damping and mass terms is calibrated with physical model experiments. The coupling module combines the wave force module and the dynamic module, which makes it possible to formulate a full equation of motion, describing the oscillation of the SFT in a wave current environment. From the equation of motion the sway and roll motions, containing accelerations, velocities and displacements, can be obtained. Apart from the motions, the tether forces can be predicted. The dynamic SFT model is validated with physical model experiments. With this dynamic SFT model, a parametric study has been performed. The first part of the parametric study focuses on the motion of the SFT. The second part examines the tether forces. Furthermore, the slack-taut transition and the safety against fatigue have been investigated. The parametric study does not take into account current. The most important findings and implications are in summary: • Each SFT configuration has a different response to the wave environment. Hence, every configuration has a different critical wave length for which the dynamic response is maximum. This critical wave length is independent of the wave height. It should be noted that the dynamic response is a comprehensive term which consists of many variables. These are; tether forces, sway motions and roll motions of which both motions contain accelerations, velocities and displacements. The most dominant parameters to influence the dynamic response are the buoyance to weight ratio (BWR), tether angle and submergence depth. • The BWR increases the stiffness of the dynamic SFT system which causes a decrease in the roll motions and sway displacement. Due to the stiffness increase, sway accelerations and velocities become larger. The natural frequency of the SFT is increased by increasing the BWR, which makes it more sensitive to shorter waves. • Configurations with large tether angles have the character to be very flexible and sway dominant, while configurations with small tether angles are stiffer and roll dominant. Tether forces for configurations with large tether angles are more sensitive to long waves, while tether forces for configurations with small tether angles are more sensitive to short waves. • A decrease in submergence depth increases all tunnel motions and tether forces, as the tunnel becomes more exposed to the wave environment. The dynamic response of the SFT becomes more sensitive to short waves. • An increase in anchorage depth results in larger tunnel motions. The increase in tether forces is negligible. • Placing the tether connection sideways of the tunnel body results in smaller roll motions and larger sway motions. Lowering the tether connection with respect to the tunnel bottom is favourable for all tunnel motions. The manner of how the tether connection is orientated, with respect to the tunnel body, has small influence on the tether forces. • Increasing the BWR, submergence depth or both reduces the risk of snapping lines and tether fatigue. Configurations with small tether angles have a smaller risk of having line snapping and tether fatigue compared to configurations with large tether angles. This study gives a supplement to the classical Morison theory. Morison’s theory is modified which makes it possible to compute rotational moments due to wave loading. Also the applicability to short waves is enlarged. A new dynamic schematization is developed which makes it possible to describe the dynamic response of a SFT as a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system. The advantages of this dynamic schematization are the fast computational time and the convenience of physical interpretation. The results obtained from this research study can be used as a preliminary design tool. In an early design stage, motions and tether forces can be predicted. Also measures to reduce these motions and tether forces can be investigated using the dynamic SFT model. Design graphs to estimate the snap-taut transition and for safety against tether fatigue are provided. It should be noted that this dynamic SFT model should not be used for detailed computations in later design stages.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-22","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The use of performance-driven approaches are progressively growing interest among architects and engineers. Proper design of a large span roof shading system can positively influence the micro-climate of the space underneath, representing a significant source of daylight and reducing the building energy demands. To support the decision making process and steer towards high-performing solutions, the adoption of computational design processes has the potential of being a fast and reliable approach. This project was undertaken to propose a computational workflow and evaluate its effectiveness as supportive decision-making tool from the early design stage of large roof shading systems. The proposed Computational Design Exploration (CDE) is adopted to evaluate three different concept alternatives in terms of daylight and thermal performances. Based on the visualization and analyses of the data, the best performing morphological features of the three alternatives are identified and the design is refined to create an optimal fourth concept. In a second phase, the Computational Design Optimization (CDO) workflow is applied to obtain high performing solutions in terms of daylight objectives, by varying geometrical and material inputs. 50 configurations are selected as optimal. The post process of the CDO consists of a second CDE, in which the selected samples are evaluated in terms of energy performance. The final shading system is chosen by identifying the input settings that allow the lowest energy consumption. As result, the daylight requirements are fulfilled and the thermal properties are used as final decision criteria. The steps described in the CDE and CDO workflow are followed through the combined use of a parametric modelling tool (Grasshopper) and a multidisciplinary design optimization platform (modeFRONTIER). Post-processing tools are adopted to help the identification of interaction effects of the variables on the performance targets. By a series of data visualizations and sensitivity analyses, it is determined whether the final optimal selected design configurations improve the visual and thermal performances. The most important identified trends and variables are used as main inputs to produce a more structured and integrated computational workflow. The final proposed workflow is meant to be a versatile method to assist the designer in the decision making process, yet maintaining his/her autonomy of judgement. Future research is needed to prove the validity and effectiveness of the proposed workflow. The integration of other design variables and performances objectives could lead to an holistic method, suitable for every kind of multi-objective design problem.","Computational Design; Parametric Design; Daylight; Grasshopper; modeFrontier; Design workflow; Performance based design; Large span roofs; Shading; Thermal Performance; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

These LIPs have a substantial impact on not only the society but also the economy. The Indonesian government intends to accelerate infrastructure provision by selecting complex LIPs to be assisted by a government body, KPPIP (Committee for Acceleration of Priority Infrastructure Delivery). The selection is difficult due to the limited information in the early-phase of a project and creates uncertainty for the Decision-Makers (DMs). Besides, KPPIP does not have a structured approach in selecting the projects in Indonesia. Another challenge is the non-comprehensive list of KPPIP selection criteria. The process cannot generate good decisions. Therefore, the problem statement is formulated as “KPPIP does not have a tool to handle the uncertainty of the DMs to deal with the selection of LIPs based on the project complexity.” This study has three objectives. First, generate a list of selection criteria. Second, propose a decisionmaking method to manage LIPs selection issues. Lastly, check the suitability and usefulness of the method. The research question is formulated as: “How do decision-makers select LIPs based on the project complexity giving the uncertainty of DMs?” Two relevant topics are synthesized from a systematic literature review: first, the selection of LIPs. Second, two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, i.e., Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach. This research proposes a methodology that comprises three main processes. First, a set of selection criteria is created. Secondly, criteria weights are obtained with Belief-Based Best-Worst Method (B-BWM). Lastly, projects’ scores are acquired by an ER approach. The findings show significant changes in the weights and various preferences on the critical criteria among four sectors compared to those obtained from KPPIP’s current assessment. The weights from four sectors are computed as the group weights and more reliable because it considers the reliability of the DMs. The results show that the previously critical criteria are not considered as necessary in the new assessment and discover several criteria to be added to the existing criteria set. The projects’ score demonstrates the non-comprehensiveness of the existing criteria set. The sensitivity analysis shows a less sensitive result on the group weights and higher robustness of Group B-BWM due to the use of interval collective weights. The weights’ change implies a biased understanding of the criteria’s importance and shows the non-comprehensiveness of the criteria in KPPIP current assessment. The application of Belief Structure (BS) form in both the B-BWM and ER approach can handle the non-quantifiable criteria which cannot be managed in the KPPIP method. The challenges in the selection of LIPs are identified: the complexity of LIPs, the uncertainty of the DMs, non-comprehensiveness of KPPIP current criteria, and limitation of KPPIP current methods. Five confirmed important criteria are found: “Project Development Fund support,” “determination of funding scheme,” “executive direction,” “technological newness/innovation of the project/products,” and “availability of people, material, and resources due to sharing.” A procedure comprises of Group B-BWM and ER approach is proposed and offers some advantages, such as considering the reliability of DMs, flexibility, compatibility, and more robust methods. The proposed methodology is confirmed to be fit-for-purpose in LIPs selection. Four recommendations for the selection of LIPs are proposed: Establish comprehensive criteria set, implement Group B-BWM and ER approach, and set the grades definition. For future research: Use a project complexity criteria framework from literature, conduct group project scoring, conduct multiple case studies, use more samples, and conduct concurrent validity.","large infrastructure projects; multi-criteria decision-making; Best-Worst Method; belief-based best-worst method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It is easy to tell that AI will become pervasive in our everyday life. However, people still lack confidence in AI. Since trust is crucial in the development and acceptance of AI, it is essential to design for proper trust in the human-AI relationship to make people benefit from the technological advance. In this project, the challenge of trust in AI is explored in collaboration with Exact. Exact is one of the market-leading business software companies in the Netherlands. Following the trend of automation in the business software industry, Exact comes up with the future vision of Robotic Accounting and integrate AI into their product Exact Online. However, the users seem to stay behind in adopting these automatic features. Through initial interviews, they find that the lack of trust is one critical reason behind the low adoption. Thus, the design assignment is to “find out the reasons that cause a low trust and adoption of users for automation within Exact Online, and design a solution to promote the trust and usage towards Exact existing and to-be designed AI features.” To understand the background and why trust is such a challenging topic in AI, the project starts with literature reviews around AI and trust. Then trust models are studied to build the theoretical structure of what is trust and how is trust formed. Besides the literature review, the context of Exact and bookkeeping is also studied to define the background of this project and guide the design concept. After the analysis of trust theories and context background, two rounds of user research is conducted to know how users trust AI functions in Exact Online, and how will different elements influence their trust towards : the quantitative research and the qualitative research. The quantitative research is based on the theoretical framework of trust to validate and prioritized the elements, while the qualitative research is more explorative and could explain the elements with real experience. Insights are generated from the two rounds of research and guide the solution design. After the research, a strategy pyramid is created for Exact. The strategy pyramid consists of four layers. The first layer is the vision: trust AI like trust your best assistant; The second layer is the strategy: take care of trust for the whole journey; The third layer is the tactical layer: the trust-building guideline. And the last layer is the operationalization: the envisioned product. The last two layers are further designed. The trust-building guideline is designed as a toolkit that could provoke discussion round trust in the AI development process, and the envisioned product is a redesigned version of Exact Online based on the trust-building guideline.

This is mainly the result of inaccuracy and lack of understanding of the soil behavior and the interaction with the foundation piles. Therefore, this study is aimed at developing analytical and numerical methods to describe the nonlinear dynamic soil response as excited by a harmonic excitation representing a Dynamic Cone Pressure Meter. Measuring the dynamic soil properties more accurately and using them in design will reduce the uncertainties and conservatism in the design of foundation piles.<br/><br/>This study is divided in two main parts. In the first part a soil column is modeled. The numerical and semi-analytical methods to describe the one-dimensional linear and nonlinear dynamic soil response to a prescribed displacement are developed. The linear solution is obtained first since it is easier to get and interpret. It is also used to study the extent to which the nonlinearity influences the soil behavior. In the nonlinear analysis strain-dependent shear modulus and damping ratio are used. These are essential input parameters for conducting a ground response analysis. In this study, the curves constructed using the hyperbolic soil model are used for the expressions of strain-dependent shear modulus and damping. <br/><br/>In the second part of the study, the cavity expansion problem is modeled to simulate a Dynamic Cone Pressure Meter (DCPM) that will be used for in-situ investigation of dynamic soil properties. The response of the soil to a prescribed displacement/ stress at the cavity is found using the numerical method and the HBM. Using the HBM different assumed solutions are implemented to study the influence of the higher harmonics. The HBM is assessed for both a finite and an infinite medium, meaning when standing waves and propagating waves are formed respectively. <br/><br/>Overall, the HBM was found to have a comparable level of accuracy with the numerical method in modelling the nonlinear response of the soil column and the cavity problem. The difference results due to the limited number of harmonics used in the HBM and also due to the tolerances of the MALAB solvers used such as bvp5c and ode45. Both methods show that the nonlinearity affects the response considerably. As the nonlinearity increases, the amplitude and the phase shift of the response change. While it may be hard to interpret the results judging from the numerical solution only, they become much easier to understand by comparing them with the harmonic balance method. Moreover, while it takes hours to obtain the numerical solutions for different forcing frequencies, the frequency response function is obtained in a couple of minutes through the harmonic balance method. This shows that the harmonic balance method is a computationally efficient and powerful tool. Overall this study is an important step of the project that aims to develop a prototype of a DCPM for in-situ soil investigations. The DCPM will pave the way for the reduction of uncertainty in the soil-structure interaction models and help the offshore wind industry to increase cost efficiency while harvesting energy from a sustainable natural resource.<br","Nonlinear dynamics; harmonic balance method; numerical method; harmonic excitation; soil response; non-reflective boundary condition; standing waves; propagating waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Just as regular computers boosted our computing power to scales never imagined before, so too could quantum computers allow us to solve problems that we just do not yet have the computational power for. However, a properly functioning quantum computer that outclasses current classical computers is not yet a reality. Many di_erent platforms for quantum computing are being researched. Experiments are being done with diamond vacancies (see, for example, [1]), trapped ions [2], nuclear spins in NMR [3] and silicon quantum dots [4], to name a few. One of the most promising types of qubits is based on superconducting circuits [5]. The most widely studied and most promising superconducting qubit is the Transmon qubit [6]. One of the advantages of this type of qubit is that it can be fabricated using currently available lithographic patterning equipment. However, when fabricating Transmon chips, there is a problem of non-uniformity: when using the exact same method to make two chips, they can be vastly di_erent. As such, every chip needs to be characterised after fabrication. Characterising a chip means _nding speci_c important parameters for the qubits, such as their frequency and coherence times. For use in a quantum computer, qubit frequencies will have te be targeted with more precision than is currently possible [7] [8]. As such, a technique that allows change a qubit's frequency after its fabrication is very useful. In this thesis, such a technique is presented. The characterisation process of a Transmon chip is then explained. The data of the three chips that were subjected to the aforementioned technique is also presented.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

With their purpose ‘moving your world by creating memorable experiences’, maintaining those high levels of services is important. Cabin crew is for a big part responsible for those high levels of services. Making cabin crew feel the best of them and reaching optimal staff behaviour are therefore important goals of their managing department Inflight Services. For that reason, many tools for cabin crew have been developed and KLM has gone through multiple digital transformations. Although much effort is put into creating the optimal working climate, cabin crew suffers from information overload. This has led to the aim of this graduation project, namely reducing information overload among cabin crew. The thesis followed the X way of working. Starting with the SHERLOCK phase, a literature review and a channel, organisation and crew analysis has been done. The analyses showed factors playing a role in the occurrence of information overload. Additionally, it showed that channels are used by the organisation as a gate to push information to crew, while cabin crew wishes to pull the information according to their needs. This has led to the design challenge ‘making cabin crew feel up to date’. The intended solution should guide the organisation in becoming more crew centric, understanding the cabin crew needs in regards to information and with that move from a push to a future minded pull strategy. The following MICKEY phase aimed ideating solutions. The future vision was specified and learnings were drawn from strategies applied by other companies. The phase closed with a set of hypotheses. In the LEGO phase, the hypotheses were tested with minimum viable products. These tests showed that needs of cabin crew differ per phase of the journey and what the exact needs in each phase of journey were. The following DUMMY phase aimed at translating all these findings into a framework for the organisation and tangible solutions for crew. In multiple design cycles, the DUMMY phase closes with The Information Compass. The information Compass is the final deliverable of this thesis. The tool includes information-needs of crew per phase of the journey and can be used by the organisation to navigate those needs. The tool is written in the same style as the branding strategy and with that aims at creating coherence between the communication and organisation strategies. Ultimately, the tool aims at making cabin crew feel up to date. The information compass comes with a guide and 10 cheat sheets; one for each action crew undertakes. The cheat sheets give explanation about the needs and a clear, tangible example fulfilling the needs. The validation phase showed that cabin crew are enthusiastic about the solutions designed. The organisation values the solution and aims at using the tool to become more crew-centric in the way they send information and in the developed apps, and with that make cabin crew feel up to date. The thesis concludes with recommendations for future designs.","Information overload; Design; Airline; Cabin crew; Framework; user centric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Control algorithms can be programmed into a digital signal processor and tested with real-time simulations of electrical machines and power electronic converters, eliminating the need for developing real prototypes. Consequently, this project aims to develop a simulation environment for electric vehicle research by implementing a HIL simulation of an EV powertrain computer model and an external hardware controller. The proposed HIL simulation runs in real time the transmission, inverter, and PMSM models of an EV powertrain inside an OP5700 simulator. On the other hand, the controller algorithm is executed from a TI LaunchXL-F28379D board. The controller samples current and rotor position signals from the motor model through the analog outputs of the simulator, and generates a PWM signal as a command to the inverter computer model. In addition, a software in the loop (SIL) simulation is implemented, running the controller algorithm in the real-time simulator's CPU to test the control strategy before moving on to the hardware implementation. The powertrain specifications are based on the released information of a battery-electric vehicle on the market. The HIL controller's FOC algorithm is based on MTPA and flux-weakening strategies from the reviewed literature. The simulation results show the expected behaviour from the inverter's phase voltages, stator currents and the output torque of the simulated electric motor model. Finally, the response of the developed SIL and HIL simulations to a reference drive cycle is analysed, and the results validate the implemented controller algorithm and powertrain model.","real time simulation; Electric Vehicle; OPAL-RT; hardware in the loop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a required mature radical innovation capability in the front end of the process was lacking (O’Connor &amp; DeMartino, 2006). Therefore, they have to change their internal processes and organisational routines that are regarded as the building blocks for this organisational capability (Junginger, 2008; Salvato &amp; Rerup, 2011). Understanding organisational change is one of the great endeavours of many researchers and management consultants in the field of organisation design. A way to understand organisational change is by looking at organisational routines (Becker, 2005). Organisational routines are important to organisational change, but easier to study (Feldman &amp; Pentland, 2003). However, an understanding how routines are designed or come to life is still a key question in the field of organisation design (Howard-Grenvile, 2005; Wegener et al., 2019). The approach of many managers and consultants of carefully designing PowerPoints and checklists while hoping for routines to change is a mistake (Pentland &amp; Feldman, 2008). This leads to the following research question: How to design an organisational routine that develops a radical innovation capability within a technology firm?To answer this question and to provide organisation designers or organisational researchers empirical insights on how to design a routine in a performative way I developed and executed a routine design strategy. This strategy is based on existing routine design literature (Pentland &amp; Feldman, 2008) and the double diamond approach (Design Council, 2005).This study shows that using a routine design strategy consisting of three interdependent phases are critical to routine design. First, emphasize with routine actors, conduct activities to discover and define the challenges and needs the actors face in their patterns of action. Second, lock in desired performance, prototype in collaboration with the routine actors the desired performances and lock them in a physical artefact. Third, build the ostensive, perform the designed performances in design experiments within a reflective and experimental space to practice the routine in safe but realistic boundaries.","Organisation Design; Routine design; Radical innovation; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Permeating the construction field from the aerospace industry, FRP are applied in both the rehabilitation of existing degrading structures as well as the conception of new projects such as pedestrian and traffic bridges or building facades. The increase of interest and use in FRP in recent decades is driven by the material’s advantageous properties. Its tailorable mechanical properties, long-term durability, customizable free-form design, and its light-weight feature have engrained FRP as a noteworthy alternative to traditional construction materials such as concrete, steel, or timber. This is of paramount importance in light of the climate change challenge facing structural engineers today. While the material properties have been extensively investigated over the past decades, the structural use in FRP have remained limited to specific applications. As such, FRP, material of the future, has fallen short of its aspirations, disappointing its most ardent proponents. A rift is identified between the academic setting of laboratory testing and the pragmatic essence of the construction industry. This research situates itself as part of the efforts interrogating the industry limits and attempting to bridge these two spheres. It proposes to answer the following research question: What strategies capitalize on FRP’s favorable mechanical properties in order to promote formal exploration with the material in the preliminary phase of a design considering its durable and sustainable potential? This research proposes then a tool that capitalizes on the advantageous mechanical properties of FRP and encourages formal exploration in FRP at the conception phase of a design. Considering the climate change threat, the stakes of such a catalyst framework are high. The Wilhelminaberg Viewpoint, a landmark project in Landgraaf (NL) designed by Ney &amp; Partners, is used as case-study to implement the proposed framework. It also allows to draw a contrast between what is structurally feasible in FRP and what is realistically buildable in FRP. A multi-step single-objective optimization is developed. First, stiffness for a certain design boundary is maximized. Using a brute force algorithm, the first level iterates through all the possible laminate layup combinations to find the combination which generates the stiffest structure. The second level of the optimization finds the lightest geometries using a genetic algorithm. This suggested framework offers an answer to the research question, mentioned hereinabove. Completely integrated in one interface (Grasshopper 3D), the developed tool stimulates formal exploration in FRP structures exhibiting shell-like behavior. The user defines the design boundaries, design constraints, load-cases, and material properties and implements the framework.","Fiber Reinforced Polymers - FRP; Form-Finding; Structural Optimization; Evolutionary Algorithm - EA; Genetic Algorithm - GA; Alternative Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

When dispatching taxis, often only current requests are taken into account and not future ones. We examined how beneficial it can be to take coverage into account. For taxi companies it is important to keep their customers satisfied, by serving them as quickly as possible. Often companies assign the taxis to the nearest requests. We investigate whether there are better dispatch methods. We developed three dispatch policies which use ILP models, and discussed what the best option is. The first policy does not consider the coverage and minimizes the waiting times of the clients among the requests that are taking place at that moment. The second one aims to maintain a good coverage and short waiting times when assigning taxis to requests. The third one also aims to maintain a good coverage and short waiting times when assigning taxis to requests and also relocates taxis to gain a better covered area. Those policies can be a contribution for taxi companies because they help to serve clients more quickly. To determine what the best way is of dispatching taxis, we run a simulation on the different policies on a real-data map and compared the results. The literature over taxi dispatch mostly conducts research on a small area like a city or a village.

Due to the communicative turn in urban planning, collaborative planning moved up on the local and national government agenda: in 2021 the new environmental act will come into place, which firmly encourages participation in an early stage of the process. Within those participatory processes, face-to-face contact is currently indisputably the most used method. Practitioners believe that increasing the moments of contact is the best strategy to quickly reach consensus, even though only half of the participating citizens say that it indeed contributes to mutual trust and understanding. And although citizen participation is not something new in the Netherlands, its effectiveness leaves much to be desired. Despite the increase of attention for citizen engagement, the actual interaction between citizen and urban planner has not been studied extensively. Why and how to arrange a productive interaction with citizens is not clearly stated in literature nor known from practice. This leaves spatial planners with a large uncertainty on how to employ dialogue in daily practice. Therefore, the central question in this double degree thesis revolves around the face-to-face interaction between urban planners and citizens. It researches the gap between the ideal but rather theoretical concept of dialogue with citizens and the unruly reality of practice. It focuses on how the urban planner should manage the dilemmas of dialogue and how he/she could facilitate this interaction in an effective way, in order to let the process contribute to something constructive. Dialogical principles were taken as starting point and experts were consulted about dialogue in participation’s functioning in practice. The generic framework which results from this, is applied in the case of the redevelopment of Delft Campus station. That is done by developing a game for the interaction between citizens and planner, which served as input for the spatial design which followed. By developing and reflecting on these three different products - the general framework, the game and the spatial design - the thesis provides practitioners with an advice how to deal with the complex conversations which they have to deal with today.","citizen participation; collaborative planning; dialogue; urban planner-citizen interaction; communication design; Delft Zuid; Design-based research","en","master thesis","","","","","","This master thesis is a joint graduation project of MSc Architecture, Urbanism and the Building Sciences (Urbanism track) and MSc Science Education and Communication (Science Communication track), both at the Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","","51.990730, 4.364604"

Givers willingly pay dues and volunteer their time as they see it ‘as the right thing to do’ (are often from the Baby boomer generation). Takers on the other hand say “I will show up if you can show me value”. In this thesis Frame Innovation is used as the method. Problems that are characterised as being open, complex, dynamic and networked are analyse, explore and redesign with the nine steps of this method. To understand the problem, six paradoxes where developed that lead to the definition of a new problem statement: there seems to be a lack of overview and purpose in the BNO portfolio which makes the portfolio seem like a patchwork of services. This problem was translated into a design goal where the patchwork is transformed into a coherent portfolio with a clear purpose and overview in order to establish the value of the BNO more clearly. Later a core paradox was added to better understand why the problem was hard to solve: The BNO is an association, however at the same time it calls itself a professional organization. These two roles contradict each other on some important aspects. Subsequently, the context was established which represents the inner circle of stakeholders and the interpersonal relationships and value exchanges between them. The same was done for the field but then with potential stakeholders. The Context and Field helped discover the factors that underlie the needs, motivation, and experiences which are necessary to define the themes for this project. There are three main themes for this project: Representation, Value and Responsibility. These main themes are supported by four sub-themes: Sense of identification, Recognition and acknowledgement, Relationship and Centralisation versus decentralisation. What follows is the development of frames that allow for the reframing of the problem. In this thesis six frames were defined. These frames were: The BNO as 1) an educational institute, 2) a polar expedition, 3) a National Park, 4) a café, 5) a travel agency and 6) a solar system. With the themes and frames six potential futures for the BNO portfolio were developed. From this, one final frame was chosen to redesign the BNO Patchwork: the solar system. This frame allows to focus on building an emotional connection with members as the solution. It emphasizes the BNO’s whish for members to see the membership as relational based and not transactional. The solution is a portfolio framework where, by actively involving members, responsibilities are taken both by the BNO and its members. This is done through three zones of the framework that are translated into three sub-portfolios: the Team portfolio, Collective portfolio and Member portfolio. This division defines clear roles for both the BNO and its members. With the framework the BNO is able to establish a portfolio with the motto ‘An association is something you build together’ leading to more a more sustainable approach to memberships.","Portfolio Strategy; Member Involvement; Professional Association","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Hydrodynamic models are used to predict river behaviour and one of the input parameters is the river geometry. In-situ measuring of river geometry can be very expensive and time consuming. Remote sensing offers a more efficient method to monitor rivers, because it has the ability to continuously monitor the Earth surface at multiple scales. Rivers in monsoon dominated regions show a strong seasonal variation in discharge and have a high variability in morphodynamics. Therefore it is very important to have a high spatial-temporal resolution of river geometry data as input for hydrodynamic models to keep up with the changes in the river. Both optical and microwave images can be used in providing information about the river geometry. The microwave images need a lot of processing to deal with noise, but they are not limited by clouds, whereas optical sensors are troubled by clouds but produce less noise. The benefit of combining these methods is because the microwave images could fill the gap of cloud covered optical images during the monsoon. The main result from this thesis is that more investigation is needed on how to deal with the noise produced by the microwave images before the methods can be combined. Nevertheless it is shown that using the Canny Edge detector and Otsu thresholding improves the results. With this research we are a small step further in global river monitoring. This is important in particular for parts of the world where rivers are not continuously monitored because they are situated in hard to reach terrain and because the country will not invest in local gauge stations. Having more knowledge about river behaviour will help to get a better understanding of water losses along the river course, habitat change and flood risks.","remote sensing; radar; optical; landsat; sentinel; river; myanmar; monsoon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

However, not often the actual technical detailing of their reuse practice are addressed. This study is primarily focused on proposing the most suitable solutions to what concerns the reintegration of these structural second-hand parts into a “host” structure, which can contain other reused elements or can be a mixture of new and second-hand parts. The overall approach to the previously mentioned task is structured as follows: -Four structural systems have been considered to formulate the input list of elements for which re-connection approaches need to be formulated; -Connection approaches have been formulated for the elements which have been considered suitable for a potential reuse; -Selected connection methods from the ones formulated above have been studied in detail, assuming to embed them in a hypothetical office building made partially of second-hand elements. From the first part it have been assumed that common columns, shallow beams, load bearing wall panels and one way slabs such as hollow core slabs and plank-floors can be potentially reused. In the second phase several connection approaches have been formulated, highlighting briefly their constructional details and specifying their advantages and drawbacks. Some of these resulted in having different degrees of overall complexity. In any case the proposed designs are requiring more investigation before being actually put in practice, since, for some methods a significantly different design from the one used for traditional connections was used. In the last part, regarding the case study of selected jointing methods, it was chosen to address three approaches: the connection of a second-hand column to the foundation block, a splice joint on a column and a complete study of a columns-to-shallow beams node. In final result it has been deduced that, even if the feasibility regarding the use of second-hand elements requires a careful preliminary assessment and a detailed study about the cost-effectiveness of the details, the proposed connections could be potentially successfully embedded in a new structures. This point has been also confirmed by the positive output results obtained at the end of the analysis of the case-study.","circular; concrete; connections; joints; Circularity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The properties of narrowband usage, low energy consumption and universality on devices attract numerous customers and promote researchers to investigate potential of Bluetooth in indoor positioning field. It has already supported Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and Angle-of-Departure (AoD) in angle domain for indoor localization. In range domain, using Received Signal Strength (RSS) is practicable but it cannot provide enough resolution. It is needed to develop a technique that can improve resolution for range finding feature. The challenges of localization in indoor environments are mainly from the multipath propagation of signals. In this thesis, a subspace-based super-resolution algorithm for time delay dispersion estimate is developed. Range finding is realized by computing time-of-arrival (ToA) parameter of signal arriving at direct line-of-sight (DLoS). An essential procedure before the developed algorithm is applied is that to correctly separate subspace into signal space and noise space. Techniques for subspace separation are investigated in this thesis. In this thesis, we want to explore the potential of indoor localization using Bluetooth narrowband radios. To start with, a data model according to the property of the conducted measurement data is developed. The conducted measurement data is radio channel measurements based on channel sounding technique. Then the data model is developed as channel impulse response model and multipath signals are indicated by different time delays. Since an accurate covariance matrix of measurement data is required for super-resolution algorithm, smoothing techniques is employed. The smoothing techniques considered are forward smoothing technique and forward-backward smoothing technique. For the purpose of obtaining an accurate subspace separation, two techniques are investigated in this thesis, namely MDL criteria algorithm and the threshold method. in order to investigate the performance and reliability of those two techniques, experiments are taken out using different parameter values. Comparison is made between the results of these two techniques. Afterwards, subspace-based super-resolution algorithm is taken into consideration. In this thesis, the super-resolution algorithm implemented is MUSIC algorithm. The functionality of MUSIC algorithm on narrowband radios measurements is tested and evaluated firstly by simulation experiments, which demonstrates the practicability of applying MUSIC algorithm on narrowband radios measurements. Then experiments are extended to the measurement data that conducted from real indoor environments, for the purpose of indoor localization realization using narrowband radios.","Bluetooth Low Energy; indoor environments; range finding; subspace separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Such behaviour often leads to premature failure of the soils. Over the past few decades, geotechnical research community has developed numerous constitutive models to predict the behaviour of soils with variable degrees of success. The constitutive models based on the concept of bounding surface plasticity have gained much attention owing to the simplicity in describing the development of stiffness. This thesis analyzes the performance of bounding surface SANICALY model in reproducing the stress path and stress-strain behaviour of kaolin clay under undrained cyclic loading conditions . <br/>A driver was developed in MATLAB for the chosen constitutive model to simulate undrained triaxial loading conditions. The performance of the driver was verified against the data published from literature. Further, sensitivity analysis was carried out on chosen model parameters. This was followed by validating the model with the experimental data on kaolin clay. Particularly, model performance was examined with varying initial conditions such as change of over-consolidation ratio, change of initial anisotropy, variation of initial pressure and strain controlled loading. The obtained results from sensitivity analysis have shown to increase the strength and stiffness response of the model with increase in model parameters such as the rate of evolution of the anisotropy, bound for evolution of the anisotropy and change of initial stress-induced anisotropy. In the context of calibrating the model parameters against the experimental data, it was initially noticed that the experimental stress path in monotonic loading was not being reproduced by the model with various combinations of the initial parameters. Owing to such performance the model was subsequently assessed qualitatively. When the model is subjected to different initial loading conditions, certain aspects of the experimental behaviour were qualitatively captured by the model. These include faster rate of accumulation of pore water pressure with increase in the amplitude of cyclic loading, reduction in the rate of development of strains with increase in OCR values, increase in the hysteretic damping with increase in the amplitude of strains. However, with change of OCR there were differences in the development of stress path. Also contrasting results were observed with regard to the development of the stress-strain response with change of amplitude of cyclic loading and initial pressure. Analyzing the model formulations revealed that the chosen model did not take into consideration the fabric anisotropy and hence it explains the deviation of the stress path from the experimental stress path in monotonic conditions. In the chosen model, during the process of cyclic loading, stagnation in the evolution of stress path is observed whenever the plastic volumetric strains stop evolving. It is recommended to incorporate plastic deviatoric strains in the evolution of the bounding surface in order to stimulate the further development of stress path even when the plastic volumetric strains stop evolving. It is also suggested to validate the model against different clays since this thesis focused only on Kaolin clay.","constitutive modeling; bounding surface; Clay; cyclic loading; Anisotropy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-17","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The Dutch Ministry of Defense approached SenseGlove B.V., a company specialised in haptic gloves, to develop a Proof of Principle of the potential of haptic gloves in combination with Virtual Reality as a replacement for their high fidelity combat vehicle simulators. This project was split into two parts, a kinematic arm that can block the user’s motions so a person can no longer more their physical hands through digital objects, and a tactile palm strap that provides haptic feedback to the palm of the user to convey the motion of a digital steering mechanism. The kinematic arm was designed internally, and the tactile palm strap was taken as the focus of this graduation project.<br/><br/>An explorative Literature Study was conducted to find the ideal locations for haptic feedback on the human palm, as well as their corresponding types. These feedback locations and types were evaluated using a method called Interaction Prototyping. Based on the results of this study, a Lab Study was set up to evaluate three types of haptic feedback on the palm of the user. For this Study, a prototype haptic interface was made that could provide all three types of haptic feedback.<br/><br/>The outcome of the Lab Study was inconclusive because of a low sample size and many confounding factors. While the results were unsuitable to base a feedback choice on, the confounding factors resulted in valuable Design Challenges. The choice to go for vibrotactile feedback was made based on other factors such as cost, ease of production and company preference. The design challenges formed the basis for the Ideation Phase.<br/><br/>Product Ideas were generated using various creative techniques, and a Morphological Chart was made to condense the ideas into three Product Concepts.

Each module is connected to a finger, which automatically aligns the product and keeps the haptic feedback consistent during use, no matter how extreme holds their fingers or folds their hand. Signal consistency is maintained through constant skin contact. The modules can easily be attached to or detached from a Hub that is located between the SenseGlove and the back of the user’s hand.

The primary function of the FCW system is to alert an inattentive driver to a collision possible situation and prompt a mitigating action. Adaptive FCW systems have been shown to reduce unnecessary and nuisance alarms by adapting the timing of the warning to match the individual which improves trust. In evaluating the feasibility of an adaptive warning system, we examine its use case in a particular traffic scenario. The traffic scenario in this case, ‘lead vehicle turn-off’, is examined with the intention of revealing a route to reducing unnecessary and nuisance alarms. By looking at driver inputs in the lead up to this event, certain behaviours will indicate whether the driver has initiated a mitigating avoidance action. This information can be used to adjust the timing of warnings or suppress warnings when they are not required. <br/><br/>The following research questions are proposed: <br/><br/>- How do drivers of HGVs act prior to lead vehicle turn-off, specifically, is it possible to detect an effort to avoid danger prior to the presentation of a FCW?<br/><br/>- Can this information be used to support the use of an adaptive warning system which reduces unnecessary and nuisance alarms in the given traffic scenario?<br/><br/>In a case study with 262 instances of the traffic scenario of interest, 30 events were selected for statistical comparison. The 30 event cases selected contained data from 14 subjects. The results suggest that most cases some form of pre-emptive avoidance manoeuvre could be detected long before the presentation of a warning. 93% of cases showed some form of avoidance manoeuvre prior to the warning. 87% of drivers made an effort to decelerate prior to the warning, typically initiating the avoidance manoeuvre more than 7 seconds prior to the issuance of a warning. 27% of drivers carried out some form of steering avoidance prior to the warning. Given that the timing of early avoidance manoeuvres did not seem causally linked to a change in the contextual scene information and that, it would be difficult to predict exactly when the driver is likely to carry out an avoidance manoeuvre. For this reason, adjustable warning thresholds may offer little potential for improvement in the pursuit of increasing driver acceptance. The number of avoidance manoeuvres detected prior to the warning suggest that the system could be further improved by suppressing warnings if the driver is assumed to be attentive.<br","Forward Collision Warning; Nuisance alarms; Avoidance manoeuvre; Adaptive warning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Due to climate change, the Greenland ice sheet is currently losing mass at an accelerated rate. Ice sheet models are used to project long term melt of the ice sheet, which are often forced by output from climate models. Most of the multi-millennium time scale ice sheet simulations conducted in the past used SMB calculations based on empirical relationships between melt and temperature (Positive-Degree Day schemes). In this thesis, I address the question of the future evolution of the Greenland ice sheet by means of an ice sheet model forced with an elevation dependent SMB field that accounts for the energy available for melt. This work focuses on key variables such as ice thickness, ice area, velocity and contribution to eustatic sea level rise, and assesses the reversibility of the mass loss. For this thesis, I performed uncoupled CISM2.1 simulations which were forced by the elevation- SMB field from a coupled CESM-CISM simulation. The coupled simulation used to force the ice sheet has a length of 160 years and a CO2 concentration that is increased with 1% per year from pre-industrial levels and capped at 4 times CO2. Time segments with 2x, 3x and 4x pre-industrial CO2 concentrations of this CESM-CISM run were used to force the ice sheet on multi-millennium time-scales. In addition, a Recovery from 4x CO2 was conducted in which the pre-industrial forcing from a coupled CESM-CISM simulation is re-introduced after 55% mass loss. The 2x, 3x and 4x CO2 scenarios resulted in a cumulative sea level rise of 0.49 m, 3.0 m, and 8.2 m by year 4,000. The 2x CO2 scenario resulted in limited retreat and stability within 4,000 years. No stability of the ice sheet was attained by year 8,000 in the 3x CO2 simulation, with a final Mass Balance of -108.8 Gt/yr (0.30 ± mm/yr). The 4x CO2 simulation resulted in the complete deglaciation of the ice sheet within 3,000 years. Despite the lower initial topography compared to the pre-industrial ice sheet, the Recovery from 4x CO2 simulation resulted into expansion of the ice sheet. Within 4,000 years, the mass increased from 46% to 67% relative to the pre-industrial ice sheet.","Greenland; Climate Change; Future Melt Projections","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

This master thesis is focused on the investigation of aerosol trajectories inside the agricultural purifier named `ASPRA Agro', developed at VFA Solutions. Various CFD simulations have been carried out using an open-source C++ toolbox named `OpenFOAM'. The flow field was solved by carrying out axisymmetric simulations using a pressure jump boundary condition for the perforated wall. The comparison with the experimental results reveals that the axisymmetric simulations can capture the radial velocity profile gradients closely, but there is a considerable difference in velocity values. This difference has been ascribed to various factors such as wall effect due to mounting the purifier on the stand during the experiment, suction pockets due to the joints between the perforated wall. For electrostatic simulations, a very fine mesh is required, due to large gradients near corona needles. An axisymmetric simplification has been made to reduce the required computational effort, which increases the current to twice the expected value. The increase in current directly increases the particle charge. However, particle trajectories are unaffected because of negligible contribution from the electrostatics, assuming particles to be one-way coupled with the flow and electrostatics. OpenFOAM tools developed during the thesis will help in future simulations and the results obtained will aid in the further development of the purifier.","CFD; OpenFOAM; Air purifier; Electrostatic Precipitators; RANS; Lagrangian particle tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, when demand is lower, the supply temperature will be higher than necessary and heat will be wasted. In addition to this, heat production costs can be dynamic over time, which allows more cost-efficient heat production scheduling. By choosing a dynamic temperature over the day losses and operating costs can be reduced. However, determining these dynamic temperatures is not easy, as there are several factors that need to be taken into account to ensure that demand can always be fulfilled. In this research, the use of metaheuristics is explored for finding supply temperatures. Optimisation of DHS operations results in up to 5% savings with respect to typical heating curve operations.

In this thesis we explore and determine the viability of these SDKs from the perspective of the consumer. We accomplish this by conducting an experiment that lets the participants solve tasks using a web API both with and without an SDKs. Their opinions were collected and manually analysed. Several of the participants were also invited for an in-depth interview regarding their opinions on the SDKs. We concluded that autogenerated SDKs are suitable for internal use in situations with low customization of settings. We also concluded that autogenerated SDKs are not suitable for third-party use.","Software Development Kit; Web API; Autogeneration; OpenAPI; Picnic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

These elements are the underlying additions of the Order Acceptance and Scheduling with Sequence Dependent Setup Times, and introduce additional difficulties to the problem of scheduling. Given the complexity of this problem, it is surprising no evaluation of black-box approaches has been performed. This thesis investigates the applicability, strengths and weaknesses of black-box optimization approaches to various instances of this problem. Two hints were provided in order to improve performance initially. The Time hint informs the approaches of the completion time of the last order in the evaluated schedule, while the Bounds hint leaks information about the release time and deadlines of each order. Both have notable up- and downsides with regards to performance. For the identified weaknesses improvements to the most promising approach, Permutation GOMEA, are proposed and evaluated. These improvements include the addition of various local search approaches, including one derived from an exact approach. The most notable result is a new approach based of GOMEA, named qGOMEA, which shows performance beyond that of any of the evaluated algorithms, including the current state-of-the-art of the Order Acceptance and Scheduling problem. Furthermore, applicability to other permutation problems was shown by improved performance on benchmark functions.","order acceptance and scheduling; Evolutionary Algorithms; optimization algorithms; Permutation problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays an important role in accelerating the world’s transition towards sustainable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions by fossil fuels. This study focuses on the advancement of service planning, related to this renewable energy source, by researching high resolution metocean modelling. The research aims to assess and advance the modelling performance of typical metocean parameters by using atmospheric large-eddy simulations coupled to a spectral wave model. The GPU-Resident Atmospheric Simulation Platform (GRASP) coupled to Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) was used to simulate the atmospheric- and oceanic conditions in the Gemini wind farm, located in Dutch waters. Large-scale boundary- and initial conditions were provided by the fifth generation of ECMWF’s ReAnalysis (ERA5). Relevant metocean parameters were modelled using two different coupling configurations. The one-way coupled simulation concerns the forcing of SWAN by GRASP friction velocities, for an accurate representation of the one-way momentum exchange to the ocean surface. The two-way coupled simulation concerns the momentum exchange of the friction velocity and roughness length. To accurately represent the sea surface roughness, the parameterization of Taylor and Yelland (2001) was used in this study. Both coupled configurations were used to simulate the first two months of 2017, which were subsequently validated using the available observations.<br/>This study revealed that both coupled simulations caused a reduced value for the roughness length in wind- and wave wake conditions. Furthermore, a spatially averaged reduction in the sea state is observed due to the wake effect, where the magnitude of this wave deficit follows the line of a typical wind turbine thrust curve. The effect is however small compared to a realistic significant wave height. Besides, the two-way coupled simulations provided higher average roughness lengths in comparison to the one-way coupled simulations. This resulted in higher friction velocities and drag coefficients for the two-way coupled simulations, which subsequently reduced the time- and slab averaged wind profiles.<br/>Moreover, the modelling performance of SWAN improves when it is forced by GRASP friction velocities instead of ERA5 wind fields. In addition, the established two-way coupled simulation is proven to be an enhancement for the spectral wave model in comparison to the one-way coupled configuration. The performance of the atmospheric large-eddy simulation could also benefit from the two-way coupled configuration. However, it is sensitive to the implemented roughness length parameterization.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Existing buildings are not designed to withstand seismic loads and are likely to be structurally unsafe. Two storey terraced houses with concrete ﬂoors and large openings in the ground ﬂoor façade walls are onsidered vulnerable, since the in-plane behaviour of these walls is weak. This research aims to investigate the possibilities of enhancing the seismic in-plane performance of this building type with the application of timber elements. Non-linear static pushover analyses are performed to assess the in-plane behaviour according to the Dutch guidelines for the Near Collapse limit state using a macro-element modelling approach in ETABS, a 3D non-linear analysis software. Variants of the typology are studied to investigate the sensitivity to certain geometrical and structural parameters, such as the height, width and depth of a building and the applied masonry type. Based on the results, a timber strengthening design is proposed and the effect on the behaviour is studied. The majority of the un-strengthened buildings presents rocking behaviour caused by the slenderness of masonry piers due to the large openings in the façade walls. This ductile behaviour ensures relatively large lateral displacement capacities, often resulting in the satisfaction of the safety standards. Moreover, results show that structures with wide masonry piers, calcium silicate element masonry and extremely large openings at ground ﬂoor level (up until 70% of opening) are likely to be unsafe. Therefore, strengthening is required. Global capacity of the numerical models depends heavily on prescribed drift limits. Therefore, establishing the appropriate limits for each model is essential. The analysis indicates that assessment according to other guidelines, can lead to different outcomes. The proposed retroﬁt design consists of a timber framework connected to the inner masonry piers, with an OSB panel nailed on top of it to increase the stiffness. The retroﬁt is attached to the foundation by tension anchors. Gravity loading of the structure is mainly carried by the masonry elements. Implementation results in stable rocking behaviour of the piers, which ensures higher displacement capacities. Analysis demonstrates that the application of the timber retroﬁt leads to the satisfaction of the Near Collapse limit state, when higher drift limits can be prescribed. Furthermore, applying the reinforcement results in a change from unfavourable shear behaviour to rocking behaviour. However, increase of strength is limited, since the resistance of the anchors to the lateral forces is largely depending on the design of the foundation and structural elements to which they are attached. Therefore, the retroﬁt is not suitable for signiﬁcantly increasing lateral resistance, which is required for structures with extremely large openings in the façade walls. Experimental testing is recommended to quantify the increase of drift limits. An overall consistent deﬁnition of capacity values and corresponding drift limits for each possible failure mechanism is essential for reliable evaluation of the in-plane response, especially when buildings are assessed using non-linear analyses.","Unreinforced masonry structures; Timber; Retrofitting; Groningen earthquakes; ETABS; Pushover analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Lisi claims in his paper “An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything” that there is a connection between the standard model of the elementary particles and this root system. He claims that standard model has the same structure as the root system E8. If this is true, there must be a mapping from the standard model to E8. This map must identify each elementary particle with an unique root of E8. Also the four charges (weak isospin, weak hypercharge, g3 and g8) of the standard model must have corresponding vectors in R8. These four charge vectors must have the property that taking the inner product of the charge vector and the root identified withan elementary particle, it would result in the charge of that particle. This is needed to guarantee that we have conservation of charge. In this paper we have shown that it is not possible to find a map with four charge vectors. This was done by studying root systems and how different root systems are present in E8 as sub root systems. We also proved that the intersection of E8 with the orthogonal complement of a charge, must be a root system. This limits the possibilities for the charge vectors.

Many empirical models of different complexity are proposed in theliterature; however, (i) they all have below high (R2 =0.85) predictiveaccuracy; (ii) they are inflexible; and (iii) their prediction uncertainty isseldom quantified. This M.Sc. thesis aspires to overcome these three majorchallenges. It focuses on the prediction of three important mechanicalproperties of asphalt mixes: stiffness, resistance to permanent deformation,and indirect tensile strength (ITS). The used data are part of the NL-Labproject and represent six road work projects for asphalt concrete bottom andintermediate layers. The number of data points available for the threeproperties ranges from 100 to 400. Two approaches are used to predict thefunctional properties: multiple linear regression (MLR), and a machine learningtechnique: gradient boosting (GB). For both approaches the root-mean-squareerror is used as loss function and 5-fold cross-validation is applied to ensurea balanced fit. It is demonstrated on the NL-Lab dataset that (i) GB canachieve high and very high predictive accuracy; (ii) it is sufficientlyflexible to capture complex non-linear relationships; and (iii) its predictionuncertainty is low and can be estimated at the same computational cost asfitting a GB model. The predictive accuracy of the GB model significantlyoutperforms that of the MLR. For example, for stiffness: R2GB = 0.96 vs. R2MLR= 0.62, and for ITS: R2GB = 0.82 vs. R2MLR = 0.72. It is shown that the averagestandard deviation of the prediction uncertainty of the GB model is less thanhalf than that of the MLR model. Based on the completed analyses GB is stronglyrecommended over MLR for modelling asphalt concrete functional properties. Tothe author’s knowledge, this work is the first application of GB to modelasphalt concrete functional properties and the first that developed high andvery high predictive accuracy models for these properties. The results arepromising and encouraging further research into this subject.   ","Gradient Descent algorithm; Predictive Modeling; asphalt concrete; decision tree; uncertainty quantification; pavement engineering; Regression analysis; Machine Learning; Data analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Osteoarthritis has the highest prevalence of all knee complaints. Knee osteoarthritis is likely to start at the patellofemoral joint and is associated with the aggravation of pain. Mechanical overloading is hypothesized to contribute to the development and progression of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Several studies have explored the mechanical loading pattern of the patellofemoral joint. Because different biomechanical models were used, vastly different estimations of the patellofemoral joint contact force (PFJCF) were concluded. This diversity prevents a clear understanding of the role of mechanical overloading in PFOA, since it is unknown how different biomechanical models affect the PFJCF estimation. OBJECTIVES: This study will explore how different biomechanical models of the patellofemoral joint affect the estimated PFJCF for common weight-bearing activities. METHODS: Ten healthy participants were included in this study. Common weight-bearing activities (walking, stair ascending, stair descending, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit) were performed in the motion lab. Marker trajectory data and force plate data were collected. The data were input to biomechanical models used to estimate the quadriceps muscle force and subsequently the PFJCF. The quadriceps muscle force was estimated using the inverse dynamics and static optimization method. From there on, the PFJCF was estimated using three PFJCF to quadriceps muscle force ratios (P2QFRs), each based on a different patellofemoral joint model (i.e. van Eijden’s model, Yamaguchi’s model and Gill’s model). For each weight-bearing activity, the peak PFJCF was obtained and the magnitude of the difference among the biomechanical models was explored. RESULTS: The static optimization method resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to the inverse dynamics method in walking (largest effect size was 0.10 BW). However, for stair descending, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, the inverse dynamics method resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to the static optimization method (largest effect size was 0.45 BW, 1.17 BW, 1.25 BW, respectively). No significantly difference was found for stair ascending. For walking, Yamaguchi’s model resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to van Eijden’s model and Gill’s model, and van Eijden’s model resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to Gill’s model (largest effect size was 0.06 BW). For stair ascending, stair descending, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, Gill’s model resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to van Eijden’s model and Yamaguchi’s model. For stair descending the van Eijden’s model resulted in a significantly higher peak PFJCF compared to Yamaguchi’s model. The largest effect size was 0.15 BW, 0.32 BW, 0.72 BW and 0.72 BW, for respectively stair ascending, stair descending, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. CONCLUSION: The choice of a biomechanical model has a critical effect on the estimation of the magnitude of the PFJCF. Its differences might reach half the clinical size effects when comparing control to symptomatic PF pain patients.","Patellofemoral joint contact force; Knee osteoarthritis; Inverse dynamics; Static optimization; patellofemoral joint contact force to quadriceps muscle force ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This condition raises the importance of Deep-Sea Mining (DSM) as an option to fulfill the global demands, for the sake of future ambitious projects. On the other hand, DSM still faces some drawbacks and obstacles in its operations, e.g. environmental impact of its tailings discharge. Thus, the presence of tools for predicting the behavior and environmental impact of DSM tailings becomes crucial for the sake of conducting sustainable DSM operations. Researches, both numerical and laboratory experiments, are then done to achieve this goal. In the study of DSM tailings behavior through numerical simulation, the challenge lies in the ability to implement the complex physics phenomena around DSM plumes to a numerical model. This research is thus aimed to observe one of the parts of the so-called physical phenomena, and numerical constraints on the simulation of DSM plumes: the effects of implementing arbitrary non-orthogonal mesh. Arbitrary non-orthogonal mesh would give users the freedom to refine the mesh based on the required resolution on a certain area in the simulation domain. In this research, an arbitrary non-orthogonal mesh is constructed forming a domain geometry of 3D tank with round pipe as a source of tailings discharge, adapting the laboratory setup of Byishimo (2018). Mesh refinement is done around the pipe discharge area, where the jet mainstream expected to occur, and near the bottom, where settling of solids fraction and high velocity-gradients are expected to occur. Top-hat approximation theory is then used for defining the inlet boundary condition of the simulation domain, and smooth solid wall is used for the bottom boundary. In observing the effect of arbitrary mesh, two parameters are varied: solids settling rate, and differentiation scheme. Following this, six simulation cases are prepared, containing three solids-settling conditions (minimum, realistic, and extreme solids fraction settling) and two differentiation schemes (Gauss Gamma and Gauss Linear). These cases are then simulated using the CFD drift-flux model in OpenFOAM for two incompressible fluids, with ambient fluid and tailings mixture as the two incompressible fluids. Turbulence is modeled using LES method, with Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) LES model for modeling the subgrid-scale of the turbulence. Two simulated field variables are picked to be observed and compared with the laboratory measurement data: flow velocities and local Suspended Solids Concentration (SSC). Simulations show that the constructed domain able to generate stable results using not only Gauss Gamma differencing scheme but also Gauss Linear, which originally expected to give unbounded results. From simulations with various solids settling conditions, it is analyzed that the implementation of solids settling using the mentioned function leads to constant settling rate with inability to re-suspend the settled solids. Thus, simulation of cases with extreme solids settling leads to hyper-concentration of solids fraction in the cells on the bottom. The top-hat profile of the inlet boundary condition is constantly sustained throughout the simulation, resulting in uniform jet vertical velocity profile. The simulations also show that momentum-driven jet-like flow can be observed around the impingement point, while gravity current generated further from the impingement point. The simulation results show that the mesh refinement is enabling simulating and validating the flow with the required resolutions. Moreover, the constructed domain also shows that Gauss Linear can be used for simulating DSM plumes, furthermore using full tank domain. The simulated SSC also turns out not only affected by the simulation domain and mesh, but also the differencing scheme, and the presence of settling and pick-up functions.","CFD; Deep-sea mining; Non-orthogonal mesh; tailings plume; buoyant-jet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The awareness of this long existing problem is rising among consumers and policy makers. Although over decades many professionals in various areas of expertise have worked on improvements and tried to find solutions, these solutions all involve trade-offs. An ideal zero waste, circular status in which the world’s resources are preserved and their value is maintained has not been reached yet. New solution spaces need to be discovered, which seems like an impossible job within this already much discussed issue. The present project starts out from the thesis statement that there are still ‘voids’ to be discovered in the entirety of solution possibilities. A ‘void’ is defined as a solution space that is not deployed because it is undiscovered, not because it is considered un-useful. Traditional design ways of problem solving use ideation techniques to come up with different concepts from which the best one is selected. By selecting solutions in this way, solution spaces and possibilities may be overlooked. Going beyond the traditional design problem solving techniques, this research uses a technique based on abstracting physical working principles of solutions, borrowed from the field of biomedical engineering. By combining problem solving techniques from different engineering disciplines, a systematic overview of solution spaces is created exposing undeployed solution spaces. In the subsequent phase, the undeployed solution spaces are investigated further to see if there are actual ‘voids’ among them. The overview is used to create an innovative solution concept by first clustering the solution spaces in workable solution directions to reduce complexity. By an iterative process of ideating and research, a solution space is selected. Taking the complex interconnected boundary conditions into account – such as the demanding consumer, the profit desiring retailers and the different types of environmental impact –, solution concepts are developed within the selected solution space from which one is selected as final solution concept. The final solution concept implies separating the presentation function of food packaging from the disposable packaging and shifts the function to a reusable element. The solution concept is developed into an example application: a new packaging is designed for prepacked stuffed wraps. The new packaging is user tested and adapted in an iterative process, based on the test results, until it has shown its potential. Thus, the created systematic overview is verified to uncover at least one ‘void’ and holds the possibility to contain more. This project aims to contribute to reducing the negative environmental impact of on-the-go food packaging by showing that is worthwhile to search beyond existing solution directions. The created packaging concept plays both ways: by being part of the theoretical void finding process in verifying the overview and by being part of a practical solution in reducing the amount of single use material. The application of this concept can be explored further in future research.","Food; Packaging; sustainabilty; Solution Space; Environmental impact; Consumer behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The aim of the project is to investigate ways by which KLM can change the perception of passengers during a disruption event such as flight delays, cancellations, and missed connections. In order to accomplish this, the Double Diamond approach was used along with the addition of an envisioning phase based on the inside-out process of meaning innovation pioneered by Roberto Verganti (Verganti, 2016). KLM is one of the world's oldest airlines that still operate with their original name. Their ambition is to become Europe’s most customer-centric, innovative and efficient network carrier by offering memorable experiences by leveraging new market opportunities and technological developments to deliver superior customer service. KLM has done extensive research and examined and identified certain gaps in their customer journey experience to focus on and improve. One of the key gaps identified is disruption handling. KLM projects almost 4.5 million passengers to be affected by disruptions in 2019 (KLM, 2019). During a disruption, passengers experience increased stress and seek guidance and quick resolutions to their problems. A disruption is a sudden event and that passengers do not have control over it. Thus the only way they will feel some sense of control is if they have information about it, information that is transparent and information that will help them take their next steps. In fact, one of the core customer needs gathered from research is the receiving of proactive information in the event of a disruption. Regardless of the cause of the disruption, passengers are usually quick to blame the airlines for the negative situation. Therefore, effective communication might help in reducing that perception and might generate a positive sentiment about the airline. According to KLM’s own disruption communication mandate, passengers should receive information that is consistent, relevant, contextual, personalized and transparent at the right time. However, that is sometimes not the case. KLM uses a number of communication channels to provide information. However, most often, all these pieces of information are not consistent, relevant, personalized or on time. In addition, as per the KLM compass and their new emphasis on customer intimacy, KLM wants to show passengers that they care about them, that passengers feel recognized, comfortable and touched. However, these particular aspects of customer intimacy do not translate to the information that the passenger is being sent. Therefore, the tone of voice, the nature of the information ( helpful, not helpful, feed-forward ) also makes a big difference in how passengers perceive KLM as a brand. In order to make all information more coherent and consistent across all channels and touchpoints, there was a need to evolve a communication structuring, design, and dissemination framework which effectively and consistently delivers the most relevant informational content as expected and desired by passengers under conditions of flight disruption and otherwise. Thus, The Asix structure for information content was created to unify all the information content. The Asix structure provides guidelines as to how the information should be structured along with giving guidelines about the tone of voice of the message as well. In essence, messages designed on the basis of the Asix structure make the passengers feel more recognized, acknowledged and seem to be more sincere and heartfelt which positively influences their perception about KLM and their situation as well, thereby increasing their trust in KLM and their belief that KLM truly cares for them. This is a good positive step towards positively changing the perception of the passengers during a disruption.","Service Design; Interaction Design; customer experience; Disruptions; Perception; Information Content","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The spherical symmetry of a spherical nanoparticle in solution is exploited by modelling a laterally periodic water column of an initial length of 500 Angstrom enclosed between a planar iron(III) oxide nanoparticle surface and a graphene piston. A cavitation bubble is formed after nanoparticle heating, leading to an increase of clustered ions according to a bond order criterion. The clustering should correspond to nucleation in experimental systems because the clusters satisfy Delta G &lt; 0 for locally valid NPT ensembles. The results corroborate concentration based NPLIN mechanisms as the clustering is visibly induced by local solute evaporation. Pressure based mechanisms appear ineffective because no effects of pressure waves are observed. Thermostatting the graphene sheet does not yield observable dissipation of the thermal energy generated through the nanoparticle heating and at the ion clustering sites and, obstructing completion of the cavitation cycle at a feasible simulation duration. It is suggested to repeat the simulations using a conically shaped system and a piston of higher transverse thermal conductivity.","non-photochemical; laser; nucleation; crystallisation; molecular; dynamics; simulation; electrolytes; clustering; nanoparticle; solution; potassium; chloride","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Its location makes it typhoon prone and on average around 20 typhoons enter the country every year (Asian Disaster Reduction Center, 2008). This natural phenomenon can have disastrous effects and therefore, good preparedness is of special importance. Traditionally weather forecasts have been used in order to predict the physical characteristics of typhoons to organise early actions that can dampen their damage. However, regardless the good meteorological forecasts, typhoons kept having large effects in coastal areas, due to the gap of knowledge between a hazard and its impact. For this reason, nowadays disaster managers are increasingly more interested in the knowing the repercussion of natural hazards, which can help to prepare and mitigate their consequences (Tozier de la Poterie et al., 2018).<br/>Although forecasts that predict the impact of hazards, the so-called impact-based forecasts, are rising, there are not many of these systems operationalised yet. To make these forecasts more functional it is essential to understand what their users’ needs are. Because disaster managers work under stressful conditions, it is crucial to have the right information in order to take effective actions. This research has developed an impact-based forecasting prototype for Manila Bay, Philippines, considering the information needs of disaster managers. In order to do so, an iterative process has been followed in the creation of the system, in which disaster managers provided their inputs and feedbacks on the prototype. The impacts on the assets of relevance for the disaster managers have been forecasted with the use of Delft-FEWS and Delft-FIAT. Furthermore, this forecasting system has been novel in predicting the impact of typhoons considering not only the hazard and exposure but also implementing the vulnerabilities of the affected area. The findings of this study suggest that an impact-based forecasting system for Manila Bay should provide information on the affected population, livelihoods, hospitals, roads and schools. Those assets have been pointed out as most important for disaster managers at local scale. The output of the forecasting system should provide actionable results that allow disaster managers to make quick and relevant decisions. Furthermore, the data displayed in the system should be simple, clear and with colour codes that allow for a fast interpretation of the results and provide maps with information of the impacts on all the assets per municipality or province. Besides, it has been observed that vulnerability plays an important role when prioritising the action areas of disaster managers. The aim of this research was to develop an impact-based forecasting system that considers the information and display needs of disaster managers, while integrating the vulnerabilities of the affected area. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was not to develop an accurate mathematical model that provides the exact impact. Instead, it is a guide of what a disaster managers-based forecast should provide. Hence, in order to make this forecasting system operational, validation of the prototype and consideration of other hazards, such as wind speeds, are recommended.","Impact-based forecasting; Vulnerability; Storm surge; Disaster managers; Typhoons; Impact; Hazard; Exposure; Decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","14.5995, 120.9842"

The largest improvements in recovery take place during the _rst half year after stroke. With more knowledge about neurological recovery, it may be possible to predict motor recovery after stroke with the use of neurological biomarkers. Prediction of stroke recovery can be used in the selection and development of rehabilitation therapies. By applying continuous perturbations to a joint with the use of a robotic manipulator during di_erent control tasks, the evoked cortical responses of the sensorimotor cortex can be studied. With this method, evaluating the relation between EEG activity and motor function of the upper limb may provide meaningful EEG biomarkers for motor recovery after stroke. Methods A selection of 13 sub-acute stroke patients who participated in the 4D EEG project were longitudinally measured four times during the _rst half year after stroke. EEG was measured during relax, position and force tasks while a robotic wrist manipulator applied continuous perturbations to the a_ected wrist. The upper limb part of the Fugl-Meyer assesment (FMA) was used to asses the upper limb motor function. The index of the signal-to- noise ratio (iSNR) was obtained from the EEG data. Results The FMA score was strongly related to time post stroke. Also, FMA score during the _rst measurement was lower than during the second, third and fourth. The iSNR was lower during the position task than during the relax and force tasks. A moderate relation was found between the FMA score and the iSNR during the position task, but not during the relax and force task. Conclusion The iSNR during the position task is potentially a EEG biomarker for upper limb motor recovery after stroke. 1","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It can provide design freedom allowing complex geometries, as well as customization, among other benefits. However, there is no research on 3D printing of hydraulic piston-cylinder systems. The aim of this article is to check the feasibility of 3D printing a hydraulic piston-cylinder system, as well as quantifying its performance. Methods: The same design was utilized for different 3D printing processes (Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA) and Selective Laser Melting) and materials (Polylactic Acid (PLA), resin and Titanium), in order to be compared with each other and with conventional manufacturing of a system in Aluminum. Also, a second version of each piston-cylinder system was printed to use a reamer on them, to compare the performance between the cylinders with and without reaming. The followed methodology consisted of performing static and dynamic tests for each of the actuators. The output of the static test was the maximum fluid pressure that the system can handle. With the dynamic test a more realistic situation could be tested, from which the friction could be deducted and its results could be compared to the theoretically calculated data. Results: The results showed that the best performing 3D printed option was the reamed SLA resin version, reaching pressures of at least 4~MPa, with a dynamic friction force of 6.6~N, a stick-slip friction force of 9.9~N and a weight of 28~g. These features led to a force-to-weight ratio of 2928, only surpassed by the lighter FDM printed PLA actuator, reaching a value of 3565, but with higher friction forces. Conclusion: The conducted research means a first step towards the 3D printing of hydraulic piston-cylinder systems, demonstrating that it is possible to reach high pressures without leakage. The features that additive manufacturing offers, such as lighter and customized geometries in one assembly step, can benefit application fields where hydraulic piston-cylinders are used, such as prosthetic devices.","3D print; Actuator; Hydraulic cylinder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Roads are designed for the current traffic composition. Due to the promotion of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems, utilisation of these systems is expected to increase. Society benefits from insights into the effects these systems have on traffic flow, as they can help to reduce traffic jams and accidents. ACC systems are designed to increase driving comfort by taking over throttling and braking from the human driver. For optimal driver acceptance, these systems show similar driving behaviour to that of human drivers. However, this is not entirely possible due to limited anticipation. To predict how differences in driving behaviour affect traffic flows, researchers usually perform simulations using parametric car-following models. However, research shows contradictory findings. The goal of this research was to gain insights into the performance of commonly applied parametric car-following models on representing the driving behaviour of ACC systems. Optimal model calibration was obtained by investigating the sensitivity of the model calibration to synthetic data. Investigated were the calibration methodology and the quality and quantity of calibration data. Models are calibrated to real-world driving data from an Audi A4 from 2017. These models were used to assess the capability of representing typical highway scenarios: steady-state car-following, cut-in, cut-out, hard-braking and stop-and-go scenarios. The considered models were the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) model, which has previously been applied to model the driving behaviour of human drivers, the newly developed simplified ACC (sACC) model and a variant on this model. Insights in the sensitivity of the model calibration were obtained by performing a sensitivity analysis on synthetic data. Essential factors in achieving an optimal model calibration are: 1) the model closely matches the driving behaviour in the data, 2) noise levels are as low as possible and 3) the data should contain as many situations as possible that are also included in the model. The dataset must be sufficiently long to include all these situations and to allow the model to develop its dynamics entirely. Using these insights, a calibration was performed on real-world ACC driving data from an Audi A4 (2017). For the ACC system, it was found: 1) the ACC system exhibits non-linear driving behaviour, 2) the acceleration depends on the current velocity and distance to the desired velocity, 3) the system does not consider an intelligent braking strategy and is thus not able of handling safety-critical driving situations and 4) the model includes a sub-controller which ensures comfortable driving behaviour. Except for the comfortable sub-controller, the non-linear IDM model considers all of these factors and thus best represents the driving behaviour. The linear sACC model cannot represent standing conditions, which is resolved in the alternative version. The linearity allows for a better representation of the behaviour of the comfortable sub-controller. However, it disallows for an accurate representation of the dynamics by the models.<br","ACC; Adaptive Cruise Control; Car-Following Models; Model Calibration; Calibration; Parametric; Rijkswaterstaat; IDM; Intelligent Driver Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The controller is designed for the highly maneuverable and tailless innovative control effectors (ICE) aircraft, which has a control suite of 13 nonlinear, interacting and axis-coupled effectors. The least mean squares (LMS) method is used to estimate a delta control effectiveness Jacobian (CEJ) based on the difference between the expected and measured accelerations of the aircraft. This delta CEJ model is then added to the onboard spline CEJ model to achieve fault tolerance. By keeping the nominal spline model intact the nonlinearities and interactions of the effectors remain modeled, while the LMS estimator allows for fast adaptation. Simulations for four different maneuvers and failure cases showed that the estimator is able to stabilize the aircraft for the most demanding maneuver. For two less demanding maneuvers the adaptive controller greatly reduced the control effort while keeping the tracking error similar to the non-adaptive controller. For the remaining fourth maneuver, which operates in a flight region with the most significant interactions and nonlinearities, the adaptive controller had a reduced performance compared to the nonadaptive controller. A sensitivity analysis showed that the choice of design parameters greatly influences the results, and no general set of best performing parameters was found.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-11","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As a matter of fact, the growth of nc-Si:H on a flat c-Si substrate is not uniformas it irregularly peels off after deposition using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). On the other hand, the growth of the nc-Si:H TF layers on the standard alkaline textured c-Si substrate with sharp pyramidal structures results in defective regions in the bulk of nc-Si:H grown material. A nc-Si:H layer with high defect density reduces the voltage and the fill factor (FF) of the tandem device. In order to minimize the defect density in the nc-Si:H absorber layer, different texturing approaches (TA) were developed for the c-Si<br/>wafer to facilitate better growth of the nc-Si:H absorber. The surface morphology of the textured c-Si wafers for all TA’s at different etching time steps were investigated. Prior to TF layer deposition for the SHJ and the tandem devices, various cleaning approaches were investigated to improve the surface passivation of the textured c-Si wafers. The investigation of the grown nc-Si:H layer using different TA’s showed that smoothening of the sharp pyramidal structures significantly improved the nc-Si:H grown bulk as it helped in better growth of nc-Si:H with no significant defects. Finally, the current density-voltage (J-V) measurements were investigated for all TA’s for the SHJ and the tandem devices. The best performing tandem cell has an open circuit voltage (Voc ) of 1.02 V , short current density (Jsc ) of 13.34 mA/cm-2 and a FF of 0.44.

The first is to gain a deeper understanding of the needs of the elderly with dementia that causes undesired behaviour or Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia, such as wandering during the night. The second purpose is to design CloudCuddle Senior: a lightweight and inflatable bed tent that keeps patients up to 120 kg in bed and creates a feeling of safety in various use cases such as home, caring home or the hospital. Data for this thesis were gathered by doing a literature study, making rapid prototypes and doing qualitative user tests. These methods generated knowledge for two sub-sections of the CloudCuddle Senior Design. The challenge of the Structural Design part was to come up with a bed tent concept that will be stiff enough to keep patients up to 120kg in bed while being lightweight to ensure mobility and consider nursing activities in and around the bed. The Experience Design of CloudCuddle Senior is about creating a safe and comfortable experience in bed that take the needs of people with dementia into account. The literature research results provide the support that patients with dementia need dynamic stimuli. However, research often focuses and compares mainly the type or the meaning of the stimuli such as Snoezelen, light therapy and music therapy while intensity through pace and amplitude often forgotten. More research into the intensity of therapeutic activities may conclude that designers of new interventions should focus on creating an intensity of dynamic stimuli that matches the patients need instead of focusing on the type of stimuli. A concept design is proposed based on the results of the Structural and Experience Design research. One of CloudCuddle’s bed tent’s significant characteristics is its inflatable structure. Although it was tried to design a more stiff design through solely inflatable elements, hard materials are required to meet the requirement of keeping 120kg patients in bed. The results on research from an Experience Design perspective implies that a bed tent that impairs vision on all sides except on one side offers a sense of safety while still being connected to the room in which the patients sleeps and a sense of control. The results of both the Structural and Experience Design research are combined in a final concept design for CloudCuddle Senior that should be prototyped and tested on strength and experience.","bed; tent; dementia; wandering; sleep; elderly; BPSD; behavioral; psychosocial; therapy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Flooding is globally one of the most damaging natural hazard. Flood risk will most likely increase in the near future due to increases in flood frequency attributed to climate change and growth in population and wealth in flood prone areas. This growth in wealth and population is increasingly considered as a major driver for the increase in flood losses in the last decades. Floodplains are susceptible to floods, but historically people have always been settling in floodplains. The growth of population in floodplains, which is a substantial cause for increased flood risk, is essential to consider for decision making in floodplain development, as improper development increases flood exposure and aggravates flood risk. The science of socio-hydrology tries to capture the interaction between humans and floods in the floodplain. But, it is necessary to identify these mechanisms on a broader scale. A way of doing this, is to look at the development of floodplain population density over the years, but population data is not available on a long temporal scale. Therefore, Nighttime light data was used to model the gaps in the availability of population data. Nighttime light data data captures the illumination on earth, and is available on a large temporal and spatial scale, and has a high correlation with population data. However, the relationship between Nighttime light data and population data is not straightforward. This study tries to model a population proxy through the use of Nighttime light data data and explains when and why it does or does not work. Validation of the model shows that in some regions the predicted data is relatively precise, but ultimately, due to the lack of data, the accuracy is unknown. This study shows that understanding the behaviour of NTL is valuable, because it has the potential to map Socio-Economic variables in data-scarce areas.","Socio-hydrology; Floodplains; Nighttime Light Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Lending out money is associated with the risk that debtors are not able to fully or partially repay the loans. This is called credit risk. Banks have to make an estimate of the credit risk in their portfolios and have to keep reserves for potential losses. The way this risk is to be determined, is decided by the government where the bank is established. In Europe, the United States, Russia, China among others, the legislation on credit risk is derived from Basel III. Basel III is an international framework to homogenise banking regulation across the world. There are three important factors to determine credit risk In Basel III, namely Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default. In this thesis I investigate Probability of Default (PD) modelling. The size of the portfolio, for which the Probability of Default has to be estimated, can vary greatly. When the amount of defaults in a portfolio is low and the amount of explanatory variables is high, there is a risk of overfitting. Variable selection methods can be used to counteract overfitting and give understanding of the important predictors. I apply variable selection methods on on a logistic regression. I look at three Frequentist variable selection methods, namely Forward Selection, Lasso and Relaxed Lasso. I compare these three methods with Predictive Projection combined with a Horseshoe prior, which is a Bayesian approach to variable selection. Forward Selection starts with only the intercept in the model and adds variables one by one to the model. The variables are added in such a way that each step increase the estimated performance the most. The Horseshoe prior and Lasso Regression are types of regularisation, where the estimates of the regression coefficients of the logistic regression get shrunk to zero. In Lasso regression, this is done by adding a L1 penalty of the regression coefficients to the logistic regression. This causes weak signals to be pulled to zero. Lasso shrinks all regression coefficients to zero to some degree, even those with a strong signal.<br/>Lasso can also be used to and an order of importance for the regression coefficients by varying the strength of the L1 penalty. Regression coefficients are set to zero one-by-one as the penalty increases. Relaxed Lasso uses this rank and refits the variables without regularisation.<br/>In Bayesian statics, regularisation is added via the prior. The Horseshoe prior can adjust to the average sparsity in the model and the Horseshoe prior either shrinks a signal aggressively to zero, or leaves the signal almost unchanged. The posterior of the model is never truly sparse. Predictive Projection can induce sparsity by setting the Monte Carlo samples of the posterior to zero for certain variables. This is done in such a way that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the full posterior and the projected sparser posterior is minimised. I investigate the behaviour of the variable selection methods. The main focus is on the predictive performance, the sparsity, the computation time and the reliability of the estimated performance for the selected models. I apply the methods to various types of simulated data to compare the variable selection methods. The simulated data consist of data with independent predictors, collinear predictors and non-normal predictors, among others. The simulations studies show that Lasso and Predictive Projection lead to models with the highest performance overall and the predictive performance is more stable over different realisation of the data. For the same performance the Predictive Projection produces models with less variables. This makes Predictive Projection the most attractive method. I also employ the techniques to FreddieMac data, which is a data set on single-family mortgages. The results are similar to the simulated data and Predictive Projection with the Horseshoe prior is the most attractive variable selection method. Both the simulation studies and the FreddieMac application imply that the estimated performance of the Predictive Projection and Lasso are better than those of Forward Selection and Relaxed Lasso. However, the behaviour of the estimated performance remain unclear to a certain degree. More simulations per data type and more data types are needed for more insight into the estimated performance. Additional resources are needed to achieve this.","Horseshoe prior; Predictive Projection; Probability of Default; variable selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This is the case within the Netherlands, where the use of the internet has a pervasive influence on society, necessitating robust telecommunication networks and services. The telecommunications industry is regulated by the Radiocommunication Agency Netherlands, which currently use a method of risk-based regulation to monitor relevant organizations. This is characterised by allocating resources based on the estimated level of risk that is posed by a monitored organization. While these risk analyses have developed over the years, there is no standardised system heightening the possibility for cross-departmental inconsistencies. An overview of academic literature reveals a lack of research on the creation and implementation of data-driven model for risk-based regulation. Existing studies lean towards the merits of risk-based regulation, in addition to the risks associated with data-driven risk-based regulations. When this literature gap is compounded with the rising pressure for the regulator to perform quality supervision and ensure the uninterrupted continuity of the telecommunication networks and services in the Netherlands, it provides a suitable opportunity to explore the applicability of a data-driven solution. The use of data-driven risk detection models have the potential to identify companies that pose higher social risks to create a more efficient process for the allocation of resources. It can illuminate the relevant risk criteria and characterise the risks that certain organizations may pose. This information supports the decision-making process of regulation, which could lead to a more cost-effective process of supervision. Furthermore, given the inconsistencies that exist between the various supervisory divisions of the Radiocommunication Agency Netherlands, a data-driven model could increase internal cohesiveness. As a result, there is significant interest in the possibility of developing a risk detection model that can be adapted to the current organizational structure and makes use of the readily available data within the organization. The research objective of this study is to create and implement an exploratory data-driven model for risk-based regulation, specifically on the subject the continuity of the telecommunication networks and services within the Supervisory Field of Information Security of the Radiocommunication Agency Netherlands. Thus, the primary research question that will be explored is: How could a data-driven risk analysis for risk-based regulation support the process of risk-based regulation executed by experts? There are four primary challenges to the creation and implementation of data-driven models: the ability to turn data into useful information, the ability to assess the quality of the data, the availability of the data within the organization and the ability to create a process with a high cost-effectiveness ratio. Additionally, there are specific issues associated with the use of data-driven models in regulatory bodies. Firstly, the use of algorithms and data metrics can be distorted when applied incorrectly. In addition, this who create data-driven models or use the outcomes of the model are prone to interpret the data so that it will fit the pre-existing narratives The second issue is implementing the data-driven model so that it generates acceptance and can be integrated into a well-functioning working culture within the organization. The research utilizes data that is sourced from two different departments of the Radiocommunication Agency Netherlands; survey responses from supervised organization and self-reported data regarding network incidents. The final data source consists of social media mentions naming network failures of monitored organizations. The development of an Exploratory Model based on the available data within the organization highlighted several modelling challenges. The process of developing the Exploratory Model is preceded by an Exploratory Data Analysis which determines the quality and significance of the available data. This allows for a summary of the main characteristics of the data and supports the development of the Exploratory Model. The Exploratory Model involves clustering the data, and developing correlations between the various datasets. The execution of a K-means algorithm segments the organizations into groups that provide similar responses to the surveys. The correlations can be used for facilitating the initiation of risk profiles. The data from network incidents and failures are highly important when creating a model for data-driven risk-based regulation as they are key in defining the different risks posed by supervised organizations. The results are validated through interviews with experts of the relevant divisions in the Radiocommunication Agency Netherlands. Two primary challenges that exist for the implementation of the model are identified; ensuring all necessary data is available for the creation of the model, and defining the owner of the model. The existence of an institutional boundary between the Supervision Division Information Security and the Spectrum Division Continuity, which hinders data sharing regarding the reports of failures that caused discontinuities of the telecommunication services and networks. This poses challenges for the implementation of a data-driven model, as it is crucial for the relevant teams to have access to all necessary data within the organization. There are two possible solutions to overcome this challenge; either dismantling the institutional boundary, or relocating the data management of reports of failures that caused discontinuities of the telecommunication services and networks from the Spectrum Division Continuity to the Supervision Division on Information Security. The second challenge is defining the most suitable owner of the model. As the model is intended to support regulation for the Supervision Division on Information Security, it is necessary for the owner to have expertise in this area. Moreover, as this will be a data-based model, knowledge on quantitative analyses is preferable. Currently, the Monitoring &amp; Analysis Centre of Radiocommunication Agency is most suitable, due to their expertise in analysing data and working on data-driven models. Moreover, they already have access to all necessary data, which means no organizational restructuring is needed. However, there will be challenges stemming from their lack of knowledge regarding the process of supervision on the continuity of the telecommunication networks and services. Two directions for future research are identified based on the outcomes of this research. The first step would be to further develop the Exploratory Model, which requires a higher volume of information about failures that caused discontinuities. In addition, the data currently within the databases must be frequently updated. Whilst this is certainly viable, it would be a time intensive and a bureaucratic process. In the meantime, it is possible to execute the clustering algorithm on the whole dataset of both of the surveys with the responses from around 1000 organizations and to compound this with qualitative data from experts and inspectors within the Supervision Division Information Security, to aid in the determination of the risk profiles.","data-driven risk-based regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The changes that come along with this evolution include several aspects such as the introduction of variable energy generation from renewable sources, changes in the network's topology, storage, new regulation policies, liberalization of markets, constant trading of electrical energy between countries among others. These changes, combined with a context of growing demand and aging network infrastructure can result in more stressed power systems, uncertainty and potentially more risks that could lead to blackouts. These new conditions have to be taken into account when assessing the reliability of the transmission system in order to have a complete insight of what is happening in the network and to identify potential causes of problems. This thesis provides a methodology using state enumeration to assess reliability in the transmission network in the context of long term planning using a probabilistic approach with the aim to identify potential improvements for current practices based on deterministic approaches. This methodology considers three main aspects: i) Failure probabilities of individual components (i.e transmission lines) based on historical data and operational conditions. The failure probability originated from operational conditions is obtained by combining expert's opinion and available data by applying Bayesian data analysis; ii) Contingency selection to obtain a representative list of contingencies to be analyzed. The screening of contingencies for the list is performed based on the failure probabilities and accepting a certain level of residual risk. The residual risk is calculated by assuming a lost load and finding the probability of the contingency that leads to that lost load; iii) Determination of the effect and the associated risk of contingencies. The purpose of this part is to quantify line overloadings in terms of money to obtain the total cost linked to a certain set of contingencies.The monetization of the effect is performed by using a value of lost load (VoLL). This monetization is first performed without the implementation of re-dispatch actions assuming that overload is lost load. Later on, re-dispatch actions for conventional generators are considered, the new cost of re-dispatch plus lost load is obtained. Furthermore, a comparison between the two costs is performed. Re-dispatch actions are implemented by using a linear programming approach with the selection of an objective function for the minimization of the amount of conventional generation. Risk of lost load is obtained in terms of money by the multiplication of the probability of the contingency times the cost. The proposed methodology obtains reliability in terms of system adequacy by investigating line overloads and lost load. Further on, this methodology is tested on a test model for the 380/220kV grid topology of the transmission grid of the Netherlands. The results show the variation of indicators of risk of lost load and guidelines to continue developing probabilistic approaches for reliability analysis. The computational burden and the time employed for this kind of approaches is still a challenge to be tackled.","Probabilistic reliability; State enumeration; Risk; Re-dispatch; Bayesian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-10","","","","","",""

A particular application is the use of an artificial neural network to predict solutions of the governing equations for fluid flow i.e. the Navier-Stokes equations. This is done by taking the space and time variables as the inputs and the flow field variables (velocity and pressure) as outputs. Subsequently, the artificial neural network can be trained by using velocity field data on discrete points in a domain. This training is carried out by means of a scalar loss function, which is minimized by the backpropagation algorithm. By taking the gradients of the outputs with respect to the inputs, the Navier-Stokes can be formed and included in the same loss function. By including discrete velocity field data as well as the Navier-Stokes equations physics into the loss function, the trained artificial neural network could leverage its approximation capabilities to approximate the complex solutions of the flow variables. Only data on the velocity field is provided, such that the framework could be used to infer the pressure field, for which no data is given. In order to apply this approach to incompressible flows, the predicted velocity fields are strictly required to be divergence-free. To accomplish this, a divergence-free potential basis was proposed. This Data Physics Fluid Informed Neural Networks (DPFINN) framework was tested on several incompressible fluid flow test cases, for which analytical solutions were available. This work provides an extensive analysis for these test cases. The results of the test cases showed that the balance between the data and the physics loss function proved to be a delicate one, which depended on a number of different choices for the artificial neural network architectures, data and physics informing process as well as the training process. Overall, the flow fields were able to be inferred well, however simultaneous implementation of the data and the physics proved to be difficult. More complex artificial neural networks were shown to not always improve the performance. Thus, the framework results were showed to be largely dependent on the balance between the expressibility and the trainability of the framework.","artificial neural networks; machine learning; Fluid flow; flow field inference; data assimilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The principle of ATES is to temporary store thermal energy in aquifers in a warm and cold well in order to use this thermal energy for heating and cooling in the next season. Because the available subsurface space is limited, congestion problems can occur in areas with high ATES density. In these areas a conflict of interests exists between private parties who want to achieve maximum efficiency by avoiding negative influence of other systems (leading to large buffers between wells), and the public interest to maximize the amount of thermal energy stored in the aquifer. One solution to this problem is to reduce the distance between wells of the same temperature, creating one large thermal zone around the wells. The main goal of this research is to quantify the change in performance of ATES systems when their thermal zones are connected. The results of this research are as follows. Connecting the thermal zones of wells of the same temperature increases the thermal recovery efficiency of individual systems. This increase is between 8-15% for an average ATES system with a storage volume of 250.000 m³. It is even higher for smaller systems, 15-40% for a system with a storage volume of 50.000 m³. This is crease in efficiency is due to lower losses to the surroundings due to a lower area of the thermal zone compared to the volume of the thermal zone. The reduced distance between wells leads to an increase in pumping energy. Therefore an optimal distance between wells of the same temperature of 0.5 times the thermal radius is found. The distance between wells of opposite temperature should be larger than 3 times the thermal radius.","ATES; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Sustainable heating; Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","51.999884, 4.369080"

A hydrological model, in the context of this thesis, translates meteorological data to stream-flow of a river, for a specific catchment. A model incorporates parameters that describe the dynamics of a chosen model, in this case a FLEX (Flux-Exchange) based model. All parameter together form a set. These parameters are unknown and therefore need to be determined, which is done via a calibration process. In the calibration process, the modelled flow will be evaluated against the observed stream-flow over a period of time for a certain hydrological signature. A hydrological signature is defined as the quantification of specific information concerning the rainfall-runoff dynamics of a catchment, e.g. the mean stream-flow. The evaluation for a certain hydrological signature is known as an evaluation criterion. Literature deems the use of one or two criteria in combination with multiple years of data enough to ensure a good performance from the parameter-sets that exit the calibration process. As this amount of data is not available everywhere, this thesis proposes to still ensure good model performance for less observed data. For this purpose, a selection was made of evaluation criteria to be applied in the calibration process. These criteria were selected in such a way that various different characteristics of the hydrological response were covered. A benchmark was created for comparison purposes in which 10 years of data was used during calibration and one evaluation criterion. After the benchmark, the observed data was shortened and evaluation criteria were added. The results showed that 6 months worth of data in combination with all criteria would create benchmark-level performances without extra information. The same level of performance can be reached with 3 months of data but this would require extra information. This information would be e.g. during which period of time observed data should be collected.","Hydrological Modelling; Calibration; Evaluation Criteria; Signatures; Multi-objective calibration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","During the next few decades, a significant increase in the use of intermittent renewable energy sources is expected in the Netherlands as well as a general increase in electricity consumption. Due to the increased demand as well as a more uncertain, volatile supply, substantial upgrades and redesign of the current Dutch electricity grids are needed. These upgrades will inevitably require large investments as the design and installation of electricity grids is costly. Additionally, the investments are lumpy and irreversible. It is therefore important that the investments will be made in such a way that the future grids will operate successfully, supplying consumers with the demanded electricity at sufficient quality with a low rate of interruptions. Recently, the Netherlands has been divided into 30 energy regions, which allows the Netherlands to work on its climate agreements both from a regional and from a national level. These regions will work on generation and consumption of electricity and heating as well as on the energy infrastructures needed to supply this energy. This aim of this research paper has been to create a method that can be used to design suitable electricity distribution networks for the energy regions in the Netherlands. One approach to designing electricity grid topologies is with the use of graph theory heuristics, which has shown to be a useful way of approaching the electricity design problem by discretising plots of land into a graph. The research paper has shown that by taking into account spatial constraints specific to the Dutch regions, more valid networks can be created. This further leads to increased implementability of the final networks in addition to a reduction in the possibility for unforeseen costs related to building on certain plots of land. The proposed method aims to minimise the investment costs of the future regional electricity distribution networks in the Netherlands, taking both cable lengths and capacities into account. A radiality constraint is applied, ensuring that the network is connected but does not contain any cycles. A flexible way of ensuring that the final networks do not overlap with unavailable land is thereafter applied and demonstrated. A heuristic method aiming to minimise network length is applied before assigning the required capacities to the network. An improvement procedure is performed in order to further reduce investment costs. The cost function is formulated as a non-linear function, incorporating the characteristic that savings can be made by combining lines in order to create a shorter, high-capacity network instead of a longer, low-capacity network. The proposed method has thereafter been verified with respect to the problem formulated and demonstrated using a case study on the energy region Goeree-Overflakkee. Experimental results have also been generated in order to assess the effectiveness of the method. In comparison to an alternative simultaneous topology and production optimisation, it has been found that the proposed method leads to a shorter final network that additionally leads to lower total investments costs.  ","Graph theory; Electricity distribution; Network design; Cost minimisation; Minimum Steiner Tree in Graph","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Consequently, central and local governments across the globe are attempting to spark the diffusion of BEVs through various measures such as financial incentives, developing charging networks or other distinctive benefits. In this process, understanding and exploring the factors which affect consumers to transition from Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to BEVs is essential for the salient actors attempting to increase the adoption rates. In this thesis, we aim to add to this branch of BEV research by investigating the factors influencing consumers’ adoption intention of BEVs while introducing the element of consumers’ BEV knowledge and familiarity. To analyse these effects, a conceptual structural model based on an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was developed and analysed. The conceptual model involved a total of eight variables: Consumer’s knowledge, risk perception, perceived usefulness, attitude towards BEVs, BEV incentives, incentive awareness, intention to adopt a BEV, and the side-by-side comparison to ICEVs as a vehicle alternative. The model was then empirically tested through an extensive questionnaire survey involving data from 266 consumers in the BEV pioneer Norway. To collect this data, the researcher utilized a combination of snow-ball and convenience sampling where the survey was spread through online platforms. Further, the data was analysed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in the software IBM SPSS AMOS to determine the validity of the conceptual model as well as the effect among the variables. To evaluate the results, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed. The results of this analysis indicated that the conceptual model was a good fit despite its complexity. In regard to consumer’s knowledge, the analysis indicated that there was a strong and significant total effect on the adoption intention of BEVs. More specifically, knowledge functioned as a strong predictor through mediating effects of increased perceived usefulness, improved attitude and reduced risk perception related to BEVs. In addition, Knowledge was found to have a strong and significant positive total effect on the mentioned side-by-side “comparison to ICEVs” variable. Further, through a separate regression analysis, the results also revealed the knowledge variables was found to have an explained variance of .3 in regard to the “intention to adopt” variable. This was significantly higher than any other variable in the analysis. Further, the analysis showed that perceived risks could be a considerable psychological barrier against accepting and adopting BEVs. This barrier, however, was significantly reduced in accordance with increasing levels of consumers’ BEV knowledge. Lastly among the SEM key findings, attitude towards BEVs was found to have the strongest direct effect on adoption intention in the model. A variable which again was found to be strongly positively influenced by consumer’s knowledge about the vehicles. The descriptive statistics of the analysis also found noteworthy characteristics in the sample population. For instance, the data revealed that the average knowledge and familiarity levels among the population were as high as 5.82 on the 7-point Likert scale used in the survey research. In combination with the discovered effect of knowledge (on “intention to adopt” and “comparison to ICEV”), this finding could indicate that high levels of BEV knowledge might be an important contributor to Norway’s disproportionately large adoption rates compared to that of other salient actors. One should be cautious, however, to draw this conclusion without performing a similar study in a comparable setting and location. Further, the statistics revealed an average score of 6.29/7 on the variable measuring the awareness of the government incentives in Norway. This is another strong sign that the country has succeeded in spreading information on the topic among its population. Another interesting finding in this regard was the low satisfaction levels with the Norwegian charging networks. With an average score of 3.62/7 (SD=1.57) among the sample, it is clear that a large part of the respondents are dissatisfied with the charging infrastructure. However, the low satisfaction levels do not seem to have a large impact on the intention to adopt BEVs as there was found no significant effect among these variables. A demographic regression analysis with the independent variables of gender, age and education on the dependent variable “intention to adopt” was also performed. This revealed that both gender and education had a small, yet significant effect on the dependent variable where men and high education was associated with higher adoption intentions. Age, on the other hand, had no significant effect. In sum, the main takeaway from this study is that consumers’ knowledge of BEVs should be taken into consideration when attempting to manage the adoption of the ""green vehicles"". Norway has succeeded in diffusing knowledge of BEVs and fiscal incentives within its population, and this might be part of the explanation for their disproportionally large adoption rates compared to other salient actors. The recommendation based on the results in this research is therefore that governments aiming to substitute ICEVs with BEVs should take measures to spread information and educate potential adopters on BEVs and its technology. Achieving this would improve the overall attitude towards BEVs, increase the perceived usefulness and limit the existing risk barriers. In turn, this would increase consumers’ willingness to adopt BEVs and contribute to the global task of creating a greener society.","Battery Electric Vehicles; SEM; Diffusion; Knowledge; Norway; Quantitative analysis; Causal modelling; Consumer behaviour; adoption of innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, the capability of Nanopore sequencing for characterizing the microbiome in drinking water with extremely low biomass content has not been explicitly evaluated. Therefore, this research was carried out to explore the potential of Nanopore sequencing for microbial community characterization and species identification in drinking water.

Results showed that NanoAmpli-Seq 16S rRNA sequencing precisely identified abundant species in artificial microbial communities with high level of reproducibility but biased community profiles due to variation in PCR efficiencies of different species, whereas only 10 species were identified in tap water samples. In addition, raw results from 1D<sup>2</sup> gDNA sequencing provided an unbiased microbial community profile of an artificial community DNA, while polished data improved the species identification accuracy at the expense of the ability to profile the community structure. Furthermore, 45 hours’ sequencing generated more reliable results than 5 hours’ sequencing with higher profiling accuracy of community structure. Nevertheless, 1D<sup>2</sup> gDNA sequencing still did not exhibit desirable species identification performance on tap water DNA samples. Notably, despite two enteropathogenic species (Enterobacter cloacae and Laribacter hongkongensis) were identified, the detection of Homo sapiens in the same sample indicated the potential existence of post sample contamination. To conclude, Nanopore sequencing possesses great potential to serve as an efficient tool for study of drinking water microbiology. Specifically, notwithstanding the dissatisfactory performance of NanoAmpli-Seq, its high reproducibility across sequencing runs, adaptability to low DNA quality and quantity, and short turnaround time indicated its potential usefulness to promptly monitor microbial community changes subjected to environmental changes in extremely low-biomass samples (i.e. drinking water). Despite that 1D<sup>2</sup> gDNA sequencing exhibited superior performance on species identification and microbial community profiling to NanoAmpli-Seq, more endeavors should be made to overcome the hurdles (e.g. demand for high molecular weight gDNA, standard methods for analyzing sequencing data), thereby improving the species identification coverage and microbial community profiling accuracy in drinking water. Understanding the presence and dynamics of the microbial community in DWDS is important for water utilities to gain a better understanding of various microbial processes in drinking water from source to customers’ taps, based on which water treatment strategies could be improved and better management of drinking water quality could be performed.","Drinking water microbiome; Nanopore sequencing; 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; Whole genome sequencing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There is also a trend of achieving deeper automation in the business processes, which is a part of Business Process Automation (BPA). Among various BPA technologies, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has attracted increasing research attention. RPA is an emerging form of business process automation technology. The practice of performing RPA results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization's environment. ChatBots, as the outcome of the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has been regarded as a potential and powerful tool to achieve such cognitive automation in service-oriented business processes. However, limited knowledge on the design road-map and approaches of ChatBot implementation in the Business process hinders the ChatBots further deployment into company practical operation. Herein, the research is focused on the question: How should ChatBots be implemented in service-oriented processes? Chapter Introduction contains the introduction of this study, including the background, problem statement, research question, and thesis structure.<br/>Chapter Literature Review describes the background of business process management (BPM), ChatBot technology, and the current state of ChatBot-implementation in business processes. BPM holds great potential for significant cost saving and productivity improvement, and the lifecycle of BPM serves as one of the guidelines for ChatBot-implementation methodology designed in the next chapter. Chapter Methodology Design introduces the requirements, design strategy, description approach, and validation and evaluation of designing a ChatBot implementation methodology. The requirements of methodology design are described according to the limitation of the current ChatBot-implementation methodology. Then the methodology design strategy is proposed. The methodology can be developed based on the BPM lifecycle, which ensures the business processes covered by the BPM lead to consistently positive outcomes and delivers maximum value to the organization, together with the Quark ChatBot implementation methodology. Following is the approach to describe a methodology. It is crucial to depict the methodology with clear logic. The analytical framework of Sol can be regarded as a suitable approach to describe the ChatBot implementation methodology. The framework consists of three parts namely way of thinking, working, and modeling. Methodology validation and evaluation are described at last. To check the validity and evaluate the methodology, it is necessary to use a case study to execute the methodology. By employing the method of case study, the methodology can be practically performed to automate a process by implement ChatBots. Accordingly, the validity of methodology can be examined, and the limitation of the methodology can also be explored, laying the foundation for the further improvement of the methodology. Chapter ChatBot-implementation Methodology designs the ChatBot-implementation methodology according to the design strategy and description approach in Chapter Methodology Design. It follows the analytical framework of Sol (1982). Chapter Methodology Evaluation evaluates the ChatBot-implementation methodology. The Call Management process of Philips IT Global Services was chosen as an example case to apply the ChatBot-implementation methodology to obtain an automated process.<br/>In Chapter Conclusion, conclusions are drawn. Research findings answer the previously mentioned research questions. The major contribution of this research is establishing a theoretical ChatBot-implementation methodology for service-oriented process automation. Although, there still are some limitations of the work. For further research on ChatBot-implemented process automation, efforts can be focused on the executable process model, the business process model towards the ChatBot model, the extension of methodology application, the multi-process ChatBot implementation methodology, and ChatBot-based business process management.","ChatBots; business process automation; IT service process; case study; BPMN; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The next innovation in for this technology is the implementation of granular sludge in continuous flow through configuration. However, many challenges will have to be faced before this technology can be applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants. One of these is the formation and behaviour of granular sludge in continuous flow reactors. In this study the start-up and steady state behaviour of two lab-scale bioreactors were compared on growth speed, granule size distribution, influent distribution and density. One of the reactors was run with an up flow feeding through the sludge bed, as performed in Nereda™ plants. The second reactor was run with a pulse feeding, followed by an anaerobic mixing phase. By combining data from image analysis with reactor cycle measurements, batch tests, PHA determination and density measurements, a classification of the granule size distribution and COD distribution over the granules was made. A comparison between the reactors could be made, as both reactors were exposed to the same conditions, except for their anaerobic influent regime. Both reactors were fully granulated at the end of reactor operations. The bed fed reactor had a faster average growth speed of granules due to the higher COD load on the biggest granule fraction. This selected for a higher mass fraction of granules greater than 1mm in diameter in the bed fed reactor. Both reactors seemed to suffer from diffusion limitation, as oxygen limitation was observed in the bed<br/>fed reactor, while the pulse fed reactor showed spatial COD limitation. Both reactors experienced some degree of P-limitation. The results from this study can be used to model granulation and granule metabolism of aerobic granular sludge exposed to different anaerobic contact regimes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

Due to advances in materials, structural designs, and manufacturing techniques since the publication of SP-8007, the development of new knockdown factors for contemporary launch vehicle structures is an ongoing subject of research. The work presented herein was performed in collaboration with the NASA Engineering and Safety Center on the Shell Buckling Knockdown Factor Project. A laboratory-scale composite cylindrical shell test article, which had previously been designed according to a novel scaling methodology, was the subject of simulation and testing. Its inner, outer, and boundary surface imperfection signatures were measured and implemented in finite element models for buckling test simulations. These were then used to provide prediction data for an experiment conducted at NASA Langley Research Center. Buckling loads from the two pre-test analyses were within 0.08% and 3.7% of the experimental buckling load. The concurrence of axial shell stiffness, localized strains, and buckling shape evolution was also established between the experiment and simulations. A slight loading imperfection was found during the test; however, it was demonstrated through post-test analyses that this did not affect the buckling load substantially. The test article's 0.91 normalized buckling load was much higher than the 0.59 knockdown factor specified by SP-8007. The correlation between the experimental and simulation results, as well as their contrast with SP-8007's prescription, suggests that directly measured imperfections are capable of playing a role in the development of modern and potentially less conservative knockdown factors for future launch vehicle structures.","Finite Element Analysis; buckling; cylindrical; shells; composites; carbon fiber; NASA; shell; simulation; nonlinear; dynamic; experiment; experimental; Abaqus; finite element method; Finite Element Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Alderliesten, Rene (graduation committee); de Jong, Bart (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Mines and improvised explosive devices are the cause of many mortalities of vehicle occupants. Both experimental and numerical research in this field aims to improve the safety of military vehicles. TNO has advanced Finite Element (FE) models to simulate such events. The numerical research is done to better understand mine blasts. Another aim is to reduce experimental costs for Defence Material Organization (DMO). For full vehicle simulations the empirical Westine model is the basis of the in-house TNO mine blast model. The model consists of a triangular pressure pulse consistent with the Westine impulse which is calibrated using the a test rig developed by TNO and DMO. Experiments are compared with numerical results using the TNO mine blast model and the jump height, representative for total impulse transferred, shows scattered results for different vehicle tests. A possible cause can be accuracy of the current mine blast model. This research will study a new technique to validate mine blast models. When this new technique results in improvements in validation of mine blast models it can be used to study and improve the current TNO model. The aim of the new validation method is to calculate the interaction pressure of an plate excited by a mine blast loading. The obtained pressure can be compared with existing mine blast models for validation of the mine blast model. The methodology is based on solving the inverse problem which requires transient Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements of the deforming plate for the duration of the mine blast loading. Such measurements are done with the state of the art test setup from TNO and DMO. Several methods to solve the inverse problem will be studied. The proposed best way to solve the problem at hand is by solving the corresponding optimization problem using an iterative gradient of descent algorithm. The main difficulty in this approach will be the calculation of the gradient of the objective function. To do this the corresponding transient adjoint problem has to be solved. First an algorithm to solve the inverse problem is implemented for a linear Kirchhoff Love plate model to study the behaviour of the inverse problem for a relatively simple test case. For this algorithm the transient adjoint problem is derived. The forward and adjoint problem are numerically solved. The implementation is verified using the method of manufactured solutions and a convergence study. The algorithm is verified using three different bench mark test pressures. It was found that without any exception the displacement of the algorithm converged with great accuracy to the applied displacement. The corresponding pressure converged good for smooth pressure distributions. Non smooth pressure distributions representative for mine blast interaction pressure did not converge. This shows the non-uniqueness of the solution of the inverse problem. It was realized after these tests that the forward problem acts as a low pass filter for time and spatial oscillations of the pressure distribution. This implies that the inverse problem in non-unique and that noise in the displacement data will be amplified in the obtained pressure from the inverse solution. The total force and radial position as function of time, obtained after integration over the spatial domain, for a localized load are accurately captured back. These parameters could be useful to validate a mine blast model such that research was continued for a continuum model. A non-linear elastic material model is proposed to model the deforming plate assuming monotonically increas- ing strain. This model is used and calibrated against the Johnson-Cook plasticity model. One plate simulation excited by the TNO mine blast model verifies that the non-linear elastic and Johnson-Cook material model result in almost the same displacement. The adjoint problem for a general continuum with elastic material model is derived. The same optimization algorithm is implemented for the continuum model using the calibrated non-linear elastic material model. The forward and adjoint problem are solved using the author’s transient FEM implementation which is verified using commercial software. From the benchmark tests it was verified that the displacement converged quite well however less compared to the linear problem studied earlier. The corresponding pressures behaved similar. It was concluded that the total force and centroid position of a localized load are not always in agreement for the benchmark and solved pressure. This research shows that the limitations of the inverse problem shed light on the limitations in the validation methods employed by many researchers in the field.","Mine blast; Inverse problem; Inverse analysis; Adjoint optimization; Adjoint problem; Transient Analyses; FEM; Kirchhoff Love plate; Non-linear; Non-linear FEM; Explicit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An example of such images is Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data. IMS is a technique for recording the mass-over-charge ratio of molecules in (biological) samples while also recording the molecules’ spatial location. High dimensionality in multivariate images (e.g. many recorded features per pixel) often makes direct human interpretation infeasible and computational analysis impractical. For this reason, unsupervised and data-driven factorization is often applied prior to any exploration of the data, with the goal of reducing its dimensionality. However, one of the more promising factorization methods for multivariate images, Maximum Autocorrelation Factorization (MAF), still depends on some input from the user. Unlike most factorization methods, that focus solely on the spectral content of the observations, MAF also utilizes the spatial structure of the input data to generate matrix factors that try to capture both spatial and spectral patterns in the data. The factors of MAF represent the content of a matrix, ranked according to spatial autocorrelation, i.e. how rapidly they vary spatially. The idea for application of MAF in a bioimaging context is that naturally occurring, signals tend to form larger, more uniform areas and therefore change more slowly spatially, compared to noisy, non-biological measurement patterns. Since MAF factors are ordered according to autocorrelation, noisy measurement (with low autocorrelation) tend to get demoted in the order of factors, effectively separating them from biological data components (with positive autocorrelation). The goal of this thesis is to build upon the MAF algorithm and remove the current need for user input, making an extension of MAF. This novel factorization method is named Extended Maximum Autocorrelation Factorization (EMAF). Similarly to MAF, EMAF is invariant to linear transformations, utilizes spatial and spectral information of the dataset to determine its factors, and produces uncorrelated factors at all distances under certain conditions. The EMAF algorithm is fully unsupervised and produces factors ranked according to spatial autocorrelation. Unlike MAF, EMAF does not unnecessarily promote spatial artifacts oriented in one particular direction over other directions. The exact formulation of EMAF, derivations of the mentioned traits, and practical examples of EMAF are found in the following thesis. Preliminary experiments show that EMAF returns factors of improved quality compared to MAF.","IMS; MAF; Geostatistics; Factorization; Linear transformations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Many musicians record their rehearsal sessions and listen back to reflect on their practice. However, the rehearsal sessions are unstructured, messy and rather long compared to commercial recordings. As a result, musicians may not have the capacity to listen back to all of their practice recordings comprehensively. Nowadays, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques have been developed to better manage and filter informative representations from commercial recordings. However, not much research has been performed focusing on rehearsal sessions. What differentiates rehearsal session recordings from 'regular' recordings, is both their length and the unpredictability of the content within them. Besides, rehearsal recordings will not have labeled ground truth on their content, and obtaining this would require a massive amount of manual labeling work; thus, it is unrealistic to achieve. In this thesis, we therefore propose a systematic development and evaluation framework to deal with these challenges. In detail, we will focus on the segmentation of full rehearsal session recordings into meaningful repeated fragments that could be used by musicians.<br/>To this end, we propose a framework which adopts an unsupervised segmentation strategy that can be robust to expected variability in 'meaningful' repeats.

The reflected flux and polarization signals contain information about the microphysical properties of an atmosphere but are influenced by the geometry of the system. For this study, I adapted a radiative transfer code and used it to compare the influence of inhomogeneous cloud cover, rotation-induced oblateness, orbit inclination, tidal deformation and obliquity on the disk-integrated reflected light signal, for visible light with wavelength 0.7 microns. I have also investigated the importance of including a spatially resolved stellar disk in the model planet's sky when simulating scattering by exoplanetary atmospheres. It was found that a degree of polarization of the order of 1% can arise from rotational-induced oblateness in reflected light, and that a planet's shape may be derived from the normalized flux signal without knowledge of the percentage of cloud cover in some cases. Giving the host star a non-negligible angular size makes a significant difference to the light signal when the planet is in a close-in orbit (D&lt;0.05 AU). Proximity to a spatially extended star leads to a washing out of optical features such as the glory, as well as producing a non-zero reflected flux during transit.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Unfortunately, failures in SUDS still occur regularly, resulting in malfunctioning systems, water nuisance and high costs. To learn from past experiences and to ensure that SUDS in the future can function as a credible alternative to piped UD systems, these failures should be identified, and the underlying reasons more thoroughly understood. Therefore, the research objective of this study was to create a better understanding of technical failures in SUDS and identify their root causes. In creating this understanding, cases of technical failures in SUDS were collected and interviews were conducted to reveal information about their root causes. The observations showed that the implementation of SUDS in the urban environment present new interfaces between systems, disciplines and responsibilities. These interfaces between SUDS and subsystems were shown to be prominent failure locations. The interviews revealed that designers, constructors and operators often lack knowledge about these interactions and their impact on the performance of SUDS. Combining the results of technical failures and the underlying root causes showed that throughout the whole development process of SUDS (i.e. design phase, construction phase and user/maintenance phase) technical failures arise. In minimizing these technical failures, every project phase should focus on certain root causes behind technical failures. The classification of the 13 identified root causes revealed that root causes stem from uncertainties in technical, social and institutional systems and are located both within (internal) and between systems (interface). Previous research focused mainly on barriers in the socio-institutional system, this research however showed that we should just as much focus on the technical system. Moreover, previous research primary focused on the performance of SUDS in their context, this study revealed that interfaces between SUDS and other urban subsystems are critical and deserve extra attention in future projects. Further research is required to systematically keep record of the problems and failures occurring in SUDS.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

This added hydraulic circuit has to be able to generate high enough pressures and volume flows to generate a pinch force of 30 N with all of the fingers, close the hand within 0.5 seconds and support both closing and opening movements. Furthermore, the combined weight of both the hand and the expanded hydraulic circuit had to stay underneath 350 grams. When creating this circuit, the addition of a hydraulic valve and pressure sensor at the hand was kept in mind. As a result, the hydraulic circuit only has to uphold the high pressure long enough for the hydraulic valve to close. This time was assumed to be 0.5 seconds. The expected weight for this addition is added when determining the combined weight of the hand and the expanded hydraulic circuit.<br/><br/>This study explores the possibilities for creating this expansion of the hydraulic circuit. First, the parts necessary to build a basic hydraulic circuit and the limitation for these parts were studied. Then, the required parameters for the hydraulic circuit were both calculated and measured. Based on those results, the hydraulic circuit was built with the chosen parts and the hydraulic circuit was tested. Based on the test measurements, possibilities for future optimisation of the hydraulic circuit were studied. The power source and the reservoir were left out of the scope of this research as those two parts can be placed more proximal on the forearm, and thus have a reduced impact on the weight experienced by the patient.<br/><br/>The built circuit enabled all the fingers of the Delft Cylinder Hand to exert a pinch force of 30 N and was able to uphold this pinch force for over 0.5 seconds and supported both closing and opening movements. The closing time was found to be between 0.9 and 1.2 seconds. However, applying a low pressure on the hydraulic circuit and removing the springs inside the fingers of the hand before turning on the motor reduced the closing time to 0.45 seconds. The combined weight of the hand and the expanded circuit, including the expected weight for the added hydraulic valve and pressure sensor, is 337 grams.<br/><br/>As the used external gear pump was found to have a relatively low efficiency, further improvements to the performance to the hydraulic circuit can be made by improving the pump efficiency.

Moreover, in the field of medication it will allow for more effective treatments as certain types of medication are more effective when applied at certain moments in the 24-hour cycle. The mammalian biological clock is controlled by a tiny area in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The neurons in the SCN are able to synchronize their clock gene expression to each other through coupling. However, it is unclear how different types of coupling affect the synchronizing property of the SCN. This research explores how two types of coupling, namely gap junction coupling and neuromodulator diffusion shape the synchronous behaviour of a network of SCN neurons. Since data collection in the biological system is challenging, this research is done using a modeling approach. A mathematical single SCN neuron model was used and scaled to a network representation. The individual neuron models were coupled using a gap junction and neuromodulator models. In this research, it was found that gap junction coupling is a precise and strictly local form of coupling. It can synchronize phase errors on the level of action potentials. However in a network there is a maximum number of neurons that can be synchronized, assuming that the number of gap junctions per neuron is limited. Therefore, it was concluded that in large SCN networks gap junction coupling is not able to completely synchronize the network. Neuromodulator coupling is imprecise, slow and global. It can effectively synchronize large phase errors, however, as phase errors become small, neuromodulator coupling loses its synchronizing ability. Therefore, it can only synchronize the daily pattern and cannot synchronize on the level of action potentials. Furthermore, it was shown that neuromodulator diffusion can synchronize SCN networks of arbitrary size. <br/>As a final conclusion, the combination between gap junctions and neuromodulator diffusion is able to synchronize a network completely, perfectly, and rapidly. The neuromodulator component ensures complete synchronization while the gap junctions guarantee perfect synchronization (in the absence of noise). Furthermore, the combination ensures effective synchronization for both small and large phase errors. Therefore, the combination of these two types of coupling is vital in the establishment of network with versatile synchronization properties.","brain; neuron; scn; Diekman; network dynamics; mathematical neuroscience; computational neuroscience; neuronal coupling; biological clock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Assuming that the valley isospin is also conserved at a smooth normal-superconducting (NS) interface, theoretical research has previously predicted that plateaus in the longitudinal conductance are expected to occur in the lowest Landau level of the incoming edge modes, which depends on the angle difference between the isospins entering and leaving the superconductor. In this thesis, this prediction is verified with a tight-binding simulation of six different NS junctions: for both zigzag and armchair edge nanoribbons, the superconductor can cover a single edge, two adjacent edges or two opposite edges. The theoretical prediction could be confirmed successfully, suggesting that the edge states are valley polarised along a smooth NS interface. Some deviations from the theory could be observed for the armchair edge ribbon with opposite edges when the width of the ribbon is not a multiple of three hexagons. Two consecutive widths show a complementary behaviour in the conductance such that their average corresponds to the predicted value with a remarkable robustness. The reason for this complementarity was briefly conjectured by using the special Andreev reflection in graphene and the coupling between sublattice and valley degree of freedom for zigzag edges. The parameter regimes allowing for the existence of conductance plateaus were established, confirming that the plateaus emerge for a system size much larger than the magnetic length and the superconducting coherence length, and that a smooth chemical potential, magnetic field strength and superconducting order parameter are necessary at the NS interface. The robustness of the NS edge states was furthermore investigated with three methods: a Fermi energy mismatch between the bulk and the superconductor, and random normally distributed variation in the onsite electrostatic potential and a random potential landscape. All results could confirm that intervalley scattering is the reason for deviations from the plateaus predicted by the theory.","graphene; junction; conductance; valley polarization; superconductor; quantum hall","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Hydrogen is seen as a potential energy carrier in the Netherlands by 2050. To what extent hydrogen will be implemented is unknown, because many applications are possible. Hydrogen shows potential for (1) carbon free feedstock for process industry, (2) carbon free energy carrier of high temperature heat in process industry, (3) energy storage and transport capacity to enable renewables, (4) transport, and (5) built environment. The presence of a natural gas grid is a driver for implementation of hydrogen. This research aims to provide concrete roadmaps for hydrogen futures based on earlier studies, to explore the possibilities for hydrogen development. For this study, no new visions are created with workshops, but existing studies are compared and the key takeaways provide the input for visions. To develop actual roadmaps, a backcasting study has been conducted. Backcasting studies normally do not have prior visions. However, in this study backcasting has been implemented to explore concrete changes and actions that are necessary for development of hydrogen to fulfil the visions that resulted from the existing studies. The results of the backcasting analysis are placed in time to form a roadmap for hydrogen visions. Key actors and policy measures are determined to realize the visions. The following results and conclusion can be made. First, hydrogen plays a role in industrial clusters in the Netherlands. Potential for future hydrogen markets strongly depends on the further development of the energy system and alternatives in the different sectors. Electrolysis and SMR with CCS to some extent are production methods to make hydrogen production cleaner. Depending on new markets, more stakeholders will become involved in the current hydrogen system. Based on existing visions and scenarios, three visions have been constructed. The constructed visions are based on hydrogen as secondary energy carrier and hydrogen as primary energy carrier. Often hydrogen is compared to electricity. Vision 1: All electric. Vision 1 describes a system where electricity is used as the primary energy source. Hydrogen plays an important role in flexibility of the energy system. Electrolysis has to be scaled to provide flexibility. Vision 2: One integrated system. Vision 2 describes a system where hydrogen and electricity are integrated. Hydrogen is implemented in built environment, industry for high temperature heating, heavy vehicle transport and inland navigation. Vision 3: Go hydrogen. Vision 3 describes a system where hydrogen is implemented to its full potential. Every action is to enable a large hydrogen economy in 2050. For further research, the approach of vision comparison could be further developed. Second, combining models with pathways studies may provide a better insight in the bottlenecks between technical possibilities and realisation of the vision. Third, workshops could be conducted for a similar study to gain more detailed insights on roadmapping approach and to provide more platform between stakeholders.","Backcasting; Hydrogen; Visions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These investigation, express different concerns and limitation of the currently used CPT based calculation methods. Prompting the need for further investigation into the consistency of these methods.For the base capacity calculation methods, the αp factor used is accompanied by a cone resistance (qc ) averaging technique. However, some limitation have been found for the currently used qc averaging technique, which affects the consistency and accuracy of the base capacity calculations when a constant αp factor is used, namely, a dependency with penetration depth. Presentiments by Randolph (2003) &amp; White and Bolton (2005), suggest that a single, constant αp factor can be used when an appropriate averaging technique is applied in combination with the inclusion of the residual loads present in a pile. Hence, a new CPT averaging technique was developed during this study. The goal of this new averaging technique is to find an accurate and consistent averaging technique, which can be used in combination of a single, constant αp factor. The new CPT averaging technique was calibrated using a series of high quality CPT laboratory tests with varyingsoil deposits. Comparisons were then made between the new and existing averaging techniques, as well as, base capacity calculation methods by applying the different averaging techniques to the Deltares pile load test database. Lastly, the effect of residual loads were investigated by applying the averaging techniques to 4 well documented pile load tests where distinctions between residual loads were made. The investigation carried out in this report concluded that the new CPT averaging technique, developed in this study, was more accurate than the other investigated CPT averaging techniques, when comparisons were made with the CPT laboratory tests. This was also the case when comparing the CPT averaging techniques applied to the pile load database. Although the pile load database demonstrated that the new averaging technique had the least spread in results, a dependency with embedment length in the sand bearing layer was still present. This effect was not removed when pile load tests including residual loads were considered, as predicted by Randolph (2003) &amp; White and Bolton (2005). However, the limited number of these tests calls for further research in order to confirm any conclusions.For the shaft capacity calculation methods, the αs factor used by the Dutch norm in particular, NEN-9997- 1, was investigated. This is because the formulation of the NEN-9997-1 calculation method is believed to be too simplistic (van Tol, Stoevelaar, Bezuijen, Jansen, &amp; Hannink, 2013). Comparisons between a variety of shaft capacity calculation methods were made by applying the calculation methods to the Deltares pile load test database and to the 4 well documented pile load tests where distinctions between residual loads were made, in order to look into the effect of residual load on the accuracy of shaft capacity calculation methods.Additionally, results from the research carried out in this report into the αsfactor used by the Dutch norm, concluded a presence of a strong correlation between the αs of sand layers and friction fatigue terms used in other shaft capacity calculation methods. This can be used in the future to improve the current shaft capacity calculation method used by the Dutch norm. ","Pile driving; Capacity; CPT-based correlations; CPT; averaging distance; pile foundations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Filtered EMG has an offset above zero which is part noise and part background activity. The goal of this study is to separate these two parts, using a non-linear neuromuscular ankle model. The model uses positional and EMG data as inputs to make a prediction of the output torque around the ankle, optimizing several muscle parameters. It was assumed model error was partly caused by the lack of separation of background activity and noise in the EMG offset. The correlation between model error and the force-length relationship of the muscle was investigated, as it was hypothesized that the force-length relationship could be used to separate background activity from noise in EMG.Twelve subjects (11 male, 1 female, mean age 25.21.7 years) participated in the study, which was approved by the TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee. The Achilles ankle perturbator and the TMSi Porti7 EMG system were used to obtain positional and EMG data around the ankle. The subjects performed several trials containing multiple ramp-and-hold phases. The trials were performed while relaxed, and while performing co-contraction at 5% and 10% of maximum voluntary co-contraction. Model validity was judged on robustness and fit. Model fit shows how close the predicted torque resembles the measured torque. High robustness is defined as a low variance of the model parameters per subject, between trials. To improve robustness, two model configurations, one using averaged data and one simplified model configuration, were compared with the original model. The most robust model configuration was used as a basis for an alternative model, which added a parameter for each EMG signal, that subtracted part of the EMG offset. This EMG offset subtraction parameter was added to remove the constant part of the noise in the EMG offset. The correlation between model error and the force-length relationship of the model was calculated for the model with the best robustness, and the alternative model.Model robustness was not improved in the averaged data model configuration or the simplified model configuration, compared to the original model. The original model was therefore used for the rest of the study. The EMG offset subtraction parameter did not yield to desired reduction of noise in the EMG offset. This was likely a result of difficulties with determining the EMG offset. Only weak correlations (R&lt;&lt;0.3) were found between the model error and the force-length relationship of the muscles, for both the original model and the alternative model configuration.","EMG; Neuromuscular modeling; Spasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

This makes them hard to distinguish from one another. Structures can block the visibility of the ground surface for side looking SAR satellites making large parts of potentially flooded ground going unseen by SAR satellites. Smooth surfaces and limited ground visibility make it hard to produce accurate flood maps using SAR in urban environments. Here we have shown how the use of a temporal stack can improve the result of urban flood detection with<br/>SAR. Traditionally SAR based flood mapping uses a single image or an image pair to classify flooded and non-flooded pixels. This study found these methods unable to detect flooded pixels in an urban setting. By using a temporal stack of SAR images more pixels are correctly classified as flooded while keeping false positive classifications low. However the number off correctly classified pixels remains too low to be useful on its own, by adding ancillary data in the form of a high resolution DEM an accurate flood map for a very specific area is produced. This means that SAR images are not suitable for flood mapping in urban areas as a single source of information. When they are combined with other data they have the potential to produce accurate flood maps useful for First responders when the next flooding disaster hits.","SAR; Flood; mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-07","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

However one of these types of stall behaviour, trailing edge stall, has been shown in literature to be three dimensional by forming stall cells along the wing span. Stall cells are coherent flow structures consisting of localised patches of separated flow that are surrounded by attached flow. Most of the recent research is focused on determining the requirements for the formation of stall cells in terms of the angle of attack and the Reynolds number. Published results of these investigations use different airfoils and are thus not comparable. In this master thesis a NACA 0012 wing with plain flap has been used to assess the effect of the airfoil thickness and the camber on the stall cell formation criteria. The experimental results of the NACA 0012 wing have been compared to published results of a NACA 0015 wing to assess the effect of the airfoil thickness. The effect of the camber is simulated by deflecting the plain flap. Experimental results suggested that stall cell behaviour needs to be split into a low and a high Reynolds number regime, where the change in regime is airfoil dependent. Thick airfoils have been found to promote the formation of stall cells in the high Reynolds number regime but delay the formation of stall cells in the low Reynolds number regime. Adding camber to an airfoil was found to promote stall cell formation in both Reynolds number regimes. Further investigation of the formation criteria for stall cells indicated the importance of aerodynamic parameters such as the lift coefficient in determining stall cell formation criteria. Additionally the size and steadiness of the stall cells has been investigated by tracking characteristic vortical structures of stall cells. Although the angle of attack and Reynolds number have an effect on the stall cell size in spanwise direction, it was found that the minimum and maximum size of a stall cell are determined by the airfoil. Larger flap deflections were found to result in larger stall cells in spanwise direction. The unsteadiness of the stall cell spanwise position was observed to decrease with increasing angle of attack and decreasing Reynolds number.","Experimental aerodynamics; Stall cell; Airfoil; Flow separation; Tufts; PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The most common support structure for a wind turbine at sea is a monopile. These are currently installed by large hydraulic hammers. However, hammering produces a lot of underwater noise which may harm marine life (Kastelein, 2014). Therefore, the industry is looking for new installation methods that are more environment friendly. GBM Works aims to implement such a new installation technique called the Vibro-drill. They introduce a revolutionary new design which is to replace the hammering technique. Vibrations, jetting and liquefaction are used to reduce the soil resistance. This reduction is so powerful that the monopile sinks into the ground under its own weight without producing the harmful underwater noise. Before each monopile is installed an analysis is made of the factors determining the chance of a successful installation. This process is called a penetration prediction. For the industry to accept the Vibro-drill installation method, penetration predictions are required to prove the applicability of the new technique. The radical changes in the installation process used by this technique make it impossible to use current penetration prediction methods. This means that a new prediction method needs to be developed that takes into account the specific features of the Vibro-drill. This thesis aims to address this problem by way of providing building blocks for the development of a fully-fledged penetration prediction model that is applicable to the Vibro-drill method. To this end, this thesis will focus on delivering a two-dimensional soil model in penetrated by a pile. The two-dimensional approach, which is the basis of this thesis, has of course its limitations as only a part of the pile and soil are included in the model. The assumed point symmetry over the centreline of the monopile leads to only a slice of the pile being modelled. The soil is captured using a lattice model. A well-known practice for modelling soil in a two-dimensional way. The properties of the lattice are determined using Cone Penetration Test data. As a result the model represents different layers of soil along the depth. The model uses a rigid pile to penetrate the soil. The penetration of the pile causes a reaction force in the soil. This force is used to calculate the friction forces. The reaction force and the friction force are the basis for calculating the penetration speed of the pile. From this it follows that the penetration speed and final installation depth depend on the different soil layers within the soil model. A first step towards validation is made. The pile/lattice interaction is verified and the results are compared to test data. A sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the independence of the lattice size and resolution on the modelled penetration speed of the pile. Subsequently the penetration predictions of the model in its current form are analysed. The results are compared to the real-life outcome of tests with the Vibro-drill. From this first attempt to validation the conclusion can be drawn that the two-dimensional model, as developed in this thesis, could be a suitable basis for further work on a viable penetration prediction method for the Vibro-drill technique. Finally, recommendations are made for further enhancing the model with a view to its eventual implementation as a fully functional penetration prediction model for the Vibro-drill.","GBM; Vibro-drill; Pile Driveability; pile installation; penetration model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

By using BIM, assessment is made on whether design changes are feasible and what consequences it may have on planning, costs, re-work, and clashes. However, current knowledge is lacking on how to use BIM when implementing a design change in a project. This research aims to set up a procedure that can be used by the project team for implementing design changes during the execution phase of infrastructural projects.

Hereby, both qualitative and quantitative analyses are carried out in three cases in the infrastructural field. Both analyses are subdivided into the organisational dimension(for the change process) and technical dimension(use of BIM). For the qualitative part, semi-structured interviews are held with contract managers and BIM managers. For the quantitative part, samples are taken to analyse each project. These samples consisted of all contractual changes in the project that led to a change in the design and which have been implemented after the execution phase has commenced. The results of the literature study and the case studies are used to develop a procedure to be used by the project team in case of design changes during the execution phase of infrastructural projects.

The support structure of an offshore wind turbine shows a high potential for further cost reduction. Jules Dock is investigating in the replacement of a steel tower on a monopile foundation by a Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) tower, which has a higher specific strength and better corrosion resistance compared to steel. This would enable lower transportation and installation costs and a potentially longer lifetime. Currently Jules Dock assesses the feasibility of a GFRP tower versus a steel tower using an aero-elastic simulation tool. However, such a tool is computationally demanding and requires detailed turbine data, which are often not available in a preliminary design phase. For this reason, a research project has been set-up to develop a parametric design model which can effectively be used without detailed turbine data and aero-elastic simulations, to identify the design driving constraints for preliminary designs and mass optimization purposes. The parametric design model analyses the natural frequency constraint and Ultimate Limit State (ULS). The natural frequency of the support structure is intended to be in the soft-soft region, which will result in the lowest mass possible as has been found in previous research. The natural frequency of the support structure is analyzed with a finite beam element model, in which the Rotor Nacelle Assembly (RNA) is modelled as a point mass. The interaction with soil is also included using a three spring model. For the ULS, the yield and buckling capacity of the support structure are analyzed. For the steel monopile and transition piece, dedicated design standards have been used. For the composite tower, however, these design standards are not existing and therefore analytical solutions from composite tube applications have been used and verified for this purpose. FEM analysis showed that the yield capacity can be determined exactly. The buckling capacity approximation in the parametric design model showed conservative results compared to a dedicated buckling analysis tool. In the parametric design model the maximum loading for the ULS constraints has been analyzed using a quasi-static load analysis method which includes turbulence and dynamic wave loading effects. This method has been compared with the time-domain simulation tool Phatas, which is integrated in Focus6. This comparison showed that also the tower top bending moment should have been included. If this is taken into account, the integrated load analysis method appears to approach the maximum loading for a very stiff tower quite accurately compared with the time-domain simulations. For flexible towers, however, the loads are less accurately approached, since dynamic interactions between wind and wave loading have appeared to be relevant, especially for load cases with a wave excitation frequency close to the natural frequency of the support structure. In the quasi-static load analysis method these dynamic effects are only taken into account for the submerged part of the support structure, but the time-domain simulations have shown that these effects will increase the maximum loading on the support structure above water level as well. For mass optimization and identification of the design driving constraints of this support structure, a genetic algorithm has been developed. Several optimization runs have been made, resulting in multiple feasible solutions with only small differences in support structure mass. While the buckling constraint drives the design of the monopile, transition piece and top of the tower, the lower part of the tower is design driven by the yield constraint. It has been concluded that the loading analysis method in the developed parametric design model should include the tower top bending moment, since this leads to a mass increase of up to 20% of the support structure mass. Next to that, it has been observed that the optimization algorithm tends to converge to solutions with a natural frequency to be as low as possible, such that the dynamic amplification of the wave loading is minimized. For these solutions, the loading analysis method in the parametric design model may have underestimated the maximum loading on the flexible support structure. This needs to be further investigated.","Support structure optimization; Offshore wind turbine; Composite wind turbine tower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Joining of aerospace structures has been accomplished using mechanical fasteners since the advent of flight. With the growing application of lightweight composite structures in aircrafts, joining methods involving fasteners have been under scrutiny. The lack of material plasticity and high notch sensitivity of composites in the presence of structural discontinuities such as open holes for joints requires local laminate thickening, increased number of fasteners to comply with the strict fail-safe philosophy for certification of primary aerospace structures. However, this incurs a large cost and weight penalty that partially nullify the benefits of using composites. To circumvent this issue, popular solutions either do away with mechanical fasteners (adhesive bonds) or modify the substrates forming the joint (fiber metal laminates). Technical difficulties with respect to the maintenance and repair of adhesively bonded joints with current-day technology have prevented their certification for primary aerospace structures. On the other hand, fiber metal laminates (FML) have exhibited enhanced mechanical joint bearing strengths as high as 168% with titanium reinforcement and 232% with steel reinforcements with a metal content of 50% compared to traditional carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Further, advancements in surface preparation of metals such as steel and titanium have improved the metal-CFRP bond durability thereby making them a lucrative solution to aerospace joints. This thesis evaluates the open hole tension (OHT) behaviour of the steel hybridized CFRP FML from an experimental, analytical and numerical standpoint. Experimental identification of the failure modes in the steel-CFRP FML failed by OHT testing is carried out with the help of non-destructive techniques such as digital image correlation and post-testing polished microscopy. Simple analytical models previously applied to the commercially successful Glare (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) are adopted to predict the blunt notch strength of the steel-CFRP FML with emphasis on the post-cure residual stresses. Within the scope of the experimental study, the analytical predictions of the blunt notch strength of steel-CFRP FML show a 2.5% deviation in accuracy. A high-fidelity numerical model incorporating interlaminar and intralaminar damage in the CFRP and steel layers is developed using Abaqus. Intralaminar damage initiation and progressive damage modelling is performed using a stress-strain formulation for CFRP while plasticity is defined for the steel layers. Interlaminar damage is addressed from a fracture mechanics perspective by the implementation of a cohesive zone model (CZM). Good correlation is observed between experimental results and the numerical model with respect to progression of damage in the CFRP/steel and failure load prediction.","Fiber metal laminate; Progressive Damage Analysis; Digital Image Correlation; Cohesive Zone Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In Newtonian fluids, the flow of microorganisms is governed by the viscosity alone. But in viscoelastic fluids, the addition of the elastic component complicates the situation. The flow of the organism is now dictated by a combination of the two forces- viscous and elastic. Understanding the behaviour of these organisms is not only important because of the presence of such environments in nature, but also because of the potential pharmaceutical applications that such studies might lead to.<br/>This thesis focuses on the experimental study of the swimming of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model motile swimmer that swims at low Reynolds numbers. The main objective of the thesis is to characterize these differences in motility and hydrodynamic interactions of these cells in Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids of varying viscosities. This is accomplished by observing the motion of a dilute suspension of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in 3D using four cameras. The cells are subsequently tracked using an in-house 3D particle tracking code that incorporates a recursive divide and conquer strategy to reconstruct the trajectories.<br/>The experiments showed a drop in velocity in viscoelastic fluids as compared to its Newtonian counterparts, validating the results from existing literature. The cells also maintained their helical motion previously observed in TRIS, although with a drop in radius and pitch in viscoelastic fluids. The ratio of the radius to the pitch, however, remained constant for all the cases, indicating a tendency to retain its overall motion.<br/>The study of cell-wall interactions is of prime importance because of the presence of confined surfaces encountered in nature. The concentration profile of the cells was observed to be similar in all the fluids, showing a non-uniform distribution with large concentration at the boundaries. The overall trajectories near the wall in TRIS revealed that the cells tend to arrive at steep angles in the contact region and leave at shallow angles, a phenomenon termed as asymmetric reflection. When the viscosity increased, however, this behaviour became less apparent as the incoming angles became less steep, while the outgoing angles remained shallow. For the viscoelastic case, the behaviour appears to become more symmetric with increase in viscoelasticity. Additionally, the data also points to a less steep drop in velocity in the contact region in solutions of higher viscosity as compared to the less viscous solutions. Though this might indicate a greater influence of hydrodynamics near the wall for more viscous fluids, more data is required to observe this behaviour deeply.<br/>The obtained results show a clear effect of viscoelasticity on the motility and kinematics of the cells, confirming results and predictions from existing literature. For cell wall interactions, differences are certainly discerned, not only for the viscoelastic cases but also for the more viscous cases. More experiments on these fluids are recommended to give a clear indication of the change in wall interactions in fluids of higher viscosity and viscoelasticity.","Viscoelasticity; microfluidics; Stokes flow; Particle Tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The strategy they follow to reach this goal is customer intimacy. However, the flexibility landscape of the airline is not aligned with its strategy. A reason of this flexibility approach is that as most airlines, KLM is conservative in their ticket changing approach: their policies discourage passengers from doing it. Nevertheless, literature, as well as the competitors analysis shows that a fine change strategy can create a revenue gain that overcomes the lost demand and unsold capacity. When it comes to risks is travelling, literature shows a wide range of adverse effects that can be aimed to relieve. Two of these have been identified as relevant for KLM: economical and opportunity loss. The following research indicate that the most valuable risk reliever for customer is an economical one. Also, a trends research has been carried out. This has uncovered the upcoming change in passengers behaviour which will change from doing it when “I have to” to “I want to”. Customer research: A thorough field research, both qualitative and quantitative has been carried out around KLM’s customers. This research also identified the main attributes passengers wish to have in their flexibility solution – fair, transparent, relevant and affordable. Conceptualization: A creative session was performed with the main stakeholders of the project. The outcomes of the session were a validation of the research as well as new design drivers – simplicity, effectiveness, transparency, value for money and appealing experience. Design proposal: The concept resulting from this project is a complete update of the flexibility landscape of KLM. A more robust customer journey in terms of flexibility is to be developed. An outcome of this upgrading is a broader portfolio of flexibility products, which is aligned with the personalization tactic within the customer intimate strategy of KLM. The new products introduction turns around the current view on ticket changes KLM has, by fostering win-win situations. 3 of the new products focus on the changes around departure. Fixed fares will be introduced to replace the current situation, where passengers have to pay both the change fee and the fare difference. These products will be the ahead product “Flight guarantee”, and the immediate products “Take an earlier or later flight” and “Passenger rescue”. Conclusion: A new flexibility landscape for KLM urges. Changes are sought by KLM customers and it is expected that this desire will grow in time.The solution proposed by this project seems promising.

In 2014 a long awaited update of the European directive governing procurement procedures was published. Among these procedures are a distinct set of innovation oriented procedures. Some of these are suitable solely for the procurement of innovations, other also for the procurement highly complex projects. Use of these procedures by governments, often called Public Procurement for Innovation, or PPfI for short, is however hindered by several problems. Due to its novelty and higher risk profile it is being applied very little, leading to a lack of jurisprudence, example projects and practice-oriented research. Compared to the widely used non-innovation oriented procedures, which have been ingrained in public organisations, its application entails a different approach and set of skills, making many civil servants hesitant to apply them. A low capacity for learning of public organisations, especially in project-based organisations, adds to this hesitation. This research aims to improve the performance of project managers and procurement advisors during the preparation phase of the innovation partnership and the competitive dialogue procedure. This is achieved by defining the processes of the preparation phase and identify how these could be optimised towards the achievement of innovation during procurement, resulting in recommendations on the relevance and set up of each process. In order to achieve this objective the following main research question was defined: How could the processes of the preparation phase be optimised for achievement of innovation during procurement, in the case of public authorities procuring for innovation in the physical domain, using the innovation partnership or competitive dialogue procedure?In order to answer this research question, a literature study was performed to clarify relevant concepts, define the preparation phase in processes and define activities for the optimisation of each of these processes. This research found the following 11 processes to be part of the preparation phase: Need &amp; need assessor identification, Need analysis and specification, Market exploration,ConsultationMarket engagement, Partnering, Knowledge &amp; capabilities management, Creation of support, Risk management, Project organising and Process design and conditions.Subsequently, 47 underlying activities aimed at optimising their influence on the achievement of innovation during the tender- and execution phase were derived from the literature. These processes and underlying activities formed a conceptual framework that formed the basis for case study research involving 4 projects and 7 respondents closely involved in these projects, either as procurement advisor or project manager. The case-study findings were subsequently compared to the literature study findings, after which a synthesis of the individual results took place. This resulted in the validation of the 11 processes and a discussion of optimisation of these processes using 34 of the processes found in literature and two new activities derived from the case studies. These are listed in the main text. The literature- and case study findings were used to define a list of general- and process specific recommendations for project managers and procurement advisors of public organisations planning to undertake procurement of product innovations in the physical domain using the innovation partnership or competitive dialogue procedure. The research should be considered along with its context and limitations, discussed in chapter 2, 4 and 8. The recommendations presented below and at the end of this thesis should be considered alongside the discussion of research results presented in chapter 5 as this creates additional insight into the limitations and applicability of the results.The recommendations presented below are therefore possible optimisation strategies for the preparation phase for public organisations with little experience in PPfI, planning to procure innovative solution for which they might use the innovation partnership or competitive dialogue procedure. Based on the research findings, the following general recommendation are given: First, it is recommended to define a tailored approach for each process due to the complexity of innovation oriented procurement and the unique character of projects. In this tailored approach the mutual influences and dependencies should be taken into account and exploited where possible. Secondly, for the underlying activities it is recommended to explore new possibilities and combinations, leading to fit-for-purpose activities that can be carried out for multiple processes. Thirdly, as these procedures and the achievement of innovation are complex and require broad and multidisciplinary skills, it is recommended to perform an assessment of the available internal expertise and the necessary expertise and to seek process assistance early on in the project. Fourthly, where internal knowledge and capabilities are lacking, Early Market Interaction and the help of external experts can be employed to increase the procuring organisations’ understanding of the process and its content. This can be precede any concrete plans for innovation oriented procurement, for instance by having a sit down with well-known or regular suppliers and discuss with them how they think PPfI and the accompanying collaboration can be optimized. And lastly, It is recommended to select a procedure only after sufficient information has been gathered from market parties, experts and internal sources of knowledge and expertise during the need identification, analysis and specification, market exploration and consultation. Furthermore, it is recommended to be restrictive in the application of the innovation partnership and competitive dialogue procedures as they are resource-intensive and require, as this thesis points out, thorough preparation.","Procurement; Innovation; Innovation Partnership; competitive tendering; public procurement; Construction; Preparation process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","","52.362758, 4.906695"

The impact is huge, with major infrastructures being damaged andaccess to basic needs cut off for the disaster struck regions. The affected regions and communitiesare dependent on the delivery of disaster relief aid, by governments and non-governmental orga-nizations. The delivery can be difficult, while airports, harbours and other infrastructure is oftendamaged from the disaster.The timely delivery of relief aid to the affected communities is a major challenge of today. Theairports used for the distribution of relief items are often unable to handle the shear size of theinflux of these items. The resources are damaged and personnel might not be able to show up forwork. In order to reduce the overexertion of the local airport, an airbridge can be made with aregional airport. The regional airport can then be used as a buffer, for bundling and storing reliefaid, until it can be delivered to the local airport. The system in which the regional airport receivesthe international contribution of relief items and sends them in a moderated flow to the local airportis called the airport relief chain.The relief chain is subject to several bottlenecks, but due to scarcity in research, the influenceon airport relief chains had not been identified previously. Reducing these bottlenecks and im-proving the relief chain can be achieved by improving the processes on individual airports, as wellas by altering small features in the structure of the relief chain itself. The research question isconsequently:How can the impact of bottlenecks on an airport relief chain system be decreased,considering the airport operations in a fixed network design?To be able to confirm the bottlenecks and investigate possible solutions, a simulation model wasbuilt for the airport relief chain system. To obtain relevant outcomes, data of a real world casestudy was applied to the simulation model. The case study of choice is the earthquake followed bya tsunami in September 2018, that struck the island of Palu, Indonesia. In this disaster, an airportrelief chain system was created, in which the delivery to Mutiara on Palu, serving as the local air-port, was provided through Sepinggan airport on Kalimantan, serving as the regional buffer airport.To this end three bottlenecks were identified for the airport relief chain. namely: (1) The air-craft arrival process at the regional airport, (2) The cargo handling after unloading of the aircraftat the regional airport, and (3) the airbridge connection between the local and regional airport. Thebottleneck at the airbridge is the most stressing, absorbing most of the cargo. Even when the otherbottlenecks are resolved, without improvement in the airbridge the performance will eventually belimited.With the airbridge as a major constraint in the airport relief chain system, the delivery of re-lief items can not be larger than the throughput of the airbridge. The bottlenecks identified at theaircraft arrival and the regional airport processes reduce the flow of relief items even further. Thepolicies investigated are meant to maximize the performance up to the airbridge, creating maximalperformance within the constraints of the system.The performance was measured through the performance indicator, namely the timely delivery.ii<br/>The timely delivery consists oftotal deliveyand theshare of priority demand delivered. The perfor-mance of the system as a whole can as such be evaluated, yet it lacks detail for the implementation ofpolicies. In order to improve the system, the bottlenecks had to be identified, for which the bottle-neck identification measures were introduced. These consist ofidle cargoandthroughput time. Theidle cargo is generally a notification for the occurrence of a bottleneck, with high average idle cargomeaning a bottleneck occurs. The throughput time here indicates whether it was very impacting,as high numbers for throughput time generally mean less impact on the overall component over time.The individual policies were ineffective to truly improve the airport relief chain as a whole. Severalpolicies proved to be quite effective at reducing bottlenecks, thus improving the timely delivery.However, only small improvements were seen in the total delivery, due to the downstream occur-rence of other bottlenecks. Theshare of priority demandalone could be raised effectively throughprioritization policy. Those policies would not provide further system improvements, making theiruse even more case specific.In order to improve on the timely delivery indicators, which includes the total delivery, combina-tions of inventory management policies and airport policies were examined. Based on the individualperformancesdestination prioritizationthrough use of off-airport storage anditem prioritizationon the most stressing relief type were chosen as the inventory management policies. These, if pairedwithadditional workerspolicies, were able to absolve the bottlenecks in the system up to the air-bridge. The combinations as such performed at the optimal range, considering the final constrainton the system and are preferable for implementation.The prioritization policies were the most useful, but require staff and their equipment to fullyperform. As such the processes in an airbridge system for the provision of relief items should con-sider the capacity at the regional airport and optimize the processes accordingly up to the airbridgeitself.","Airmile; Bottleneck Identification; Relief aid; Airports; Policies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Highly dynamic and time-dependent hydrodynamic features influence shipping routes. Due to the complex interactions between the horizontal tide, vertical tide, stratifying forces, wind-driven forces, and limited water-depth, shipping routes were previously only optimised for large scale routes (order of 1000 km). This study presents an algorithm that can optimise shipping routes that are influenced by these small scales (order of 10 km) hydrodynamic features. This algorithm uses graph theory to solve for the time-dependent fastest path between start and destination. Graph theory searches for the optimal path through a set of nodes that are connected with edges. This study uses the time-dependent shortest path algorithm which accounts for the FIFO-criteria (Waiting criteria) and can solve the non-convex nature of the problem<br/><br/>The input of this algorithm is a hydrodynamic model. These models are Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models that calculate currents and water levels in a specific domain. The domain is discretised into cells and nodes to calculate these hydrodynamic features. This study uses the nodes of this hydrodynamic model as the vertices of the graph. However, for some cases, the hydrodynamic model has too many nodes for the shortest path algorithm. This study presents a method for reducing the number of nodes without reducing the spatial resolution. The nodes are reduced based on a combination of the vorticity and the magnitude of the flow. <br/><br/>This algorithm is implemented in a python software package named Hydrodynamic Algorithm for Logistic enhancement Module (HALEM). HALEM can determine the optimal shipping route for a given hydrodynamic model. Defining different cost functions results in different optimisation purposes. This thesis presents cost functions for the fastest route, shortest route, cheapest route and least polluting route. This software is then implemented in the OpenCLSim software so that this combination of software can optimise routes of entire projects. A case study simulates a beach-nourishment at Schouwen Westkop Noord to demonstrate the practical use of HALEM and OpenCLSim. For this project, 425,500 m3 sand should be dredged offshore and pumped onto the beach. Due to the narrow gullies and tidal changes in hydrodynamic features, the routes were hard to predict. The simulation with HALEM and OpenCLSim shows an increase in the production with 21 % compared to the simulation with just OpenCLSim.<br","Route optimisation; Route planning; logistics; Simulation; Dredging; Digital-Twin; Operations research; Graph theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.911011, 4.546930"

In addition, more and more electrical appliances (e.g. electric vehicles, induction cookers, and heat pumps) are used as a substitute for appliances that need non-renewable energy sources. This increase in the use of renewable energy resources pushes the electricity grid to its limits due to new induced load peaks. The grid is not designed for these developments and as a result, asset deterioration, higher transport losses, and outages are expected to occur. The most straightforward solution for the distributed system operator, i.e. the operating manager of the distribution network, is to expand the grid. However, grid expansion is a costly operation and there are additional promising methods to decrease grid load peaks, e.g. by using different charging strategies for electric vehicles. The conventional charging strategy for electric vehicles is uncontrolled charging. With uncontrolled charging, the charging of the electric vehicle immediately commences once a connection with the charging pole is established. The smart charging strategy, however, is able to delay the charging moment to a more optimal time instant in view of, e.g. variable electricity prices. The vehicle-to-home (V2H) charging strategy is similar to smart charging, but in addition, the V2H strategy allows the electric vehicle to discharge electricity to power a nearby residential home. This research aims to compare smart charging and V2H charging on their economical effects for their users. The charging strategies are implemented using two control algorithms: a rule-based controller and a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. The rule-based controller is implemented due to its simplicity and the MPC algorithm is used for its ability to take into account predictions of system related variables, e.g. household loads. The MPC algorithm is implemented with two different forecasts namely, perfect information, i.e. uncertain variables are forecasted perfectly, and certainty equivalent, i.e. uncertain variables are predicted using a persistence forecast model. The persistence forecast model assumes that the future values of an uncertain variable remain equal to the latest measurements, e.g. the solar generation of tomorrow is expected to be equal to that of today. The control problem is non-linear as an electric vehicle behaves differently depending on its status, e.g. driving or charging. The control problem is therefore reformulated into a mixed logical dynamical framework such that it can be solved efficiently using mixed integer linear programming. An extensive comparison in performance for a microgrid case study is done using real data of solar generation, electric vehicles, and household loads for simulation. The results show that the V2H charging strategy can outperform smart charging by reducing both the peak loads and the electricity costs. However, the V2H strategy only gives a minor extra decrease in costs compared to smart charging and the performance of V2H charging is highly dependent on the quality of the forecasts. Therefore, it is concluded that, in practice, smart charging is the most effective charging strategy. Further research is done to investigate whether the microgrid costs, using a smart charging strategy, can be reduced further by taking into account the uncertainty of some variables such as the electricity price and the household load. This is implemented through a scenario-based MPC algorithm due to its ability to incorporate multiple forecasts, i.e. scenarios, for each uncertain variable. Six different scenario generation methods are implemented which are distinguished by two characteristics: the period from which the historical error between the certainty equivalent case and the true realization of the uncertain variable is collected (i.e. yearly, seasonal, or daily) and the addition method of these errors to the persistence forecast model to generate new scenarios, i.e. as a variable or as a constant. An extensive comparison in performance for a microgrid case study is done. The results show that the certainty equivalent MPC case can be outperformed if a low number of scenarios is generated.

With the bicycle as access and egress mode instead of walking, travellers can travel much larger distances to bus/tram/metro (BTM) stops and train stations while having about the same travel time. This will make it possible to use fewer BTM stops, stations and transit lines, which will save travel time and operational costs. However, to which extent does this occur? This thesis “Multimodal network with the bicycle as core” is made to know more about the effects of using the bicycle as access- and egress mode in a multimodal trip on aspects like travel time, modal split and operational costs. The main question is: To what extent does a multimodal passenger transport network with the bicycle as core reduce the total travel time for most travellers and increase the modal split for (multimodal) transit trips, without high investment- and operational cost. Based on the findings of the literature study and remaining research gaps, several theoretical scenarios were made. In these scenarios, different combinations of bicycle catchment radius values and (multilevel) BTM service outlines were made. After applying these combinations, its effects on the (experienced) travel time, (experienced) connection quality, and costs were calculated. The results indicated, that an ‘asymmetrical’ catchment area combined with an one-level BTM service outline created the most potential for applying into a multimodal network with the bicycle as core. When travellers have to travel to a BTM stop in the opposite direction of their direction, the catchment radius should be 1000 m. Larger radius values had a too high negative impact on the travel time. If the stop is in the same direction as the destination, a catchment radius of 2000 m still had a positive impact on the travel time. Also, the results confirm that a bicycle-transit trip combination creates a lower travel time and operational costs compared to walking. The last part was as case study called Utrecht Science Park (USP). In this case study, a multimodal network with the bicycle as core was designed for the USP and region east of the city Utrecht. The goal of this study was to test if a multimodal network with the bicycle as core was capable to lower the total travel time of multimodal trips and decrease the car-use for trips to the USP. Eventually, two alternatives were chosen plus a zero alternative. The simulation results showed a large decrease of the total travel time for trips to the USP with a bicycle-transit mode combination. Furthermore, the number of car trips decreased with more than 1000 car trips (from nearly 8000). This thesis showed that a multimodal network with the bicycle as core indeed creates a lower travel time and operational costs compared to walking as access and/or egress. Furthermore, it attracts travellers previously using the car as main trip mode.","Multimodal Network; Bicycle; Transit; access; egress; Catchment area; BTM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The research resulted in a roadmap for urban designers that explains four steps which could be taken to go for assignment to spatial intervention. The first step, named explore intention, involves a reflection on own motives and develops a definition of the value of connectivity. The second step is named adapt attitude and requires the development of an attitude towards residential diversity that does justice to its complexity. In the third step, analyse, urban conditions related to connectivity in residential diversity are explored.

This work specifically delves into the case of information extraction from videos, which is still an open challenge due to the combination of their semantic complexity and dynamic nature. The majority of the existing solutions are tailored for specific video categories and result in the creation of key frames time-lapses, video summaries, video overviews or highlight clips. In particular, this thesis project focuses on the case of highlights extraction from videos where one person speaks facing the camera. Automating the process of analysis of this specific kind of videos is important in the industrial context because it can be harnessed for several interesting applications, such as the automatic video summarisation of interviews or the automatic creation of personal video curricula vitae.<br/><br/>In this setting, the research objective is to investigate how Machine Learning can be deployed for the task of information extraction. From the target videos, multiple types of features can be extracted, such as textual features from the speech transcription; visual features from the facial expressions, head pose, eye gaze and hand gestures; audio features from the variations in the tone of the voice. ¬The exploitation of multimodal features enhances the capacity of Machine Learning algorithms. In fact, as proven in former research, the integration of multiple channels of information --- textual, audio, visual --- makes it possible to derive a more precise and greater amount of knowledge, just like humans exploit their multiple senses, in addition to experience, to make classifications or predictions. In this work, two approaches for multimodal information extraction from videos are investigated. The first approach is based on simple multimodal feature vectors concatenation, while the second approach exploits a recent deep architecture, the Memory Fusion Network by Zadeh, Amir, et al., to model both individual and combined temporal dynamics. To test the effectiveness of multimodal learning in the context of information extraction from videos, the two techniques are compared against a unimodal, content-based method, that relies on the summarisation of the video transcripts.<br/><br/>In order to train the multimodal approaches in a supervised fashion, a novel dataset based on videos of political speeches of well-known American politicians, the Political Speeches Dataset, was collected. The dataset is provided with binary saliency labels, that allow to identify the ground truth salient video segments. Four types of highlight clips are generated for each speech and evaluated through crowdsourcing. The results show that the quality of automatically created highlight clips is comparable to the ground truth, in terms of informativeness and ability to generate interest. Moreover, they also confirm that highlight clips generated with multimodal learning are more informative than the baseline. <br","Machine Learning; Multimodal Machine Learning; Video analysis; Highlights extraction; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-03","","","","Computer Science","",""

It was not clear what the impact of these systems would be on a yacht, the aim of this project is therefore to gain more insight into these topics. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact on both the design and operation of a superyacht using fuel cells for energy supply on board. To reach this objective, first a review of different fuel cells and fuel technologies was executed. These conclusions are used to develop a decision making tool which will help in choosing between the different types of fuel and fuel cell techniques. Finally the tool is used to select the best possible fuel cell solution, for this option the impact on the design and operation of a fully fuel cell powered yacht is determined. The report is split up into two different parts, where in the first the technological review is carried out while the second part focused on the design study.<br/><br/>In the first part a study was conducted into the status and characteristics of different fuel cell technologies and fuel storage solutions. Seven different types of fuel cells are investigated which can divided based on their operation temperatures (Low, Medium or High). Fourteen different types of fuels which are categorised as physical-, fuel- or material based hydrogen. The density of both separate systems were analysed and merged into a combined density for comparison reasons. Other factors which have been investigated are the: storage type, maturity, safety, and emissions. To be sure that a good choice can be made despite the many variables, these review subjects are used as decision criteria for the developed tool. In addition, the time influence on the density is taken into account by the adjustable time factor which is integrated in the tool. Specific preferences for a system can be given by changing the weighting factor for the different decision criteria. When changing the weight factors the order of all options will be rearranged by the tool, showing the ranking of the most promising solutions corresponding to the preferences of by the user.<br/>From this tool, it has become clear that a fuel cell solution should be specifically selected for any different type of application. A specific application could lead to the selection of a completely different type of technology, which is in contrast with a diesel combustion engine where only an appropriate size needs to be selected. <br/><br/>The second part focuses on the design study of a fuel cell powered yacht, whereby an Oceanco yacht was used as reference. The most promising fuel cell solution for this yacht was selected based on the decision making tool and selected weighting criteria, a high temperature PEM fuel cell powered by methanol turned out to be the best solution. In order to determine the influence of the conversion to fuel cells additional research has been performed towards other factors which have an impact on the design. The following subjects were considered: regulations, fuel cell characteristics, energy storage, propulsion and electrical distribution. From these topics, several important conclusions have emerged. First of all the regulations have a substantial impact on the design of a yacht. Secondly, the fuel and fuel cells itself require more space compared to the original configuration, and the fuel cells require a larger battery system to be able to follow the fluctuating load of a yacht. Lastly, it became clear that the use of fuel cells makes it possible to have some volume and efficiency gains when switching to PODs and a DC energy distribution system. A detailed design study based on these findings made clear that the yacht needed to become longer to fit all the required systems while keeping the functional requirements for the owners the same. Additionally the system changes corresponding to the fuel cell conversion resulted in an increase in terms of weight. These changes in length and weight turned out to have negligible change on the resistance of the yacht.<br/>There are some factors which have an impact on the operation of the yacht. One of these is the fact that the lifespan of the used fuel cell technology is lower than that of a diesel combustion engine. A well designed hybrid system and by using shore power as much as possible, could be used to stretch the expected lifetime. Another operational issue could be the fact that this fuel cell technology is not fully developed which could influence the operability of the fuel cells. In addition, the methanol used as fuel is not as widely available as diesel. Positive influences are the fact that the overall efficiency increases while reducing all emissions with 100% except for the CO2 emissions which will be 14-20% lower compared to a diesel engine. When using green methanol, the overall emissions of the yacht will be completely reduced since it will be CO2 neutral. Additional advantages of fuel cells are the added comfort due to low noise and operation without any vibrations as well as an increased redundancy because of the modular design of the fuel cells.","Superyacht; Fuel cells; Alternative fuels; Design impact; Marine Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-02","","","","Marine Technology","",""

However, in the early design phases of a project long computational times are undesirable. Therefore the problem statement of this Master thesis concerns the development of a practical engineering tool which can be used in the early design phase of a vibration sensitive laboratory structure. The resulting tool is called EDDABuSgs (Early Design Dynamic Analysis of Building Structures by Gerwin Schut) and is the final product of the thesis research. The main focus of EDDABuSgs is on structural vibrations induced by heavy traffic at geological locations with soft soils (e.g. Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The thesis research concerns the four interrelating parts: source of vibrations (truck), transmission of vibrations (soil), soil-structure interaction and the structure (receiver of vibrations). The software FEMIX is used for computing the 3D soil response (source and transmission). The soil response is then used as input for EDDABuSGS, which computes the 2D structural vibrations by the aid of a Python script. The global structural response is computed from a rigid 3DoF system which is supported elastically by the soil and a pile foundation. The local structural response (ground floor) is computed from a flexible frame, composed of the analytical solutions of Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. The flexible frame is excited by the global 3DoF structural response by means of the boundary- and interface conditions. The results of FEMIX and EDDABuSgs show good agreement with the used verification projects. Several iterations have been made using EDDABuSgs to see how several parameters change the 2D structural response. The results of these iterations are well in line with general known theory about structural dynamics. From this Master thesis research one can conclude that soft soils excited by heavy traffic have a responsive frequency spectrum generally in-between 3 and 15 Hz. Therefore it generally holds that the eigenfrequencies of the global building response should be made relatively low (&lt; 3 Hz), while the eigenfrequencies of the local structural elements (e.g. floors) should be made relatively high (&gt; 12 Hz). Additionally, the resistance against vibrations (impedances) of the structural elements should to be as large as possible, which might sometimes contradict the preferred shift of the eigenfrequencies.","Structural Dynamics; Structural engineering; Soil Dynamics; Traffic induced vibrations; Dynamic Analysis; Early Design Stage; Python; Soil-structure interaction; Concrete; Eigenfrequencies; Impedance; EDDABuSgs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-02","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","Early Design Dynamic Analysis of Building Structures",""

In this thesis, an extensive simulation study has been conducted using a new Operator based linearisation simulator (DARTS) on a geological model of the Delft Sandstone Member within the West Netherlands Basin (a prolific geothermal reservoir). The first section of the study outlines the construction of a representative geological model of the Delft Sandstone in Petrel using core, well log and seismic data.<br/>The model is quality checked by comparing derived model values with both values recorded in the literature and data from well tests. Following this, a sensitivity and uncertainty study was conducted which examines the effect of changing a wide range of model values and inputs on the thermal<br/>performance of production wells. A well placement study was then implemented, examining how well configuration, orientation and distance can affect well performance. Finally, a considerable section of the thesis investigates the role of non-reservoir lithologies in geothermal reservoir simulation and how the heat transfer from these lithologies can be accounted for utilising multi-scale<br/>upscaling. The findings of the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis suggest that the primary uncertainty for simulation in the Delft Sandstone is the porosity and intrinsically linked permeability, with the value and spatial distribution of these properties having the largest effect on thermal performance of wells (10’s of years difference in thermal breakthrough). From the well placement study, it was found that different well configurations performed variably according to local reservoir conditions (especially reservoir dip) and that optimum configuration should be decided on a case-by-case basis. It was also found that both well separation/interference and orientation have a key role in controlling the thermal productivity of wells. Finally, the section on non-reservoir lithologies finds that firstly, thermal recharge of injected water from these rocks can have a very large effect on thermal breakthrough time (10’s of years for low N/G reservoir) and must not be ignored in geothermal simulations and secondly,<br/>of the three multi-scale upscaling methods implemented to more efficiently simulate conductive heat flux from the non-reservoir rocks, only multiple sub-region upscaling shows significant promise in terms of accurately accounting for heat flux and significantly reducing the number of grid cells.

A new problem arises with the development of additively manufactured complex orthopedic metal implants. In spite of the advantages that come with patient specific implants to cure the most critical orthopedic situations, these implants are inherent to infection susceptibility. Currently, no study has shown deposition on such complex implants, therefore this research aims to make the first steps towards an antibacterial coating deposited on additively manufactured complex implants to fight peri implant infections. This is facilitated by means of electrophoretic deposition. In order to develop homogeneous deposition of a chitosan/gelatin based coating loaded with vancomycin or gentamicin on titanium implants, a state-of-the-art setup was used, containing a cylindrical counter electrode surrounding the complex specimen. After parameter optimization, in vitro release behaviour, cell viability assays and antibacterial tests were performed, in order to investigate the biological behaviour of the coating. The release behaviour, which was dependent on coating degradation, showed a burst release after one day followed by sustained release up to day seven. Specimen including antibiotics showed antibacterial effect against S. Aureus. While all planktonic bacteria where eradicated, biofilm formation by adherent bacteria was significantly decreased, however not prevented. Cell viability assay showed bacterial adherence and growth, with an increased rate in the gentamicin samples, potentially caused by the high hydrophilicity of this drug. While an in vivo study is suggested to obtain more in-depth insights in the biological behaviour of the coating, this method is suggested to be a successful way to create a homogeneous coating against peri implant infections on complex implants, preventing peri implant infections, to reduce the change of patient specific implant revision.","metal implants; additive manufacturing; antibacterial coating; patient specific implant; antibiotic release; complex orthopedic implant; electrophoretic deposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-10","","","","Biomedical Engineering","LSHM18026",""

The existing infrastructure and the transportation activities are studied and modeled as an online optimization problem with simultaneously vehicle routing and container-to-mode assignment. A characteristic of great importance in the problem is the uncertainty element that reflects in the requested appointment times that have to be confirmed by another agent in the network. An online optimization approach is proposed, where the input data come in sequentially and decisions have to be made in between, because new information becomes available only after the decision has been made. At each decision moment, the uncertainty element is converted to an offline optimization problem by disregarding the uncertainty or by simulating various potential future scenarios. Subsequently, the problem is modeled as a multi-commodity network design problem on a time-space graph. Four different solution methods are developed in order to solve the online optimization problem. Three confirmation based methods concern a model in which the uncertainty element is partially disregarded, by assuming that each requested appointment time will be scheduled at a specific time relative to the requested one. Alternatively, a much more complex method is developed in which various future scenarios are simulated for the requested appointment times given their probability vector. The simulation based model seeks robust solutions that are resistant to change, i.e., feasible and (sub)optimal for every potential future scenario that has been simulated. Using randomly generated (but realistic) instances, the computational results show that the proposed simulation model surpasses the simpler models both in terms of outcomes, robustness and reliability. However, the practical relevance is somewhat restricted in the sense that the model is built on several assumptions.","Intermodal transport; Synchromodal transport; Online optimization; Multi-period time window; Simulation algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","CoMet-PS",""

On the basis of a preliminary study, the investigation focused on the development of a suitable conducting layer at the electrolyte/electrode interface as well as the development and control of a hole extraction layer, based on the device electronic structure and energy levels matching. Research was conducted into the properties of various prospective materials that could improve charge carrier transport at the electrolyte/photoelectrode interface. Once the optimal configuration is determined, the photoelectrode and redox couples are prepared and characterized and the photocharging performance of the device is optimized. Furthermore, the control of the formation conditions of a hole extraction layer took place, in order to yield improved internal charge carrier separation and transport. Various hole transport layers were assessed in SRFB system in relation to the photo-charging performance. The described process resulted in the development of a conducting layer through the growth of well distributed islands, which led to a high solar-to-chemical conversion of 9.4%. Through the control of the formation conditions of the hole extraction layer, better spatial separation of the photogenerated charge carriers was achieved, leading to improved device performance. Despite the enhanced viability of each device in terms of efficiency, further research into the long-term stability is essential for its practical implementation. This mainly relates to electrolyte degradation to form solid precipitates and photocorrosion of the absorber semiconductor materials in acidic conditions.","Solar Redox Flow Battery; Photoelectrode; Photoelectrochemical cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (graduation committee); Koops, L.S.W. (graduation committee); Keusters, Guus (graduation committee); van Veen, Pim (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Construction projects are argued to be the most complex of all production undertakings (Baccarini, 1996). Williams (2002, 2005) states that the complexity of these projects is a contributing factor to project failures, such as cost overrun, which are commonly seen in infrastructure project (Cantarelli, Molin, Van Wee, &amp; Flyvbjerg, 2012). As one of the first Morris &amp; Hough (1988) describe that cost overruns are common and that many projects appear as failures, while Flyvbjerg et al. (2003) agrees with Morris &amp; Hough, by stating that this is a long-lasting problem since cost estimates have not improved and cost escalations have not decreased in the past 70 years. However, between the 1990s and 2000s, western governments were reassessed and more tasks were privatized (England &amp; Ward, 2007; Pollit &amp; van Thiel, 2007). Governments expected that private contractors would be able to innovate more, deliver quicker, reduce costs, and operate more efficient (Savas, 2000) resulting in integrated contract types. This research aims to provide insight into the relationship between the contract type and the management of cost groups, in Dutch national infrastructure projects in order to improve cost management. To provide an answer to the main research question, a literature study has been performed followed by a statistical analysis of 68 infrastructure projects with contract types including, RAW (n=24), E&amp;C (n=22), and D&amp;B(M) (n=22). Combined with the expectations of the expert panel this study concludes that there is no relation between the contract types RAW, E&amp;C, and D&amp;B(M) and the cost management of Dutch national infrastructure projects. However, it has been observed that project members of a contractor overestimate the relationship that D&amp;B(M) projects should have higher cost overruns. This study concludes that the cost performance, of cost groups other than engineering, differ insignificantly and marginally small between contract types with varying design responsibilities. Moreover, the expert panel assumes that more information leads to less uncertainty and risks resulting in less cost overruns. Which is a common reasoning as stated in the GWW market analysis performed by McKinsey. However, this study concludes that the unavailability of information depending on the moment of contracting does not have an influence on the uncertainty of the cost performance nor the cost performance itself. Therefore, this study does not believe that the “two-phase-process” as proposed by McKinsey will contribute to less uncertainty about the cost performance. Instead, this study illustrates that Dura Vermeer confidently applies percentages to estimate relatively small, often process-related indirect cost groups which on average incur a cost overrun. Therefore, both the client and contractor should improve the process of constructing large complex infrastructure projects in order to improve the cost performance.","integrated contracts; Cost Performance; Cost Overruns; project control; Cost Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Then the Brownian bridge method is introduced and applied, which allows for improvements computational wise. Finally, fully collateralized exposures are modeled in the presence of the Margin Period of Risk, with the Least Squares Monte Carlo method in the case of one European call option under Black-Scholes assumptions.","Margin Period of Risk; CVA; XVA; Fully collateralized exposures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Aviation is a large contributor to anthropogenic climate change through its emissions, particularly through nitrogen oxides (NOx), which reacts to Ozone in the atmosphere. Due to the emission of NOx, the ozone budget of the atmosphere is disturbed which results in an increase in the Earth’s surface temperature. To mitigate this effect, the variability of NOx and ozone due to aviation must be properly understood, which can be assessed through measurements in the atmosphere. NOx from aviation has been successfully measured in fresh plumes of aircraft, however, research has pointed out that the variability of ozone in the atmosphere is rather high, making it doubtful whether the perturbation due to aviation is detectable except under specific meteorological conditions such as high-pressure systems. This thesis assesses whether there is a correlation between high-pressure systems and the concentration of NOx from aviation and its produced ozone in those systems. With the result of this assessment recommendations are formulated which aid in designing future measurement campaigns of ozone from aviation.","aviation; NOx; ozone; weather; effects; correlation; weather pattern","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In aircraft maintenance, performance of routine maintenance tasks is prone to generate additional non-routine tasks. These non- routine tasks relate to solving an unexpected issue and have specific requirements in terms of materiel, tools and manpower. In existing research regarding optimization of aircraft maintenance environments and schedules, these requirements are assumed to be in place or not considered at all. In real-life, the required resources may not be in place and retrieving them is subject to human interactions and decision-making, potentially resulting in delays in the maintenance schedule. This research proposes a novel methodology to address this problem by developing a multi-agent automated negotiation model capable of simulating negotiations related to the procurement of required aircraft materials in order to perform non-routine tasks. The proposed model explores its applicability by incorporating several negotiation strategies, adaptive parameters and negotiation circumstances, e.g. urgency. The main research question is: In the context of non-routine aircraft maintenance materiel availability, to what extent can multi- agent automated negotiation be applied to explore effective agent strategies for various negotiation circumstances regarding the procurement of aircraft components and expendables? The proposed methodology has shown to be very suitable for modelling negotiation circumstances as evaluation of the model’s performance has resulted in understanding and recommendations to policy makers concerning what strategy to apply in which circumstance. Variations of circumstances have lead to expected findings, e.g. increasing urgency results in a sooner delivery of materials, whereas in other situations the model’s KPIs are unaffected by parameter variations, unexpectedly.","Agent-based Modelling; Resource Availability; Multi-attribute Extended Contract Net Protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These stochastic forcing conditions consist of time series with significant wave heights, peak wave periods, wave directions, and water levels. The basis of the method for generating these stochastic forcing conditions are Autoregressive-Moving Average (ARMA) models. The morphological change of the beach width due to these stochastic forcing conditions is modelled using an XBeach model. This results in a range of the possible development of the beach width, with the probability of occurrence. With the method examined in this study, a more realistic idea of the possible future beach width development can be given.","XBeach; Stochastic modelling; Hondsbossche dunes; ARMA models; Latin Hypercube; Nourishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","52.726079, 4.636397"
