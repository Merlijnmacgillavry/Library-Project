(mentor); Driegen, F.J. (mentor)","2017","The current developments in the world result in increasing tensions between different countries. This increasing tension requires materials that are available when needed. Major budget cuts have resulted in the disposal of six multipurpose frigates which has reduced the total amount of frigates owned by the Royal Netherlands Navy from twelve to six. Because of this significant reduction, a high availability of the remaining frigates and oceangoing patrol vessels is required. However, the availability of these vessels is not sufficient at the moment. In this research a suitable definition for the term 'availability' was found in the term 'operational availability' which is a function of the maintenance process. With this definition the operational availability of the multipurpose frigates, air defence and command frigates and oceangoing patrol vessels was calculated. The calculation showed that the operational availability of these ships does not meet the operational availability requirements. The maintenance process was analysed by using the Delft Systems Approach to determine the problems that cause the low operational availability of the ships. The analysis showed a significant amount of problems that influence the operational availability of the ships in a negative way. This study developed a continual process improvement dashboard that can be used by the Royal Netherlands Navy as a tool to improve the operational availability of their existing ships. Besides that, the dashboard can also be used in the design process of a new ship class to achieve the desired operational availability for the new ships.","Operational Availability; Delft Systems Approach; Continuous Process Improvement; Royal Netherlands Navy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

These models enable quantification of the effects on enhanced safety against flooding and on environmental impact over time, based on physical processes such as hydrodynamics and sediment transport. The Sand Engine is a mega-scale nourishment pilot along the Dutch coast with a substantial sub-aerial surface and significant aeolian sediment transport, which highlights the need to integrate aeolian sediment transport and dry beach changes in current morphodynamic models. An explicit objective of the Sand Engine emphasizes this need: its dune area should increase by natural processes in the coming years, a process linked to aeolian sediment transport. In order to accurately model the morphological evolution of the Sand Engine, a model incorporating both morphodynamics and aeolian sediment transport is preferable. However, morphodynamics and aeolian sediment transport interact and the dynamics of the bathymetry and the water line cause the physical interface between sub-aerial and sub-aqueous processes to be highly variable both in space and time, making it complex to model the (lower) beach and the nearshore zone. Current morphodynamicmodels such as Delft3D FlexibleMesh (FM) only take into account hydrodynamic forces as drivers for sediment transport and do not resolve bed changes on the dry beach. Vice versa aeolian sediment transport models as AeoLiS do not include hydrodynamics and subaquaeous sediment transport. Recent developments in model couplings allow implementing the interaction between morphodynamics and aeolian sediment transport.","coastal morphodynamics; aeolian; sediment transport; process-based modelling; model coupling; Delft3D; AeoLiS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.051911, 4.183558"

Businesses provide online personalized services within their ecosystem based on customer data, but at the same time, customers are reluctant to share personal information. In this article, an online trust building tool is proposed to increase customer’s willingness to share information. A conceptual model is constructed on the relationship between customers sharing information in an online context and businesses providing online personalized services. Customer conditions for information sharing from the conceptual model are validated by a survey under a selection of Transavia airlines’ customers. After conducting a principal component and linear regression analysis, it is found that these customers do not necessarily find monetary or non-monetary benefits the most important conditions for online sharing information. Moreover, gender and age do not have influence. The factor that appears most important for sharing information relates to trust. Customers with a higher general trust and higher institutional trust, are willing to share more personal information with the company. Therefore, literature on trust building is reviewed and four trust building principles are constructed: experience, security, transparency, and trusted sources. For each of the principles, constructs are identified in literature and validated by exploratory customer interviews. The list of constructs is the input for a trust building tool for companies to increase their online trustworthiness. The tool is a basis for a discussion with businesses. These discussions can create insights in how a business can become more trustworthy in the eyes of the customer, and can as a result lead to gaining more customer information.","Personal Information Sharing; Online Personalization; Trust Building; Business Ecosystem; Customer Values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","SEPAM / Engineering, Systems and Services, SEC / Applied Physics, Science Communication","","Track, Applied Sciences, MSc.

(mentor); Zuninga, M. (mentor); Hauff, C. (mentor)","2017","Visible Light Communication has been intriguing both the industry and the academia for over a decade. However, most of the research efforts in this area only consider scenarios where the light emitted from the transmitters is constant. This is not true when Smart Lighting, a technology designed for more comfortable and energy efficient buildings by adjusting the illumination of fixtures based on ambient light availability, is involved. Under the smart lighting, the changes of fixtures’ illumination affect the communication links significantly. Therefore, new methods must be proposed for a revolutionary co-design of smart lighting and communication for the visible light networks. This project proposes SmartVLC, a system that can optimize the through- put (benefit communication) while maintaining the LEDs’ primary illumin- ation function (benefit smart lighting). A new modulation scheme Adaptive Multiple Pulse Position Modulation (AMPPM) is proposed to support fine- grained dimming levels and optimize the throughput under each dimming level via pattern multiplexing. An algorithm is also designed to adjust the LEDs’ dimming level smoothly. The proposed AMPPM and the LEDs’ il- lumination adaptation algorithm are implemented into a low-cost platform. The performance of SmartVLC is evaluated under both static and dynamic scenarios. The current version of SmartVLC supports a communication dis- tance of 3.6 m and a throughput of 107 Kbps in an indoor environment. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, the performance gain of SmartVLC can reach up to 190%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software Group","",""

Procedural modeling has been increasingly used to create such road networks. However, many procedural methods are complex and difficult to master by non-experts, often have a limited and hard-to-control expressive range, and require a variety of specialized input data to generate a complex road network. To mitigate this, some methods proposed to use stochastic data on road patches extracted from example maps to design a road network following a given urban style. We propose a novel patch-based method that uses the semantics of individual patches to help guiding the procedural generation. Our approach combines the advantages of patch-based generation with those of conventional parametric-based methods. Due to the intuitive character of semantic parameters and tags, our approach provides for an easy customization of fictive road network creation, allowing a user to easily define various types of road network styles, containing only the desired features and structures of real-world road networks.","Patch-based network generation; Procedural content generation; Urban modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","In this thesis the alignment of speech behavior between team members of small group meetings (3-8 people) and its relation to team cohesion is studied. Since team cohesion is highly related to effectiveness and productivity, automatically estimating cohesion can be a useful tool for assessing the meeting quality. This information can be fed back to the meeting groups with the goal of improving meeting quality. Research within social sciences suggests that participants of a meeting put larger effort in aligning their speech behavior when they like each other more and when they are more committed to the common task. We therefore hypothesize that non-verbal speech alignment is positively related to both constructs of team cohesion, social and task cohesion. We propose a novel method of quantifying group-level alignment of non-verbal speech behavior, namely, voice intensity, pitch, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and speech rate. The resulting quantifications of non-verbal speech alignment are used to estimate high and low social and task cohesive regions. This is the first study examining alignment within prosodic cues on a group level, instead of a dyadic (one-to-one) level. In total, more than 20 hours of naturalistic group meetings were recorded and examined. As a measure for cohesion, a behavioral approach was followed, in which the cohesion levels were objectively quantified using verbal expressions. As cohesion is known to be inherently temporal, a dynamic methodology was pursued quantifying the alignment of speech on small time windows. By extracting three features solely related to the alignment of prosodic speech behavior, it was found that 2-minute high and low social cohesive regions could be classified with 0.72 Area under the ROC curve. The results imply that the alignment of speech behavior between the different participants in a meeting is a strong indicator for the team cohesion. This result holds for small naturalistic group meetings, implying that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting prosodic speech alignment on a group level. Predicting task cohesion was more challenging, an accuracy of 0.64 Area under the ROC curve was obtained. This performance was better than the Area under the ROC curve obtained with features related to turn-taking patterns (AUC). It appears that social cohesion is more openly expressed by behavior than task cohesion is. This insight accentuates the importance of distinguishing in social and task cohesion, instead of integrating them as one construct ""team cohesion"". Further analysis is needed to draw firm conclusions about the underlying behavior examined and how exactly the dynamics of the meeting are related to group outcomes as productivity and meeting satisfaction.","Social signal processing; Cohesion; Small group meetings; Mimicry; Group conversation analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Vision / Pattern Recognition","","Signals and Systems, Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","An interesting concept related to photovoltaic energy is Concentrated Photovoltaics (CPV), in which sunlight is focussed on a PV cell through lenses and mirrors, thereby increasing the incident irradiance on the PV cell. Solar concentration is proven to not only increase the output power of PV cells, but also to increase the electrical efficiency of PV cells. This concept is expected to further push PV energy to the scale of MW power plants for large-scale energy production, and increase the power density of standalone PV modules on Earth and in space. Increasing the irradiation on a PV cell inevitably also increases the temperature of the PV cell due to thermal losses. Cell temperature has a negative effect on the output power and electrical efficiency of a PV cell, and given a high enough concentration ratio, may cause the PV cell to lose electrical efficiency and ultimately break down. Adequate cooling is therefore required for CPV systems to keep the PV cell in its optimal operating temperature range. For this purpose a model is proposed that simulates the output characteristics under influence of solar concentration and temperature variations, most notably the output power and electrical efficiency of a PV cell. The electro-thermal model is fundamentally based on the detailed balance model, which dictates that the absorbed and emitted photon flux must be equal in equilibrium conditions. From detailed balance, the absorption, recombination and photo-generation processes in a PV cell are determined, from which the Shockley-Queisser limit is deduced. This fundamental model is extended to the single-diode model, which serves as the ultimate baseline of PV simulation, taking into account cell temperature, concentration ratio and other internal PV cell factors. Sensitivity analyses on the single-diode model show that solar concentration indeed increases the output power and electrical efficiency. Taking into account solar concentration and temperature effects however, shows that the electrical efficiency drops by 4% points at a concentration ratio of 20, thereby confirming that without cooling, increasing the solar concentration on a PV cell will yield lower electrical efficiencies due to thermal effects. Laboratory experiments are conducted on an Emcore 3J gallium-arsenide PV cell (DUT) to verify the electro-thermal model. Baseline tests are conducted using a calibrated light source, and secondary tests involving a secondary light source are performed at controlled ambient and elevated temperatures. These results show that the model has a fit of 98.9% with respect to the verified specifications of the DUT PV cell at an ambient temperature of 25 ◦C. At an elevated cell temperature of 60 ◦C, discrepancies exist between the simulated single-diode model and test results. A new in-plane heat conduction concept developed by Airbus NL called Hiper is added to the test set-up to assess its suitability in conjunction with a heat radiator for PV cells. Hiper is a novel thin-film material particularly suited to spread heat effectively over a surface, from which it can be dissipated using a radiating material. Experimental results show that heat is spread slightly more effectively with Hiper, than in the same test set-up without Hiper, highlighting its heat spreading capabilities.","Photovoltaic concentrator cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Egineering","",""

The proposed sample strategy aims to sample with uniform prediction errors, as opposed to uniform intervals. This signal-agnostic strategy is tested upon data from traffic flow, a wireless sensor node, and a position trace obtained with a mobile phone. A reduction in the root mean squared error ranging from 0 to 50 percent compared to uniform sampling was achieved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Embedded Software","",""

(mentor)","2017","Due to the expected depletion of fossil fuels, the development of renewable sources of energy has gotten a lot of attention over the past years. Wind energy, and in specific offshore wind energy, is considered to be one of the most promising sources of renewable energy for the future. Although the costs associated with offshore wind energy are declining they have not reached cost competitive levels yet. The costs have declined due to the improvements of the technology of the components and experts claim that further cost reduction can be achieved by improving the installation process of offshore wind farms. The conventional method used for the installation of offshore wind turbines is the component-wise installation method. This method transports and installs the turbines in three parts, being the tower, a pre-assembled rotor-nacelle construction and three separate blades. A relatively new way used to install offshore wind turbines is the pre-assembled installation method. This method transports and installs the wind turbines in their fully assembled form. In this study the pre-assembled method will be examined in order to see how it compares to the conventional component-wise method in terms of time required for and cost associated with the installation of offshore wind turbines. The information necessary for the comparison has been gathered through literature as well as by contacting companies specialized in the relevant parts of the offshore branch. After the data was collected two different simulation models have been created in Matlab. The first simulation model is based on the workability of the installation vessels and the second, more advanced model is based on Markov chains. Both simulation models are used to simulate the process of installing the offshore wind turbines, taking into account parameters regarding the wind farm as well as parameters regarding the installation vessels. Both Matlab models are capable of simulating the time required for the installation of the offshore wind turbines regarding the component-wise as well as the pre-assembled installation method. The simulations regarding the installation times are used in combination with cost related data, gathered through literature as well as by interviewing an expert from a cost engineering company, to make a comparison based on the costs. Using the results of the cost comparison a preferable installation method can be appointed, depending on the distance between the offshore wind farm and port.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2017","The European Union has set its goal to produce at least 20 percent of the gross final consumption of energy from renewable energy sources by the year 2020. This ambitious measurement was taken to reduce the anthropogenic GHG emissions in order to mitigate the consequences of climate change. The economic and technical oriented strategies to accelerate renewable energy implementation have shown little success in the inclusion of renewable energy technology as a main harvest of energy. In the Netherlands, the energy sector has a history of a top-down energy system with generation and distribution of energy from fossil fuels. For the last decades, private energy companies were the only project developers of renewable energy projects. The top-down decision-making has been tagged as being unfair at the moment of allocating costs and benefits towards local communities where energy projects are developed.As a result, a growing number of communities have organized themselves as renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) to provide a bottom-up and collective solutions to their local needs and global environmental issues. Renewable Energy Cooperatives (RECs) are a bottom up group of actors that adopted a cooperative in a legal and organizational form who invest in renewable energy projects. There is a present need to recognize the balance of environmental, social and economic benefits and costs of RECs and so, we need to understand the real impact these organizations create beyond the rhetoric. The main research question is posed as How do RECs generate and manage social, environmental and economic value and what are the lessons learned for RECs and its main stakeholders? Drawing on current literature, this research empirically dives into the identification of social, environmental and economic values that are created on behalf of these organizations. Furthermore, this research is interested in determining how negative value creation is managed against the creation of positive value. This research makes use of the theory of sustainable business models to develop the analytical framework. Bocken et. al (2015) developed a basic framework which was further conceptualized and adjusted for the REC business models. The inclusion of mission & vision, knowledge as value, strategic network, innovative roles & practices, value missed and value destroyed. Additionally, this sustainable business model framework recognizes a wider definition of value and a larger range of stakeholders that accommodate to answer the main research question. The analytical framework also serves as a tool to collect data and process the gathered information. The empirical research consists in the study of four diverse renewable energy cooperatives in the Netherlands with diverse business model. Type of members, technology used, value chain and lifetime were the different criteria used to select the four cases. Each was analyzed separately and later compared in a cross-case analysis. The main findings include that RECs create and destroy value in the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. Democracy, conservation of the natural environment,autonomy and procedural justice, are some of the values that are created and captured by stakeholders in the socio-technical system of RECs. As these organizations prioritize social and environmental value creation, the economic value captured is used as a mechanism to mitigate the social value creation. Acceptance of renewables and conservation are the consistent values destroyed among RECs. Wind energy projects have demonstrated to be value-laden projects as they create and destroy more value than solar energy projects. Finally, collaboration with energy companies has demonstrated to yield unique value creation in terms of innovation and competence. The main research question is complete by developing recommendations to RECs, policymakers and energy companies, which are considered to be key actors around the practice of RECs. The framework developed in this research is proposed as a tool to maximize the value creation of RECs.","Renewable energy cooperatives; sustainable business models; value creation; bottom-up; grassroots innovations; social innovation; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The grasping of objects is a highly desired function for service robots. To aid with grasping, researchers have developed grasping approaches. A demerit of existing approaches is that they solely focus on the grasp finding. A more important part in grasping is the grasp execution, which involves the solving of a motion planning problem. Currently, 23 sampling-based motion planners can be chosen from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) within MoveIt!, a ROS framework that provides the tools for motion planning. However, no recommendations for selecting a specific planner for high performance is given. Moreover, difficulties in real-world grasp executions are typically not outlined in existing grasping approaches. In this thesis high-performing planners are selected for grasp executions and difficulties in performing such executions in a real-world setup are outlined. The performance of the planners was analyzed by means of solved runs, computing time and path length. Three lightweight manipulators with different characteristics have been chosen to collect reliable data on planner performance. Various grasp executions have been defined with individual goals. One grasp execution incorporated a motion constraint that demands a specific orientation of the gripper. To achieve maximum performance, the parameters of the planners have been optimized. For a grasp execution which starts moving in a confined space towards an open space, high performance was found with mono-directional tree-based planners with goal bias, such as EST, ProjEST, KPIECE and STRIDE. For a grasp execution which starts moving from an open space towards a confined space, bi-directional planners with lazy collision-checking (SBL and LBKPIECE) yielded highest performance. In the investigated grasp execution that incorporates a motion constraint, high performance was obtained with the BiEST planner. The experimental setup for real-world grasp execution was realized with modified ROS packages. Difficulties in real-world grasp executions exist due to inaccurate depth data, small errors in extrinsic calibration and the lack of verification of a grasp execution using an automatic command.","Motion planning; OMPL; ROS; grasping; grasp execution; Moveit!","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Design","","","",""

(mentor); Farah, H. (mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2017","Current research on automated vehicles focuses mainly on the drivers of automated vehicles, on its potential to improve the efficiency of traffic operations, safety, congestion and societal benefits, public’s acceptance of automated vehicles as a transport system and the willingness to buy automated vehicles. Nevertheless, there is a research gap in an equally important topic of research; the interactions of the automated vehicles with Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), i.e., cyclists and pedestrians. The WEpods (shuttle buses) are the first automated pods on public roads amidst other traffic, for an extended period of time in the province of Gelderland, in the Netherlands. The main research question revolves around the safety perception of vulnerable road users (VRUs) when interacting with automated vehicles, specifically at unsignalised intersections, and their crossing behaviour in comparison with traditional motor vehicles. The data on road users’ perception was gathered through face-to-face interviews (𝑁 = 22), a focus group (𝑁 = 8), and an online survey (𝑁 = 198). The results of this research showed that in terms of perceived safety, in general, VRUs (pedestrians and cyclists) feel significantly safer when sharing the road with the WEpods (max. speed of 15 𝑘𝑚/ℎ) compared to traditional motor vehicles (max. speed of 30 𝑘𝑚/ℎ). However, cyclists reported feeling less safe when interacting at unsignalised intersections with the automated vehicles, while there was not significant effect on pedestrians. Similarly, pedestrians more often opted for crossing facilities in the presence of the WEpods than in the presence of traditional motor vehicles (this can be interpreted as the result of perhaps feeling less safe), while no significant difference was reported for cyclists. Some of the reasons that could explain the trust in the WEpods are its low operational speed and the trust of most (81.1%) of the VRUs in the automated technology. This makes them expect the WEpods will stop in all possible instances, even when other traffic participants violate traffic rules. Surprisingly, a significant proportion (63.2%) of the participants were not aware of the presence of the steward on board of the WEpods. On the other hand, variables such as the awareness of the steward and having interacted with the WEpods increased the perceived safety amongst VRUs. Moreover, eye contact and gestures use as part of the actual interaction with human drivers of traditional motor vehicles particularly when crossing, was reported to be of importance by the respondents and has also been previously reported in the literature. The VRUs who said that they rely on cues given by drivers, more often indicated a preference to cross at dedicated facilities in the presence of the WEpods than those who stated not to depend on this type of communication. In order to substitute this lack of “real” interaction, information about the WEpods’ operations appeared to be desired by most of the participants in the form of visual information or a mix of auditory and visual. Finally, it was found that individual characteristics of the VRUs, such as their gender and other demographic variables could also have an impact on their perceived safety of VRUs interacting with the WEpods. The findings of this research point at a cautious attitude of cyclists and pedestrians in their interaction with automated vehicles.

(mentor)","2017","Solar landfills are an emerging and promising concept in which PV systems are installed on closed landfills to combine renewable energy production with efficient use of contaminated land. This study focuses on such an application on the VBM (Verwerking Bedrijfsafvalstoffen Maasvlakte) landfill in Maasvlakte, Rotterdam. The PAS (PV Afdichting op Stortplaatsen) project was setup on the landfill to develop an approved model of a PV integrated landfill cover. This project involves a field test performed on the south slope of the VBM landfill to test the feasibility of two types of PV integrated landfill covers: the ‘flexible geo-PV solution/HyET system’ consisting of a white TPO (Thermoplastic polyolefin) with flexible HyET thin film modules glued on top of it and the ‘glass PV solution/ Soltronergy system’ consisting of Mitsubishi glass encapsulated thin film modules mounted on a steel anchoring frame. The purpose of this research was to analyze the results from the field test, model them in PVsyst and design a large scale PV plant on the south slope of the VBM landfill. The results from the field test concluded that the HyET system was more feasible for the application on the VBM landfill. A detailed model of the two systems was made in PVsyst. The default model parameters for PV modules and module temperatures were checked for suitability to the measured value and then optimized separately. The final optimized models were validated with the data measured on the field test. Finally a large scale PV plant was designed to cover 7 hectares of land on the south slope of the VBM landfill using the HyET thin film modules. Simulations for the design were done in PVsyst using the optimized model of the HyET modules. The final design for the PV plant consisted of 20160 HyET 55 Wp modules, capable of producing annual energy output of 1110 MWh/year.The energy produced from the PV plant is planned be used for the operation of the water treatment plant on the east side of the landfill. The total energy consumed by the water treatment plant is 1256 MWh/year. On an annual basis, the energy produced by the PV plant can cover 88% of the consumption.","thin film; PV system design; Landfills","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-05-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Sustainable Energy Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Wormgoor, R. (mentor)","2017","The assignment was compiled by the student itself without a company involvement. It originated from the student its observation that there seemed to be very little style variation in guitar amplifier design. The formulation of this observation with the objective to find a new style for this product category, evolving from the traditional style, was the starting point of this graduation project. In the event to create a new style it was first tried to define and explain the traditional style. Worth mentioning is that the traditional style has hardly changed since the very first guitar amplifiers in the late 1930’s. History analysis was done and the first part in finding answers on how the traditional style, and lack of other styles, was created and remained unchanged for so long. The second part that provided insight in this matter was an analysis on product value. How the appearance, thus the design and style of a product, has an important influence on the perception of value. Literature explained how consumer behaviour is influenced by qualities of a product that do not directly fulfil the primary need for the user. Examples are brand identity, brand loyalty, marketing, also social aspects as the influence of famous idols or close friends, and of course for this project, the style of a product. Studies showed that these, sometimes even intangible, product qualities can be most decisive for a consumer its choice between products. This was an important step in the answer to how it is possible a product category changed so little in its appearance over a few decades. This was further explained in literature about the influence of context on the perception of a person. Product meaning, or product identity, is something that is created by a person. The literature explained that context forms an important role in the design and perception of a creation. It was found by the writer that all these things explained why guitar amps have such a dominant product meaning. Once the questions on the traditional style were more clear it was time to create a new evolved style. This started with analysis on aesthetics. Theory on how the human mind absorbs and places all the visual input became important in the formulation of a vision and designing of the concept. A different approach on aesthetic analysis was conducted in the form of a study on existing designs. This resulted in the vision for a new style. Ideation resulted in variations on this concept for a style, ending with choosing one. The result was a design for the context of guitar players that play at home for personal entertainment. It was chosen to create product value in of course its initial purpose of providing amplified sound for electric guitar, but most importantly in providing an alternative for the traditional style, making the style the main purpose of the concept.","Valve Tube; Guitar; Amplifier; Guitar amp; Vacuum Tube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to assess potential alternative epoxy resins in injected bolted shear connections for a civil engineering application. Research has focused on the application of injection bolts with various resins in a double lap shear connection. In current practice only one resin is allowed to be used due to regulation by RWS. This is RenGel SW404/HY2404 resin [1]. To assess possible alternatives different products have been selected that have potential for use in this application. To verify their performance, short duration double lap shear tests have been performed in the Stevin Laboratory. The curing temperature of the resin was varied in testing to assess the influence this has on performance, and gain further insight in the importance of material properties of resins for injection bolts. Secondly the stress distribution of the resin layer has been investigated by developing an analytical model using 1 dimensional Timoshenko beam theory. This model was calibrated using results from lab tests and verified against FEM results and other experiments. From this research, it is concluded that only Edilon Dex R2K resin is a possible alternative resin. The injection procedure is simplified with this product but it suffers from large scatter in results in this research. The found characteristic short term strength is 156 MPa when cured at 16 degrees Celsius. Curing temperature had no influence for RenGel SW404/HY2404 between 8 and 24 degrees. Dex R2K did have a positive dependency in this range. Lastly the research into the effect of bolt length shows a trend that the connection capacity remains the same or increases slightly for L/D ratios above 3. From this research, it is recommended to gain further insight in the mechanical behavior of injection bolt connections through FEM analysis. Furthermore, development of alternative washer designs and research into optimized injection procedures are recommended. Lastly the occurrence of air inclusions in the resin layer as noticed in this research is something to be investigated in future research.","Injection bolts; alternative epoxy; shear; bearing resistance; RenGel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","Strut-braced wing aircraft are believed to have great potential for the future of large passenger air transport with regard to fuel burn reductions due to the combination of high structural and aerodynamic efficiency. Strut-braced wings deviate from conventional wings in the fact that they employ additional bracing at certain span location away fromfuselage to relieve the bending moment at the root of thewing. The large aspect ratio wings that are thereby enabled, experience less induced drag, and reductions in wave drag and parasitic drag compared to conventional wings. The downside of a high degree of wing slenderness is the inherent wing flexibility which in turn makes strut-braced wings very prone to aeroelastic (flutter) instabilities. In the last few years a lot of work has been done to get a better understanding of aeroelasticity of strutbraced wing and truss-braced wing aircraft in light of the Boeing Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) (Bradley et al., 2015). Nonetheless, flutter constraints still cause a significant weight penalty for these configurations. At the same time, passive load alleviation by the application of aeroelastic tailoring for the purpose resolving these flutter instabilities has not been exploited fully yet. To investigate whether aeroelastic tailoring can indeed resolve aeroelastic instabilities in—and increase the potential of strut-braced wings, the existing Proteus framework was modified and verified to enable design of these configurations. Fourteen strut-braced wing models with varying strut configurations and a reference model of a clean wing, all with an aspect ratio of 19.4, have been optimized for a minimum weight objective and the corresponding results have been analyzed. It was found that configuration parameters such as the axial stiffness of the strut, and the spanwise and chordwise location of the strut-wing connection had a significant influence on the aeroelastic vertical wing deflections and wing twist, respectively. Results of aeroelastic tailoring clearly showed that the spars were tailored for the inboard normal force caused by the strut. Stiffness results also implied that the wings were optimized for a wash-out effect at the root and a wash-in effect at the tip. As this result is essentially the exact opposite of what would be seen for conventional wing design, static aeroelastic deformations, active design constraints and critical aeroelastic eigenmodes of the strut-braced wings were further investigated. The stiffness distribution throughout the wing had a smaller influence on the wing deformations than the configuration parameters, and mainly affected the rate of wing twist along the span of the wing. The wash-out effect at the root indeed resulted in an increase in wing twist over the first section of the wing, but the supposed wash-in effect only decreased this twist angle slightly, resulting in a small decrease in wash-out instead of actual wash-in. Nevertheless, the wash-in effect could be explained by the flutter instabilities thatwere found to be the key design driver for tailoring of all strut-braced wing designs. Moreover, because of the extreme susceptibility of strut-braced wings to flutter, the bands of aeroelastic stability showed to be very narrow. As a consequence, laminate design was driven towards the boundaries posed by laminate feasibility constraints. The deformations corresponding to the most critical eigenmodes showed direct links to the tailored stiffness distribution. The set of aeroelastically tailored strut-braced wing designs shows that the isolated wing mass decreases for increasing values of axial stiffness of the strut. At the same time the stiffest struts make a larger contribution to the total mass of the strut-braced wing. The configuration with the strut at 60% of the span, 30% of the chord length and with the second lowest axial stiffness was the most optimumdesign, resulting in amass decrease of 20.9% with respect to the optimized clean wing. From the presented results it can be concluded that aeroelastic tailoring is very well capable of avoiding flutter without the addition of any weight penalties. Aside from modifications aimed at increasing the accuracy of the current work, it is recommended that this research is continued on a full scale Boeing SUGAR strut-braced wing. In case aeroelastic tailoring on such a full scale model indeed resembles the promising results that were found here, the future of aviation will finally be associated withmore disruptive developments and larger steps in fuel burn reductions alike.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Aerospace Structures & Computational Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Hordijk, D.A. (mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor)","2017","The main question of this thesis is the result of a survey by ‘provincie Zuid-Holland’ (PZH), that has developed a ‘uniform model’ for the assessment of the structural safety of existing prefabricated culverts. PZH is considering the possibility of using generic parameters to decide on the strength of existing culverts in the area. The province wants to show that all culverts, given their size and other material characteristics, are strong enough to carry the traffic loads prevailing in Netherlands. The PZH has decided to provide some elements of a replacement culvert (Schaapswegduiker) for the (destructive) determination of the strength. This has been realized based on the results of this thesis. The aim of the thesis is to determine the maximum load that can be carried and to assess the structural safety of the Schaapswegduiker, in accordance with current regulations. In order to answer this research question, a literature study was conducted to assess the structural safety of existing structures. Schaapswegduiker is assessed for traffic loads LM1 and LM2 in accordance with RBK1.1, NEN 8700, NEN 8701 and NEN-EN-1991-2. First, a materials research has been performed (by Nebest) based on my plan of action, to determine the proper output parameters for the calculations. Hereafter two calculation models have been prepared to validate the uniform model of PZH: a framework model (comparable to uniform model) and an advanced nonlinear FEM model. The advanced non-linear calculation has been carried out by means of a 2D-model DIANA. Using this model, I have made a prediction, a plan of action and a set-up for the test load that is carried out (by Heijmans). The DIANA-model is calibrated with the results of the test. Lastly, the influence of the by ground enclosed culvert on the load-bearing capacity has been analyzed For all calculation models, the spread of the traffic load on the deck of the culvert is considered as uniformly distributed load. The load-bearing capacity and the assessing of the structural safety for the framework model (calculation model 1) is as follows. Applying the material properties assumed by PZH (design values), the culvert does not meet (UC = 1.09 for shear force). Applying the design values of the measured material properties by the material research (with a non-exact reinforcement configuration) are used, the culvert still does not meet (UC = 1.02 for shear force). Applying the (material properties of the calibrated model) upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration, the culvert meets the assessment (UC = 0.92 for shear force). The associated load-bearing capacity is 443 kN. With framework models, sufficient strength can be demonstrated using the measured values and exact reinforcement configuration. However, with an advanced model, a higher strength (in this case an increase of a factor 1.9) can be determined. With the calibrated DIANA-model, a load-bearing capacity of 840 kN has been determined with a corresponding UC of 0.53. The upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration have been used for this calculation as well. This determined strength is including the maximum negative influence of the load-bearing capacity for culvert which is enclosed by ground. This reduced the load-bearing capacity by 10%. In short, the culvert meets the test for assessing the structural safety for both models. An advanced model with a nonlinear calculation in EEM calculates a factor of 1.9 higher load-bearing capacity and UC, compared with a framework model which is linear-elastic. This factor includes the maximum negative influence of the culvert in the ground and a conservative calibration of the model (DIANA-model is calibrated up to a maximum of 81%). That means that this determined factor can actually be even higher. PZH is recommended to go through the following phases when assessing other culverts. Phase 1, design values should be used when there is enough information available about the culvert. When the UC does not meet, there should be continuation to phase 2. Here a materials research will be done. Precise determination of the material properties is important, especially the reinforcement configuration. It has been shown that it is worth paying extra attention to the reinforcement configuration. When the UC does not meet with the design values of the under limit of the design values of the measured values, there should be continuation to phase 3. Here, an advanced non-linear calculation is with FEM recommended, such as DIANA. The same material properties are assumed as in phase 2.","Numerical model; non-linear model; experiment; existing culvert; assessment structural safety; determine load bearing capacity; provincie Zuid-Holland; traffic loads; materials research","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Engineering, Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor)","2017","Field studies with in-situ sediment sampling demonstrate the spatial variability in grain size on a sandy beach. However, conventional numerical models that are used to simulate the coastal morphodynamics ignore this variability of sediment grain size and use a uniform grain size distribution of mostly around and assumed fine grain size. This thesis study investigates the importance of variable grain size distribution in a beach’s morphological response. For this purpose, in-situ swash zone grain size distribution, beach profile and accompanying wave and tide time series data were obtained at a field campaign at the USACE Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, USA, in the spring of 2014. Using this data, a process based numerical coastal morphology model, XBeach, was chosen to simulate the beach profile response to wave and tidal action. 1-D cross-shore model was run for five major scenarios for a 2-day period with available field data in order to compare beach responses in the cases of measured variable and hypothetical uniform distribution of grain sizes in the swash zone respectively. The data gathered in SABER_Duck, confirmed a highly variable grain size distribution in the swash zone both vertically and horizontally. The numerical model results for alternative grain size distribution scenarios were compared. Computed beach response for uniform grain size distribution differed from that for the original varying distribution, corroborating the importance of grain size variability in beach response. The results for alternative hypothetical bed composition scenarios, demonstrated the importance of the accuracy in spatial distribution of varying grain sizes and the accuracy of the representative grain size. Lastly, the grain size distribution in the computed final bed composition showed layering of different grain sizes similar to those that were observed during field campaign, showing the model’s capability of simulating the sediment grain size sorting.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Automated fibre placement technology has made possible to place bands of composite fibre tows along curvilinear path to create laminates with spatially varying stiffness properties called variable stiffness panels. These panels have shown improvement in stiffness properties, buckling load and post buckling failure load, over conventional straight fibre laminates. However, automated fibre placement machines can allow a minimum radius of curvature for fibre steering. Due to this, bands of fibre tows with same orientations are placed next to each other to produce a panel. This placement strategy gives rise to mismatch between the two bands and leads to fibre angular distortion. It can also lead to thickness build up but, to maintain the constant thickness of the panel, fibre tows are cut perpendicular to the placement direction which give rise to the defects called tow drop defects. Tow drop defects are the resin rich areas. In recent years, optimization of the variable stiffness panels for different load cases have been studied. These studies do not account for tow drop defects during optimization. To take account of these defects on the properties of the variable stiffness panels certain finite element approaches were proposed. For applying these approaches, location and geometry of the tow drop defects need to be identified in the variable stiffness panels. Based on it, property assignment to the mesh elements were done. However, the location and geometry of tow drops are dependent on fibre angle, width of the fibre tows and number of fibre tows in a band and can vary for different configuration of variable stiffness panel. It involves excessive computational effort to determine the location and geometry of the tow drop defects in the panels and analyze it. This makes it difficult to integrate the finite element approaches to optimization study. Thus, there is a need to develop a methodology which could make this integration possible.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); Meirelles, S. (mentor); Rijnsburger, S. (mentor)","2017","The Rhine ROFI ( region of freshwater influence) is a dynamic area where various processes and timescales come together. Research has shown that stratification caused by the freshwater outflow of the Rhine alters the tidal currents in front of the Dutch coast. In the case of the Netherlands the tide behaves like a kelvin wave, which causes rectilinear tidal flow. If the area is stratified this rectilinear flow becomes elliptic, the cross-shore component of the flow increases. As this happens the top and bottom layers of the flow become decoupled due to stratification. This results in two counter rotating ellipses. This behavior causes a cross-shore velocity shear in the water column. From high to low water the velocity shear in the bottom layer is offshore directed , from low to high water it is onshore directed. Research has shown that this cross-shore velocity shear causes extra sediment transport. This thesis describes the impact of the Rhine ROFI on the alongshore and cross-shore variability in annual cross-shore sediment transport in the depths from NAP-12 to NAP-20m between Hoek van Holland and Noordwijk. The stratification that drives the formation of tidal ellipses is dependent on the freshwater discharge from the Rhine, the spring neap cycle of the tide , the ebb-flood cycle and breakdown of stratification by wind and waves. To see the effect of stratification on the velocity field a D-Flow-FM model is used to simulate a two week period. This model includes the tide, wind and discharge. The necessary wave parameters to calculate the sediment transport are derived from a Delft3D-Wave model. This is an offline approach, so the impact of the waves on the stratification and flow is not taken into account. The flow field and waves are used to calculate the sediment transport with the total load Soulsby-Van Rijn formula. Five scenarios are run to assess the impact of different discharges. A reference scenario without the impact of stratification, three scenarios to simulate a year and an extreme scenario to see the impact of very high discharge. The effect of the wind is investigated by using a constant wind from the South-East and a no wind condition. From research it is clear that strong winds and high waves break down stratification. Due to the offline approach the effect of waves are not taken into account on the flow field. This has been taken into account in the sediment transport calculation by using flow results from the reference case that are without the effect of stratification for waves higher than 1.5m. The results show that there is an impact of the ROFI on the cross-shore sediment transport especially near the river mouth, this effect reduces in the direction of Noordwijk. The gradient in cross-shore sediment transport in the alongshore direction is negative, the transport reduces slowly in the direction of Noordwijk. The transport in cross-shore direction shows a high gradient near the river mouth at Hoek van Holland and a zero gradient further to the North. The results show that the effect of different discharges that represent the seasons is small. The overall impact of the ROFI is limited with its effect reducing in northward direction. The results demonstrate an onshore cross-shore sediment transport at the NAP-20m depth contour indicating that this area feeds the coast with sediment and it would have detrimental effects on the long term if this area was dredged. The overall results demonstrate onshore cross-shore sediment transport over a large part of the middle shoreface of the Holland coast.","Rhine ROFI; sediment transport; Delft3D; D-Flow-FM; cross-shore transport; numerical modelling; salinity; tidal ellipses; Holland coast","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.140500, 4.171097"

(mentor)","2017","Within 100 years of the Wright Brother's first flight, we are already approaching the top of aviation’s technological S-curve. Breakthrough technical improvements have resulted in an undeniable increase in efficiency and range, but today’s aircrafts are still relatively inefficient resulting in a large amount of air and noise pollution. In order to aid further new advancements, in this thesis I set out drawing inspiration from nature - specifically birds; to understand how through more than 150 million years of evolution they came to be the most efficient flying creatures we know. The work presented in this thesis is related to the structural modeling and numerical analysis of the primary feather of the western jackdaw (Corvus monedula) to hypothesize its passive deformations under varying morphology and aerodynamic loading. Starting with Computed Micro-Tomograph scans of a primary feather, several techniques were devised towards realizing the detailed micro – and macro - structure of the feather. Modular capabilities of the model allow for rapidly creating morphological variants of the feather. This is the first attempt to model with such high detail the structural response of the micro-structures of flight feathers. Existing experimental or numerical investigations used highly simplified forms of the feathers structure, allowing the analysis of only stand-alone aspects of deformation dynamics of various avian species. Consequently, these low fidelity models failed to capture how individual sub-micron deformations collectively form the passive response of the feather. Passive dynamic deformation of the feathers micro-structures under increasing load revealed an initial decrease and then and increase in nose droop, overall profile camber and transmissivity of the vanes in order to limit flow separation. Response of feather structures due to change in microstructural morphology revealed high stresses at low loading conditions caused due to their reduced strength and rigidity. Buckling of the barbs at their kink zones was found and is attributed to aforementioned morphological changes and the large and unsteady pressure gradients caused as a result. Based on numerical quantification and evidences, the conclusion of this thesis presents a detailed hypothesis on the series of events and interactions which define the mechanics of dynamic passive flow control abilities of primary flight feathers.","Bird Flight; Dynamic Passive Flow Control; Finite Element Analysis; Structural Modelling; Primary Flight Feathers; Western Jackdaw","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Existing mathematical models for aerobic granular sludge have focused solely on lab-scale reactors. In this study, an effort was made to adapt these models to simulate the processes of full-scale installations. The model is the first aerobic granular sludge model to use transient radial diffusion and multiple granule fractions. Aerobic and anoxic endogenous processes were added to the model as well. Despite these changes, the existing metabolic models for phosphate accumulating organisms were not capable of describing the behavior at the low storage polymer levels encountered in full-scale installations. Analysis of influent data of three full-scale plants revealed the low-loaded character of these installations and the significant role of maintenance processes play. With an analysis of ammonia and phosphate mass balances it was shown that the phosphate release to substrate uptake ratio was much lower than predicted by metabolic models. This suggests polyphosphate only plays a minor role in anaerobic generation of energy for substrate uptake. Most likely, glycogen is used as energy source instead, due to the lack of stored polyphosphate. Two parameters were used to analyze the state of an installation, the VFA-load [mg HAc-eq/gVSS/d] and the P-load [mg P/gVSS/d]. More research on the metabolism of phosphate accumulating organisms at low storage polymer levels is required to obtain a viable model of full-scale aerobic granular sludge.","Aerobic granules; modeling; EBPR; metabolism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

It is mean-variance optimal to increase risk-taking as time passes, whereas conventional investment wisdom states that risk should decrease as time goes by. We introduce dynamic mean-variance optimization, where the asset allocation can adapt to changing circumstances, as an alternative to deterministic mean-variance optimization. We introduce an algorithm for dynamic mean-variance optimization of the replacement ratio, an extension of the dynamic mean-variance algorithm by Cong and Oosterlee.

(mentor); Kruse, T. (mentor)","2017","In the development of materials used for constructing aircraft, progress has been made in the production, certification and implementation of materials such as Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) and Glass Laminate Aluminium Reinforced Epoxy (GLARE). The state-of-the-art in joining techniques however, has not changed much: fastening is still the current used method for high load transfer (HLT) joints. Unfortunately, fastening is associated with high fatigue sensitivity due to the need for holes in the joined materials, causing stress concentrations and a highly concentrated load introduction. Using bonding for HLT joints would alleviate this fatigue sensitivity by continuous load transfer over the bonded area. Currently, certification of these bonded major loadpath joints is only allowed if the design of bond-line secures a limitation of the maximum disbond size originating from manufacturing anomalies or in-service impact events. In order to meet this requirement, disbond arrest features (DAFs) need to be implemented in the bond-line. As a spin-off from the BOPACS (Boltless Assembling of Primary Aerospace Composite Structures) project, where fasteners are used for disbond arrest, the transferability of this design strategy in GLARE is investigated. The fatigue sensitivity of the metallic bonded surface in GLARE in combination with the implemented fasteners inside the bonded area prove to affect the disbond arrest performance to a large extent. A unique combination of fatigue crack growth (FCG), adherend delamination and adhesive disbonding is observed in the tested configurations, detrimental to the DAFs intended use. In the process, a qualitative in-situ disbond monitoring system is developed and verified. Additionally, the root causes of the observed failure mode and the subsequent damage progression are identified. By identification of the one-off damage progression characteristics, new DAF designs are proposed for the certification of bonded HLT joints in GLARE.","ultrasonic testing; fibre metal laminate; GLARE; secondary bonding; high load transfer joint; damage tolerance; disbond; delamination; fatique; fatique crack growth; certification; wide single lap shear; non-destructive inspection; digital image correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Palha Da Silva Clérigo, A. (mentor)","2017","Turbidity currents are an essential agent of sediment transport from shallow to deeper waters. Detailed measurements of the velocity field or particle concentration are only available by means of accurate numerical simulations. In this thesis, a DNS solver for turbidity currents is presented based on the MEEVC scheme, a mass, energy, enstrophy and vorticity conserving solver for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary conditions. The construction of the solver consists of two separate steps: the prescription of slip boundary conditions and the implementation of a transport equation for the particle phase. Tangential velocity boundary conditions cannot be imposed strongly because the velocity is sought in the function space H(div). To this end, three methods are proposed for the weak enforcement of the tangential velocity component by means of vorticity boundary conditions. Of these methods, kinematic Neumann boundary conditions prove to be the most effective and are used for the construction of a turbidity current solver. An equilibrium Eulerian approach for the particle phase is implemented and the resulting solver is proved to satisfy the discrete energy balance equations up to a residual. This residual does not accumulate over time and no artificial dissipation of energy is introduced into the system. The 2D lock exchange test case is computed and comparisons are made with reference results. The numerical results indicate that the solver is capable of capturing the essential dynamics of the flow in coarse grids.","mimetic; energy conserving; physics compatible; turbidity currents; numerical methods; finite element","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Investigation after including long term morphological assessments in the Environmental Flow studies. It is the aim of this research to assess the influence of changes in flow regime on the long-term morphology for the Mara river basin, thereby concluding on the significance of these effects for the establishment of the EFAs. Both a long-term assessment and local EFA assessments are undertaken and the results are linked to each other. Analytical and numerical calculations for the long-term 1-dimensional sediment transport analysis were conducted. Four reaches along a portion of the main stream of the Mara River are distinguished in the analysis. First, a reference scenario was established based on current discharges and parameters measured during site visits. Scenarios for future discharge regimes, were derived from the EFR. Three discharge scenarios are considered; Q_EFA, floods build up by the full EFRs, Q_EFA,maintenance , build up by only taking into account the maintenance flows, and the 95 percentile of flow (Q_95), which is the legislative discharge set by the Kenyan government. The results of the analysis include changes in cross sectional averaged bed levels, velocity, and depth over the length of the river. Although the river shows signs of historical erosion, also seen from field observations, the current state of the river is expected to be stable, since the riverbed is controlled by bedrock. The result for the equilibrium sediment transport flux for the alluvial reach of the river was comparable to fluxes in other rivers in Kenya. A first indication for the corresponding characteristic time scale for adaptation of the bed level is 1000 years, which indicates the time it takes for half of the total perturbation of the riverbed to respond. These results support the assumption that the river is stable for the current situation. Comparing the calculated discharge scenarios, the Q_95 and Q_EFA,maintenance scenario show high response of the bed level. The QEF A, f loods shows the same pattern of steepening, but the bed level changes are much less. From this result it can be concluded that it is important to establish an EFR, that also considers the floods, recognising the importance of the morphological assessment of the EFA. This research has taken the first steps in the direction of assessment of river stability in perspective of EFA assessments under data limited circumstances. Unfortunately no further conclusions can be made upon the long-termassessment of the bed level response on a small time scale, therefore improvements of the numerical model are recommended to be made. It is recognised that 2-dimensional processes such as meandering and river widening are important to take into account as well. Moreover, for better understanding and possibly in the future quantification of the morphological processes, it is recommended to build up a data bases including standardized data collected fromfield surveys of the EFA ormonitoringmoments after flood events. This can greatly contribute to the understanding and verification of expected morphological processes in the river.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

Practically speaking, our approach provided a scalable, energy effective and precise method to tune the photocatalytic properties of SiO2 coated Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. When it goes to applications, the enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be used for photocatalyst.","atmospheric pressure; atomic layer deposition; Si-O-Ti interface; self-limiting reaction; TiO2 photocatalysis; ultrathin SiO2 film","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","As air traffic controller workload is a bottleneck on air traffic growth, automation solutions have been proposed. This study investigates the effect of transparency on the acceptance of resolution advisories generated by an adaptive automation tool and the frustration experienced by controllers when using this tool. Two different kinds of transparency were looked at. The first shows the variables the automation uses directly, while the second shows them only indirectly. Both incorporated a preview functionality, which allowed for comparison of the resolution advisory and the controller solution when the automation activated. A human in the loop experiment featuring these different kinds of transparency was performed. The results show that there is no significant difference in acceptance of advisories, workload or frustration ratings obtained from the NASA-TLX between the different levels of transparency. However, the group using the direct form of transparency received more short-term collision alerts and the time that the automation was active was higher than for the group using the indirect transparency. No significant difference in controller trust in the automation was found. In conclusion, there does not appear to be an influence of transparency on controller acceptance of resolution advisories, controller workload, controller frustration or controller trust in the automation. However, the experimenter noticed that most participants in the experiment did not use the information from the preview functionality to compare their solution to the resolution advisory. As they did not use the automation transparency to its full potential, further research on automation transparency is recommended in order to either confirm or dismiss the findings of this study.","air traffic control; Automation transparency; separation monitor; automation acceptance; frustration; trust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-23","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

Nonetheless, such standard fails to provide a practical and accurate solution for localization and ranging applications within indoor environments due to the need of satellites and meter-level accuracy, which is poor for indoor environments. It is in this context that Ultra-Wideband (UWB) emerges as the potential standard to overcome the accuracy shortcomings of other types of radio signals, which is needed for security, military and medical applications. Based on the fact that first-path time and amplitude detection favor the ranging accuracy in indoor environments. This thesis presents the implementation of a novel low-complexity receiver concept implementing first-path time and amplitude detection with a maximum ranging error of less than 7cm. This system is able to decouple amplitude from time detection, which improves the TOA estimation accuracy of the system. The architecture of this receiver is fully self-biased and inverter-based, which also favors process scalability. The receiver is able to perform time detection on signals with frequencies up to 900MHz due to technology limitations. Furthermore, a low-power consumption of 22mW is achieved.","UWB; CMOS; peak detection; time of arrival","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Beelaerts van Blokland, W.W.A. (mentor); Van der Wardt, L. (mentor)","2017","The Courier Express Parcel industry is booming business. Final delivery in the business to customer (B2C) parcel market has been one of the main focusses for innovation. The last mile in the B2C market is inefficient and expensive, due to delivery failures, congestion, urban constraints, non-optimum loading rates and regulations. The best solution in solving the last mile problem within B2C logistics is decoupling the presence of the final costumer and the delivery; electronic parcel lockers achieve exactly that. MYPUP is one of the companies operating in the electronic parcel locker market and their method of operation is unique. MYPUP allows for delivery from all courier services by integrating the last mile of the delivery. The integration of the final delivery resulted in a new logistics process to consolidate, register and redistribute parcels and is the subject of this research. Analysis of the current logistics process exposed that the process involved a fair amount of manual labor, was error prone and reaching its capacity. The aim of this research was to redesign the warehousing process of MYPUP, focusing on the outbound logistics, to be more efficient, less error prone and to increase capacity, within the constraints of the limited available funds. Solutions were found based on brainstorm sessions with MYPUP executives, MYPUP employees and by consulting experts. A model was developed to show the potential of the proposed solutions and to support the decision-making process of which solutions to implement. The model results showed that introducing optical character recognition (OCR) in the registration process leads to the biggest improvement. A MYPUP specific algorithm was developed to deliver a proof of concept for implementation of OCR in the registration process. This algorithm provided a financially attractive alternative to the expensive, already existing OCR solutions in the market. The other identified solutions that were modeled all showed that significant improvements can be achieved. The registration process time can be reduced to a third of the current registration process time and a substantial portion of the errors can be eliminated, if all solutions are implemented. Furthermore, the reduction in registration time almost triples the hourly capacity. It is recommended MYPUP implements all proposed solutions. The software solutions are recommended to be implemented first, in case financial constraints do not allow for immediate implementation of the 3D camera solution. Although using a 3D camera to determine the size of parcels, eliminates errors and saves time, it requires investment in expensive hardware. It is also recommended to introduce the use of barcodes in combination with a drivers’ app to eliminate errors in the registration, sorting and delivery process. The first step is to implement the drivers’ app with the scan and OK functionalities. The route optimization algorithm requires further research and is recommended to be added later. Finally, further research into the consolidation phase is recommended. Consolidating all parcels in time is crucial if the parcels are to be delivered the same day. Quantifying these benefits strengthens the negotiating position of MYPUP in concluding agreements with parcel delivery service companies. Solutions proposed in this research, although specifically designed for MYPUP, can be adjusted and used to improve logistics processes in small-scale city logistics facilities as well.","B2C; city logistics; design; co-innovation; start-up; parcel industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","","",""

(mentor); Roosenboom-Kwee, Z. (mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor)","2017","To avoid uncontrollable climate change, the increase of global temperature should not exceed 2 degrees Celsius. Taking this into account, not all fossil fuel reserves can be exploited, which will affect the oil & gas companies and their assets. This not only poses a risk on companies operating in the fossil fuel sector, but also on the financial system which has close ties with this industry. Among the Dutch institutional investors, pension funds are most exposed to the ‘’carbon bubble’’ risk. This thesis aims to identify how the Dutch pension market should value this carbon bubble risk. Seventeen interviews were conducted with a pension fund, pension providers, and actors related to the pension market, comprising of 990 out of the 1300 billion euros in assets under management of the Dutch pension market. The average exposure to O&G companies in the pension portfolios is 7.45%, which is high. However, the Dutch pension market does not value carbon bubble burst probable, mainly due to an expected dominant rise in fossil fuel energy demand. Strategic Asset Allocation tools such as Asset Liability Management studies are not yet applied on O&G industry level. The scenario analysis using data of 11 O&G multinationals found ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Chevron are most at risk in a Carbon Bubble Burst scenario, assuming an abrupt energy transition. The results of this thesis can be used by other insitutional investors to obtain insight into carbon bubble risk valuation. Furthermore, it provides transparency for the Dutch citizens with a pension plan in how their pension providers value these risks. The scientific relevance of this thesis is the verification of the usage of ALM and SAA methods at O&G sector level on carbon bubble risk with practitioners in the Dutch pension market. Future research can be devoted towards the potential indirect impact of a carbon bubble burst on other sectors in the portfolio, or optimal strategies for pension providers to deflate a potential carbon bubble without facing the risk of missing additional returns.","Climate Risk; Oil and Gas companies; Dutch Pension Market; Stranded Assets; Asset Allocation; Asset Liability Management; Carbon bubble","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-22","Technology, Policy and Management","","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management (SEPAM)","",""

(mentor)","2017","For telecommunication businesses it is important to retain as many customers as possible. For this purpose it could be useful to predict which customers have a high potential to stop their subscription. When a customer leaves the company by stopping the subscription, it is called a customer churn. In this thesis customer churn was predicted for KPN, a telecommunication business in the Netherlands. To predict customer churns for KPN, a data set with information about the network, subscriptions and calls to the call centres was used.The data set contains numerical, ordinal and categorical features and just over two million customers. One of the features is the response feature churn, which suffers from class imbalance. Only 3.39 percent of the customers had churned. Firstly, the data was explored by a cluster analysis. For this cluster analysis partitioning around medoids was used, with the Gower distance as dissimilarity measure. This clustering was illustrated using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding. The cluster analysis showed that it is hard to distinguish churners from non-churners since they are not clearly grouped. To find a model that predicts customer churns, several classification methods were compared. Those methods were logistic regression, lasso, adaptive boosting, naive Bayes, random forest and a super learner, respectively. Not only the classification methods were applied to the data as is, but also to the data where the training set was balanced by up-sampling. To assess which model performs the best, an in-depth study into performance measures was executed. In the end, three different performance measures were used to assess the performance. Those performance measures are the weighted risk, the H-measure and the area under the recall-precision curve, respectively. It turned out that the super learner, which was an ensemble of logistic regression and random forest, performed the best for the KPN data set. Furthermore, it turned out that all feature should be included in the modelling process since a model that only contains the most important features, as determined by a feature importance method, gives worse predictions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)","","","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2017","In the past decades, universities’ involvement in socio-economic development, which goes along with their teaching and researching activities, has defined a new role for them in society’s ecosystem. This new role is often referred with the term of “entrepreneurial” university, whose objectives are positive societal, economic and environmental impacts. In order to fulfil such objectives, entrepreneurial universities might engage in cross-sector collaborations with external organisations. Despite the great contributions that cross-sector collaboration can give to the partners involved, the outcome is mostly unfocussed and rarely embedded. This master thesis explores the outcome embedding in the cross-sector collaboration between entrepreneurial universities and the private sector. To this end, we provide the case of the collaboration between KLM and four Dutch entrepreneurial research and education institutions. We aim to uncover hindering and enabling factors to the outcome embedding in order to design a new type of cross-sector collaboration, design it together, or else DIT. DIT is a new cross-sector collaboration that encourages the outcome embedding, moving from being inspired by to the actual implementation of the cross-sector collaboration. In order to fulfil this goal, this study employs a research through design methodology. This approach is a generative process, where cyclic loops of iterations and evaluations with stakeholders tend to the research goal. The solution is a cross-sector boundary group, The DIT Board, a cross-sector boundary object, The DIT Platform and a cross-sector boundary experience, The DIT Program. The DIT cross-sector collaboration overcomes the obstacles to the outcome embedding, creating an interaction that is able to transcend the different organisation cultures of the partners involved. This study can inspire practitioners and future research on the problem of unsuccessful cross-sector collaborations, between entrepreneurial universities and external organisations, with more emphasis on the value of embedding and translating the outcomes.","Innovation; Outcome embedding; Research through design; Cross-sector Boundary groups, objects, and experiences; Cross-sector collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Kobus, C.B.A. (mentor)","2017","Smart thermostats like Toon are part of an overarching product category called Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). These products provide consumers with feedback on their energy usage and consequently help them reduce their energy usage. Recently, energy companies have started offering these devices to their customers. The underlying reasoning for this development is twofold. Firstly, the market in which energy companies are operating is subject to big changes in the nearby future. The decentralisation of energy production is bound to cannibalize on centralised energy sales which is the main source of income of energy companies. Therefore, alternative revenue streams are explored by these companies to compensate for this potential loss. Secondly, it is hard for energy companies in the Dutch market to differentiate from one another. By offering a smart thermostat next to energy contract the chance of selling an energy contract increases. Eneco offers a smart thermostat called Toon to its customers. The thermostat involves a 7 inch touchscreen display on which detailed energy data derived from the electricity meter is shown. The product proposition involves an app with which users can control the thermostat and have access to energy consumption graphs. Furthermore, Toon can be linked to smart light bulbs, smart plugs and a smart smoke detector. Compared to competitors in the smart thermostat market, Toon takes an unique position since it is the only device capable of communicating real-time data on both electricity and gas consumption. Moreover, Toon is very much hardware-focused, trying to obtain a central place in the household by becoming a smart-home platform. However, when comparing Toon to other smart-home platforms the product falls terribly short in terms of compatibility with peripherals and shear value for money. At this point, Toon is struggling to add value to Eneco. The vast majority of Toon is given away for free in a bundle with an energy contract. Within this construction the initial loss is not compensated by the recurring revenue through the Toon subscription at the end of the contract. Moreover, there is a large amount of fixed costs involved regarding Toon which can be allocated to labour and marketing expenses. Currently, Toon is not providing Eneco with the alternative revenue stream they are looking for. However, the product does help them differentiate from competitors and generates income indirectly through energy contract sales. The function of Toon as a marketing tool is confirmed by the atypical composition of its current user base. The fact that the majority of Toon users is not interested in a couple of key points of the product proposition shows that the product is mainly seen as a gift next to an energy contract. Since the future strategy of Eneco for Toon is to sell additional services to its users, the current user base poses a big problem since they are unlikely to be interested or willing to pay for them. The lack of fit between the current product proposition of Toon and its consumers is also found when diving deeper into their deeper underlying values and needs with use of the value proposition design method. The vast majority of consumers is expected to perceive the current product proposition of Toon as a ‘nice to have’ gadget at this point. In order to verify the position of Toon in the lives of consumers, qualitative research is conducted during this project. Contextmapping interviews are conducted with 10 participants from a specific mentality group based on the model developed by Motivaction. The findings of these interviews are aimed at confirming the assumptions about consumer perceptions regarding the current product proposition of Toon. Furthermore, the underlying values and needs of consumers found during the interviews are translated to design goals which serve as a foundation for the development of a new product proposition for Toon. Eventually, a new product proposition of Toon is created based on all the previously mentioned aspects which were analysed. The result is a concept called Toon X, which separates the energy feedback section of Toon from the smart thermostat section. Energy feedback is made readily available for all Eneco customers through a cheap P1-dongle. This way the user base increases from 260.000 users to approximately 1.500.000 users. The large user base facilitates collecting big data about the energy usage of the group and their daily habits. The data is both valuable for process optimisation within Eneco and reselling to other companies. Furthermore, it prevents the government from intervening in the market and it makes Eneco obtain first-mover advantages. The success of this big data solution is largely dependent on the fact that customers keep using it. This is why the smartphone app of Toon has gone through a thorough redesign aimed at providing its users with more adequate feedback. Energy usage is communicated in various layers and is broken up into small manageable pieces while gamification elements are added to the app to keep it interesting for a longer period of time. Furthermore, the app forms a platform for additional services which offers upsell possibilities. One example of an addition to the Toon X concept is the new smart thermostat. The thermostat is merely focused on the strong points of the product category and is consequently considerably cheaper than its competitors which makes it a new standard in the smart thermostat market. The end-result is a new, stronger product proposition for Toon which adds more value to both its users and Eneco.","Smart Thermostat; Energy Market; Smart Meter; Big Data; Diffusion of Innovation; Value Proposition; P1-dongle; Energy Usage; Energy Saving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Prendeville, S.M. (mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor); Blaauw, O. (mentor)","2017","Problem situation - Global population is expected to double its size in 2030 (EMF, 2013), so will global consumption. Resource scarcity and associated environmental impact has shown that the current way of conducting business is not sustainable (Bocken et al., 2014). A promising alternative is proposed; circular economy. This new economic system is like an ecosystem; everything interacts through endless cycles and flows, thus waste does not exist. To establish a circular economy, a new way of approaching the problem (the current way of business) is required. This new way involves looking at problems holistically instead of breaking them apart; it is called a systemic approach. The company - Circular Valley is an organisation that wants to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by taking this systemic approach. At Circular Valley, people can rent workspaces and collaborate to solve circular challenges. They look at a problem as a whole and bring organisations together to work on that problem. A team of approximately 10 people, called Valley Creators, help organisations in their transition by guiding and enabling these collaborations. At present, Circular Valley is still in their start-up phase. The assignment - The scope of this thesis is to study the approach Valley Creators take and formalise it. Thereby it answers the following research question: Research question How can organisations systemically collaborate to accelerate the transition to a circular economy using an action research approach? Approach - To investigate the approach an action research approach was adopted. Action research includes a number of research methodologies that simultaneously pursue action (change) and research (understanding) (Altrichter et al., 2002). Literature regarding circular economy, systemic approaches, current state of the circular economy and facilitating cross sector collaborations, whole systems design and circular business model innovation were reviewed. Findings were combined with the insights gained from studying Valley Creators. Results - It was found that Valley Creators are still in the start-up phase. The approach they take was not yet formalised. Also, the way the approach was communicated was unclear. By formalising it, positioning, branding and communicating the concept will become easier. Both the literature study and the research showed that the facilitating party, Valley Creators, need to have certain values, capabilities and principles. Based on the findings from the research a design vision was formulated. Design vision - The goal is to design a guide that helps Valley Creators to facilitate, structure and express how they build circular systems to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Design outcome - A framework describing how to facilitate the collaboration to build a circular system was designed. It consists of the following steps, See figure Figure 1 on page 5. Experiencing the need for a new economic system Define circular system of urgency Refine circular system solutions through co-creation Test circular system feasibility Scale circular system solutions Setting the economic standard The proposed framework is supported by tools and methods; embedding a systemic approach in the transition to a circular economy. All of it is described form the perspective of Valley Creators. Business guidelines were formulated, pertaining to values, capabilities, principles and tips to facilitate the process. Evaluation - The evaluation showed that the developed framework was too abstract and needs to be combined with the findings from Valley Creators to communicate it with clients. Furthermore, 4 experts reflected on the proposed framework. They perceived the steps to be logical but more study is required to fully comprehend the feasibility and desirability of the approach. Also, the framework inhibits a number of implications. These include e.g. the group facilitating the method needs to be specialised and each project requires a degree of tailoring. The framework should be constantly updated as it describes a transition. Discussion - Finally, the framework relies largely on theory and e.g. a case study could enrich it further. Also the complementary list of suggested methods and tools to support the framework are non-exhaustive and should be tested. This framework should be interpreted as a first proposal.","Circular economy; systemic collaboration; accelerated transition; circular systems; design; service blueprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","The right training and equipment become increasingly more important in professional wheelchair sports such as wheelchair basketball. Individual performance characteristics need to be measured to be able to optimise for example wheelchair settings. Recently, a method using shimmer sensors has been developed and validated to measure speed, acceleration and rotation speed of a wheelchair. This thesis explains how these data can be used in wheelchair basketball to estimate a different performance measure: the external power. Models for the external power are based on the power balance equation, and include the rolling resistance, which is the main resistance, and possibly air resistance or bending forward of the athlete. Resistance parameters can be estimated based on known coasting periods, or based on estimated coasting points or periods. A simple model is proposed to identify coasting points and more sophisticated Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are proposed to estimate resistance parameters and coasting periods simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. Next to three available data sets, a pilot study is carried out in which data are acquired of both shimmer sensors and a smartwheel, which measures external power. The models are analysed and applied to multiple data sets. The pilot data are used to compare estimated with measured external power. Using the simple model to identify coasting points results in an overestimation of the rolling resistance, and in an estimation of the external power that is highly sensitive for the subjective choice of parameters in the simple model. The proposed HMMs show promising results for the use of HMMs in automatically tuning resistance parameters. Best results in power estimation in the pilot data are obtained when the rolling resistance is based on a known coasting period in bent forward position.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This converter relies entirely on the noise shaping provided by the transducer, which proves to be sufficient to reach the required specifications. Each converter only includes an inverter-based transimpedance amplifier, a variable gain amplifier for time-gain compensation and a 3-bit tracking quantizer, which comprises two comparators and two DACs. A prototype chip has been fabricated in TSMC 0.18𝜇𝑚 technology, featuring 20 channels, with one ADC per channel, and 20 parallel high-speed LVDS transmitters to convey the bitstreams out to the measurement system. The whole modulator, clocked at 200𝑀𝐻𝑧, achieves an area of 150𝜇𝑚 × 150𝜇𝑚, a power consumption of 800𝜇𝑊 and an SNR of 47dB in a 75% bandwidth around a transmit frequency of 5𝑀𝐻𝑧. The measurements clearly show the desired noise shaping behaviour, thus proving that the proposed concept is valid.","Inverter-based OTA; Band-pass ΣΔ; Electro-mechanical Resonator; Tracking Quantizer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation","","","",""

The maximum span width of the tail surface is also found to play an important role in determining dynamic behaviour, in particular when the distance between the tail surface and the flapping wings is large. Steady-state conditions can be predicted accurately using linear functions of tail geometry for this ornithopter. Predicting dynamic behaviour is more complicated and requires further study.

(mentor); Price, R.A. (mentor); Leijh, B. (mentor)","2017","A new airport furniture collection has been designed for passengers that travel in groups and experience airside dwell-time at an airport terminal. Traveling with a group is trending, more than 28% of passengers at Schiphol travel with more than two persons. Passengers traveling in groups have different waiting behaviour and thus different needs and wants. Looking at three factors of experiencing waiting, space, activity and entertainment, the preferred experience of the target group is: “Efficient passengers traveling in groups like to wait together, in a semi-private space. They like to be on the relaxed side but want interactive entertainment”. No recent projects have been done on the airside dwell-time, since most projects focus on reducing stress. However a lot of opportunity lies in increasing comfort during low stress time. This means adding comfort instead of decreasing discomfort. The experience for passengers traveling in groups during their airside dwell-time is a prime example for this. They do not have a lot of stress but also do not have an adequate waiting environment. They have the option of the commercial area (shopping/dining) or airport benches. Neither suits their needs during this time. For creating an environment that does meet their needs and increases their comfort during the dwell-time information is needed on how comfort is experienced. There are four factors that make up the experienced comfort: Postural, Physiological, Cognitive and Environment. The outcome of the experience is also influenced by the expectation a person has. There is a threshold that needs to be exceeded in order to notice the change in comfort. Comfort is thus one of the factors that make up the airport experience. A change in comfort can be measured using the four factors provided that the change exceeds the threshold. For an optimal waiting experience physical and physiological comfort need to be increased. For the physiological part of comfort inspiration is drawn from the past. Excitement and romance are key elements that made flying great during the golden age of flying that are missing today. This has to do with the shielding of most airport and flying processes to the passengers. This can be called the black box of flying. The origin of this black box, lies largely in the recent increase in security measures. This has been contributing to the lack of adventure during the travel period. Opening up the black box of flying by letting the passenger experience these processes again will help make the travel time be part of the adventure again. Moreover it does give an opportunity to incorporate new entertainment possibilities into the passenger’s journey in the terminal. For the physical part of increasing comfort, a space meeting the waiting requirements of passengers traveling in groups is designed. In order to create the personal space for groups that promotes social cohersion a circle will be used. To accommodate different group sizes different size circles are needed. Looking to nature for inspiration, different size circles appear in water, randomly as water droplets and concentric as water ripples. Using water ripples as the fundament for the seating elements, they need to be arranged in the space allowing different “pods” to be placed together without becoming too boring or chaotic. Because the pods will differ in size, rhythm needs to be found in their spatial layout, an orthogonal grid is best suited for this. This grid will create a playful, open but safe landscape of personal (for groups) pods. Lastly the size of the pods is very important. When people’s heads are further away than 2.5 meters their number of interactions significantly decreases. Thus it is important that the distance between group members does not exceed 2.5 meters. The Loungescape Bridge was designed with all this information in mind. This design has been prototyped (see cover picture). The feet of the seating element consist of a backbone that is bolted together on the installation spot. There are three different elements that can be added to the backbone. A seat with a high back, a seat with a low back and an armrest. An overhead lamp is installed in the armrest to create a safe space in mostly very large and high terminal buildings. Because all the components are bolted together and the set consists over very little different items, it is very suitable for product leasing. This is in line with the vision of Ahrend to transform furniture in a service. With this transformation they can contribute to a Circular Economy.","PASSME; aviation; passengers; dwell-time; comfort; Ahrend","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Air Traffic Control (ATC) workload is the main limiting factor for air traffic growth. Although predicting workload is important, a proper objective ATC workload metric is still not available. Previous research has shown that using the solution space diagram as a workload prediction metric is promising. This metric is based on the concept that ATC workload is inversely related to the size of the set of all available solutions. The current solution space metric however, does not incorporate altitude. In this thesis a 3D solution space metric is designed and evaluated. An experiment has been conducted to test the relation of the 3D solution space metric with workload and compare it to a conventional workload metric, the aircraft count, and a quasi-3D metric: the 2D layered solution space. Participants were required to separate air traffic on predefined flight routes, while rating their subjective workload at regular time intervals with an Instantaneous Self Assessment-based method. Weak correlations with workload were found for all tested metrics and no significant differences were found between them. Excluding aircraft that had been given a transfer of control did not yield a significant improvement. Although no significant differences were found, the 2D layered metric showed more promising results than the 3D solution space-based metric, indicating that air traffic controllers might think in 2D layers over fixed altitude ranges rather than considering the complete 3D physical solution space.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

Technology and cost parameters are analysed for all system components in a Near Future and Mid Century scenario. An energy system that is designed in previous work is modelled and simulated with actual climate data from the northern location Hamburg and a southern location Alicante.

Not sufficient solar electricity can be generated in the smart city area to cover the building demand, expect for Alicante in Mid Century. In all other cases the remaining building electricity demand is balanced by re-electrifying wind generated hydrogen, which also covers the demand for transport. Balancing of the smart city electricity demand requires 37% of the car fleet as maximum in Near Future, which is reduced to 19% in Mid Century. Reliable energy for buildings and for transport, with a system levelised cost of 0.44 €/kWh for electricity and a specific cost of energy for passenger cars of 0.11 €/km in the Near Future.

Bicycle mobility leaves its mark and is an important aspect in the design of public environments. This graduation project in centred around the theme of bicycle parking in public environments. The first phase of this project researches and analyses how bicycle parking is dealt with currently. Insight is gained on how bicycle parking facilities relate to their context and what problems are experience during parking. In this stage observational research and field research were used as methods. A broad questionnaire among cyclists as part of the research revealed the most valuable context and target group to design for. Limited space constraints inhabitants living in urban areas to park their bicycle outdoors. At these places the bicycles are vulnerable for theft, vandalism and weathering. This happens in a time where municipalities stimulate bicycle use as a way of sustainable transport. The design vision is formulated as such: “The design should stimulate people in urban areas to use the bicycle, by translating the positive experiences of cycling on to a bicycle shed. In this way bicycle riding and parking becomes one coherent positive experience. With the design I want to assist peoples sustainable mobility choice. The product should an added value to the public environment. After research being guided by the use of the Vision in Product design method, a phase of ideation started. Meeting with the municipality of Rotterdam that is familiar with the problem, insights in municipal incentives was gained that have influenced the projects development. After ideating two concepts were drafted that differ in appearance, modularity and in their relation to the environment. The final concept is the BBOX, a space-efficient bicycle shed that is placed on former car parking spots. The product is designed to create added value for the city landscape. The specially designed and integral bicycle rack facilitates easy parking for a large range of bicycle types. The BBOX is designed around a characteristic and functional shape that is inspired by the bicycle contour. This quality contributes to the products presence in the street. The BBOX comes in different sizes and is modular in appearance, attracting municipalities to place the product by allowing them to carry out the product in any desired way and create the best fit with the city context.

(mentor)","2017","Automated vehicles (AVs) have been receiving much attention all over the world, where the first fully AVs are already operating on the road network. AVs could not only have a tremendous impact on the urban environment but also on human travel behaviour. The focus of this study is to gain insight into the effects of private highly AVs on drivers’ parking location choice. The capability of AVs to ride and park themselves instead of being parked by the driver, will result in a change in parking choice behaviour. The aim of this research is to find the importance of different factors that could influence drivers’ parking location choice for a future situation in which private highly AVs will become available for passenger transport. The results of this study are used to guide opportunities for promising parking policies. In this study, theoretical expectations are examined with an empirical framework to get conclusions on the medium- and long term impacts of highly AVs on drivers’ parking location choice. A stated preference experiment was specified to examine which parking location drivers would chose, based on factors that influence their decision for the parking location. The Hague is used as a case study for this research in which it is assumed that passengers have their destination in the inner city of The Hague. Two parking locations are considered: parking at an off-street parking garage in the inner city and parking at an off-street parking lot at the edge of the city. Based on the model interpretation, it can be concluded that individuals are most sensitive for a change in direct costs, i.e. the ‘parking cost’ at the parking facility and the ‘parking fee’ for temporary parking the highly AV at an onstreet parking place near the passenger’s destination when the vehicle arrives too early at the pick-up point. Furthermore, it can be concluded that individuals are less sensitive for ‘personnel surveillance’ at the parking facility and the ‘risk of extra waiting time’ for the vehicle arriving too late at the pick-up point. Personal characteristics, trip characteristics and perceptions on the risk of damage during the empty vehicle driving trip do not affect attributes that influence drivers’ parking location choices. To reduce the number of on-street parking places in the inner city, it is advised to forbid the parking of highly AVs at on-street parking places. Released on-street parking space could be used for amongst others drop-off and pickup manoeuvres. To minimize the number of empty vehicle kilometres on the road network, it is advised to stimulate short term parking of highly AVs in the inner city and stimulate long term parking of highly AVs at the edge of the city. Furthermore, it is advised to implement a parking fee for temporary parking the vehicle at an on-street parking place near the passenger’s destination in the inner city. With an implemented parking fee, the municipality is able to 1) control supply and demand, 2) account for competitor pricing and 3) account for external factors (e.g. peak periods). When more parking capacity is needed, it is advised to invest in flexible parking facilities at the edge of the city near distributor roads.","Parking location choice; Automated vehicles; Smart mobility; The Hague; Stated preference; Multinomial logit model; Discrete choice modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics (TIL)","",""

The existing literature was first analyzed to get an understanding for the process, resulting in a proposed mesostructural and mechanical model of FFF materials. The model was constructed such that only the print settings plus the part weight and dimensions after printing are necessary to calculate the mesostructural dimensions. A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to get a better understanding of the limitations of the model. Subsequently a FEM model was used to verify the above model. This sensitivity analysis was performed using a sweep of different mesostructural parameters was done in order to see the impact on the mechanical properties by means of FEM and analytical-numerical methods. The sweep parameters are the aspect ratio, the infill coefficient and the shrink coefficient. The analytical-numerical methods were added for validation and to get a mathematical feel for the mechanical phenomena. The effect of the shapes and sizes of the filaments were assessed with the three sweeps on the stiffness and stress concentrations. The models did show mostly expected trends, which not all have not been fully described in literature before. In order to verify the mesostructural model, a sintering simulation of the 2D filament crosssections was performed in Comsol. The void shape evolution performed as expected, however the long cusps are found to form upward due to the competition for inflowing of other cusps nearby. This counteracts hypothesis from literature. Additionally, the Comsol simulation did not respond well to the external shrinking variable. The cause behind this is suspected to be in the flow solver having problems in solving around sharp cusps in the fluid mesh.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance & Propulsion (AWEP)","","Flight Performance & Propulsion","",""

(mentor)","2017","Monitoring and optimising turbine performance are important tasks of a wind energy operator. However, monitoring activities are expensive and the current state-of-the-art in this field could be improved. A newly developed Avent five-beam Lidar was tested and the impact of heterogeneity on Lidar measurements was analysed. Also, the effect of turbulence on turbine performance was investigated. The Avent five-beam Lidar measurements were compared to several measurement devices: an IEC-compliant met-mast, a ZephIR Lidar and a ROMO Wind spinner anemometer. The Avent five-beam Lidar proved to be an accurate measurement device compared to the met-mast in measuring wind speed and yaw misalignment. However, the thresholds for its availability seemed to be too conservative. The Avent Lidar underestimated the power curve and consequently measured up to 3.5\% difference in AEP. Furthermore, by including a meteorological station at hub height, a more accurate PCV can be performed. The IEC presented a methodology to normalise power curves in order to determine the effects of turbulence on power curves. It was expected that the scatter would be improved and that power curve uncertainty would be reduced. Simulations showed the effects on the power curves and a lower scatter was obtained after normalising the power curves to one turbulence intensity. The theoretical results were validated with measurements from two measurement campaigns, however the circumstances were different due to varying conditions next to turbulence intensity during the measurement campaign. The effects of turbulence on the power curves were clearly observed whereas no improvement in the scatter around the power curves was perceived. Therefore, it could be valuable to investigate the turbulence normalisation by isolating the effects of turbulence. Simulations were performed to approach heterogeneous wind conditions. Also, a five-beam Lidar was simulated to analyse its ability to correct for heterogeneity. Measurements from the met-mast and Avent five-beam Lidar were used to validate the simulations in order to examine the magnitude and possible effect on Lidar measurements. It was found that the effect of heterogeneity depended on the magnitude. A linear correction could be applied, but was insufficient in wind fields with large heterogeneity. In case of low heterogeneity, a correction is not needed. Finally, it is recommended to investigate heterogeneity further by measuring with a Lidar continuously looking into the direction of a met-mast.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Wind Energy","",""

Changes to coastal zone management along the Delfland Coast have given rise to questions on the influence of alongshore bathymetric variability on bather risk. Extensive measurement data is available from two measurement projects, mapping the entire Delfland Coast. This data has been used to study the presence and development of alongshore bathymetric variability along the Delfland Coast. Subtidal variability was found to generally increase during the winter months, in accordance with literature. In the intertidal area variability was found to decrease in the winter months. Both intertidal and subtidal variability were found to be relatively low near the breakwater at Hoek van Holland. The range in measured variability along the Sand Motor was found to be very wide. Using a parameterization of the alongshore variability, subsections of the Delfland Coast have been selected for a modelling study. Artificial bathymetries have been created, using the selected measurement data. These artificial bathymetries have been used as the basis of numerical models. These have been forced with linearized wave conditions, in order to investigate the relation between different levels of alongshore bathymetric variability and wave induced currents which might form a risk to bathers. Good correlations were found between the alongshore variability and the wave induced currents, especially for the intertidal area. Alongshore bathymetric variability seems to be an important factor in generating wave induced currents which might form a risk to bathers. In order to be able to fully assess the influence of the bathymetry on such nearshore currents, the influence of the depth of the variable bar patterns, the distance between the subtidal bar and the intertidal bar and the phase differences between the subtidal and the intertidal bar need to be investigated further.","Alongshore bathymetric variability; rip currents; swimmer safety; bather risk; Sand Motor; Sand Engine; Delfland Coast; numerical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.057580, 4.184632"

The concept that comes closest to the theoretical Auger limit is the Si heterojunction cell with a record efficiency of 26.6%[1]. A problem with this type of cells is that the process temperature that is allowed is limited, increasing the processing temperature results in decreasing passivation and thus loss of efficiency. The TOPCon concept can withstand higher processing temperatures, which is beneficial when it comes to applying a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer of certain metallization schemes. For n-TOPCon good results have been obtained in the past leading to a record efficiency of 25.7%[2]. For p-TOPCon, the efficiency is significantly lower and the cause of this discrepancy is not fully understood yet. In this work, the boron doped TOPCon configuration was optimized by optimizing all of the individual components of this passivating contact concept. During this work the tunnel oxide, which can be grown using variousmethods, proved essential to obtain a good passivation. A comparison was made between four different growth methods for the tunnel oxide, from which it was concluded that the thermally grown tunnel oxide performed best in terms of passivation quality and thermal stability. The optimal p-TOPCon stack was found to consist of three layers: a thin intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer, followed by a boron doped a-Si:H layer. The p-TOPCon stack is finalized by depositing a thin silicon carbide (SiC) capping layer, which was also boron doped. Besides passivation, the specific contact resistivity was also investigated. A metallization stack consisting of titanium, palladium, and silver proved to result in the lowest contact resistivity values. The lowest value which was measured was 10 m­cm2, this is below the threshold value for which fill factor (FF) losses are to be expected. Implementing a thin tungsten oxide (WOx) layer underneath this metallization stack resulted in a stark increase in the specific contact resistivity values. Furthermore, the tunnel oxide influenced the contact resistivity values, where a lower oxidation time and temperature resulted in lower contact resistivity values. In order to better understand the correlation between contact resistivity and passivation, the contact resistivity values and corresponding recombination current values were fitted to two different models: the oxide tunneling model [3] and the pinholes model [4]. The measured resistivity values all laid in the saturated regime, whichmade it difficult to exclude one of the two models. The passivation quality of the p-TOPCon stack was improved by altering the tunnel oxide to a thermally grown oxide and optimizing the TOPCon stack. This resulted in an implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) value of 710 mV and an implied fill factor (iFF) value of 84.5 %. A good contact was obtained with a titanium, palladium, silver metallization. This resulted in a specific contact resistivity value of 10m­cm2.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Congestion is one of the big annoyances people experience in their everyday life. Furthermore, congestion has negative effects on both the environment and the economy. In short, it forms a very big problem to society. This thesis focuses on a specific type of congestion, namely a ‘wide moving jam’. This is typically a short jam that propagates in the opposite direction of the traffic. The short jam usually originates at a ‘weak link’ of any specific road. An example of such a weak link is the location where four lanes become three lanes and people are asked to merge. The general rule is that the outflow of traffic in a wide moving jam is 30% lower than the free capacity of the road. This means that the realized capacity of the road can be much lower than the theoretical capacity. A very well-known example of this in the Netherlands is the freeway route A13-A20-A16 which passes Rotterdam. It has been shown that a large part of the congestion on the A13 is caused by moving jams [Vonk Noordegraaf, 2013]. This route will be the subject of the analysis performed in this thesis. Often there is a combination of factors that contribute to the formation of a wide moving jam. Speed and density are high but there is another specific reason (or more) at play. In such a situation the state of traffic is not stable and therefore a small disruption can cause a jam. The general strategy in combatting these wide moving jams is to lower the inflow of traffic onto the jam. Algorithms have been developed that are able to detect and dissolve wide moving jams with use of variable speed signs to control traffic flow. However, while this measure is successful in solving a wide moving jam there are side effects. The variable speed sign changes the behaviour of the road users in such a way that congestion will form elsewhere. It has been studied that the impact of the side effects are in the same order of magnitude as the initial problem. Instead of cutting off the flow to solve the moving jam why not stimulate the flow at the known locations where they originate? In this thesis it is proposed to solve the operational bottleneck that causes a wide moving jam by stimulating vehicles to maintain their speed. At the origin of a wide moving jam a dynamic road sign will be placed that displays your speed with a L if you are driving too slow and a J if your speed is sufficient. To investigate the effect of stimulating vehicles to increase or maintain their speed, traffic is divided into two groups, a fast group and a slow group. Simulations are done where vehicles from the fast group and the slow groups are mixed. The range of free speed is constant but the compositions of vehicles with high free speed and low free speed is variable. The simulations show how more uniform free speed results in less congestion in both cases, whether the ratio of fast to low vehicles is close to 100 or 0. The difference is in the level of congestion, when the majority of vehicles are fast the flow discharge rate stays approximately constant. However, when the majority of vehicles is slow, the flow discharge rate is not. As the percentage of fast vehicles is decreased congestion decreases but speed in congestion decreases as well, therefore the critical density decreases. A smiley traffic sign that encourages vehicles to increase their speed can be used in combatting wide moving jams by reducing the bottleneck and therefore the chance a wide moving jam will form. When speed and density are high a smaller disruption is less likely to cause a wide moving jam. It is difficult to define a critical size for the bottleneck as it depends on the state of traffic. However, it is found that when the percentage of fast vehicles succeeds the percentage of slow vehicles the speed inside the congestion is more stable.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Coenders, A.M.J. (mentor)","2017","Additional thesis - Due to an expected increase in rainfall intensity in the future because of climate change for the area of Rotterdam, the amount of storm water runoff will increase as well, resulting in higher stress on the sewer system. But until now we don’t fully understand the behavior of a sewer system. This additional thesis should help in a better understanding of the system, as it investigates the hydrological response time of the urban drainage system of Rotterdam and focuses on the effect of imperviousness. This research is based on data which are collected during the first seven months of operation of the monitoring system at 21 combined sewer overflow (CSO) weirs which was implemented in June 2016. As the hydrological response time gives information about the behavior of a sewage system, it’s an important parameter to investigate and the question is how it’s being influenced by parameters such as the imperviousness and to what extent the behavior of the sewer districts in Rotterdam is different from what we would expect from theory. From the results, we see that there is no single hydrological response time for both Time-to-Peak and Peak-to-Peak responses. The response times are highly variable with large standard deviations. There seems to be no clear linear relationship with the imperviousness or the connected surface area for the sewer system of Rotterdam. Furthermore, no significant relationship was found for several rainfall characteristics like intensity, rain event duration and cumulative rain volumes in the previous period with the hydrological response time. Finally, it was shown that the large variability in response times is mainly associated with assumptions on starting time of a rain event, which can produce large Time-to-Peak responses. However, Peak-to-Peak responses found in the research are also significantly larger than the responses found in theory. All in all, the results have shown that the response times are larger than we expected from theory and that variability cannot be explained by variability in rainfall characteristics nor by relations with catchment size or imperviousness for the urban drainage system of Rotterdam. For future research, it is recommended to have a further look into the system responses by doing a signal analysis for individual events in order to understand the high variability in responses. Furthermore, the rain radar, which will be implemented in Rotterdam in the summer of 2017, might help in a better understanding of the influence of local rainfall variability on the response time.","Hydrological Response Time; Urban Drainage System; Time-to-Peak; Peak-to-Peak; Imperviousness","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS) – where not the whole breast but only the tumour is dissected – is the most common and preferable treatment for these woman. However, 20 to 55% of the patients’ needs a second surgery because of positive margins. A dissected tumour has a positive margin if it lacks a border of 2mm healthy tissue at any point. Currently, no instruments are available to provide intraoperative distinction between adipose and muscle tissue with real-time feedback. This thesis evaluates a ‘smart’ electrosurgical knife, which uses Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) to discriminate between tumour and adipose tissue to assess margins intraoperative with real-time feedback. Previous research has shown that DRS can discriminate between tumour and adipose tissue. In addition, electrosurgical cutting in adipose tissue does not affect the measured DRS spectra. This thesis focuses on detecting muscle tissue under a layer of adipose tissue with DRS while cutting the adipose tissue using an electrosurgical knife. An answer to this research question is provided based on four experiments. All experiments are performed on pork muscle- and adipose tissue. DR spectra are measured with multiple probes and a ‘smart’ electrosurgical knife. PNSas software is used to acquire the spectra and fit the data. First, the influence of electrosurgical cutting and coagulation is described. This is accomplished by examining the shape and size of the cut and measuring DR spectra. Second, the transition from adipose to muscle tissue was identified in the resulting DR spectra. In addition, chromophore concentrations are retrieved from the fit data. The second experiment was repeated on cut muscle tissue. Moreover, the DR spectra obtained while cutting with an electrosurgical knife are presented.","Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; tumour margin assessment; breast conserving surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017",": Identifying faults early on in the design phase drastically reduces the cost of fixing them and can even prevent the loss of a spacecraft. The Correctness, Modeling and Performance of Aerospace Systems (COMPASS) project created a toolset to approach the design of systems with a model-based angle, specifically critical on-board systems for the space domain. The COMPASS toolset requires an input model written in the high-level System-Level Integrated Modeling (SLIM) language. Systems engineers working with a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach commonly use a graphical modeling language to model systems on an architectural level. One of modeling languages most used for this purpose is Systems Modeling Language (SysML). For optimal use of the COMPASS toolset in an MBSE design project, a smooth transition between SysML and SLIM is desired. There is currently a gap between these two languages is present. The challenge lays in the fact that systems engineers using a graphical modeling language are not software engineers, which limits the ability to model the architectural SysML model in SLIM. This thesis presents a new developed methodology, the SysML to SLIM Transformation Methodology (SSTM), to develop a space SysML model which is able to automatically transform a SysML model into a SLIM model, ready to be imported by the COMPASS toolset. This allows a systems engineer without software engineering knowledge to model in a familiar modeling environment, but adds the ability to directly run tests on the model using the COMPASS toolset thus giving valuable insight into the behavior, limitations and possible errors of the system under development. Ultimately reducing development time and cost. A methodology based on the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) method is created that introduces a set of custom stereotypes. Modeling with these stereotypes allow the transformation tool to automatically transform the SysML model into a SLIM model. The open-source, Eclipse-based modeling environment, Papyrus is used to model the SysML model. A profile with the required stereotypes is developed which can be imported and used in Papyrus projects. The transformation tool, written in Java, has a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to load the SysML model and save it as a SLIM model. Two experiments were executed and are presented in this thesis. Verifying the SSTM methodology and transformation tool was the main focus point of the first experiment in which a battery-sensor system was modeled. A second experiment was performed modeling an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) case study to test the possibilities and limitations of modeling a complex space related system and identifying improvement points for the SSTM methodology. The first experiment successfully verified that using the SSTM methodology a SysML model can be developed without significantly more effort than to develop any other SysML model. It also verified that the tool successfully transformed the SysML model into a correct SLIM model that can be used in the COMPASS toolset. The second experiment, modeling an ADCS case study, showed that a simple space system can successfully be developed with the SSTM methodology. The case study also identified important improvement points for the SSTM methodology to model complex space systems. The experiments performed show that the SSTM methodology and transformation tool together bridge the gap between SysML and SLIM models and can be analyzed in the COMPASS toolset. This can be performed without significantly more modeling effort and in-depth programming knowledge. At this stage the SSTM methodology and transformation tool are ready to be used on component-based systems with event-based error models. Improvements in the SSTM methodology are proposed. The improvements will increase the maturity of the SSTM methodology and allow the modeler to model complex space systems SysML models with more ease and with less programming knowledge.","Model-Based Systems Engineering; Model-Based Embedded Software Engineering; SysML; SLIM; Transformation; Methodology; COMPASS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Currently our energy supply system is experiencing a transition towards more sustainable energy generation with an increased amount of renewable energy. However, the high fluctuations in renewable energy generation make balancing demand and supply more complex. One solution to cope with high production fluctuations is to improve the energy system on the demand side (Siano, 2014). The introduction of Home Energy Management Systems (HEMSs) to the electricity infrastructure should contribute to the demand side management of our energy system. HEMSs have the potential to intelligently integrate the behaviour and actions of all connected users, improving demand forecasting and scheduling of electricity generation (Galli & Scaglione, 2011). However, currently there is a large uncertainty about the extent to which households in the Netherlands are willing to purchase HEMSs due to ethical dilemmas. When intelligent and connected systems are designed, it is important to adequately safeguard ethical values that are affected by the application of the technology in design engineering (de Greef, Mohabir, van der Poel, & Neerincx, 2013). The introduction of the smart meter among others revealed that failing to take conflicts with human ethical values into account in the development of technology leads to technological artefacts violating ethical values and consequently the predicted benefits may not be realised.The purpose of this work is to construct performance requirements for HEMSs compliant with household values. The construction of performance requirements is done by translating values into performance requirements using a value-oriented approach. We have reviewed literature concerning value-oriented approaches, finding multiple studies attempting to translate values into design requirements (Bresciani et al., 2004; Friedman, Kahn Jr., & Borning, 2008; van de Poel, 2013). However, none of these works provided explicit and concrete steps for the translation of values into design requirements. Hence, we constructed our approach based on the values hierarchy by van de Poel (2013), enriching the values hierarchy with explicit and transparent steps specifying the information gathering process. Our value-oriented approach to translate values into performance requirements is our theoretical contribution. The input for the translation of values into performance requirements are the values privacy, autonomy, reliability, usability and economic development, which were identified by Ligtvoet (2015) as to most critical values for the development of HEMSs. In the translation of these values to performance requirements we pay explicit attention to concerns and norms existing around HEMSs. Besides, we present two formats that have proven to be helpful in constructing the norms and performance requirements in a consistent and repeatable way. The outcome of our value-oriented approach is a list of performance requirements, which is used to evaluate the hardware requirements of two HEMSs: the Toon and Smile P1. In order to assess whether the technical properties of these systems satisfy the established performance requirements, we technically investigated both these HEMSs in terms of data and control flow. Based on this assessment we concluded that for every value there were performance requirements not compliant with the two HEMS designs. Therefore, we can conclude that these five values are indeed critical and that HEMSs require improvements on both a technical level and institutional level to avoid moral issues with values.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","","",""

Surprisingly, the results empirically document a positive effect of the anchor (52-week high) in the bidder merger gains and that low-tier investment banks might provide higher bidder merger gains than their top-tier counterparties. The results of this study contradict a previous research and suggests that for investigating the anchoring effect more focus should be allocated into the run-up period plus the timing after the announcement altogether.

In addition, these kinds of projects are in line with the need for improvement of the quality of the public urban space. Nowadays, when a municipality applies for funding with the national government for the construction of a transportation project a Cost-Benefit analysis (CBA) has to be conducted by an independent party (Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, 2012). In the CBA the costs and benefits of the project on the society are balanced and therefore provides the CBA decision-makers with important policy information; whether the benefits outweigh the costs of the project compared to the state of affairs in which no project is build- also called the reference case (van Wee & Rietveld, 2014). The use of the CBA in the decision-making process leads to a better decision-making process (Mouter, Annema, & van Wee, 2013), but it is unclear which exact role a CBA plays in the decision-making process, because politicians also have other reasons than the results of a CBA for reaching a go/no-go decision (Rienstra, 2008; Eijgenraam, Koopmans, Tang, & Verster, 2000; Annema, 2014; Mackie, 2010). A limitation of the CBA is that not all (welfare) effects can be taken (properly) into account in a CBA (Mouter, Annema, & van Wee, 2015). CBAs are often incomplete because project effects are uncertain, unknown or difficult to monetize (Mouter, Annema, & van Wee, 2013).

(mentor)","2017","A literature survey which concerns a variety of wave generation and absorption methods was accomplished. The survey deals with the methods used for the experiment wave tank and numerical wave tank. Their implementations are also described very briefly. The numerical wave tank (NWT) was set up using the hybrid particle-mesh method with the emphasis on the wave generation of solitary wave and linear progressive wave, and passive absorption at the far side of the wave tank. The Discontinuous Galerkin method was applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equations on the background mesh while the particles are used for solving the non-linear advection term. The waves are generated by using a piston-type wavemaker with the use of first-order linear wavemaker theory. For the absorption of reflected waves at the termination end, the sponge layer approach was implemented making use of viscous damping or internal friction among water particles. The hyperbolic tangent function is found to be applicable for smoothly increasing viscosity in the damping zone, which is also be able to prevent the formation of rigid body at the transition point. The drawbacks of the passive absorption technique are not only the extra cost of computational power and domain size, but also the rising slope of average water surface elevation induced by the accumulation of water particles near the end of the wave tank. The solitary waves of small amplitude could be simulated with reliable accuracy and also did the linear progressive waves in the intermediate water. The short waves and the long waves need to paid more attention for the wave generation boundary condition. Regarding the passive absorption for both of solitary waves and progressive waves, the same hyperbolic tangent function was used for viscosity functions which increases spatially. The solitary wave can be damped out using this function while the latter one cannot be damped, leading to the instability of the computation induced by the loss of the particles in the mesh system.","hybrid particle-mesh; numerical wave tank; wave absorption; sponge layer approach","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Increasing the capacity of offshore wind energy is a necessary step in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. In order to accelerate this process, the costs of wind energy should be reduced to make it more competitive with traditional energy sources. Cost reduction could be achieved by increasing the lifetime of an Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT). The lifetime is directly affected by the amount of damping present in an OWT. Hence, it is vital to have accurate estimates of the damping in order to predict the lifetime. All Offshore Wind Turbines are equipped with a bidirectional accelerometer, resulting in large amounts of data that can be used for identification purposes. Using Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) it is possible to estimate the structural parameters of an OWT from output measurement data. Due to technical limitations, however, the available measurement data does not have a constant sampling frequency. Consequently, conventional OMA methods based on discrete-time models cannot be applied directly. The goal of this thesis is to investigate whether the damping of an OWT can be accurately estimated using non-uniformly sampled measurement data. Two different identification approaches are taken to answer this problem. The first approach consists of resampling the measurement data with a constant sampling frequency and subsequently applying OMA methods. The second approach uses a continuous-time identification method, which can be applied directly to non-uniformly sampled measurement data. In this thesis, the Predictor-Based Subspace IDentification (PBSID) method is used for the identification of measurement data. This method is based on a discrete-time state-space representation of a system. Using Laguerre projections the PBSID algorithm can also be extended to the continuous-time domain. The performance of both the discrete and continuous-time PBSID algorithms is examined by applying them to a simulation example. It is observed that both methods are able to provide damping estimates of similar accuracy. Following the simulation example, both identification approaches are applied to wind turbine simulation and measurement data, respectively. Furthermore, the results from these two approaches are compared with the results obtained from uniformly sampled measurement data taken from an experimental OWT. It is concluded that accurate damping estimates of an OWT can be obtained from non-uniformly sampled measurement data.","Wind energy; offshore wind turbine; damping identification; subspace identification; continuous-time identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

(mentor); Balkenende, A.R. (mentor)","2017","Over the course of the 20th century, plastics have transformed the way we use, design and manufacture the products that define our everyday lives. Yet as our global demand for plastics increases, so does the amount of plastic waste that is created. Currently only a small amount of the material value of this waste stream is retrieved through global recycling practices. Closed-loop recycling, in which the material is brought back to an equal or comparable level of quality, currently represents only a small amount of all plastics recycling activities (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). This system urgently needs a re-think. This first part of this project describes the result of a study that was done to help companies to significantly scale up closed loop plastics recycling. The main goals of this collaborative project, initiated by several corporate members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s CE100 community, were to evaluate existing closed loops of post-consumer plastics, provide recommendations to overcome common barriers to closing these loops and scaling up the use of recycled plastics. Consumer products, rather than plastic packaging items, were the main focus of the project. The second part of the project describes the development of an online course on the topic of design for closed loop plastics recycling. This course is aimed at designers and design students. Initially the scope of this second phase involved applying the insights that were gained during the first phase to the development of a set of guidelines for design for plastics recycling, including the application of recycled plastic material. However throughout the research it became clear that several sets of guidelines, including those aimed specifically at plastics parts and products, exist within the literature. A problem with such rules concerning the design for recycling of plastic parts that their effectiveness is highly dependent on the end-of-life context, the type of product and the recycling technologies that are used. It was therefore decided that the focus of this second phase should be on the development of something that could help designers obtain the right mindset with which they could navigate and resolve these kind of issues themselves.","Circular Economy; Design for Recycling; Plastics; Online Education; Online Course; Online Learning; Ellen MacArthur Foundation; CE100","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","Introduction An aircraft breakdown, crew coming late, or bad weather conditions are examples of disruptions that airlines have to cope with on a daily basis. Even small disruptions might cause infeasibility of airline schedules. Currently, operation controllers of most airlines solve disruptions manually at the day of operation. They attempt to make the schedules feasible again and strive to return to the original schedule as soon as possible. In addition, it is of great importance to minimize the costs. However, dealing with all the rules, regulations, preferences and costs makes that the recovery process is a complex problem. Therefore, decision support tools need to be developed to assist operation controllers during the recovery process. A decision support tool can provide several solutions to the operation controllers considering all kind of parameters. However, it is of great interest that solutions are generated in short computation times since decisions have to be made in a short amount of time. This research project considers the crew recovery problem, since crew recovery is one of the hardest recovery tasks. Many regulations have to be considered and human factors are involved as well. In addition, after fuel costs, crew costs are one of the largest costs of an airline. Therefore, in this research project a decision support tool is developed for the crew recovery problem. This Master Thesis research project is conducted at the University of Technology Delft (TU Delft). More specifically, at the Air Transport and Operations department from the faculty of Aerospace Engineering.

(mentor)","2017","When people interact with each other, it is often fruitful to cooperate. Cooperation is however not always established naturally, since in many systems it is not beneficial for rational actors to cooperate without the assurance of reciprocation. In real-world scenarios authoritarian central parties or social pressure can be used to organise cooperation by giving some assurances of reciprocation. In open access systems on the Internet however, both these mechanisms fall short. There is thus a need for other mechanisms that can realise cooperation in such systems, which remains an unsolved problem today. A recent innovation that has opened up new avenues in many applications is blockchain technology. The blockchain is a new type of datastructure that can provide reliable and tamperproof storage of information in distributed environments. In this thesis we apply the principles of blockchains to the problem of realising cooperation by creating an incentive system called the Multichain. By recording historic behaviour using blockchains, we utilise the principle of the shadow of the future to incentivise cooperation. The steps towards a system that can use this idea to establish cooperation in BitTorrent networks are identified. The first step, consisting of the creation of records, is designed and implemented, taking several issues of performance and security into consideration. Furthermore it is deployed to real-world users and evaluated. The second step consists of the discovery of records by others in the network. For this purpose several algorithms are explored, showing that a focus on high reputation peers can improve the efficiency of the discovery process. Additionally a prototype version of the discovery process is implemented and tested in a distributed manner. The successful implementation and validation of these two steps show the utility of blockchains in distributed networks, and pave the way for realising behavioural change using the Multichain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Distributed Systems group","",""

The goal of this programme is to create an opportunity for women to start and develop their own sandals company, with sandals made from natural/ consumer waste materials, freely or cheaply obtainable in the Gambia. During this project, research was conducted on the topics of: Female Entrepreneurship, Footwear Culture and Availability of Eco-Materials in the Gambia. From this research, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The most opportune way of empowering women to develop a successful sandals company, is by setting up a programme in collaboration with the social enterprise, YepAfrica. The main advantage of this collaboration would be the opportunity to combine sandal design- and production trainings with business- and marketing trainings, which are currently being provided by YepAfrica. 2. Sandals play a significant role in the Gambian footwear culture, however quality sandals are currently missing from the market. 3. There are at least 10 types of (waste) materials, easily obtainable in the Gambia, that could be suitable for the production of sandals. Four sandal concepts were developed, of which an initial design was chosen to be implemented into a women’s empowerment programme. The design process was translated into a training plan for aspiring entrepreneurs, which teaches the process of designing and producing sandals in a structured and visual way. A programme implementation plan was specified, which proposes an approach for setting up a fruitful women’s empowerment programme, resulting in a successful sandals company, independently run by female entrepreneurs in the Gambia.","Female; Women; Entrepreneurs; Empowerment; Africa; Gambia; Sandals; Footwear; Training","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

In this research project a testing method was established that can be used to test the influence of different padding parameters on the performance of the padding in relation to the skaters’ injury risks. An existing numerical model was updated and validated by comparing three simulations of the model to real impact scenarios. Because the validation tests resembled the real impact scenarios quite well, the model is deemed suitable for performing more padding tests. Furthermore, tests were done with variable air pressure and cover friction. Injury criteria for the head, neck and spine were measured. The HIC, Nkm and CTI did not show a clear correlation between one of the variables and any of the injury criteria. They did give an impression of the possible severity of the incurred injury in that impact scenario. A threshold value of 700 for the HIC, corresponding to a 30% risk of incurring an AIS ≥ 2 head injury, was exceeded by 70% of the measured values. Also quite an amount of Nkm and CTI values were above their threshold value of 1.0, which corresponds to a 25% risk of incurring an AIS ≥ 3 injury. These high injury criterion values may point towards the high risk of skaters of incurring severe injuries. However, the large amount of high values is not in proportion to the amount of severe injuries that is incurred in reality. This may be explained by the fact that a real skater can react earlier and more active to the impact than the model can.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Biomechanical Design – Sports Engineering","",""

Most of the fresh water is being wasted on land fields for irrigation. Farmers waste so much fresh water, when watering their crops. To conserve water, measurements need to be done efficiently. However, soil moisture sensors currently available on the market are quite expensive and have high power consumption to be used in developing countries extensively. Currently, ICT technologies moving at a rapid pace has resulted in a broad domain called, Internet of Things (IoT), which is becoming more and more ubiquitous. They are being deployed as part of smart solutions for purposes as remote monitoring and automation, to solve individual as well as social needs. In this work we present a new solar powered passive moisture sensor, which is a low cost alternative moisture sensor with low power consumption. To reduce the power consumption we took two approaches. Firstly, we target to reduce the power consumption during operation and secondly, we aim to harvest solar energy to prevent battery depletion. The Passive moisture sensor measures the volumetric water content in soil by means of two electrodes composed of different metals, such as copper and zinc. The potential difference between the metals changes with the change of moisture in the soil. Since, the measurements are based on the potential difference between the metals there is no energy consumed by the node. We show that measurements performed by the passive moisture sensor correlates with the measurements performed by the commercial moisture sensor, such as, Decagon EC5. Our passive moisture sensor solution is at least 30% less expensive than other solutions currently available on the market. To reduce the energy consumption as much as possible, we let both main components of the sensor node, microcontroller and radio, duty cycle independently of each other. Therefore, we have developed the Harmonic-Medium Access Control (H-MAC) protocol which ensures that the duty cycle of both components do not conflict with each other. And allows the communication between the sensor nodes and Cloud to be bi-directional. H-MAC makes the network scalable and resilient to failure. With H-MAC the radio has lower duty cycle, lower energy consumption and has lower latency than X-MAC. Further, to ensure that the batteries of the nodes last for as long as possible we powered the nodes with solar energy. Since, solar energy is not consistent we need to predict when will the sun provide enough energy to power the sensor nodes. We show that by using the weather forecasting and insert information about solar radiation and sunshine duration into our prediction model we get an improvement of about 10% on the prediction of solar energy availability. In this work we provide convincing results that our passive moisture sensor is a low cost, low power alternative","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Water scarcity is a severe problem that needs to be faced to avoid devastating effects in future generations (WWAP, 2017). Changes need to be made in the direction of a circular economy, where water is used wisely and wastewater is not an end product, but a resource mine (2030 WRG, 2015). To do so, there are available technologies with great potential. One of them is the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), which can convert organic matter from wastewater into an energy source (methane) and get a effluent suitable for re use in irrigation (Smith et al., 2012). The process is already applied in full scale for industrial wastewater, but still have challenges to overcome before it can be used for low strength wastewater, such as domestic . If a suitable system for this is developed, meaning economically feasible, then there will be a continuous source to feed the reactor, meaning a constant energy production (McCarty et al., 2011; Puyol et al., 2017). One of the main limitations of AnMBR is that fouling reduces the efficiency of the system and increments the operation costs (Ozgun et al., 2013). This study focuses on understanding which sludge characteristics influence fouling the most. The Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm) was used to analyse anaerobic sludge for the first time, providing a method to quantify fouling in anaerobic sludge; in parallel, sludge characterization was performed based on the anaerobic degradation process. Sludge was collected from a full scale digester, and obtained results compared with lab and pilot scale results available in literature. Particle size presented the main influence over filterability, where smaller particles cause an increase in filterability. On the other hand, the intermediate and end-products of anaerobic digestion showed no significant influence over filterability in the analysed ranges.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

Ahold Delhaize acknowledges its role in this matter and wants to contribute with a healthier assortment, and inspiring programs and services. Moreover, Albert Heijn wants to shift its role towards one where they stimulate healthier lifestyles. Problem statement However, the company's outlined health-related innovations are mainly based on a feasibility perspective, where customer-centeredness and desirability have not been sufficiently addressed yet. Even so, an elaborate customer understanding is needed to design a service that supports and inspires healthy food choices. Approach To gain insight in the customer journey of healthy food choices, qualitative methods (interviews, contextmapping) are used for explorative research and quantitative methods (online survey) for validation of an initial service design. For the design and implementation of a valuable service for both parties (Albert Heijn and its customers) methodologies of Value Proposition Design, Hooked, the Lean-Startup and Design Roadmapping are applied. Solution The designed digital service system is comprised of multiple features. An online dashboard forms the system’s foundation, which is connected to in-store touchpoints, providing support and inspiration on relevant moments in the customer journey. Together, the features deliver three value propositions: - Determine your focus points with personal insights and receive recommendations on how to reach these in an approachable way - Receive recipe inspiration that matches your personal goal and focus points, based on convenient variation of your favourites - Receive activity-based nutritional guidelines and recipe recommendations Implementation However, to realise the envisioned service system without redundant investments, it is recommended that developments should focus on iterations and learnings, allowing the provided value to expand over time. Initial value will be delivered with a minimum viable product, which is a general version of the service. After this, the recommended step-by-step iterations result in a more personalised, then multi-sided and finally integrated version of the service. Value for Albert Heijn With the designed innovation, Albert Heijn achieves a more substantial role in its customer's lifestyle. The company takes it responsibility, and strengthens its reputation while binding with customers. Finally, new business opportunities are created for Albert Heijn's Sustainable Retailing strategy.","retail; design; roadmapping; contextmapping; service design; customer journey; Albert Heijn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

The coastline of the Mekong Delta suffers from severe erosion and mangrove degradation. Due to relative sea level rise and climate change it is crucial to design adaptable and proactive coastal protection measures. From a literature study into ongoing erosion processes, local coastal protection problems, and mangrove habitat requirements, boundary conditions were determined. As a basic concept of a Building with Nature alternative for the Decision Support Tool, a combination of a mangrove fringe with its accompanying wave attenuating foreshore and an earth dyke were considered. Two requirements with respect to a maximum wave height in front of the mangrove fringe and earth dyke, were translated into a conceptual profile of the foreshore: a convex-up bathymetric profile. This schematised profile was adjusted for two case study areas. The numerical model SWASH was used to translate the offshore boundary conditions into near shore conditions. Annual and heavy storm conditions were modelled for both case study areas, in order to test the performance of the convex-up profile. The model results led to designs of the foreshores of the case study areas. Possible dredging locations, equipment, transport of the dredged material, and different nourishment techniques were considered. The proposed Building with Nature designs and design alternatives were compared with current coastal protection measures by a cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. It was found that a convex-up profile improves the conditions for mangroves to develop, as this significantly decreases the hydrodynamic forces in front of the mangrove fringe and creates an additional zone above Mean Sea Level suitable for mangrove colonisation. The minimal required width for mangroves to serve as a self-sustaining coastal protection measurement is dependent on multiple factors including fringe density and local hydrology. The minimal required mangrove width was established to be 700 m for the case study site of Tam Giang Dong at the east coast and 350 m for An Minh at the west coast, where the hydraulic conditions are milder. The point at which full restoration of the convex-up profile can compete economically with a breakwater is dependent on the foreshore profile and erosion rate. For the east coast, in order to maintain the present situation, an erosion rate of 24 m/year or less was determined as the tipping point. For full restoration of the convex-up profile to be economically favourable the upper limit of the erosion rate is 20 m/year. For the west coast these points are 17 m/year and 10 m/year respectively. For the case study site of Tam Giang Dong, as well as for the case study site at the east coast, due to high erosion rates and high cliffs in front of the mangrove fringe, the proposed design is the option 'mud or sandy-mud nourishment in combination with a permeable breakwater'. In other parts of the Mekong Delta area with lower erosion rates Building with Nature alternatives without permeable breakwaters are viable as well.","Coastal protection Mekong Delta Vietnam; Building with Nature; Mangroves; Nourishment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This report describes an investigation into Objects with Intent, embodied agents in human activity. The aim of this project is to generate more insights in the design approach and establish guidelines for the design of these objects. It makes use of a research-through-design approach and has a strong emphasis on intention. Some of the philosophical background of agency, intention and embodiment is explored. This background lays the foundations for a conceptual framework in which the characteristics of the collaboration between human and objects are defined. Most emphasis is on the role of intention in this collaboration resulting in a description of hierarchies in intention and the various possible relations between the intentions of the object and human activity. Building on this theoretical framework, a field study is done on guide dog teams. The analogy between guide dogs and Objects with Intent is explored and the framework developed earlier is updated accordingly. It is shown how information, negotiation and autonomy play an important role in the collaboration. The division of tasks appears to be crucial in the establishment of this collaboration. Insight is generated in the aligning of intentions in the activity of the guide dog team. A second empirical study is carried out in which a stimulus is used to uncover more about Objects with Intent. This backpack is designed as an Object with Intent for visually impaired people that could help them in their participation in public space. Participants in this study use this backpack in a crude simulation of a street environment and are interviewed about the attribution of intentions and the characteristics of the collaboration. To attribute intention, the behavior should be more active and more goal directed than simple stimulus-response. There also appears to be strong relation between understanding of behavior and the attribution of intention.

HMC therefore participated in a recently executed Joint Industry Project (JIP) for the installation of offshore pipelines. Possible dynamic loading on these pipelines during installation is the vortex induced vibrations (VIV) caused by currents. When a fluid flow passes a cylindrical structure, unsteady flow patterns due to vortex shedding may cause oscillations of the element normal to their longitudinal axis. It is observed that VIV has influence on the fatigue lifetime of these structures, therefore an analysis of the dynamic behavior of slender cylindrical structures encountering VIV is performed in this research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and dredging engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Tensegrity robots are researched for robotic locomotion, as they have remarkable properties which makes them well suited for physical interaction with unknown and unstructured environments. So far, locomotion on rough terrain has not been demonstrate, but only on flat and moderately hilly terrain. Moreover, research merely focuses on rolling and crawling, while from conventional robotics legged-designs and legged locomotion is researched to traverse rough terrain. Therefore in this thesis, as rough terrain is everywhere in real life scenarios, the goal is to achieve walking locomotion with a 4-legged tensegrity robot. To this end, a method is proposed for static stable walking locomotion, which is based on a set of task trajectories of the robots contact nodes and its center of mass. For tracking control of these trajectories with existing control techniques sequence of reference configurations are required. Hence, a tensegrity reference planning algorithm is derived that generates these sequences of feasible equilibrium reference configurations for quasi-static motion. These reference configurations can directly fed into existing control thereby complementing the field of tensegrity control perfectly. Numerical results from simulations indicate that the proposed reference planner performs well. Moreover, results demonstrate static stable walking with a four-legged tensegrity robot is feasible both on flat as rough terrain with obstacles up to a sixth of the robots height. Thus, the goal is achieved. To the authors knowledge, this research is the first to 1) show truly rough terrain locomotion, and 2) demonstrate that controlled walking locomotion with accurate node placement is feasible with a tensegrity robot.","Tensegrity robot; tensegrity locomotion; reference planning; differential geometry; static stable walking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-04-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","Mechanical Engineering, BioMechanical Design, BioRobotics","ME2590-32",""

(mentor)","2017","Over the years, the installed capacity of offshore wind turbines is increasing rapidly. However, the Levelized Costs Of Energy (LCOE) is still higher than the LCOE of traditional energy production methods like nuclear power or energy from coals or gas. This research focuses on a further decrease of the LCOE, by minimizing the mass of a monopile support structure of a wind turbine. This is done in a so called integrated way: Optimizing the tower and the foundation together. The design variables used in this research are the wall thickness and the diameter of every +-3 meter section. These can even be cylindrical or conical. To simplify the problem, a parametrization of the designs is used, which reduces the design variables from around 180 to 28. This is checked with existing designs. Due to the interaction between mostly the first eigenfrequency and eigenmode, the diameter and the waves, it is expected that several local optima exist. Therefore, the proposed optimization strategy is a Particle Swarm Optimization which can be used for a global search for an initial position for a gradient based optimization to find a local optimum, which is possibly the global optimum. In this research the focus is on the Particle Swarm Optimization. The constraints of the optimization are Fatigue, Buckling, the maximum deflection of the monopile, the angle of the conical parts and the D/t-ratio of the monopile. These are used in the initial design of support structures, so that the optimized designs are realistic. To take the constraints into account, the objective is taken as the mass extended by the penalized constraints. To reduce the optimization time, the evaluations of the objective function are done by using load estimations instead of extensive load calculations. Several methods are compared on a theoretical basis: Response Surface Methodology, Radial Basis Functions, Kriging, Support Vector Regression, Multi-adaptive Regression Splines and Non-Uniform Regression B-Splines. The performance of a selection of methods is checked on the problem, to come up with reliable estimation methods. To improve the accuracy of the estimations, interaction of Particle Swarm Optimization and the estimators is proposed via estimator updating. During this research, an optimization tool for monopile support structures is developed. This tool is able to use calculations or estimations of the loads. In order to study the behaviour of the proposed optimization approach and to compare it with the traditional design approach, several case studies are formulated based on a realistic design problem. These are optimized with the optimization tool. Using a constant tower diameter, the optimization tool is able to reduce the mass of the support structure with 13\%. Using the tower diameter also as design variable in the optimization gives a further reduction of the mass with 4\%. Several test runs are done, to check whether a global optimum is found or not.","wind energy; wind turbine; offshore wind turbine; support structure; optimization; estimators; radial basis functions; kriging; support vector regression; nurbs; response surface methodology; estimator updating; integrated optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision & Microsystems Engineering (PME)","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2017","Re-entry is a term that is applied when one would like to transport some (human) payload from an orbit around a certain body towards the surface of that body. With an entry velocity of multiple kilometers per second, having the vehicle carrying this payload not smashed into pieces at the end of flight is one of the key points of re-entry. Using a guidance, navigation, and control system (GNC), one is capable of defining a path through the atmosphere towards a predefined target, and following that trajectory so that a safe landing can be assured. This thesis focuses on the navigation module of the GNC system, where the application of a Flush Airdata Sensor (FADS) and the comparison between the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and the Particle Filter (PF) is considered. The approach that is taken to evaluate the performance of the three filters and the FADS is based on the design of a re-entry simulator, which provides a 6 degree-of-freedom simulated motion through the atmosphere. The guidance system consists of a set of commanded attitude angles and for the control system, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is designed that is able to control the vehicle throughout the hypersonic descent of the atmospheric re-entry flight. Then, the EKF, UKF, and PF are designed and evaluated individually, using measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and the FADS. From the individual assessment of the filters, it is found that the PF outperforms the two Kalman filters. Concluding this, the PF-based navigation module is integrated into the simulator, thereby completing the GNC-system. The FADS shows improvement of the position estimation results, as the final error for a navigation module without the FADS is 0.93 m for the altitude, whereas the integration of the FADS in that module results in a final estimation error of 0.62 m. In terms of velocity, errors in the magnitude of ~0.02 m/s are found, and, for the attitude angles, errors of ~0.02 degrees are estimated.","Re-entry; Space; Navigation; Particle Filter; Flush Airdata Sensor; GNC-system; GNC-system; Unscented Kalman Filter; UKF; Extended Kalman Filter; EKF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

At present, most of this clean energy is converted into electricity and used up directly or stored in the grids or batteries to be used later. Chemical storage of this energy is an attractive alternative due of its high energy density. Artificial photosynthesis is a hot field wherein researchers try to mimic the photosynthesis process of plants and try to convert solar energy into chemicals that can be stored. Photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one such pathway that is extensively investigated. However, the ideal semiconductor required to make this conversion efficient and economical is yet to be discovered. A big share of research also focuses on materials or techniques to improve the performance of these PEC devices independent of the semiconductor. Plasmonics, or plasmonic hot electron injection in particular, is such a technique that is being extensively investigated. Plasmonic hot electron injection is a relatively new phenomenon that could have potential application in many fields including photo-electrochemistry and photovoltaics. It is coveted as one of the techniques that could directly improve the performance efficiencies of solar and photo-electrochemical cells. But a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking. This is crucial for improving and optimizing this technology before it can have any practical application. In this thesis, photo-electrochemistry is used as a tool to study the plasmonic hot electron injection and shed more light on the fundamental aspects, at the nanoscale, involved in the excitation and injection of hot electrons into the conduction band of a semiconductor. Silver, gold and 50% silver – 50% gold alloy nanoparticles are used in this work to systematically<br/>study the effect of composition, size and concentration of these nanoparticles on the hot electron injection efficiency. Through this work, some fundamental understanding of the factors affecting the energy of the excited hot electron and hot electron injection process is obtained.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

Usually these rest gasses are flared to the atmosphere or re-used as fuel gas after compressing and cleaning it. At Shell Pernis Refinery currently Liquid Ring Compressors are used to compress flare-gas. This technique however has not been designed for processes with varying fluid composition, resulting in significant downtime leading to increased flaring. This thesis research aims to provide Shell with recommendations whether to apply another technique for compressing flare-gas: Liquid Jet Gas Ejector technology. Several alternative techniques for compressing flare-gas are investigated. From this investigation the Liquid Jet Gas Ejector is found to be the best alternative to the Liquid Ring Compressors. The Liquid Jet Gas Ejector is assessed technically and economically. With respect to the technical aspects, the physical principals and flow conditions are researched. A one-dimensional thermodynamic model is written to assess the ejector performance and create an optimized design for various applications. The model is validated against a state-of-the-art Liquid Jet Gas Ejector. In the economical analysis the Liquid Jet Gas Ejector is compared to the Liquid Ring Compressor for two cases on Shell Pernis. The first case investigates whether the Liquid Ring Compressors at a flare-gas recovery unit can be replaced by Liquid Jet Gas Ejectors applying various Shell tests. The second case compares the Liquid Ring Compressor and the Liquid Jet Gas Ejector for a greenfield opportunity for flare-gas compression on Pernis resulting in significantly reduced flaring. This thesis research project has proofed that there is a technical and economical case for applying Liquid Jet Gas Ejector technology for flare-gas compression.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-05-09","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Additional Thesis work performed as part of the master Hydraulic Engineering at Delft University of Technology in collaboration with University of Southampton, Ocean and Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography - In this research the outcome of several realisations of 10 different models from the CMIP5 program is used to predict the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).With her extreme phases ’El Niño’ and ’La Niña’, ENSO is probably the most infamous oceanographic and climate phenomenon in the physical climate system with a great influence on the world’s climate and weather systems. Despite the fame amongst public and the high importance in research programmes throughout the last decades, the potential causes, cyclicity patterns and the possible forcing of ENSO are still not fully understood. Even with state of the art models its predictability (up to 12 months ahead) remains quite low compared to the time scale of the phenomenon (2-5 years). In this study a statistical model is developed to predict ENSO with a transfer operator framework based on model output from 10 models. This method is based on a recent study by Sévellec [19] and transforms a deterministic single time series evolution of sea surface temperature in the Tropical Pacific, extracted from existing coupled atmosphere-ocean model data, into a probabilistic method to determine the evolution of an observational initial condition in time. The main goal of this research is to explore and define by means of hindcasting (predicting the past) the predictive skills and reliability of this statistical method. The results show that the reliability is similar to previous studies. Where the most computational extensive coupled ocean-atmosphere models show a good prediction skill up to 9 months, with this quick model a similar skill is sustained up to a prediction window of 5 months. Since this is the first time this method applied on ENSO, recommendations are done for further development of the model as well as for the application on ENSO. Suggestions for potential other systems this model could be applied to are made.","physical oceanography; numerical modeling; climate variability; ENSO","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2017","This thesis is concerned with characterising the plume expansion in the magnetic nozzle of a helicon thruster. The investigation took place in the context of the new electric propulsion laboratory of the Space Propulsion & Plasmas Group (EP2) of University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M) and the testcampaign of the helicon plasma thruster HPT05 prototype that is a joint project of SENER and EP2. The magnetic nozzle is a new plasma acceleration concept that can be used on several different electric thrusters. The helicon plasma thruster is a new type of electric thruster that aims to achieve high thrust density by using a helicon plasma source. The focus of this work is threefold: development, testing and application of electrostatic probe diagnostics for the EP2 lab; characterising the plume expansion and comparison to DiMagNo (magnetic nozzle model) simulations. Some figures of merit about the helicon thruster performance are estimated along the way. The diagnostics used in this thesis are simple and RF-compensated Langmuir probes, Faraday probes and emissive probes. Langmuir probe measurements were found useful for inferring the plasma density and providing the electron temperature which were found to be of the order of 〖10〗^16-〖10〗^18 m^(-3) and 3-5 eV respectively. RF-compensated probes could not be verified correctly as in the low plasma densities of n<〖10〗^19 m^(-3) one of main assumptions, ω_rf≪ω_pi was not valid. The emissive probe was operated in the floating potential in the limit of large emission method providing a fast and precise means to measure the plasma density. A Faraday probe was used to measure the ion current density. All probes are mounted on a three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) positioning system to provide spatially resolved measurements of the corresponding plasma parameters. The plume expansion was found to be independent of the the RF-power in both radial and axial dimension; the shape of the plume is therefore mainly determined by the shape of the magnetic nozzle. Observed radial asymmetries in plasma potential and electron temperature are attributed to the shape of the antenna. The downstream evolution of the electron temperature showed signs of polytropic cooling with γ_e=1.10±0.05 at 500 W operation while at higher power (>650 W) the observed behaviour was isothermal. The plume divergence half angle was found to remain constant downstream (>120 mm) indicating ion detachment from the magnetic fields lines. This was further corroborated by the downstream increase of the ratio of ion to magnetic flux. The presence of the magnetic nozzle significantly improved the plume divergence, decreasing the divergence half-angle with 7°. The axial evolution of measured plasma parameters in the plume were compared to the DiMagNo simulation for the nominal (500 W) case, which showed overall good agreement of ion Mach number, plasma potential, ion current density and plasma density1. Including the polytropic model for electron thermodynamics into DiMagNo was necessary to achieve agreement between simulation and measurement of the ion Mach number. Results were also compared to results from similar thrusters found in literature and good agreement was found particularly with Takahashi [80] and Little [49, 50]. This work helped develop the diagnostic capabilities of the EP2 electric propulsion lab and paved the way for future experiments on magnetic nozzles and validation of the DiMagNo code.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

The first design of this system consists of two axisymmetric ducts, each containing a propeller mounted to a centerbody that is attached to the duct by a strut. Furthermore each ducted propeller contains two horizontal and two vertical control surfaces and the ducted propellers are mounted to the fuselage by two external struts. Besides the function of propulsion, the ducted propeller system also replaces the horizontal and vertical tail for control and stability. The aerodynamic characteristics of this system are investigated by the construction of an aerodynamic performance model, consisting of a combination of low order analytical and numerical methods. This model aims on predicting the aerodynamic coefficients, which are significant for control and stability over a range of operational conditions, incidence angles and thrust settings. These include lift, side force, drag and control surface effectiveness. The numerical part of the model is first validated against existing experimental data from literature, after which the complete model is held against data from a low speed wind tunnel test on a small scale model of the system. Finally, a sensitivity analysis aims on finding the effect of the most important design parameters on the thrust to power ratio of both the propeller and the total system. The numerical model is succesfully validated in its capability of predicting trends in propeller and total system thrust over a range of operational conditions. The analytical model is capable of predicting the lift and side force performance of the system to a reasonable degree in the unstalled regime. Drag is significantly underestimated by the analytical model, possibly due to unknown flow separation and interference effects, which require higher order methods. Stall angle and maximum lift can not be modeled accurately by the low order performance model. Finally, the sensitivity analysis shows that advance ratio is the most critical operational condition whereas duct shape and duct aspect ratio are most affecting the total system thrust to power ratio.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance & Propulsion","","","",""

It is believed that this will become increasingly more important since the regulations regarding 2020 ascribe significant increase in energy efficiency of the built environment. On-site RES self-consumption is therefore a central lead in this research. The project data comprise air source heat pump and solar energy data of 6 different households for the months June to November 2016. The RL learning algorithm was applied to the different data sets to derive an optimized individual and generalized control strategy. Simulations were carried on, to acquire the resulting energy consumption, self-consumption, and self-sufficiency. The results show an increase of individual self-consumption between 17% and 348% and self-sufficiency between 18% and 72%. This results in an additional monetary benefit for the occupants based on the transition proposals of 2020 for the renewable energy generation net-metering abolishment in the Netherlands.

(mentor)","2017","Blended wing body aircraft represent a paradigm shift in jet transport aircraft design. Stepping away from the conventional tube-and-wing philosophy, they promise benefits over existing or future conventional aircraft. The most significant challenge with the concept is the increased coupling between aircraft design disciplines that has necessitated the development and implementation of multidisciplinary design optimisation routines. A novel conceptual aircraft design program named the Initiator has been developed that is able to design conventional and unconventional passenger transport aircraft, enabling comparisons to be made which are based on the same top level requirements and analysis fidelity. It however lacks the ability to design or analyse the blended wing body. The aim of this thesis is to make comparative studies between the blended-wing-body aircraft and its conventional tube-and-wing counterpart based upon the same design requirements. To this end the work investigates the methods that are required to implement the blended wing body aircraft in a semi-automated design framework such as the Initiator. By developing a novel geometric parametrisation of the blended wing body, the design possibilities have been increased while maintaining straightforward shaping manipulation and robustness. All relevant topics of conceptual aircraft layout are considered, making the resulting aircraft feasible in terms of the integration of its components. Furthermore, methods have been implemented or developed which are capable of analysing the mass, aerodynamic performance and longitudinal stability of the aircraft to a fidelity which is suitable for conceptual design. The mass estimation methods that have been implemented are verified and validated to be within 10% of reference blended wing bodies with a smaller error of 5% being common. There is however significant scatter in reference results, making conclusive statements about accuracy difficult. Drag estimations perform less accurately with drag being overpredicted by approximately 20%. The cause of this over prediction was largely due to empirical corrections for miscellaneous and unaccounted drag sources as is done for conventional aircraft. Wave drag is considerably higher than reference cases (7 versus 1 counts). Considering the applicability of the implemented method to blended wing bodies and the limited specific transonic design that is performed, it is chosen to accept this result as a conservative estimate until higher order validations of the wave drag can be performed. Induced drag was also higher for the test cases but results are inconclusive whether this is an error or a true result of the design choices. Zero-lift drag has however been accurately estimated by the novel implementation of empirical methods. Test case blended wing body and tube and wing aircraft were formed in the 150, 250 and 400 passenger classes. The comparisons of the resulting aircraft show that the blended wing body is feasible at the fidelity level achieved. They have reduced mass, improved aerodynamic efficiency and higher fuel economy. Trends show that the improvements over tube and wing aircraft increase with aircraft size. The qualitative results contained herein should still be treated as provisional since the implementation of the concept is not complete and remaining topics could still have significant effects on the results.","Blended Wing Body; BWB; Hybrid Wing Body; HWB; conceptual; design; MDO; KBE; unconventional; passenger; aircraft; oval fuselage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Currently the vessel motions are measured by Ampelmann using a highly accurate and expensive fibre optic gyroscope called a Motion Reference Unit (MRU). The MRU measures translational change in velocity by means of accelerations and rotational change in position by means of angular velocity. These changes are used to determine the position and orientation of the vessel in six Degrees of Freedom (DoF). Using a rate of change measurement system to measure position and orientation is known to introduce drift. Over time this drift influence will grow and the position and orientation of the vessel with respect to the target platform becomes inaccurate. A new vessel motion measurement system is introduced called the LiDAR Reference Unit (LRU), with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). The LRU overcomes the drift problems by measuring the position of the offshore target with respect to the vessel. The LRU combines measurement information from multiple sensors to create a robust, accurate and cheaper solution. The system combines a scanning Laser Range Finder (LRF) and a micro-electromechanical Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). To determine the vessel motions, the position of the target platform is measured and followed in every consecutive LRF scan. Obstructions caused by moving people or small details on the target platform create measurement scan point outliers. These outliers could cause mismatching of LRF scan point clouds. To avoid mismatching a landmark detection algorithm is used. Common shapes on platforms are circles and straight lines. A RANdom SAmple Consesnsus (RANSAC) algorithm is used to extract lines and arcs from the LRF scan point cloud. Only the scan points of the arcs and lines are used to measure the vessel position and orientation to the target platform. The position and orientation are determined using an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) matching algorithm. The sensor measurement data of the LRF and IMU are combined with a model based Kalman filter. The feasibility of the proposed LRU is tested with a simulation model for the system. To verify the results of the simulation model and determine the accuracy of the LRU a test setup is created. Simulated vessel motions are used to move the measurement system. The LRF scans the target platform and the measured results are compared to the position data of the measurement setup. The robustness of the motion extraction algorithm is tested by creating an obstruction of a person walking around the target platform while measuring. The vessel motions and target platform position with respect to the vessel can be accurately measured with the proposed LRU. The LRU system does not experience drift and future innovations for the Ampelmann system could be integrated with the LRU, due to the known position and orientation of the vessel to the target platform.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","","",""

Adding further safety measures to the infrastructure has adverse effects as drivers may compensate for improved safety by driving faster. This study investigates whether in-car warnings on a head-up display (HUD) improve speed compliance and speed behaviour of young male passenger car drivers at work zones. A HUD warning system was tested in a repeated measures fixed-base driving simulator experiment with 34 participants. Drivers slowed down sooner and smoother when the warning system was enabled, but speed behaviour at the work zone was not different when the system was active. Drivers who sped outside of the work zones had lower pre-experimental satisfaction of the system although this increased to normal levels during the experiment. Perceived effects of the system were limited to a small reduction in stated mental effort. This is in line with literature findings. Although the system improves speed behaviour in the slow-down area and may have a positive effect on traffic safety, it does not improve speed compliance at work zones. The system can reach its target audience by integrating it with systems which provide directly perceivable benefits to drivers. Further research is required on the effects on other driver groups and the potential of personalised situation-aware warnings.","intelligent transport systems; traffic safety; road work; speed behaviour; driver behaviour; head-up display; driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","TIL5060",""

These infections are a burden for the patient and are related to extra cost for the hospital and healthcare system. This graduation project is on behalf of Zimmer Biomet, TU Delft and is in collaboration with Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft. Zimmer Biomet is working on a new system that has to decrease the risk of periprosthetic infections. The new system has the main goal of preventing the formation of a biofilm by covering the surface of the implant. This hydrogel layer has to prevent that bacteria attach to the implant. In the analysis phase a visit to the Zimmer Biomet office in Berlin, observations in the operating theatre and interviews with experts are conducted to get insights and background information about antibiotics and total joint arthroplasty procedures. As result a design vision and list of requirements is created, which are used to generate ideas. Four ideas are developed into four concept directions. The strengths and weaknesses evaluation selected the spraying and dipping method as concept direction to be developed further. The project’s scope is narrowed down towards the cemented knee procedure. In the embodiment phase, the saw bone validation test showed that the dipping action is already covering a large part of the prosthesis. It is the main reason to focus on the dipping direction. Outcome of this project is a bearing dip set, which consists of the bearing dip tool and bearing dip tray. It is concluded that the bearing dip set is integrated better in the TKA work flow when compared to the DAC gel kit. This has as result that additional application time is not required. The bearing dip set is able to cover 93% of the exposed implants surface. The bearing dip tool could be improved further in the current work flow when the tool is also able to insert the bearing in the locking system of the tibia plateau. Further research is necessary to cover the upper front side of the femoral component.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mulder, I.J. (mentor)","2017","In recent years, a new culture has arisen in which citizens use technology to make and learn for themselves. This culture, called maker culure, has gathered the attention of the municipality of Delft as a means to have citizens contribute to long term municipality goals outlined in a Smart City vision. This master thesis explores how maker culture could empower citizens to contribute to these municipality goals and argues that makerspace communities can function as communities of practice in which citizens can learn from each other. It is argued that the differences between the practices of makers are a central obstacle preventing a makerspace community from functioning as a community of practice and that a lack of documentation on maker practices makes it difficult for makers to understand each other. To tackle this problem, this thesis proposes a design for an online portfolio platform which uses task analysis methods to accurately and effectively document maker practices. Because task analysis methods have not been used to create online portfolio documentation before, the use and value of these methods within the given context is researched using a research through design method. By iteratively creating designs which incorporate task analysis methods and user testing these designs, the use of task analysis methods to document maker practices is evaluated. These research findings are then used to create a final design proposal and argue for its value. This design, called Makefolio, uses task analysis methods to help makers formulate and structure descriptions of their project activities, allowing others to easily find makers to collaborate with and learn from. This way, Makefolio supports a makerspace community in learning from each other, allowing this community to empower citizens to use technology and contribute to the Delft Smart City vision.","Smart City; Maker Culture; Social Learning; Online Portfolios; Task Analysis","; en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The vertical tail size of a multi-engine aircraft is typically driven by the directional control requirement during one-engine-inoperative flight. This results in the vertical tail being over-sized for most regularly occurring flight conditions. By adding thrust vectoring technology to an aircraft, the vertical tail can be designed to cope with regularly occurring flight conditions rather than the one-engine-inoperative flight condition. A modern aircraft was redesigned such that it would have thrust vectoring capabilities and an unconventionally small vertical tail. The redesigned vertical tails had areas which were 85\%, 70\%, 60\%, and 50\% of the original vertical tail area, which corresponded to reductions in the vertical tail area of 15\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 50\%, respectively. By reducing the vertical tail area, an aircraft's parasite drag may be reduced, and a reduction in parasite drag would allow for a reduction in the aircraft's fuel consumption. Analyses showed that the redesigned vertical tail and change in aircraft inertia due to the addition of thrust vectoring technology had a negligible impact of the aircraft's roll mode dynamics. It was also shown that the reduction in vertical tail area resulted in a degradation of the aircraft's spiral mode flight qualities. With regards to the Dutch roll motion, a reduction in vertical tail area resulted in a reduction of Dutch roll damping coefficient and Dutch roll frequency. Based on the analysis of the Dutch roll mode, it has been recommended that a compromise between the 85\% and 70\% vertical tail area would likely produce an acceptable compromise between the reduced vertical tail area and Dutch roll flight characteristics; however, the aircraft design would required a yaw damper. It is predicted that trimmed flight with one-engine-inoperative can be achieved by simultaneously using thrust vectoring technology and an unconventionally small vertical tail. Through the use of directional thrust vectoring, an aircraft's rudder deflection angle, aileron deflection angle, and bank angle may reduced during the one-engine-inoperative flight condition. Analysis of the one-engine-inoperative and crosswind flight condition shows that using thrust vectoring for directional control may allow for a reduction in trim drag; however, additional analysis of this flight condition should be completed. A vertical tail mass estimation was completed, and it has been shown that the reduction in vertical tail mass resulting from a reduction in vertical tail area is of the same magnitude when compared to the engine mass increase due to the addition of thrust vectoring technologies. Lastly, it has been shown that an aircraft's mission fuel consumption can be reduced if the aircraft's vertical tail area is reduced and thrust vectoring flight control is implemented into the aircraft design. Reductions in mission fuel consumption greater than 1\% are unlikely; however, there are feasible reductions in mission fuel mass for the proposed thrust vectoring aircraft design.","Thrust vectoring; Lateral directional; Stability and control; Vertical tail; One engine inoperative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Mitici, M.A. (mentor); Pini, M. (mentor)","2017","Airline revenue management aims to sell the seats on their planes to passengers at a price that is as close as possible to their maximum willingness to pay for a seat. In practice, airlines try to achieve this by creating a fare structure for the seats on their planes after which the seats are grouped under these different fares. Revenue management practice for airlines therefore consists of a pricing part and a seat allocation part. The fares can be updated, however, the fare structure is considered static compared to the seat allocation (also called allocation) control that takes place more dynamically in revenue management systems. Seat allocation control can therefore be considered as the key process within revenue management of an airline. The booking forecasting model plays a central role in seat inventory control and therefore in the revenue management process. In theory, a 100% accurate forecast will result in a maximum revenue figure and inaccurate forecasts will result in a deviation from this maximum achievable revenue. Studies on the impact of forecasting accuracy on passenger revenues have demonstrated this by showing that a 10% improvement in forecasting accuracy can lead to a 0.5% to 3% increase in annual passenger revenue. For a major US airline with high demand flights this comes down to $10 to $60 million. The quality of a revenue management forecast is of outmost importance for an airline. However, forecasting for revenue management has proven to be a challenging task because of the dynamics and complexity of the bookings process which is influenced by many factors such as pricing discounts, special events or defections of passengers from delayed or cancelled flights. As a result, the prediction for the future demand expressed as a single value is mostly wrong. In order to have an accurate forecasting model it is therefore important not only to forecast future demand close to the actual realized values, but also to provide the revenue management controller with information on the degree of uncertainty that is involved in the prediction. From there the research objective is formulated as follows,","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","","",""

First, schematized model setups have been used to assess the performance of XBeach qualitatively. It was found that adjustments of the initial bed were required to obtain the expected hydrodynamic conditions. The default sediment advection calibration factors had to be increased to obtain the expected morphological response of the pockets (stationair: 0.15, surfbeat: 0.30). The results have shown that the surfbeat mode outperforms the stationary mode based on a qualitative assessment. It was furthermore found that wave-current interaction produced unreliable results and should be avoided when modelling pocket beaches using XBeach. Non-hydrostatic simulations produced significantly more sedimentation behind the headlands due to the inclusion of diffraction. This mode was found to produce unexpected erosion at the upper shoreface however, indicating the inapplicability of the sediment transport formulas in non-hydrostatic simulations. Expansion of the classic pocket beach into two adjacent pocket beaches showed that these systems have to be treated as a complete system if interactions between these pockets are expected (separated by a salient). It was found that an individual assessment is adequate if a tombolo separates the pockets. Second, the morphological developments between the year 2000 and 2015 at Tanjong Beach (Singapore) were modelled using XBeach. For the modelled bed level changes, which were compared to bathymetric measurements, a ‘Good’ Mean-Squared Error Skill Score of 0.31 was found. In the prepared model, the obtained sediment advection calibration factors from the first part were used and model calibration was not performed. Based on the schematizations and the case study performed in this study, XBeach was found to be applicable for long term process-based modelling of pocket beaches.","Pocket Beaches; Embayed Beaches; Nearshore Currents; Morphology; XBeach","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

To increase tray flow control and any potential stagnation, EPS aims to register the in- and outbound tray flows for their depots. From May 2017, the Barendrecht depot will be required to register the incoming trays at ID level. This paper describes a thesis study which addressed these issues. The required registration process was analysed using the Delft Systems Approach. A number of designs were developed and tested on-site to ensure their validity and available hardware performance. The required number of portals was determined using a discrete event simulation written in Delphi Pascal using the TOMAS toolbox. The simulated performance in combination with a weighted multi-criteria analysis was used in order to rank the feasible solutions.

Pure Ti2AlC and the alumina composite (Al2O3-20 vol. % Ti2AlC) were synthesised by Spark Plasma Sintering. The kinetics of the oxidation of MAX-phase into rutile and alumina, were studied via Thermo- Gravimetric Differential Thermal Analysis. The strength recovery after crack damage, by high temperature oxidation of the healing particles, was measured using 4-point bending. Through thermal analysis it was observed that healing can be achieved below 1000 °C with the formation of rutile at 800 °C and alumina at 900 °C. The strength recovered after healing was quantified systematically as function of temperature and time at 800, 900 and 1000 °C for 0.25, 1 and 4 and 16 hours. The strength of the composite was reduced by about 50 % from 402 MPa ±35 to 229 MPa ±14 when a crack of 100 μm long was introduced by indentation. After healing at 1000 °C for 15 minutes, the strength of the damaged material increased to about 95 % of the original non-cracked composite. After 1 hour at this same temperature the strength increased to about 98 % of the original material. When healing is performed at 900 and 800 °C, the time needed for full strength recovery increased to 4 and 16 hours respectively. Moreover, embedding Ti2AlC particles in alumina enhances alumina’s resistance to crack propagation. A model developed for filling of a crack gap revealed that: To fill a crack of 1 μm wide, the minimum required MAX-phase content is 5 % and the minimum MAX-phase particle diameter is 3.6 μm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

The quality of the flood defense system should be of a sufficiently high level to guarantee protection against a flood. If a flood defense is unsafe, measurements are required to improve the safety of the flood defense. The Dutch governmental agency ``Rijkswaterstaat'' stimulates companies and research institutes to come up with innovative measures to strengthen dikes. Therefore, the Dutch companies Heijmans, de Vries & van de Wiel and Movares have developed an innovative measure named the ``Waterontspanner'' (in English: water relaxation well). The Waterontspanner is comparable to a passive vertical drain which is designed to reduce the failure mechanism macro instability of the inner slope. The Waterontspanner has been implemented in project Schoonhoven-Langerak (SLA). The project was successful and it is desired to use the Waterontspanner more often. To do so, more information has to be obtained on the extent to which the Waterontspanner influences the failure probability of a dike due to macro instability of the inner slope. In this thesis, research is carried out to provide insight in the latter. First, an analytical model was set up to understand the behavior of pore pressures in the subsoil and to find out if it makes sense to use a Waterontspanner. Herafter, a safety assessment was set up to investigate how the failure probability of a dike due to macro instability of the inner slope is influenced by Waterontspanners.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-05-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Rostampour Samarin, V. (mentor)","2017","The increasing penetration of wind power generation introduces uncertainty in the behaviour of electric power grids. This work is concerned with the problem of day-ahead reserve scheduling (RS) for power systems with high levels of wind power penetration, and proposes a novel set-up that incorporates an alternating current (AC) Optimal Power Flow (OPF) formulation. The OPF-RS problem is non-convex and in general hard to solve. Using a convex relaxation technique, we focus on systems with uncertain generation and formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem to determine the minimum cost of production and reserves. Following a randomization technique, we approximate the chance constraints and provide a-priori feasibility guarantees in a probabilistic sense. However, the resulting problem is computationally intractable, due to the fact that the computation time complexity grows polynomially with respect to the size of the power network and scheduling horizon. In this thesis, we first use the so-called scenario approach to approximate a convex set which contains almost surely the probability mass distribution of underlying random events. We rely on the special property of reserve scheduling problems which leads to linear constraint functions with respect to the uncertain parameters. We can therefore formulate a robust problem for only the vertices of the approximated set. Using the proposed approach, the number of scenarios is reduced significantly which is beneficial for the tractability. Such a formulation requires the power network state to only be feasible for all vertices of the convex approximated set. To even further relax such a requirement, we develop a novel RS formulation by considering the network state as a non-linear parametrization function of the uncertainty. By using a conic combination of matrices, only three positive semidefinite constraints per time step are considered. Unlike existing works in RS, our proposed parametrization has a practical meaning and is directly related to the distribution of reserve power. Such a reformulation yields a reduction in computational complexity of OPF-RS problems. Finally, we extend our results to a more realistic size of power grids, using sparsity pattern and spatiality (multi-area) decomposition of the power networks, leading to a decomposed semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve the SDP in a distributed setting, we formulate a distributed consensus optimization problem, and then the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to coordinate local OPF-RS problems between neighbouring areas. The theoretical developments in aforementioned cases were validated on a realistic benchmark system and a discussion on the tractability of the resulting optimization problems by means of computational time analysis is presented.","power system; optimization; uncertainty; renewable energy; wind power generation; reserve scheduling; optimal power flow; reserve requirements; scenario approach; alternating direction method of multipliers; distributed solving; vertex enumeration; conic parametrization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Through emerging technologies, it is possible to efficiently extend everyday objects with wireless communication and sensing-/actuating functionality. The objects can communicate with each other as well as with humans. The movement that is concerned with applying and investigating these technologies is called The Internet of Things. What the Internet of Things (IoT) can do for the barbecue was analyzed in this project by research through design. At the beginning one of the opportunities from the initial brief was confirmed by existing research: user performance in barbecuing. Looking at IoT from a perspective where products can be agents, human-product relations are easier to understand and the dialogue between the two became a point of focus. From a technical point of view the challenges of technology in an extreme environment were tackled with IoT features. The relevant variables such as temperature and food type were investigated. Controlling these variables became something that should be the combined effort of user and technology (dialogue). It should reward the user for his efforts since the main problem is that he likes to be at the barbecue but doesn’t think well of his performance. This division of labor was investigated further with design research and philosophy. The new question became how a designer can give meaning to this user-product relation. A tangible user interface (TUI) was found to be able to contribute to the relation since there is a lot of freedom to interact with it. By integrating the opportunities from some of the iterations, Pitmaster was created. It is a barbecue support toolkit that consists of temperature sensors, sensor tongs, timers and a base station. Key features include: timers that become points of focus where a user can see and remember the cooking progress for any type of food. Its accuracy comes from combining the measurement of temperature and food height with guesses from the user that become more educated after his adjustments of parameters and collection of data by the system. During and after the concept evolution the design decisions were generalized and this resulted in more insights that could be interesting for future IoT projects. Lastly, the product’s potential impact was predicted and reflected upon.","connected; design; barbeque; internet of things; smart","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","Design for Interaction","",""

By using behavioral modeling and a modified UTAUT model the main characteristic of AV were evaluated to see which has the biggest positive or negative influence on the behavioral intention. The research results show that elderly in the Netherlands are largely positive towards AV and that there is a preference for the owned AV compared to the shared AV system. It is also revealed that there are significant differences in usage intention between different groups of elderly. This thesis contributes to the research done on the potential impacts of AV and shows that the suggested methods create a valid estimation of the usage intention of AV by elderly.","Automated vehicles; Elderly; Behavioral modeling; Acceptance; Structural equation modeling; UTAUT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Kaminski, M.L. (mentor)","2017","When the Costa Concordia ran aground in Italy, it took 69 minutes to make the critical decision to abandon ship. The crew was unaware of the sheer size of the damage and the impact on the ship’s stability for too long. Instantaneous insight into the structural damage of the ship after running aground may be of great aid in such disasters. A possible way to acquire such instantaneous insight is by measuring accelerations during the grounding accident and derive the extent of the damage from analysis of these signals. Such acceleration measurements could, nowadays, even be done using a simple smart phone. The Costa Concordia hit a rock and sustained a so-called raking damage. Friction, plastic deformation and rupture are the mechanisms that form the damage, each dissipating energy in a different way. It should be possible to distinguish the energy dissipation due to these separate mechanisms from merely analysing acceleration measurement data of the vessel and thus estimate the extent of the sustained structural damage. In a ship grounding, the crew want to know whether or not the hull is breached. The structural damage of interest is therefore rupture of the hull plating. This thesis zooms in on detection of plate rupture only. It is based on experimental research exploring detection of plate rupture in a raking damage scenario by analysing the acceleration measurement data from a series of drop tower experiments. The series of drop tower experiments are designed and prepared by doing Finite Element Analysis (FEA). As part of these preparations, a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Finite Element Model (FEM) results are particularly sensitive to two input parameters: the failure criterion and the friction coefficient. So failure and friction are the two determining phenomena in a raking damage scenario in terms of energy dissipation. Besides the acceleration measurements, which form the core of this research, failure and friction are studied in detail. In total four raking damage experiments were performed on grade-A steel specimens of 6 mm thickness. The drop tower experiments are performed in such a way that they simulate a raking damage scenario realistically. During the experiment, the accelerations and loads on the sphere shaped indenter are measured. Two high speed cameras are set up to perform Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements with 2500 fps, in order to capture the exact moment of plate rupture. Using the high speed DIC measurements, strains at plate rupture were found and a Fracture Forming Limit Curve (FFLC) was calibrated. A special method of calibration was used, that uses only one single strain-state to calibrate the FFLC. As a comparison, a second FFLC was calibrated using the results of a standard uni-axial tensile test. The FFLC calibrated with the tensile test provides a very accurate prediction of the strains at failure for the raking damage experiments. The acceleration measurement data of all four raking damage experiments show an abrupt decrease directly after initiation of plate rupture. This abrupt decrease indicates that the transition from an intact plate to a ruptured plate can readily be detected from the experimental acceleration data. Half of the raking damage experiments were performed with reduced friction. Separate tests to determine the friction coefficient for the two cases have been done. With this friction coefficient, the total energy dissipation through friction has been determined via two different calculation methods. Both these methods yielded similar results. Based on the similarity between these results, static Coulomb friction seems to be a proper model to determine the energy dissipation through friction. This research provided a first, exploratory step into raking damage estimation by using acceleration measurements. The onset of rupture can be identified when a proper estimate of both the failure criterion and the friction coefficient is made. It is envisaged that the extent of raking damage can indeed be derived through real time acceleration measurements on board of a vessel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics & Structures","",""

The classic solution for the DSO to handle peak load are grid reinforcements which are costly and do not support the uptake of sustainable energy technology. In effect, the DSOs assess the suitability of alternative, possibly cheaper and more sustainable solutions for the future energy system. One measure is to mitigate peak load by incentivizing time-flexible electricity consumption. Through stimuli triggering a behavioral reaction, the DSO wishes to make residents adaptive end-users. Within previous pilot projects, DSOs predominantly assessed the effectiveness of stimuli related to electricity pricing schemes and real-time consumption information on end-user flexibility behavior.....","residential grid; end-user flexibility; energy behavior; community-oriented incentives; comparison","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","","",""
