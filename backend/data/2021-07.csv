The DUUC aircraft features an integrated ducted fan propulsive empennage (DFPE) that replaces the entire horizontal and vertical tails for stability and control. For flight evaluation the DUUC was mounted on top of a pick-up truck and allowed only one degree of freedom around the z-axis. Testing was done by driving the pick-up truck on a 2.4km long runway at 15m/s and 20 m/s with thrust settings of 50% and 100%. The performed tests include one-engine-out trimming manoeuvres, step inputs, frequency steps and tests with an optional nose fin that reduces directional stability with 훥퐶푛훽 = 0.035. This thesis focusses on the static on-engine-out experiments. Testing has revealed that the directional stability and rudder efficiency of the DUUC are inversely proportional to the advance ratio. Nevertheless, the DUUC retains ample directional stability regardless of flight conditions. Validation of the experimental results was done by developing a semi-analytical model based on the linearized asymmetric <br/>equations of motion and supplementing it with CFD data as well as previously obtained experimental data on the DFPE. The model is able to account for the observed phenomena and can reliably simulate different scenarios. Comparing the nominal directional stability of the DUUC with that the Boeing 747-200, Boeing 727-200, Cessna Citation II and Fokker F-27 reveals that it is by far the most stable aircraft with a minimal 퐶푛훽 = 0.34. OEI testing has revealed that the rudder alone is able to trim the aircraft at low advance ratios. At high advance ratios the rudder saturates in order to trim the aircraft. The aircraft remains controllable nonetheless given the option of using roll inputs to continue manoeuvring. Finally, the mobile wind tunnel setup employed for this project is a cost-effective alternative to a full scale wind tunnel and can gather adequate data but is susceptible to external disturbances currently limiting its usability.","DUUC; Directional; ducted fan; Ducted propellers; Flight characteristics; flight testing; DFS; DFPE; Trimming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dubbeldam, J.L.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Helium-ion induced deposition (He-IBID) is a small-scale manufacturing technique that uses a helium microscope to focus a helium-ion beam onto an adsorbed precursor gas, causing nanometer-scaled depositions onto a substrate. However, due to local depletion of the precursor gas, the amount of deposition can not be expected to be proportional to the beam current. The mechanisms of this growth need to be well investigated to understand the limitations and capabilities of this technique. Most studies look at simple pillar growth with a stationary beam, and most models exclude the surface diffusion of precursor molecules. We attempt to model the growth of horizontally grown pillars using a horizontally moving ion beam. According to experiments with this type of growth \cite{HammerheadAFMProbes}, precursor surface diffusion is a key mechanism, and thus past studies may not be sufficient. We use develop a continuum model based on solving differential equations. One benefit over the more common Monte Carlo methods is that the effect of the various mechanisms are more explicitly written in differential equation form. Another benefit is that the simulation is differentiable, lending itself to better application of new differentiable programming techniques. One difficulty, however, is in the accurate modelling of the energy-dependent interactions with a source that has varying electron energies. We derive a system of ordinary differential equations to model a simplified two-dimensional approach and an approximation for an effective secondary electron flux to use in decomposition rate calculations. We investigate the available literature to find realistic values for the physical and operational parameters required to calculate solutions. Through numerical integration we find solutions and show how the model estimates pillar width changes when these parameters are altered. We use numerical integration to solve the ODE system, and present the results. We find a nucleation boundary---dependent on the beam movement speed and current---below which pillars cannot be grown, consistent with experiment \cite{HammerheadAFMProbes}. We find that the assumptions made in the surface diffusion calculation are too extreme, and that likely solving a PDE system of the full surface in three-dimensional space will be required for accurate results.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Cancer is a disease that causes almost 10 million deaths each year. Currently, there is no perfect treatment for it. However, there is a promising treatment called proton radiotherapy. This works almost the same as one of the older cancer treatments called photon radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy with protons has an advantage in comparison with radiotherapy with photons. This advantage lies in the way the protons lose their energy when going through tissue. The protons deliver most of their dose in a very small region. Cause of this advantage, proton radiotherapy can deliver a lot of dose into the tumour while minimizing the dose delivered into healthy tissue. But this advantage can change into a disadvantage when the location of the tumour moves a few millimeters. <br/>Therefore ideally a scan is taken each time the patient comes in, so the location of the tumour is known very accurately. After the scan it is best to immediately create a treatment plan and do the treatment session. But creating a treatment plan takes to much time to be able to do that. Mainly, this is because the calculation of the dose distribution is not fast enough. This report studies a faster method for the calculation of the dose distribution. The method is derived by the Medical Physics \&amp; Technology group from TU Delft. This method is currently not accurate enough to use for treatment planning. The problem of the method is that the dose due to nuclear interactions is not included correctly. The goal of this report is to make the method more accurate by adding the nuclear dose caused by secondary particles formed due to inelastic nuclear interactions to the dose calculated by the existing method.<br/>The nuclear dose is calculated using a convolution of a kernel with the proton flux. The nuclear dose of the following secondary particles is calculated: alpha particles, deuteron particles and secondary protons. Adding the nuclear dose caused by these three secondary particles increased the accuracy of the model by 0.36 percent. However adding the nuclear dose calculation increased the time needed to calculate the dose distribution with 18625 percent. By calculating the convolution using the fast Fourier transform this could be decreased by a factor of 11. However adding the nuclear dose calculation to the fast method increases the time needed to calculate the dose distribution too much. Therefore the calculation of the dose distribution is not fast enough to scan a patient and immediately start with the best possible treatment plan using the fast method with the nuclear dose calculation added.<br","Proton dose calculation; Proton Therapy; Cancer treatment","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success of the service relies on active patient participation. With The Box, the treating medical team now has insights in the patient’s health condition from a distance. It doesn’t require the patient to be physically present in the hospital, and there’s now even more reliable data available to adjust the treatment to. It makes the carepath insightful and approachable by both parties, resulting in accessible digital consultations. Since The Box has proven to be a success in patient care, several departments started adopting this service as well. However not much attention has been given to how the healthcare staff at LUMC is experiencing the implementation of The Box. As the idea of patient home monitoring looks very promising, the reality however is quite discrepant. Not having the physical presence of patients in the hospital, would appear to reduce the burden on healthcare staff, as instead these “empty” hospital bed will simply be taken up by other, even more severe cases, causing a larger amount of patients to both monitor digitally and take care for physically. It leaves us with the question of “Who will do it?”. Who will take on the so to speak additional workload? The healthcare staff at LUMC is experiencing more workload with the implementation of The Box as its intended use is mostly focussed on remote and safe patient monitoring, while missing out on an opportunity for assisting the care-team. It occasionally happens that additional staff is hired to cope with the excessive workload, or that LUMC is also investing in an intelligent system that prioritizes patient data. But momentarily, healthcare staff’s solution is simply to not check up on every patient that sends in data. The Box may appear as an implemented innovation in the care practice of LUMC, but in reality it is still a prototype. Therefore it requires scaling to towards an improved standard healthcare practice. The goal is to turn The Box into a mature proposition that can be implemented hospital-wide, but also that has the ability to change the current healthcare system. The burden on the care-team must be suppressed or else the future will include an immense scarcity of healthcare professionals of which the majority will be burnt out. A roadmap is created to show opportunities for continuous prototyping and what value it brings, scaling strategies, patient monitoring and what level of staff involvement it demands, required developments and finally stakeholder collaboration. What it actually proposes are the changes to be made to create an integrated healthcare solution that is focussed on “unburdening” the staff. LUMC is not capable of changing this alone: they are specialized in research, education and healthcare, yet they lack expertise on data management, financial resources, digital developments, etc. It therefore needs support of multiple organisations. The deliverable aims to show a designer’s perspective on scaling The Box from a prototype level towards a mature healthcare proposition.","eHealth; Remote Patient Monitoring; Workload; The Box; Roadmap; Quadruple Aim; LUMC; Philips; Workflow Efficiency; Care-team well-being; Future Vision; Healthcare; CardioLab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

Widely used indices for track quality are the standard deviations of the rail longitudinal level data and the standard deviations of alignment data. Researchers have opted for various learning methods as to relate track quality to different parameters. Some research has gone to the point of using track quality interchangeably with the notion of defect density. What is common in all researches is that a track quality index is used as label for predictions. The differences are inherent to the variables/features that were chosen to conduct such predictions. With the plethora of data at the hands of asset managers nowadays, it has become easier to opt for these learning methods. Machine Learning classification is a method wherein a number of features are used to classify a datapoint into a label. With thorough learning, by inputting the features, the label would then be predicted. The features of interest in this project are structural elements describing the track sections. This can go from the sleeper type and subsoil type all the way to the distance from the nearest switch or bridge. This will allow for the relationships between the structural elements and the track’s quality to be bolstered all the while creating a predictor based on data that need not be measured. The research question is thus formulated as follows: How to relate track quality in a section to its surrounding structural elements and form a predictor out of it? 1.What structural elements are to be studied? 2.How to automate the generation of the features? 3.Which classifier algorithm yields the most accurate predictions? 4.Which structural features are the most important in predicting track quality? The research question is divided into 4 sub-research questions each pertaining to a part of the research. 1.Decide on which structural elements are the most relevant for the study. Some elements may be redundant with respect to other elements. For instance, subsoil type and ballast settlement could form a redundancy. This will be decided on from the literature. This part will contribute to a section in the thesis in which a strong relation will be drawn with respect to the courses taken and studied at the TU Delft. 2.Data Gathering is a huge part of this research. Input data will be from Fugro’s relative track geometry data and KRDZ data. In addition, ProRail’s informatieportaal, which is a website containing all the railway assets and their locations on the map will also be of huge aid to gather the structural elements data. The answer to this sub-research question lies in automating the structural feature generation, making them ready for learning. 3.Running the Machine Learning classification code on sections of a real-life track and comparing the accuracies of each classification algorithm as to come up with recommendations for future work. 4.Some machine learning algorithms, namely the random forest classifier have in their output an importance of features measure. This will give us insight on which structural elements affect track quality the most, which would allow for better resource allocation in the long run. In the goal of answering all the research questions and to realize the research objective, an outline of the research is included in this report along with a workflow diagram. The project has shown that predicting track quality using structural elements and relative track geometry can be done using classification methods, on the condition that the predicted track and the trained track have similar feature importance values, and that structural features that are displayed in the track to predict are also available in the trained model.","Railway Maintenance; Machine Learning; Structural Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-08-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Most existing methods to approximate Shapley values assume independence, which is in practice often violated. An existing copula-based method that tries to take into account the dependency is extended to apply to problems with continuous and discrete features. This copula-based method approximates the Shapley values more accurately than other methods. The Conditional Expectation Shapley values give unnatural explanations, therefore other definitions of the Shapley values are more suitable. The Baseline Shapley values seem to be the most promising since there is an accurate and fast approximation method and the B Shapley values are the easiest to interpret.","Shapley values; Machine Learning; explanatory method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

For distributed hydrologic models, this means that the streamflow observation need to be mapped to a location along the model streamflow network that represents the location of the observation station in a hydrologic system. However, the gridded representation of the modelled area causes a spatial mismatch between the hydrologic system and hydrologic model. In this study we aimed to develop a Machine learning-based method to improve matching between streamflow observations and streamflow simulations. The setup of this method was implemented in two steps: (1) a dataset was created consisting of streamflow characteristics of simulations and observations and (2) a Machine learning algorithm was trained with the created dataset. Three data sources were used for the creation of the dataset: (1) 595 streamflow observations were retrieved from the Global Runoff Database Centre (GRDC), (2) streamflow simulations were extracted from the European Flood Alert System (EFAS) and (3) we were provided with a manually created and checked dataset by European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts linking each GRDC observation to the correct EFAS grid cell. To link 60% of the observations in the dataset with the correct grid cells, the observations required to be moved away from the cell corresponding to the geolocation of the observations. The method developed in this study anticipated this by creating a search window around the initial location of each observation. The streamflow simulations were extracted from the grid cells in the search window and compared with the streamflow observation. The algorithm aimed to select the streamflow simulation that best reflected the characteristics of the streamflow observation. The characteristics were described with streamflow signatures. Four Machine learning algorithms, a Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbours algorithm, were trained with a Kfold Cross Validation procedure to match streamflow simulations with streamflow observations based on streamflow signatures. Their performance was compared with four benchmark algorithms: a Center Cell benchmark which places the observations on their initial location, and the Root Mean Squared Error, Kling-Gupta Efficiency and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency benchmarks that compare the streamflow observation with the streamflow simulations. We identified the Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms as the best performing algorithms. However, neither outperformed all benchmarks. Despite these results, we show the potential to automate matching between streamflow observations and streamflow simulations with a ML-based approach in this study.","hydrologic modeling; Machine Learning; Streamflow signatures; gauge observations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Leeuw den Bouter, M.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive, non-ionizing imaging modality that is commonly used in the clinic today. However, it is an expensive technique. The high purchase, operational and maintenance costs, as well as the need for trained staff with technical expertise, put this technique out of reach for a large part of the world population. To combat this, low-cost MRI systems are being developed. The use of lower magnetic fields allows for reductions in cost and size, increasing the accessibility and portability of the device in developing countries. Nevertheless, the signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to the magnetic field, and so low-field MR images are of a significantly lower quality. As such, a reconstruction algorithm is necessary in order to denoise the image, while preserving the details. Besides the cost, MRI is a relatively slow modality, leading to decreased patient comfort and increased chance of motion artifacts. The data acquisitions can be sped up through Parallel Imaging, which requires the use of a receiver coil array rather than a single RF coil. This leads to incomplete data as well as spatial variations in the coil sensitivity profiles that must be accounted for. Furthermore, while the Field-of-View of the image is generally larger than the spatial support of the object, information on this support is not used in MR image reconstructions. In this work, a reconstruction algorithm is developed to reconstruct MR images using incomplete multicoil data and spatial support information in a low-field setting. This algorithm is based on the single coil algorithm of De Leeuw Den Bouter et al. (2021), which will be extended to the multicoil case using the Contrast Source Inversion method. Three adaptations of the algorithm have been considered. Their performance is characterized in terms of denoising ability, edge-preservation and execution time, using both simulated and real low-field data. A mask S is introduced to include information on the spatial support. The use of this mask is shown to have a positive effect on the quality of the reconstruction, improving the preservation of edges and details. Furthermore, a mask R is introduced to deal with incomplete data in case of accelerated acquisitions. In conjuction with a Parallel Imaging technique, the reconstruction algorithm can yield de-aliased and denoised reconstructions, combatting the inherent drop in SNR caused by the acceleration. Chances for improving the algorithms remain, for instance by the exploring the possibilities for a multiplicative implementation of the Total Generalized Variation regularization term, as well as the automatic detection of the spatial support and the inclusion of compressed sensing.","Low-field MRI; Mutliplicative regularization; Spatial support information; Image reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-30","","","","","",""

Four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting is a newly emerged, next generation biofabrication technology capable of resolving the aforementioned challenges.<br/>In this thesis, an advanced 4D bioprinting method based on multi-material extrusion of two hydrogel-based (bio)inks is reported. This approach allows the fabrication of bilayered scaffolds made from a bottom part of a HA-Tyr precursor and a composite hydrogel top part from alginate and HA-Tyr (Alg/HA-Tyr). The scaffolds demonstrated self-bending upon immersion in aqueous solutions that was driven by the different swelling capacity of the two inks. Compatibility of the inks with extrusion printing was verified by rheological characterization. Control of the obtained curvature was achieved by tuning the infill density, printing angle and layer thickness. Moreover, the effect of crosslinking time as well as the influence of the swelling solvent type in the degree of bending was also investigated. Finally, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were mixed with the Alg/HA-Tyr ink and self-bending living scaffolds were bioprinted. The shape-shifted scaffolds were capable of supporting a high cell viability for up to 14 days and remained viable for up to 4 weeks.","4D bioprinting; shape-shifting; cartilage scaffolds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, over the past years they have seen a huge surge in popularity. The pandemic has been a big accelerator to this surge in popularity. This thesis was done for Overgrown Plantshop. This surge in popularity has given Overgrown the opportunity to grow and thrive, but it also came with a set of challenges. The quickly changing market brought on a lot of new small plant shops, making competition fierce. In addition to this, rare plants became a lot more difficult to source in an ethical way. Because of these challenges, Overgrown wants to develop a new product, service or product-service system to expand into a new niche. As a young company Overgrown has little to no knowledge or experience about the market outside of the rare houseplant niche. This lead to the following design assignment: “Get a deep understanding of the market and it’s consumers. Use this to drive a new strategic future vision which is visualized in a roadmap and create a first product or product-service system towards realizing this future vision “ The double diamond approach was followed. Through broad and orienting interviews, a crucial moment was identified in the journey to becoming a plant parent: the green spark. This is a crucial part for whether a person commits to being a long(er) time plant parent, or falls back into believing they are not capable. A context mapping study was used to get a deep understanding of users during the green spark. The results were a persona and a set of design requirements with accompanying ‘how might we’ questions. Lastly, the results were used to determined Ovegrown’s new future vision: “Overgrown aims to support sustainable consumption of plants by supporting plant parents to have longer lasting bonds with their houseplants“ The first step towards this future vision is Emma. Emma helps to lower the barrier for new plant parents. Right now, the most common trigger that creates a low barrier is a cheap plant. In the case the plant dies, not a lot is lost. Overgrown wants to achieve a similar low starting barrier, but in a more sustainable way. Instead of offering a cheap plant that is easily replaceable, Overgrown offers a high quality plant that is all ready to go for a smooth start. After the purchase of Emma, Overgrown offers additional services that help the plant parent form a closer bond with their plant. These services are developed and added onto through three horizons that are laid out in a roadmap. Throughout these horizons Overgrown’s focus shifts from selling plants to selling plant care. By doing this Overgrown wants to take the focus away from always acquiring new trendy plants to having stronger bonds with the plants you already have. Overgrown gets a closer bond with their customers, becoming a partner in long term plant growing.","Strategy, roadmapping, context mapping, service blueprint, product-service system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Despite this existence-defining condition, limited scientific knowledge on flood hazard and flood damage modelling of the old-town of Venice is available to support decisions to mitigate existing and future flood risk. Therefore, this study proposes a risk assessment framework to provide a methodical and flexible instrument for decision-making for flood risk management in Venice. It uses a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic urban model to identify the hazard characteristics inside the city of Venice. Exposure, vulnerability and corresponding damages are modelled by the multi-parametric, micro-scale damage model INSYDE transferred and adapted to the specific context of Venice with its dense urban structure and high risk awareness. A set of individual protection scenarios is implemented to account for possible variability of flood preparedness of the residents. The developed risk assessment framework was tested for the flood event of 12 November 2019. It was able to reproduce flood characteristics and resulting damages well. A scenario analysis based on the meteorological event like 12 November 2019 was conducted to derive flood damage estimates for the year 2060 for a set of sea level rise scenarios in combination with a (partially) functioning storm surge barrier MOSE. The analysis suggests that a functioning MOSE barrier could prevent flood damages for the considered storm event and all sea level scenarios almost entirely. It could reduce the damages by up to 34 % for optimistic sea level rise prognosis. Contrary, damages could be 1.08 to 5.92 times higher in 2060 compared to 2019 for a partial closure of the storm surge barrier depending on different levels of individual protection.","Flood Risk; Hydrodynamic modelling; Cultural Heritage; Sea level rise; Damage assessment; Storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","The submitted thesis will be published as a paper.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The value of customer relationships appears to be a hot topic at the moment as companies need to move from competition to collaboration, or how I will largely refer to: from transactional to relational. However, the value which current customer relationships generate is far from the claimed collaboration. For many years, transactional relationships kept companies in a stable comfort zone with easy cash flow, measurements and ongoing linear chain processes. However, they need to survive, but large corporates might find difficulties in acquiring new approaches to their relationships but start recognizing that their internal operations may be the key reason (Junginger, 2017). Looking at my personal motivation towards interactions and relationships between people, I see customer relationships not as on the interaction between companies but people. Although the word “customer” is largely used along with the thesis because of the Philips terminology, a relationship between people from different companies - a partnership, should equalise both sides of individuals as partners. Removing the roles of customer and provider helps to step out of the unwanted transactional approach. The same happens with customer-centricity. Although customer centricity seems to be the saving boat, companies struggle to apply it. Because it is not the company itself that needs to be customer centric, but the employees. To overcome the transactional approach of Account Management, Philips needs to understand that there are external factors to account managers that influence the behaviour of these and consequently, the outcomes of the customer interaction. Incentivisation on new deals and commercial education takes a big role within the context but this project will focus on the education side - training. Companies deliver education to their employees so that they perform under the assumed company strategy. In the case of Philips aiming to improve customer relationships, the organisation provides training to its account managers to sell better. This project aimed to develop a solution space to reframe the approach, knowledge and behaviour gaps in the dialogues between Philips Account Managers and Philips customers - hospitals.","Customer-centric; Customer engagement; Customer Relationship Management; Relational Design; Employee Experience; Framing; Reframing; Experiment; Dialogue; Behavior design; organisational design; Organizational transformation; designers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); van der Meer, F.P. (graduation committee); Heng, J. (graduation committee); Wu, W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The orthotropic steel deck (OSD) is nowadays commonly used due to its advantages, such as its lightweight, short construction time, and high capacity to bear the loads. However, fatigue cracks occur in different welded connections in the OSD. In this study, the rib to-deck-plate connection at the crossbeam conjunction has been analysed. This connection has been considered as a very critical connection due to the high-stress concentration under local wheel loading. In addition, the crack initiating at the weld root and propagating through the deck plate thickness cannot be visually inspected until surface cracks appear when the overlay is removed for the investigation. In the Netherlands, deck plate cracks at rib-to-deck plate connections at the crossbeam constitute a significant proportion of investigated cracks. In this thesis, a numerical investigation of the aforementioned cracks is carried out.<br/>First, XFEM is applied to study fatigue crack propagation using compact tension (CT) specimens. Commercial FE software package Abaqus® is used to build 2D and 3D CT models. The corresponding fatigue crack propagation is calculated in the direct cyclic step with strain energy release rate calculated using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). A good match is found between analytical calculation and 2D XFEM modeling. For 3D fatigue crack propagation, the number of cycles calculated from the automated crack propagation approach, using the low cycle fatigue step provided by Abaqus®, shows high sensitivity to element sizes, specifically the used element sizes through the thickness of the CT. <br/>Second, 3D crack propagation is applied to OSD with a 20 mm deck plate. For this detail, the fatigue crack initiation under compressive stress states is caused by the local loading on the deck plate. A hypothesis of changing the loading sign from compression to tension to subject the initial crack zone to tension is proposed so that this type of crack can propagate using automated XFEM. This assumption is made because high residual stresses normally exist in the welded connections and fatigue crack can propagate even under compressive stresses induced by loading. Before carrying out crack propagation calculation using VCCT, the stationary crack states were analysed using FEM and XFEM for cracks inserted with different angles. The SIFs obtained from FEM and XFEM are the same; in addition, that the SIF obtained when the detail is loaded in tension or compression has the same absolute value. Subsequently, the propagating crack analysis is carried out as a small initial crack with a depth of 0.5 mm is inserted and Paris’ law parameters C and m of 1∙ 10-13 and 3.0 were selected respectively. The obtained results of strain evolution as a function of loading history came close to that from the experiment with a difference of 7.75% for the initial strain value and 10.95 % for the maximum one. Moreover, the predicted crack shape, angle, and rate were all validated with similar crack shapes obtained from experiments in various literature. As for the crack propagation behaviour in the thickness direction, the crack arresting took place at around 75% of the deck thickness and an angle with the vertical axis of around 30o.<br/>Finally, the deck thicknesses of 16 mm and 10 mm were considered. Their results converged in terms of the crack propagation behaviour with real test specimens from the literature. It is also found that the 16 mm and 20 mm cases had a common crack propagation behaviour in the thickness direction as the crack arrest occurred at around 75% of the deck thicknesses, while for the 10 mm deck case the crack developed more dangerously by penetrating through the deck plate leading to a through-thickness crack. The approach proposed by this thesis proved to be valid for predicting the crack behaviour for the considered OSD deck plate thicknesses. Thus, the structural integrity of the detail can be assessed. This proved that for the 16 mm and 20 mm deck plates, the structural integrity is acceptable, while the 10 mm deck safety is not confirmed.<br","OSD; XFEM; LEFM; rib-to-deck plate joint; Fracture mechanics; Structural integrity; Crack propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This inevitable urban restructuring is reconfiguration spatial, socio-political, and cultural relations between the urban center and the periphery but is also considerably affecting the ecological functioning of the larger riverine territory of the Seine Basin from which it depends on. This thesis investigates the ecological, geological, and hydrological consequences of material extraction needed to construct the Parisian Urban Project, looking most notably at sand and aggregate quarries used in the production of concrete. While this graduation project does not look to offer an alternative to extractivism, it looks at applying a material practice of repair on damaged landscapes to mend for past destructive actions and reintegrate post-extraction sites into a larger production system. This project first constitutes a joint narrative between the urban project of the Grand Paris and the territorial project of the Seine watershed. This relational outlook is intended to form nonlinear and dynamic links between the urban and the territorial, land and water, and culture and matter to uncover the uneven and exploitative practices occurring in and around the river system. This project then follows urban matter - materials associated with the construction of the urban - through a forensic exploration, associating socio-cultural crisis with political and economic agendas and their physical manifestation beyond the conventional urban boundaries, looking at cultural and physical forces applied on geologies and the processes of de/re-territorialization of matter. Finally, this thesis formulates a territorial vision embedding a new material cycle in the Seine River Basin and proposing a design intervention towards repair in La Bassée, the last remaining upstream wetland in the watershed. This vision provides a dual social and ecological rehabilitation of post-extraction sites towards an integrated multi-species riverine landscape adapted to the instabilities of the New Climatic Regime.","Urbanization; Territorial Dynamics; Construction Materials; Urban Politics; Reparative Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","48.412882, 3.129857"

(mentor); Jonkman, Sebastiaan N. (graduation committee); Hemel, M. (mentor); Peters, D.J. (graduation committee); Feenstra, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The historic inner-cities in The Netherlands are largely known for their iconic channels and their accompanying quay walls, of which a significant number were constructed over 100 years ago. Due to the limited available space in the sub-surface of the urban environment, a high number of utility lines (i.e. potable water pipes and sewer systems) are situated in the vicinity of these quay walls. In recent years, a number of quay wall collapses have occured in the inner-city of Amsterdam, some of which have been attributed to utility line leakages. However, research into the interaction between inner-city quay walls and utility lines is lacking. Thus, the aim of this report is to answer the following question: ""How does utility line leakage relate to deformation and failure of Amsterdam's inner-city quay walls and when does this interaction become significant?"". The interaction between utility lines and inner-city quay walls works in both ways, thus the research is split up accordingly. The effects of utility line leakages on quay wall displacement and failure were qualitative studied using a literature study. The effects of quay wall displacement on utility line leakages were quantitatively studied using an analytical model. In this model, the interaction between utility line and surrounding soil was represented using a beam on a Winkler foundation, i.e. a beam supported by a distributed spring. The stiffness of the spring was represented as bi-linear, resulting from the equilibrium bearing capacity of the soil. Quay wall displacements ranging from 20 up to 100 mm were applied to the most common types and outer diameters of utility lines found in the vicinity of quay walls. Utility line leakage is deemed to occur if a predetermined threshold is passed of either maximum angular deflection, maximum allowable bending moment or maximum allowable shear force, each resulting from the utility line displacement. Although the scope of the study is the inner-city of Amsterdam, the study can be used in other cities with inner-city quay walls, given the circumstances are similar. <br/><br/>The literature study showed that quay wall displacement and failure due to utility line leakage follows from internal erosion processes. Two requirements have to be met for instigation of internal erosion: a local head difference between the water level in the channel and the groundwater level in the soil body behind the quay wall, and an open connection in the quay wall structure in the vicinity of the aforementioned local head difference, enabling the flow of soil via water. The rise of the groundwater level can be the result of a potable water pipe leakage, but can also follow from external factors like heavy rainfall. Three forms of open connections were appointed. The first is scour protection screen leakage, which can result in erosion underneath the structure. The second is quay wall floor leakage, which can result in both erosion underneath structure and erosion in the soil body behind the quay wall. The third is sewer leakage, which can result in erosion in the soil body behind the quay wall. In the latter, the aforementioned head difference is not required. This is because the direction of groundwater flow is not towards the channel, but towards the sewer leakage, given that the sewer pipe is located below the groundwater level. Erosion underneath the quay wall floor can result in quay wall displacement towards the channel, while erosion in the soil body behind the structure can result in the formation of a subsidence pit. <br/><br/>Both erosion underneath- as well as behind the structure can result in (further) deformations of utility lines. The former through quay wall displacement towards the channel, resulting in local soil displacement in which said utility line is embedded in. The latter trough local loss of soil, resulting in a local reduction of support. Both have the potential to result in relative utility line displacements, which can result in leakages. This process is can be denoted as a positive feedback loop. Actual failure of the quay wall due to utility line leakage can come in the form of collapse of the quay wall towards the channel or collapse of the road on top of the structure in the formed subsidence pit. Due to the dependence on external factors, quay wall failure resulting from utility line leakage can be described as a second order effect. <br/><br/>It was found that exceedance of the maximum allowable angular deflection of the utility line joints is most likely to result in leakages. Leakage due to exceedance of maximum allowable bending moment is relatively less likely but still significant, while leakage due to exceedance of maximum allowable shear force is unlikely. In all utility lines, a higher bending stiffness resulted in a lower susceptibility to leakage. If utility lines are deemed susceptible to leakage, it is advised that these are monitored intensely.","Quay walls; water supply system; Sewer; Winkler foundation; Amsterdam; Programma bruggen & kademuren; PenK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This overview could also be used as a reference for future research.<br/>Methods: An overview of the workflow was created, the time needed for the different steps was registered and patients were asked to fill out questionnaires on patient experience. The current clinical practice was observed to create the workflow overview and define the steps of which time should be registered. As some steps occurred in parallel the radiotherapy technicians, radiation oncologists and nurses were asked to assist in reporting of times. Matlab was used to calculate the duration of the steps and SPSS was used to determine the descriptive statistics.<br/>The research protocol written for the patient experience study was approved but the medical ethics committee. Patients were informed on the study so they could provide informed consent. <br/>The EQ-5D questionnaire was used to asses initial pain, anxiety and quality of life. A questionnaire on pain, anxiety and duration of each step during treatment day that was used for evaluating patient experience. <br/>Result: A workflow overview per location was created. Data of forty implantations in fifteen patients were included for time analysis. The general steps and mean time needed for these steps were: operating room (55 minutes), waiting before arrival at imaging (80 minutes), applicator reconstruction (57 minutes), contouring (50 minutes), treatment planning (50 minutes), clinical physicist check (22 minutes) and treatment room (41 minutes). The mean total procedure time from patient entering the operating room until leaving the treatment room was 391 minutes.<br/>The time needed for implantation of subsequent treatment fractions compared to the first treatment fraction decreased in sixteen out of the twenty fractions. The time needed at the operating room in patients receiving spinal anesthesia did not differ from patients receiving general anesthesia. <br/>Four patients provided informed consent and filled out the questionnaires on patient experience. Patient experience differed a lot in these four patients. Overall, highest anxiety scores were found during the first brachytherapy day and highest pain scores were found during the waiting time at the short stay unit. <br/>Discussion: The steps observed in the Erasmus MC did not agree on all steps that were found in literature. Time needed for these steps also differed when comparing to literature. The total waiting time could be decreased when enabling a more smooth transition between the recovery room and imaging step. <br/>Adaptions to the time registration sheet should include the time needed for assembling the applicator at the operating room. The contouring step should be separated in contouring of the OAR and target volume. Time needed for imaging is not that important as the imaging protocol is the same in all patients. The decrease in waiting time for imaging when using the hyperthermia MRI should be evaluated. The influence of the amount of patients treated during one day would also be interesting to evaluate when more data has been collected. Another interesting factor would be differences in duration of the steps and pain experienced in patients treated with the Venezia applicator compared to the Utrecht applicator. More patients need to be included in the questionnaire study to draw conclusions on patient experience. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-29","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

However, there are no insights available what a food forest could look like on peat soils nor what its environmental benefits could be. At the same time the Dutch peat area represents 12% of the total agricultural area and is subjected to soil subsidence releasing carbon dioxide, accounting for 2.5% of the national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This thesis designed a food forest for the Dutch peat area and assessed it on three ecosystem services being: food provisioning, climate regulation and wildlife habitat provisioning. The results were put into perspective by comparing them to the currently predominant land-use for organic milk production. The plant species were selected based on selection criteria which took into account the environmental conditions and marketing potential. Yield estimates were made based on documented yields and proxies. GHG emissions and carbon sequestration potentials were determined by both available comparative literature and calculations. For the indications of wildlife habitat provisioning birds were taken as indicator species group and the attractiveness was determined by available literature. The proposed peatland food forest (PFF) consists of 21 different plant species that were estimated to produce a mean dry weight yield of 863 kg/ha/a over the first 20 years with a maximum of 1569 kg/ha/a. Furthermore, the PFF is expected to store between 0.37 and 0.52 Mg CO2 eq./ha/a compared to the current emissions of 15.8 Mg CO2 eq./ha/a. Finally, the PFF provides a habitat that is likely to attract more but different bird species than the current landscape, including a greater number of endangered species.

(mentor); Wang, Ranran (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","Industrial decarbonisation has largely stagnated over the last years in Germany. A large share of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions stem from the combustion of natural gas for producing higher temperature process heat. High-Temperature Heat Pumps (HTHPs) are an emerging technology that can upgrade waste heat with electrical input to high temperatures needed for the processes and thus can contribute to the electrification of industries. Hence, HTHP can significantly reduce GHG emissions stemming from the production of process heat. While residential heat pumps are widely commercially available due to lower temperature requirements, no HTHPs were installed in German industries in 2018 due to multiple technical, market, and knowledge barriers. HTHPs are expected to reach temperatures up to 250°C soon, making the food and beverages industry a suitable sector due to process temperature requirements at the lower industrial spectrum (&lt;250°C). The International Energy Agency (IEA) outlines that HTHPs are a core emerging technology to replace fossil-fuel boilers in industry over the next decades. Thus, there is a large market ahead for manufacturers. This study evaluates the techno-economic potential of HTHPs in the Germany food and beverages industry. Further, it evaluates the GHG emissions abatement potential in relation to total GHG emissions of the industrial sector. This study has a generalized and systemic scope, thus does neither consider specific case studies, nor performs process optimization. It follows a bottom-up approach to include process- and technology-specific information and scales it up to national level. This study uses two waste heat scenarios, first considering an average 45°C industrial waste heat availability as worst-case, and second considering direct exhaust temperatures as best-case scenario. The generic bottom-up approach results in limited, but more detailed, coverage which makes the results conservative estimates for the application potential of HTHPs in German industries. The most energy-intensive sub-sectors of the German food and beverages industry are sugar production, meat processing, dairy processing, bakery products production and beer production, which together accounted for approximately 9333 kt-CO2-equivalents in 2020. The processes dominating the thermal energy demand are mainly pasteurisation, cooking, baking, evaporation, and drying processes, which require higher temperatures for the evaporation of liquids and boiling off bacteria. The thermodynamic efficiency, the COPs, of applying HTHPs to the processes lay between 1,7 – 4,8 for the worst-case scenario and 2,4 – 22,7 for the best-case scenario. The technical potential for 2018 results in 12 TWh. Between 3 - 5,5 TWh of electricity are required to cover the technical potential. The GHG emissions abatement potential lays between 52 - 855 kt-CO2-eq. This could mean a reduction of up to 9% of total GHG emissions of the five sub-branches. Due to very high electricity costs and an absent carbon tax in industry in 2018, the most cost-effective scenario (50 MW HTHP in the best-case) is not cost-competitive with the optimized fossil-fuel benchmark. The levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for this scenario is 37 €/MWh, of which approximately 67% are stemming from electricity costs. With a carbon tax of min. 48 €/t-CO2-eq. the switch to an HTHP becomes cost-competitive (incl. maintenance and investment costs). With an expected increase in carbon taxation, less efficient scenarios become cost competitive. By reducing the electricity price by 50%, the best-case scenario with the large HTHP is cost-competitive without a carbon tax. Hence, there is a strong correlation between electricity price and cost-competitiveness of HTHPs. It is expected that the emission factor of the German electricity mix will decrease further in the future and strive towards zero in the long-term, which will lead to substantial increase of GHG emissions abatement potential. When the emission factor for electricity is reduced by 38%, the GHG emissions abatement potential lays at 16% of total GHG emissions of the five sub-branches. The timely investment into HTHPs drastically reduces the risk of sunken costs and makes industrial decarbonisation efforts in this decade attractive from an industrial perspective. Subsidies, carbon taxation, and the reduction of electricity prices by for example removing the German renewable energy levy (EEG) can contribute to making low-carbon technologies such as HTHPs more competitive to fossil-fuel infrastructure that run on fossil fuels with low prices in the industrial sector. Industrial decarbonisation is highly relevant in Germany due to the recent tightening of industrial decarbonisation targets and the systemic demonstration of HTHPs potentials crucial to achieving the latter.","Industrial decarbonisation; process heat; high temperature heat pumps; techno-economic potential; GHG emissions abatement potential; carbon tax; German food and beverages industry; bottom-up approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

On a national level, this amount results to almost 50% for the Dutch construction industry (Nellssen, et al., 2018). The ever-growing population stresses the need for sufficient infrastructure and services which only results in an increase in demand and eventually an increase in resource consumption. The current trend of linear model, wherein the virgin raw materials are used to construct end products and eventually discarded at its end of life, poses a major threat for raw material extinction, and adds to the problem of excessive resource consumption. A viable solution for this problem is the introduction of circular economy concepts that aim at closing the raw material loops by considering all the current and future life cycle phases of a product in the initial development stages. Since the launch of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) in 2010, circular economy (CE) has gained considerable attention. EMF defines circular economy as “a regenerative system that aims to keep materials in a closed loop at their highest value” (Foundation, Cities in the circular economy: An initial exploration , 2017, page 7). CE focuses on much more than reduction of waste through recycling and aims at reducing the consumption of raw materials, designing products such that they can easily be disassembled and reused and extending product lifespan through maintenance and repair. CE differentiates the gradation options that help keep the materials and components within the loop by options such as refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, etc. One of the important parts of any city is its transport infrastructure that can also make use of the circularity principle. For many developed and developing countries, transport infrastructure accounts for the largest proportion of a country’s budget of any public-works program and consequently also play an important part in a nation’s economic and regional development. Studies show that current developing research of circular economy seldom focuses on the assessment of such transport infrastructure. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to understand the barriers of circular economy and to develop an assessment framework that can help the evaluation of transport infrastructure in terms of circularity.","Circular Economy; Railway; Infrastructure; life cycle; urban; Netherlands; Circularity assessment; Circularity Tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Our world is changing rapidly in various ways, forcing organizations to engage in continuous change to stay relevant. Therefore, it has become an essential capability of organizations to engage in and attempt to manage change to remain successful and sustain their existence (Stouten, Rousseau &amp; de Cremer, 2018; Coughlan, Suri &amp; Canales, 2007). Due to the increasingly fast-changing market demands, organizations recognize the need for a more outside-in approach in order to increase their resilience. This is why the customer-centric approach gained popularity (Ambaram, 2013). In order to become customer-centric, organizations need to enhance their customers’ experiences. As service design offers the means to improve customer experience, service design has become a capability that many organizations attempt to acquire (Ostrom et al., 2015).Initial assignmentA few years ago, Koos developed their service design maturity model: a model that describes different growth phases an organization can go through while trying to embed service design within their organizations, and the elements that affect this process. In order to realize the ambition of becoming a more strategic partner that guides organizations through customer-centric transformations, Koos feels having a solid maturity model could serve as a backbone. The expectation was that the model could both serve in order to predict in what way an organization should change, but also to “sell“ the transformation proposition. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis assignment was to validate and improve Koos’ maturity model, and identify how the model could be servitized by Koos. Reframed assignmentHowever, initial exploration through interviews with experts and Koos’ designers, combined with findings from literature, pointed out that the key stakeholders may have made the assumption that a maturity scan is what they need in order to concretize their transformation offer. However, Koos’ service designers and interviewed experts pointed out a more fundamental problem: the feeling that Koos might be missing skills that are essential in order to be able to help organizations transform. On top of that, literature research made clear that creating maturity models that accurately indicate how an organization might need to transform, or indicating how “mature“ an organization is, is impossible since every organization is different and requires a unique approach. Therefore, the new problem statement, formulated as a question, became:What does Koos need to do differently in order to enable organizations to become more customer-centric through service design, in order to form a more strategic, long-term collaboration with clients?Opportunity gapto focus more on exploring the organizational context elements to understand clients’ as-is situation, instead of trying to assess the context elements to indicate a maturity level. In that way, they can secure better implementation and thus enable clients to become slightly more customer-centric project by project. This will help Koos to concretize their transformation proposition in three ways:First, exploring the as-is state of the organizational context will enable Koos to improve chances of implementation, and thus make a more transformative impact. Secondly, having the as-is state made explicit will also enable Koos to express the transformative impact of service design to clients after a project has been implemented. Thirdly, more experience with implementation and organizational change on project scale will give Koos the expertise, the organizational sensitivity and credibility needed to serve as transformation consultants in the future.Organizational context framework and MiroBased on findings from 4 case studies compared with findings from literature and a co-reflection session with 24 of Koos’ employees, it was decided to design a framework that would explain which organizational context elements service designers should take into account in order to secure better implementation, and when and how they should embed exploration of these context elements into their double diamond design approach. This resulted in the Organizational Context Framework as shown in figure 1. The framework shows how designers should adress implementation from day one, by performing 3 different actions regarding the organizational context: exploring, aligning and anchoring. In order to enact the framework, the Organizational Context Reflection Miro has been designer. This Miroboard serves as a living document, in which the design team goes through a weekly reflection of all three organizational context actions. In that way, continuous alignment between the organizational context and the project approach is being stimulated, so that the project outcomes and required changes can be anchored and implemented within the organization succesfully. Change process KoosThe most important outcome of this project is not the organizational context framework or the reflection Miro, but rather the fact that this project set a change process in motion at Koos internally. Through the findings of this project, it has become apparent that Koos’ service designers need to extern their skill set and start approaching their projects in a more impact-minded, flexible manner. The framework and the Miroboard serve as artefacts that stimulate this change, but pointing out the blindspot Koos had, and starting the change process required to solve it is bigger and more important, and should make lasting impact long after this project ended.","Service design; Design maturity; Organizational transformation; organizational change; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A vast network of problems and choices are to be made, where the right course of action can solve the issues that has befuddled the infrastructure domain. These problems can be briefly described as; ageing assets that are no longer fit for purpose, use of infrastructure as a political tool with questionable goals and unclear benefits and value reporting.<br/><br/>Due to ageing assets, owners are faced with the unenviable task of total motorway replacement, but solutions to this have been found in the sanctum of innovations. But there are issues with the methods of assessment used in decision making. A solution to all these woes could be found in a wholly more appropriate decision-making method; to both improve implementation and give clarity to the values of infrastructure. <br/><br/>Hybrid real options (HRO) is a new economic method, relative to currently adopted methods, that combines decision and financial analyses to deal with uncertainty in systems. However, this method is still in its infancy and requires considerable work to complete a full method.<br/><br/>This study built an HRO method. This method consists of 5 key stages: options identification, formation of mechanisms, creation of decision trees, financial analyses, and simulation. Which forms a holistic systems-orientated framework. Importantly this research aimed to create a method that can be used to create frameworks to form an assessment, not to create a framework via another method. This was tested against a hypothetical case study of a smart motorway (NL: Dynamic Traffic Management). This case proved several key points, that the HRO method:<br/>• Can effectively represent systems (shown in the mechanism stage)<br/>• Intake wide stakeholder values (proved by the entire cases completion)<br/>• Represent options financially using time as a variable (ranging from simple nominal sum to complex European call options and graphical piecewise solution)<br/>• Has Dynamic abilities (shown in mechanism 3 by the self-feedback assessment mechanism)<br/><br/>This also demonstrates that the HRO can build on the cons of the current decision-making tools without compromising the pros - a step towards applicability. This method was also validated by an external expert. However, limitations were found with regards to the exponential growth and ability of the method to represent qualitative options. It is discussed that these are possible to address but a real case study is required to prove this.<br","Hybrid; Real options analysis; management tools; Innovation; Infrastructural assets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sousamli, M. (mentor); Rots, J.G. (graduation committee); Ravenshorst, G.J.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Masonry is one of the most common building materials globally due to its ease of construction, price, durability and fire resistance. Its heterogeneity and orthotropic nature make its mechanical behaviour rather complex, highlighting the importance of an appropriate constitutive model to describe such behaviour accurately. In literature, most of the existing constitutive models for masonry fall in one of the two following categories: macro-models or micro-models. The micro-models (also called block-based models), which explicitly describe masonry's geometrical and material heterogeneities, exhibit higher accuracy but require higher numerical efforts when simulating masonry's mechanical behaviour. The macro-models (also called continuum models), which model masonry as homogeneous material and smear out the damage over the continua, are less accurate but offer a good compromise between accuracy and numerical efficiency. They are therefore used more often to simulate masonry structures. However, most of the macro-models are not capturing well the damage localization occurring along the mortar joints and the energy dissipation in the bricks and mortars. To increase the applicability of continuum models, the components' damage localization and energy dissipation should be improved. This thesis presents a homogenized constitutive model for applications on masonry structures under in-plane loading. The developed homogenized material model for masonry includes the description of shearing, tensile cracking, crushing and splitting. Inspired by the micro-mechanical models of Zucchini and Lourenço, four models were developed in this thesis to describe the different types of in-plane failure of masonry, naming: tensile failure of bed joints, horizontal shear sliding of bed joints, tensile cracking of unit, diagonal tensile cracking failure, masonry crushing failure. The first model is derived for the masonry’s pure shear behaviour, where the shear sliding failure is introduced. The second one is derived for the horizontal tensile behaviour, where the vertical tensile cracking of brick units and the vertical joints is proposed. The third one is derived for the vertical compression behaviour, where masonry crushing failure is adopted. The fourth one is coupling the failure mechanisms described in the previous three models with a novel algorithm. Additionally, the diagonal tension cracking failure and the horizontal tensile cracking of horizontal joints are incorporated in the fourth and final material model. To derive these models, first, a representative volume element (RVE) was selected for running bond wall, where the bricks are staggered by half-length of brick from the adjoining courses above and below. Each RVE consists of two-quarters of bricks connected through a bed joint, and each one is connected to a head joint on one side. For each of the models, the active internal stresses of each component (brick, bed, head or cross joint) are calculated through the compatibility and equilibrium equations resulting from the assumed deformed mechanisms. Different damage state variables are introduced for every component in the damage model, where exponential softening is assumed for tension and shear. Additionally, a Ducker-Prager yield criterion with bi-parabolic hardening is used in combination with an explicit Euler-forward algorithm to describe the elastoplastic behaviour of the material in compression. As a result, the material model’s constitutive law is obtained with the homogenization procedures after coupling the damage and plastic model together by a specific algorithm originally introduced by Zucchini and Lourenço. The constitutive equations for model 1 (shear), model 2 (tension), model 3 (compression) and model 4 (coupled) were coded successfully in MATLAB. The components’ shearing, tensile cracking, crushing and splitting failures are correctly modelled analytically with an algorithm, which can be applied to simplify the micro-mechanical model. Besides, constitutive laws of models 1 and 2 were also implemented successfully in the finite element software DIANA version 10.4 (check). The ability of the model to capture the failure of the components in shear, tensile cracking or crushing was examined through simple analytical applications. Moreover, the model was compared against experimental results from tests performed on masonry wallets under compressive loading; the model was able to predict the strength of the specimens satisfactorily. Therefore, this alternative constitutive material model can adequately simulate masonry’s behaviours with a simpler algorithm than the previous model. Meanwhile, the component’s elastic and elastoplastic behaviours can be simulated in more detail in this model, as the case that the horizontal joint is first damaged in shear and compressive splitting effects are additionally included.","constitutive model; masonry; homogenization technique; micro-mechanical model,; Drucker-Prager r yield criterion; damage theory; elastoplastic; splitting effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There is a major uncertainty however in the modelling of groynes, and therefore in the prediction of the effect of groyne lowering. Currently submerged groynes are modelled subgrid as weirs. The flow processes differ however between groynes and weirs as discharge over a groyne is not purely defined by the contraction and expansion over the groyne, but also by lateral shear and interaction with the surrounding main channel and floodplain. The result is a lower resistance of the cross section than expected from weir modelling. For this reason a numerical investigation was started, comparing the modelling of groynes as different subgrid weirs in a 2D model and the modelling of groynes included in the bed topography in a 3D (non-)hydrostatic model. There were large differences between all different methods of groyne modelling. Furthermore the available experimental data did not suffice to explain the differences.<br/>For that reason a new physical model has been set up in the Delft University of Technology, at the hydraulic laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geoscience. The experiment includes a 1:30 scale model of a representative transect of the Waal river. The model is 5 m wide and 30 m long and includes 6 groynes and 5 groyne fields. It further includes a part of the main channel at one side and a part of the floodplain at the other side of the groyne fields. Gravel is fixed to the bed to ensure hydraulically rough flow conditions. In the experiment many measurements were done. The first aim of the measurements was to obtain a good spread of points to validate numerical models on. The second aim was to gain insight in the different flow processes in order to describe the differences between groyne and weir flow and quantify the resistance groynes have on a flow. <br/>An important observation was the existence of a region of low flow, at the tip of the groyne. The observation indicates a complex three-dimensional flow which effectively redistributes discharge over the transverse. The contribution of this flow to the two-dimensional momentum balance is then directly as a secondary circulation and indirectly by alternating the distribution of discharge. Complex flow furthermore invalidates the hydrostatic pressure assumption. The observed flow needs further investigation with either more accurate measurement devices or in a 3D non-hydrostatic model. Another observation includes the contraction and expansion of flow over the groyne crest. The expansion of flow over the main body of the groyne seems comparable to the expansion of flow over a weir, which can be predicted as Carnot head losses. The observation of expansion losses is however clouded by other flow processes, such as bed shear stress, the lateral flow around the groyne and possible three-dimensional processes induced by the groyne tip, so that the observed head loss over the groyne is only partially explained by weir-like expansion losses.<br/>The comparability between groyne flow and weir flow does not seem to hold at the groyne tip, where no separation of flow is observed. Measurements were performed 10 cm away from the transition between the groyne tip and main body of the groyne. This means that at full scale there is a region of 3 m on either side of this geometrical transition where the transition lies between weir-like overflow and non-weir-like overflow.<br/>With the here performed simulations it is possible to adapt weir head loss formulas on the observed head losses over groyne. It should be possible to validate a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model, which can further quantify the effect of three-dimensional flow and differentiate the different contributions to groyne head loss. Based on these models proper tuning parameters can be chosen to represent the complex flow in a two-dimensional model and separately model the weir-like expansion.<br","Submerged groyne; submerged spur dike; groynes; physical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In order to get a better grip on what loneliness is, and what the role is of the high school context, extensive research was done to answer the main research question: Following the current situation in Delft, which steps should be taken next in the high school context to better deal with loneliness among adolescents? <br/>Four sub questions were formulated in order to define the challenges and opportunities for the design phase. Answers to the sub questions were found through various research activities, like literature research, expert interviews and contextmapping sessions. Analysis of the data led to seven main insights. Following these insights, it was explored what a better way was to look at the problem. <br/>Currently, loneliness among adolescents is framed as problematic, because it can progress into chronic loneliness with severe consequences. Existing initiatives that aim to solve this problem often help adolescents to step out of social isolation or help them improve their social skills. Besides that, loneliness is also framed as something that does not happen to young people, which makes adolescents struggle with identifying with the word, or they feel ashamed to admit when they do feel lonely. <br/>In order to take steps towards a more preventative and holistic approach, the problem was reframed: a problem of ignorance, by not treating the feeling as something we all experience and that teaches us about our underlying human needs. <br/>Following this new frame and additional exploration, the design statement was formulated: we want to show high school students how feelings like loneliness are indicators of underlying, fundamental human needs by letting them collectively reflect on these needs and thei relation to emotions, while also making them aware of the universality of those needs. <br/>A creative design process followed. Potential design directions were explored through brainstorming and organizing a focus group. <br/>Validation of the concept was done through a user test and by interviewing stakeholders. The concept was detailed further and the Under-Needs toolkit was introduced. The Under-Needs toolkit provides the tools for the high school context to educate students on their emotions and underlying needs. While it does not directly tackle loneliness, it aims to teach students how to reflect on feelings like loneliness and trace them back to underlying needs. This will help them to make better sense of feelings like loneliness because they get taught how to see them in the bigger picture.","loneliness; high school; contextmapping; reframing; toolkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.011111, 4.3575"

Especially in urban environments, these solutions could potentially form the missing connection between heating supply and demand. This study focuses on the application of these solutions in the city canal waters in the largest city of the Netherlands, Amsterdam . Currently, these so-called Surface Water Heat (SWH) systems have not been implemented at all in the inner city canals of Amsterdam. One of the reasons for this can be found in a lack of knowledge about natural water temperature variations in these types of waters and the unknown thermal effects related to SWH systems. This study is an answer to this knowledge gap and an attempt is made to provide insight in the thermal effects of SWH on a city canal. The Amsterdam city canals form a unique water system in open connection with larger waterways and they are part of a hydrodynamically complex interaction between sea and the river Rhine. Until date, such a study towards SWH system effects, not being restricted to the boundaries of the respective water body, is scarce or even non-existent.\\ The case study location is situated at the Jacob van Lennepkanaal in Amsterdam, where a collective of civilians has recently started the exploratory phase for installation of the first SWH city canal system for heating of their own district. To respond to this societal development, this specific case study location was chosen. To be able to model the SWH system for this neighborhood, the first part of this thesis focuses on system layout and related system characteristics. It was found that open-loop SWH systems are often applied at district level. Secondly, a reference surface water temperature model without SWH systems was built and validated upon meteorological forcing with local water temperature measurements. The third part of the followed method was to apply the modelled SWH system to this validated three-dimensional thermodynamic model. For this purpose, the Delft3D model was chosen, which computes the RANS equations under the hydrostatic assumption. Several scenarios were calculated with varying temperature difference through the SWH heat exchanger and varying distance between system intake and outfall. The modelling results for the Jacob van Lennepkanaal case show that SWH systems used for heating purposes, thereby cooling the surface water, produce a negatively buoyant flow, causing the discharged cold water plume to sink to the bottom. Existing thermal stratification in the city canals is enhanced and hydrodynamic mixing processes are not strong enough to disturb this stratification built-up. Further away along the plume, in the far-field, a combination of buoyant spreading and the process of passive diffusion mix the water column and the temperature decrease, induced by the SWH system, becomes uniformly spread over the entire water column. Currently, steady state one-dimensional models are often used for assessment of SWH thermal effects. It was demonstrated that these models are useful and accurate, provided that the right heat exchange coefficient is used and near-field mixing at the outfall is represented correctly. These models can be used to study for example the time-averaged extent of the cold water plume, but fail to provide insight in time-varying and spatial characteristics of the canal. Local changes in bed level height, attraction of ambient water by the intake and intersections with lateral canals also influence the thermal profile. For a study towards these effects in greater detail, three-dimensional modelling or 2DV-modelling are preferred. Also, in case of a study towards application of multiple systems, these are the models of choice.","Surface Water Heat; Cold Water Plume; Delft3D; Negative buoyancy; City canal; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.364616, 4.870336"

Assuming a thermal occupancy of magnon modes, we study the magnetization dynamics of magnons propagating through thin magnetic insulators using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We implement a numerical model to predict and understand the response of the NV center to proximal magnons in thin films.

The simulation includes a static bias field in an arbitrary orientation with respect to the quantization axis of the NV center using the diamond's tetrahedral symmetry.

As the technology advances, the capacity of shear in concrete structures can be calculated with the analytical formulation in codes and standards and simulated with NLFEA. The shear capacity is affected by the size which is a phenomenon observed from experiments where the change in the structure size does not have a linear relation to the structural strength. This can be referred to as the experimental size effect. When estimating the shear capacity with NLFEA, this effect must be included in order to avoid over-estimation of capacity. However, another size effect can be found from the result of NLFEA. The change in structural size has an influence on the global response of concrete structures with different numerical configurations in a simulation with NLFEA. A numerical configuration consists of several numerical parameters. This effect is referred to as the numerical size effect. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the experimental size effect and reduce the influence of the numerical size effect in a numerical model in order to increase the accuracy and precision of the simulation with NLFEA. The aim of this study is to investigate how the numerical size effect influences the NLFEA results, which will help understand how to improve the accuracy of the simulation. The investigation is done by studying numerical models with a variation on several numerical parameters, such as load increment, error tolerance, the maximum number of iterations and mesh size. The study is focused on identifying the influence of these numerical parameters for cases with different structural sizes and comparable shear slenderness. This is done by observing the global behaviour of the structure and comparing NLFEA results to their respective experimental results. Any difference in the simulated global response is analysed by observing the difference between the experimental and the simulated crack pattern and the convergence state of the respective step. The study is done in three stages. The study is initiated by investigating how the flexural shear failure mode can be obtained with NLFEA. Two specimens with comparable shear slenderness (a/d), 3.70 and 3.91 for beam A123A1 and H123A respectively, are used as a reference for the simulation model. It was found that bad convergence was achieved at the later stage of the analysis and by not accepting non-converged steps, the results became dependent on the convergence state of the analysis where different peak loads were achieved in different numerical configurations for the same case study. The study continues by identifying the correlation of numerical parameters with the results of NLFEA by creating simulation models with different iterative incremental solutions, load increment, error tolerance, and the maximum number of iterations. All load steps are accepted in this stage, regardless of their convergence state, and the rotating crack model is used in these numerical models. The NLFEA results are post-processed by setting up an upper limit in the error tolerance in order to minimize the variation of the peak load and attain a higher consistency of the results. At the last stage, another study is performed to identify the correlation between mesh sizes with the results of NLFEA by simulating several models with different mesh sizes. All load steps are also accepted in this stage, regardless of their convergence state, and the rotating crack model is used in these numerical models The NLFEA results are also post-processed with the same criteria attained in the previous stage. It is concluded that the results of NLFEA are dependent on the following numerical parameters, the load increment, error tolerance, and the maximum number of iterations, due to different initiations and propagation of dowel crack in the non-converged steps, which influences the convergence condition in the later stage of the NLFEA. The formation and rapid propagation of the dowel crack results in the excessive change in the principal strain direction and magnitude, which induces high relative energy variation and out-of-balance force. These numerical parameters indirectly contribute to the error found in each step in the analysis. An additional study is done by replacing the crack model with a fixed crack model with a damage-based shear retention model, but it was found that this did not solve the problem due to the excessive change in the shear retention factor on the elements that lead to premature failure of the beam. The observation related to the numerical size effect reveals that the mesh size controls the propagation rate of the dowel crack. The use of a smaller mesh size will reduce the propagation rate of the dowel crack after its initiation due to a smaller increment of the crack width between each load step. As a result, the increment of the crack width becomes smaller as the mesh size decrease. This becomes more pronounced due to the effect of excessive change of the principal stress-strain direction and magnitude. Full Newton-Raphson method has been proven to give the smallest variation of the peak load ratio (Pnorm), ranging from 0.887-1.140 for specimen A123A1 and 1.055-1.246 for specimen H123A, compared to the other iterative-incremental method with the use of load increment ratio (load increment/experimental peak load) within 0.03-0.006 in combination with evaluation of acceptable analysis step with error tolerance, where the predefined error tolerance must be set to Gerr = 0.0001 and Ferr = 0.01, and non-converged steps can still be accepted if the relative energy variation and out-of-balance force of the corresponding step are below 0.03 and 0.58 respectively. An additional criterion related to the shear displacement on the major flexural shear crack (Δ) should be added to the evaluation of the acceptable analysis step in order to prevent an excessive crack opening on the major flexural shear crack at the peak load. The analysis step can still be considered valid if the respective step satisfies the criterion of the error tolerance and the vertical crack opening on the major flexural crack on the respective step is below the ultimate tensile crack width (CWt,u), which can be calculated from the Guidelines for Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis of Concrete Structures (Hendriks &amp; Roosen, 2020). A mesh size ratio which larger than h/15 is required to have the correct simulated failure.","Non-Linear Finite Element Analysis; Numerical Size Effect; Load Increment; Error Tolerance; Maximum Number of Iterations; Mesh Size; Convergence State; Dowel Crack Initiation; Dowel Crack Propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This can be averted by several countermeasures of which holding control is the most popular one in practice. Holding control strategies are often implemented using predefined rules. In this study, multi-agent reinforcement learning is selected to develop an effective holding strategy since it is more flexible and can adjust its strategy to the conditions of the system. This approach is tested on five bus systems with different characteristics. The first system is idealised with deterministic driving times, deterministic dwell times, where all route sections have equal length and all stops have the same demand. In the other systems several complexities are added: stochastic driving times, stochastic dwell times, route sections of varying length, varying demand at the stops and traffic lights on the route. Additionally, in two systems the traffic lights are modelled as reinforcement learning agents. The results show that this approach can outperform the rule-based benchmark in four out of five systems. Furthermore, the MARL approach can handle the stochastic processes better than the rule-based benchmark. This difference is not observed for the varying route characteristics. Lastly, the MARL approach is able to learn an effective cooperation between the bus agents and traffic light agents. This indicates the potential of system wide cooperation and optimisation.","bus bunching; Reinforcement Learning; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; bus management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

This is in part due to uncertainties in the fatigue capacity (i.e. fatigue resistance) of the ship: the nominal and hot spot structural stress incorporate implicit conservatism due to the inherent data-scatter and the Linear Damage Accumulation Model (LDAM) by Palmgren and Miner is not sufficiently accurate to assess random variable amplitude loading histories. The safe-life engineering solution to this is to employ a safety factor. This typically reduces the critical damage from 1.0 to 0.5, or even 0.2, based on engineering judgement. The main flaw of the Linear Damage Accumulation Model is that it does not properly account for the effects of the loading history. To address this flaw the non-linear probabilistic fatigue damage accumulation model by Leonetti is researched and thoroughly validated with variable amplitude fatigue data from the literature. The combination between the effective notch stress and the model from Leonetti poses significant improvements in the quality of the fatigue life predictions. The effective notch stress is used to formulate a generalised fatigue resistance curve (reducing scatter due to different geometries, hot spot types and mean stress ratios), after which the non-linear probabilistic fatigue damage accumulation model is used to work towards a generalised damage accumulation model. For the considered variable amplitude fatigue databases from literature, the Effective Notch Stress Concept (ENSC) - Non-Linear Damage Accumulation Model (NLDAM) combination proves to reduce the lifetime ratio scatter index (1:1.13, instead of 1:1.28) the most in relation to the DNV method (Hot Spot Structural Stress concept with the LDAM), allowing to reduce the implicit conservatism in the fatigue-life model.","Steel marine structures; Welded joints; Variable amplitude loading; Effective notch stress; Generalised random fatigue limit; Non-linear damage accumulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Technological advancements have enabled manufacturers to fit IMDs with specialized hardware that accelerates compute-intensive medical therapies next to a software-run host processor. However, mostly hardware acceleration is found in the form of ASIC peripherals next to a host processor in state-of-the-art IMDs, while low-power FPGAs could provide a comparable performance gain with the added benefit of the upgradability of functionality. Existing literature about low-power FPGAs focuses on new algorithms or performance improvements, while largely ignoring power and energy analysis, the latter being the most limiting factor in the IMD environment. This thesis investigates under what conditions FPGAs could be added to IMDs by developing two use cases: an FPGA securing wireless communication, and accelerating a neural network aiding medical therapies that depend on pattern detection. These cases are evaluated on FPGA, eFPGA and MCU with ASIC peripheral platforms, from which performance, energy usage and prospected IMD battery life is derived. On one end, it was found that AES encryption used 4.4 times the energy of an MCU hardware-accelerated implementation while being 17% slower. However, employing lightweight ciphers on the FPGA closes this gap. Furthermore, adding an FPGA results in only a 7.5% decrease in battery life when the FPGA is shut off during idling to combat its high static current draw. Running an FPGA-accelerated neural network is feasible if the active time is 6.5 minutes per day. With weekly recharging, continuous monitoring is possible. Using an eFPGA, which is an embedded FPGA fabric integrated within an MCU, results in using only 12% to 21% of the FPGA package area and is almost 2 times as energy efficient under 2 minutes daily usage as an FPGA. As FPGAs in IMDs is a novel field, research was done in legal regulation of IMDs, where it was found that existing regulations on software devices also applies to FPGAs. Therefore, all obstacles of the technical and legal kind have been removed that hold IMD manufacturers from using FPGAs in their devices.","FPGA; IMD; Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs); Regulations; Cryptography; Neural Network; Ultra-low power; eFPGA; Neurostimulation; Reconfiguration; Feasibility study; ASIC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ammonia is an essential nutrient and an important part of fertilizer, which in soil leads to increased growth of crops. However, the current excess of NH3 emissions is a hazard to environmental and human health. While ammonia<br/>emissions need to be reduced, the emission estimates are still highly uncertain.<br/>In this study, a method is developed to combine the chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS with measured ammonia concentrations to improve the ammonia emission estimates in the Netherlands and the surrounding regions. The measurements used are generated by the miniDOAS instruments on LML stations and the IRS instrument on board the future MTG-S satellite. The proposed method is an adjoint-free 4DVar method. The 4DVar method aims to retrieve the emission parameters for which the LOTOS-EUROS model determines NH3 concentrations that resemble the measurements while keeping the emissions fairly similar to the original inventories. A linear approximate model has been developed, which uses the near-linearity of the NH3 concentrations in terms<br/>of the NH3 emissions. When using the approximate model, the 4DVar<br/>method can be solved without using an adjoint model, making the method adjoint-free. Subsequently, the 4DVar cost function is rewritten to allow the emission parameters to have a lognormal prior distribution. A maximum likelihood approach is developed to estimate the parameters of both the prior distribution of the emissions and the likelihood of the measured observations. Last, a preconditioner in reduced space has been considered, to estimate emissions on a fine spatial resolution, while keeping the computational cost<br/>feasible. This preconditioner uses the property that the emission parameters are correlated in space. First, the methodology has been tested in an identical twin experiment where the emissions vary only in time and strength, using the LML observations. It was concluded that the methodology worked well<br/>for short periods (less than 30 days), but the results were dominated by observational noise. When using the real observations in the 4DVar<br/>method, the results seem unrealistic Second, the method has been tested in an identical twin experiment where emissions vary in space, as well as in time and strength. Here, synthetic IRS observations of the future MTG-S satellite are<br/>used. The optimized emissions did resemble the true emissions of the twin experiment. Observational noise appeared to no longer be an issue. However, the results were not perfect. The regions with the highest emission increase appeared to be underestimated, low emission areas appeared to have large<br/>relative estimation errors, and estimates for coastal regions seemed to be incorrect. Hence, on a local scale, the emission estimates can be imperfect, but overall the adjoint-free 4DVar method does greatly improve the emission inventories.","Ammonia; 4D-Var; Emission; Inverse modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

All living things have DNA within their cells. This DNA contains the building blocks of an organism. The process of creating such a building block requires mRNA and proteins. The concentration of a certain mRNA molecule plays a part in the making of these proteins. In biology these processes are called transcription and translation. These interacting processes can be transformed into a mathematical model, a network. This network is a collection of nodes and edges, which represent the interactions between different mRNA concentrations. Since these interactions are unknown, random matrix theory is used to model these interactions. It is interesting how the concentrations of mRNA molecules evolve over time. A system of differential equations can be used to model these changes of concentrations over time. This report aims to discover the properties of the model of interacting organisms. For this a linear model is found, which is a system of differential equations linearised around a given equilibrium. A system can be written as a matrix, to model multiple organisms this results in a block matrix. Each block can then be envisioned to model a certain gene pool that corresponds to an organism. Interactions between these gene pools can be modelled by adding an interaction block to the off diagonal blocks of the block matrix. Later on this linear model is improved with a non-­negative constraint, concentrations are after all non-­negative, which results in a new nonlinear model. Properties of both models are found by studying the distribution of the eigenvalues. Girko’s law and Wigner’s law are two important laws from random matrix theory, that help with the determination of the eigenvalues of a random interaction matrix. For the linear model it was found that the distribution of the eigenvalues is influenced by the entries of the block matrix and by the strength of the connection between the block matrices. Once the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors are found, the solution is deterministic. For the nonlinear model it was found that the distribution of the eigenvalues are influenced in a similar way as the linear model. But due the non­negative constraint, the stability of the system is not deterministic. The system can be partly asymptotically stable, partly stable and partly unstable for different time windows. It is living on the ‘edge of chaos’.","Interacting Gene Networks; Random Matrix Theory; Biological Model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

If left unchanged, the network will suffer from voltage violations caused by the increase of electric vehicle (EV) charging, energy generation by Photovoltaics (PV) panels and the phasing out of natural gas. Typically, cables are reinforced to cope with increased demand, but upgrading large parts of the Dutch electricity network is expensive. By not expanding the network, the remaining capacity of the network needs to be optimally used. This situation encourages the switch to an active distribution network, which opens up a new possibility for voltage management and optimal use of the distribution network. <br/>One of these prospects is the multi-port converter. This converter combines the usually separate converters of EV, PV and battery energy storage system (BESS) to a single entity. Combined with an optimal charging algorithm, the energy management system (EMS) of the multi-port converter decides when to (dis)charge the BESS and EV, using a moving horizon window. By controlling the previously nondispatchable loads, flexibility is generated on the demand side. Using a network of multi-port converters on its own is insufficient to cope with voltage problems in the distribution network due to the overlap of (dis)charging schedules and lack of communication. <br/>A Voltage management system (VMS) is used to coordinate the EMS of all the multi-port converters in the network to stay within the voltage range. This controller aims to prevent and correct voltage problems by varying the input or output of the multi-port converter. The prevention is done by actively reserving energy and changing prices to encourage changes in the (dis)charge schedule of the multi-port converter. The correction of the voltage profile is achieved by active power (Volt-Watt), reactive power (Volt-VAR)and apparent power (Volt-VA) control. <br/>Due to the stochastic nature of solar energy and load demand, the actual battery capacity and voltage profile may deviate. To combat the change in battery capacity, a reference tracker is installed. For the change in voltage, a real-time controller is implemented, used for rapid response. These controllers are placed inside the EMS under the optimal charging algorithm. <br/>The main focus of this thesis is to design a control structure, which can be gradually deployed, to prevent and correct voltage problems in a low voltage feeder in various time scales. By using multiple intertwined controllers, the proposed hierarchical control structure achieves fast operation, prevention and correction of the voltage profile over an extended period. <br/>The simulations have been validated on the IEEE European low voltage test feeder. Results demonstrate that a limited number of multi-port converters is needed to keep the voltage profile within limits. The various correction methods have been tested for effectiveness to correct voltage deviations. Both active (Volt-Watt) and apparent (Volt-VA) power show capabilities of voltage control. Furthermore, the real-time controller is capable of removing individual load usage from the network and prevent voltage violations caused by uncontrolled PV and EV.","Optimisation; Voltage control; Multi-port converter; Energy management system; Volt-VA; Volt-VAR; Volt-Watt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work investigates how future big data frameworks should be designed such that they facilitate transparent and efficient integration with FPGA accelerators in the context of SQL workloads. Three big data frameworks are accelerated to answer this question. These implementations offload the evaluation of a regular expression filter to Tidre, an FPGA-based regular expression matcher. First, Dremio is accelerated to obtain a 1750x speedup of the filter operator. Second, Dask is accelerated and a speedup of 92x is achieved for the same operator. Lastly, an accelerated version of Dask distributed is implemented. This implementation is deployed in a cluster environment to attain an end-to-end speedup of 3.6x as well as a reduction of the total cost per query by 23%. It is identified that query exploration phases could be used to increase the impact of existing FPGA kernels. In addition, it is found that the batch size of batch-processing frameworks has a significant impact on the performance of FPGA accelerated big data frameworks in distributed setups. Tuning this batch size can increase end-to-end query throughput up to 2.1x. Finally, future big data frameworks should make use of hardware-friendly and language-independent in-memory formats such as Apache Arrow.

However, most biomaterials used for bioprinting are incapable of representing the complexity of native extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, a novel cartilage specific bioink has been developed with tyramine modified hyaluronic acid (THA) and decellularized ECM (dECM) of AC for threedimensional bioprinting, combining the printable qualities of THA with AC dECM to create an optimized microenvironment. First, the influence of increasing concentrations of<br/>AC dECM on the rheological and printability properties was assessed. Next, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were incorporated into bioinks composed of 2.5% w/v THA and AC dECM (0.0%-1.0% w/v). The THA-AC dECM bioinks have been successfully bioprinted into stable scaffolds with viable cells and were cultured for 28 days in chondrogenic differentiation medium. Subsequently, the effect of combining AC dECM with THA was evaluated by measuring the cell viability, cell differentiation and AC tissue deposition. The ink compositions with AC dECM (0.5% and 1.0% w/v) caused an increase in ink viscosity, yield stress and damping factor compared to the THA ink, but still showed shear thinning behavior and provided good printability. Spread cell morphology was observed for the scaffolds with addition of AC dECM compared to AC dECM free control with only THA, indicating enhanced cell adhesion to the hydrogel network. Moreover, a higher production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) was observed for the scaffolds where AC dECM was added. The THA and AC dECM bioink composition showed promising results for AC tissue engineering and warrants further research into the development of bioinks with tissue-specific inductive properties.","bioprinting; bioink; articular cartilage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The underlying infrastructure for this digital transformation is provided by telecommunication companies through their future technologies. Future telecommunication technologies consist on a variety of raw materials, amongst some are considered to be critical. Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) are associated with a high economic importance, as well as severe supply risks. The goal of this research was to firstly identify which CRMs are contained in future telecommunication technologies and secondly how the demand for them will develop until 2030 or 2050 under slow, fast and full rollout scenarios and compared to current supply levels. Based on that, thirdly strategic choices for telecommunication companies on creating a resilient supply were given. The design of the study was build up in the respective order and was based on a case study research for a Dutch telecommunication service provider and expert interviews with technology suppliers and research institutes in the network. The focus technologies included 5G Technologies, Photonics, Edge Computing and Quantum Technologies. The general finding was that a broad range of CRMs could be identified in the network equipment of these technologies, with the CRMs Erbium, Gallium, Germanium, Phosphorous, Silicon and Titanium having the highest frequency of occurrence. Amongst them, Erbium has also very high supply risks. When looking at the demand development for CRMs contained in future telecommunication technologies, an 8-fold increase under a slow rollout scenario until 2030, a 15-fold increase under a fast rollout and a 16-fold increase under the full rollout scenario could be identified. The demand by far comes mostly from 5G Technologies. When comparing the future demand with current supply, specifically 14 CRMs could be identified where demand will exceed supply: Beryllium, Natural Graphite, Dysprosium, Gallium, Germanium, Magnesium, Neodymium, Palladium, Ruthenium, Tantalum, Terbium, Titanium, Thulium and Yttrium. From this is could be concluded that if supply cannot meet demand, the future rollout of these technologies is at stake resulting in company’s corporate strategies being at risk and thus the future of the telecommunication industry and a global digital transformation. In order to tackle these bottlenecks of demand and supply, there are strategic choices companies can chose for creating supply chain resilience for material criticality. Supply risks mitigating strategies included the design of technologies after eco-design principles, increase recycling rates, investigate into substitution potential, diversity supply geographically as well as ownership based, avoid conflict minerals by responsible sourcing, stockpiling, lobbying for new mining activities, foster cross-chain collaboration and redesign whole business models after circular economy principles. All of these strategies can be strategic choices for telecommunication companies and are advised to be considered at the company level.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The comparison with experimental data shows that the original formulation of the model underestimates the power output. The model does not take inertial forces into account and highly simplifies the reel-out flight path. In this work, these assumptions are critically reviewed and their impact on the simulation results assessed. <br/><br/>The effect of inertial forces is analytically described for a helical flight path with fixed turning radius around the downwind axis. The derived analytical solution for this flight path verifies the formulation of inertial forces in spherical coordinates proposed in earlier studies. The proposed equations are modified and added to the QSM. Both, the analytically developed set of equations and the QSM with added inertia are compared for the helical flight case. It is observed that at larger cone angles where the tether length is rather short, but the turning radius is large, the inertial effect increases the tether force and the power output. With small cone angles this effect reverses. Based on the example case, the impact of the inertial effects on the output power computed with the QSM is limited to 1-2% for lightweight soft kites.<br/><br/>In the original formulation of the QSM the figure-of-eight maneuvers are not resolved. Instead, the tether is reeled out at representative constant values for the elevation, azimuth and course angles. QSM output based on real flight path coordinates is used as a benchmark to calculate the accuracy of reel-out path simplifications. The power output error of resolving reel-out flight with constant angles is on average 4.1% when compared to the reference simulations. An alternative flight path representation is developed, fitting a known figure-of-eight, lemniscate, to measured asymmetric reel-out flight paths. By flying the fitted figure in the QSM, the output power error caused by this path representation is estimated to be only 1.7% in comparison to the reference simulations. It is recommended to use this fitting method based on a class function/shape function transformation technique (CST), to parametrize the reel-out flight path, despite the added complexity.<br/><br/>The study has shown that the accuracy improvement by including the inertial effects in the QSM is marginal if the model is limited to lightweight soft wing simulation. As a follow-up study the inertial effects should be tested with bigger kites and heavier rigid-wing systems. The adjusted CST fitting method together with the inertial equations enable these maneuvering flight simulations in the QSM.<br","Airborne Wind Energy; Wind Energy; Quasi-Steady Model; Parameterization; Inertial Forces","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This project is set up with the Erasmus MC and was initiated to elaborate on their current service called the Healthcare Monitor (HM). The HM is a structure of electronic patient-reported outcome measures filled in by patients before every follow-up consultation. The answers are shown in a dashboard to the treating physician and used during patient consultations (Dronkers et al., 2020). What the current HM lacks however, is insight for the patients themselves into their health and addressing their concerns in between the consultations. Therefore this project aims to develop an additional service to the HM that empowers patients in between consults whilst also providing the doctor with a more frequent and realistic insight into their wellbeing. Patient empowerment can ultimately lead to a better quality of life. In this project it is viewed as a process that can be influenced through design. Therefore an inspirational model is created in this thesis that designers can use when designing for patient empowerment. HNC patients in their follow-up need to deal with a lot of different physical and psychosocial side effects (Aguilar et al., 2017). I investigate their concerns using the double loop method of Jung (2021). I analyze the community context through a computational analysis of online cancer community platforms. The patient context is investigated through a focus group with 6 care professionals and interviews with 9 ex-patients. 4 main concerns are found. Patients want to: •Be prepared for what they can expect and do •Have the overview of how they are doing •Be supported when they have a doubt •Have a relevant service for them The model for patient empowerment and patient concerns are combined to create a design vision. The vision is to provide patients with an overview that enables them to gain more control in dealing with issues that concern them. This overview was designed in a prototype application through 3 main elements; a logbook with previous experiences, a possibility to track current experiences and an overview of expected experiences based on peer experiences. This prototype was tested by 6 ex-patients who found value in the low threshold way to contact others, find trustworthy information and track their wellbeing. They valued peer experience exchange and better insight into themselves as this can ultimately lead to more reassurance in between consults. Based on this test further improvements, suggestions for the next steps and possibilities to scale the concept are presented. When developing an app for patient empowerment the Erasmus MC should; •Include peer patient experiences •Provide the patient with insight into their wellbeing over time •Integrate tools and databases in one complete overview For designing in the field of value based healthcare, this project stresses the importance of incorporating experiences of the community and using a multidisciplinary approach.","Patient Empowerment; eHealth Intervention; Healthcare Design; Head and Neck Cancer; Peer support; Value based health care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

Microorganisms use their flagella to reorientate or generate movement in search for nutrients or gradients in light intensity. These microscopic swimmers are able to adapt their swimming gait to the circumstances they encounter. Motile microorganisms such as the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are used as a source of inspiration in biomimetics and used in biological, pharmaceutical and industrial applications to produce for example biofuels or medication. The fluids in which these microscopic cells swim are often of complex rheology, containing macromolecules such as synthetic polymers of proteins, which influences the<br/>motile behaviour of these cells. The motile behaviour is mostly studied in a quasi 2D environment which might be different from the behavior in a more natural 3D environment. Therefore, our aim is to analyse the motility of microorganisms in a 3D environment in fluids with different rheological properties.<br/><br/>To gain more insight in the influence of rheology on the motility of microorganisms, the model microorganism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is observed in fluids of various levels of elasticity. An in-house 3D microscopic setup, consisting of 4 LaVision sCMOS cameras, is used to observe the motility of the cells. A Lagrangian tracking algorithm is used to detect and follow many individual motile cells simultaneously. We focused on the velocity of the cells, their helical motions (radius and pitch) which they use to scan their surroundings, and their flagellar beating frequency. <br/><br/>We observed a velocity and pitch independent of the Deborah number, whereas decreasing values for these metrics were found in Newtonian fluids of equal viscosity. The radius of the helical motion showed to be independent of elasticity or viscosity. The beating frequency of the cells shows to be constant in a viscoelastic fluid independent on the viscosity or elasticity, whereas it tends to decrease in Newtonian fluids of increasing viscosity. <br/><br/>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii might have developed a more efficient swimming gait to propel themselves in a viscoelastic fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid, especially in high viscosities. Moreover, we argued that motile microorganisms that are allowed to swim freely in a 3D confinement, show a different motile behaviour than when their motility is constricted by a quasi 2D plane. To validate these findings we recommend to perform experiments both in quasi 2D and 3D, while using the same cell culture.","Rheology; Viscoelasticity; Flagellar motility; Cell kinematics; Particle Tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

In order to achieve this, one of the components which needs to be improved are the amount of malfunctions of Schiphol’s sewage pumping stations. These are caused by all types of obstructions, but especially towels and wipes. So far, BAM’s technically oriented solutions have not shown sufficient improvement. This was the base for this graduation project, in which I took a designerly, human oriented approach into solving the obstructions. I have tried to solve the obstructions at the source: the passengers at the airport. The goal of this project is to design a behavioural intervention, to prevent passengers from flushing waste down the toilets in the first instance. After reviewing research done into behavioural change and toilet design, as well as an evaluation of the stakeholders involved, a user research was set up to identify the behaviour which causes the flushing of waste and the reasons behind this. This was done in the form of exploratory interviews among a population representative of the possible visitors passing by at the airport. With the initial research, five design directions were established as a basis for ideation: signage, waste bins, towel dispensers, removing opportunity and feedback. A myriad of solutions were combined into an initial concept proposal, to be refined into a final, two-part concept: 1. A design of a new, user friendly and hygiene oriented waste bin, to be implemented in the individual toilet cubicles. The availability and user oriented design needs to make throwing waste into the bin more attractive than flushing it. 2. A repositioning of the cleaning personnel, where they are more in the forefront in a host-like manner. This will establish a connection with the passengers to give them a feeling of responsibility over the cleanliness of the toilet area, as well as a feeling of being watched to ensure the passenger behaves better. Combining these two interventions should trigger the passenger enough to lower the amount of waste being flushed and eventually the number of obstructions in the pumps. To confirm whether this concept actually achieves the intended behavioural change, a second user test was performed, in which the user group gave their thoughts on the new situation with the help of a use scenario to help them imagine themselves in this situation. With the user evaluation, as well as in-depth interviews with the three main stakeholders, BAM, Schiphol and cleaning company Vebego, the concept was optimised for implementation. The concept and its implementation came together in the final strategy, which consists of a detailed plan for a six month pilot to evaluate the effects in real life and the possible definite implementation of the concept after that.","behavioural change; wastewater pumps; design; passengers; Schiphol; waste bin; cleaner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (graduation committee); Brinkgreve, R.B.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For supporting Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT), monopiles are currently the most common foundations. The role of a foundation is to transfer safely the loading to the ground. The wind and the wave loads are considered cyclic because they repetitively apply on the OWT. The North Sea is sand dominated in many areas. During cyclic loading, permanent strains develop in the surrounding soil while the soil stiffness and strength are irreversibly affected. Through time, the accumulation of strains can lead to the soil failure. Thus, assessing the behaviour and stability of monopiles under cyclic loading is essential. To model the response of monopiles under lateral loading, the traditional design procedure is the use of p-y curves that express the lateral soil resistance in function of the pile deflection. The p-y curves are nowadays recommended to be calibrated on FE models. The Stiffness Degradation Method (SDM) of Achmus et al. (2009) is a numerical strategy that assesses the behaviour of a monopile under cyclic loading. The method estimates the cyclically degraded stiffness based on the results of a static analysis. The soil stiffness is degraded based on a semi-empirical power law that accounts for the number of loading cycles, the stresses in the soil after the static analysis and two model parameters calibrated on cyclic triaxial tests. The SDM was successfully implemented in PLAXIS 3D via a practical routine coded in Python and the use of soil clusters around the pile. The soil stiffness is degraded by updating the soil material within the clusters. The study model was verified by comparing results with the published reference system of Kuo (2008) for two piles with embedded length to pile diameter ratios of 2.7 and 5.3. The results indicate that the study model provides a stiffer pile-soil response than the reference model because the soil stiffness is overestimated. The degraded stiffness overestimation is attributed to the initial stiffness mismatch and the use of soil clusters. The impact on the short pile is greater than on the long pile because the short pile opposes less resistance to the loading and is thus more affected by the stiffness difference. The study model was validated against three 1-g pile tests for homogeneous uniform and multi-layered dense sand. The numerical results are in agreement with the test data. In the absence of cyclic triaxial tests, the two model parameters were directly calibrated on the pile head displacement of the experiment. The two model parameters have a significant impact on the stiffness degradation. Thus, model parameters from literature were classified from the highest to the smallest estimation of pile lateral displacement. The results of codified and published approaches (DNV-GL-0126; Duhrkop, 2009; Garnier, 2013) were compared with the results of the study model. The study model and the method of Garnier (2013) are in agreement. They both account for the loading amplitude, the number of cycles and the pile geometry. The codified procedure and the method of Duhrkop (2009) estimate higher lateral displacement compared to the study model. Finally, the 1D model was successfully calibrated with the highest displacement estimate of the study model. With this procedure, the 1D model accounts for the number of cycles, the pile geometry and the loading amplitude. The study model provides a less conservative approach for determining the pile lateral displacement under cyclic loading. The calibration of the 1D model on the pile deflection curves of the study model is a promising procedure which will require further research.","Cyclic loading; Monopile; Sand; Stiffness degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

In particular, its sub-field of modeling the dynamics of order books is an interesting field, since it translates into modeling the behaviour of traders on the market. Most of the models proposed in this field can be divided into stochastic models or machine learning models. The problem with the former ones is that they often make assumptions that do not propagate to practical applications, while the problem with the latter is that the models are often incomprehensible, even though they yield good results. This work tries to combine both of those fields to maintain the transparency of stochastic models and the accuracy of machine learning models. We target the limit order book, which is a book used in financial markets to place orders for financial securities in. It is a challenge to both generate realistic order books and predict them as well, since the model should be able to understand the underlying dynamics of order books to do this. We present a deep-learning-based model that is able to generate order books, through the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) like architecture, and is able to predict order books using a similar architecture for the generator. Our models are able to outperform traditional generative and predictive models in both instances, while it remains transparent in its calculation: it is still able to extract useful and interpretable features from the underlying data set. These features, like the probabilities for up or down movements, or stagnations, or the rates at which the variables within the order book move, can be used by traders or algorithms to make sense out of the predictions. Traders can, for example, ask themselves whether the extracted features are representative of the analyzed asset and can, through this question, build additional confidence in the model. Another use case could be to utilize those features as inputs to other models.

This compositional simulation framework is feasible for describing complex physical phenomenon with high nonlinearity because detached functional operators have been developed to release the calculation load while maintaining a high degree of stability and accuracy. The main contributions and innovations are shown below: i. A two-phase and three-component chemical flooding mathematical model with some reasonable assumptions was developed to investigate the enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) mechanism of polymer flooding. A finite volume discretization scheme and a fully implicit method (FIM) are implemented to approximate the conservation equations. The OBL approach is used to reduce the complexity of the simulation framework. The correctness of the model is verified by comparison with analytical model. ii. In addition to shear thinning effect, polymer viscoelasticity has also been taken into account. This mathematical model is able to handle high shear rates during field displacement as well as low to medium shear rates in laboratory experiments. iii. A new model for porosity reduction caused by polymer adsorption is formulated. The effect of polymer concentration on the effective pore volume is incorporated in numerical simulations based on Langmuir adsorption model.","Polymer flooding; numerical simulation; Non-newtonian fluids; Rheological properties; Polymer retention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Historically, offshore wind farms have been developed in the North Sea, but nowadays wind farms are expanded to other regions such as North America and Asia, which are seismic prone.<br/>In the design of Rotor-Nacelle-Assembly (RNA) and support structure for offshore wind farms, the number of design positions is reduced by using representative design positions (i.e. clustering). The number of designs is directly related to the efficiency of the design work, so it is worthwhile to minimize it by wisely selecting the representative position. However, such a clustering methodology has not been systematically developed in seismic design due to the limited number of projects and researches in seismic regions.<br/>As for seismic analysis, there are several challenges to develop an efficient clustering strategy. First, higher (and multiple) vibration modes are excited in the system consisting of the wind turbine itself in interaction with the soil. Second, blade vibration (and blade-tower coupling effect) has a significant role in the output forces. Third, energy intake from the seismic ground motion is dependent on the position due to soil amplification. Considering the problem statement above, this research develops a clustering strategy for seismic analysis to optimize the design process on RNA and support structure for offshore wind farms. To achieve this goal, as a first step, a simplified calculation model is created to efficiently carry out the sensitivity studies. A combination of point masses with Euler-Bernoulli beam is used for RNA model while lumped mass at the tower top is conventionally used in past researches, which allows to properly represent the blade-tower coupling effect contrary to most of past researches. Considering modal participation mass, higher vibration modes are truncated, and principle vibration modes are detected, which improves the computational efficiency. Both the frequency domain method and the response spectrum method are developed and compared with proven software, BhawC, to verify their accuracy. Then, a sensitivity study is carried out by using the developed model. Through the sensitivity study, the system property is approximately quantified as a form of ”scaling factor”. Combining the scaling factor with acceleration response spectrum, the maximum bending moment for an arbitrary position (i.e. arbitrary water depth, soil condition and bedrock depth) can be quickly estimated. Subsequently, the positions in a wind farm are sorted into groups with similar load trends based on the estimated bending moment; this is the basis of the clustering strategy proposed in this thesis. Finally, the strategy is applied to virtual wind farms and its applicability is verified. Although it shows some errors in the estimation of the maximum bending moment itself, the accuracy is considered satisfactory to detect the most loaded position (i.e. design representative position) and categorize the positions which have similar load trend, which are one of the main requirements for a reliable clustering methodology. Also, the strategy is applied to more realistic soil condition, such as inhomogeneous soil and its applicability and limitation are investigated.","offshore wind turbine; seismic analysis; clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

To address this issue and towards a low-cost NN hardware realization, in this thesis, we: a) thoroughly investigate the impact of RRAM faults on the inference accuracy of RRAM-based BNNs, and b) propose three complementary fault-tolerance techniques to mitigate the impact of RRAM faults on the BNN's accuracy. These techniques are namely: a) a fault-tolerant activation function, b) a redundancy and weight range adjustment scheme and c) a retraining technique. Evaluation results compiled on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed techniques can improve the inference accuracy in the presence of RRAM faults by up to 20%, 40%, and 80%, respectively.

However, this requires the current approach of fulfilling the energy supply and demand to be drastically changed over the next decade. Failure to do so will result in a prolonged energy transition which ultimately results in the failure of realising decarbonisation targets by 2030. This is particularly important because the development of alternative energy sources that is partly necessary for the realisation of the energy transition, tend to have long lead times and are not straightforward to implement. <br/><br/>Transition management in general, and Strategic Niche Management literature specifically are in line with the developments and changes that are currently observed in the energy transition. Nevertheless, a major challenge lies ahead of us in order to empirically validate the partly descriptive and partly prescriptive components of transition management literature. Therefore, the objective of this research can be described as: elaborate, generalize and verify the barriers that lead to procrastination during the pilot- and scale-up phases of green hydrogen pilots. Additionally capture the influence of SNM on these barriers in order to realise energy transition ambitions. <br/><br/>A single case-study – concerning the green hydrogen case in the Netherlands – was adopted to study the state of green hydrogen technology and the potential of SNM literature to aid the development of pilots and their scale-up.<br/><br/>The study showed that a multitude of barriers lead to procrastination of pilot- and scale-up developments with regard to green hydrogen technology. The top five consists of Legislation and regulations, directionality failures, corporate internal factors, lack of subsidy and lack of market demand and supply. Most of the failure mechanisms that were mentioned by respondents are validated and described in SNM literature. However, the theory falls short in naming corporate internal factors as an important reason for impeding the development of the green hydrogen technology. <br/><br/>Furthermore, no distinction is made between the investment decision framework for the scalability of green hydrogen technology and regular investment decisions. The scale-up phase however poses many uncertainties and therefore most definitely results in negative business cases when assessed with regular investment decision frameworks.

SNM theory is however a descriptive theory, rather than prescriptive, however, the energy transition requires literature to aid practitioners with practical guidelines.<br","Innovation Systems; Failures Framework; Transition management; Strategic Niche Management; Green hydrogen; Pilot projects; Take-off phase; Procrastination phase; Business drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Tuluk, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","br/>Piezoelectric materials are capable of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. These materials have been at the forefront of technological innovations ever since their emergence in the late 19th century. Piezoelectrics have found their niche in communication, automobile, aerospace, and several other industries relying on electromechanical systems. The excellent piezoelectric properties of materials like lead zirconium titanate (PZT) have made them a popular candidate in the production of actuators, sensors, and transducers. However, PZT was classified as a hazardous material in 2003 by the European Union due to the toxic nature of its lead oxide precursor. Efforts have been made by the scientific community to shift to more environmentally friendly, lead-free, piezoelectric systems. Bismuth, sodium, and potassium have garnered much attention as substitutes for lead due to their non-toxic nature. Piezoceramics such as barium titanate (BT), bismuth ferrite (BFO), potassium sodium niobate (KNN), and potassium sodium lithium niobate (KNLN) have become increasingly popular.<br/><br/>Bismuth ferrite’s (BFOs) high piezoelectric Curie temperature (825 °C) coupled with its lead-free nature makes it one of the more interesting PZT alternatives. However, the synthesis of phase pure BFO is difficult due to the presence of parasitic iron and bismuth-rich secondary phases. The electrical conductivity of BFO, which is considerably higher than that of PZT, is also an issue. The presence of a high electrical leakage current is generally attributed to the defects and oxygen vacancies in bismuth ferrite. Through doping, it is possible to control the density of these free moving charges and oxygen vacancies. In this thesis, we use the method of solid-state reaction synthesis with subsequent sintering for the preparation of doped BFO samples. This work aims to develop highly polarizable doped BFO systems with low leakage characteristics which could potentially be utilized for high-temperature sensing applications.<br/><br/>An enhancement in polarization was observed by doping BFO with trace amounts of cobalt. The incorporation of titanium into BFO led to the reduction of conductivity and caused an improvement in the leakage characteristics. A co-doped system of cobalt and titanium was further explored to combine the positive characteristics of both individual dopants. The result was a highly polarizable system (0.25-0.25 at% Co-Ti) with low conductivity and excellent leakage characteristics. A solid solution system of BFO with strontium titanate (STO) was also explored. The 30 at% STO system showed extremely large values of piezoelectric charge constant. The thesis was concluded by performing some high-temperature measurements on the 0.25-0.25 at% Co-Ti and 30 at% STO systems. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

Therefore, the concept of four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting has been introduced that allows for the fabrication of scaffolds that can transform in time. The extracellular matrix stiffness is one component involved in the in vivo dynamic microenvironment of tissues such as cartilage. Nonetheless, the implementation of dynamic stiffness in in vitro 3D cell culture has not been intensively investigated yet, in particular not in 4D bioprinting for cartilage applications. Therefore, the aim of this study is to create a method for the temporal stiffening of a human mesenchymal stem cell-laden scaffold in 4D bioprinting for cartilage applications. To do this, inks made of tyramine-modified hyaluronic acid (THA), and THA combined with sodium alginate (SA) (THA-SA) were studied on their ability to stiffen days after being printed through photocrosslinking or ionic crosslinking (secondary crosslinking). The method that generated the greatest increase in stiffness was evaluated on the effect of time on stiffening and the effect of stiffening on the swelling behaviour and the internal structure of the scaffold. Next, the 4D printing method was translated to 4D bioprinting and the influence of the temporal stiffening method on the mechanical properties, cell viability, gene expression and matrix deposition was determined. This study demonstrated that in 4D printing, secondary photocrosslinking of THA and secondary ionic crosslinking of THA-SA resulted into scaffolds with a significant increase in stiffness. The method for secondary ionic crosslinking of THA-SA (2.5% w/v THA, 1.5% w/v SA) scaffolds achieved the largest increase in stiffness and was able to temporally stiffen at day 1, 3 or 5. This increase in stiffness was associated with a decrease in swelling ratio and a maintained internal microstructure. For the translation to 4D bioprinting, the method was adjusted for cell culture conditions and resulted in an increase in stiffness. However, the stiffening was not yet reproducible and therefore optimalization of the method will be required. Nevertheless, in the first week of cell culture, the bioprinted scaffolds achieved high cell viability and an equal cell distribution. At day 7, the gene for collagen type II was not expressed and cartilage-specific matrix deposition was not detected. With future studies focusing on optimizing the introduced 4D bioprinting protocol, this novel method for the ionic secondary crosslinking of THA-SA may function as a platform for studying the effect of temporal matrix stiffening on the behaviour of the embedded cells in fundamental research or as a stimulus for tissue formation in tissue engineering.","4D bioprinting; Mesenchymal stem cells; Cartilage; Hydrogel; Dynamic microenvironment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jain, A. (graduation committee); Metrikine, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","An important subject in the research on the behaviour of railway structures is the validation of numerical models by means of in-track measurements. Many forms of track measurements have taken place all over the world, mainly in the sense of strain and acceleration measurements, but a more unexplored area is that of the direct measurement of stresses in the ballast. <br/>The aim of this research is to find the best way to equip a railway sleeper with measuring instruments in order to use it for validation of computational models. The sleeper must be able to measure the the vertical velocity of the sleeper as well as the normal stresses on the ballast-sleeper interface over time.<br/><br/>In order to predict the quantities to be measured, a finite element model was build for this research with the Kratos open source software package. The model comprises one single sleeper on top of a volume of ballast, both in solid elements. A dynamic load was applied vertically on top of the sleeper to simulate the passing of a double axle bogie. Linear elastic springs were fixed on top of the sleeper to represent force of the rail pulling the sleeper back to its initial place. <br/>In order to analyse the effect of hanging sleepers, interface elements were used in between the ballast and the sleeper to simulate hanging gaps. The idea is that these elements transfer no stresses when the surfaces are physically separated, and adopt Mohr-Coulomb criteria as soon as the surfaces approach each other. This method turned out to be very difficult to implement, despite numerous discussion with the software engineer it was not possible to script this in the FE software in such a way that all calculations converged without any errors. <br/>During the modelling of the sleeper, it was found that the forces on the sleeper are highly dependent on the resistance of the rail. The rails have such a high bending stiffness that they hardly show any curvature over the length of only a few meters, so the sag of the rail is mainly dependent on the behavior of the surrounding sleepers. It was concluded that, to get a good picture of the behaviour, it is not sufficient to model only one individual sleeper, but it is necessary to look at a larger part of the railway track in order to involve the coupling between the sleepers. <br/>The results from the computational model were used to determine the magnitude range and the frequency domain of the values to be measured, in order to be able to select the right measuring instruments. The results were also used to select the right positions for the sensors on the sleeper. Due to the constraints described above, a certain margin of uncertainty has been adopted.<br/><br/>The vertical speed of the sleeper is best measured with accelerometers, the large amount of previous applications of this type of measurement has shown that this measurement works well and will not lead to problems. <br/>It was considered to use pressure cells for the measurement of interface stresses, though this device turned out to be difficult to fix at the sleeper and it gives very little information on the distribution of stresses. It was concluded that the best way to measure the ballast-sleeper interface stresses is by using the matrix based tensile surface sensor (MBTSS). This instrument is able to capture the stress distribution on a surface over time, by measuring the electrical current flow through a matrix of conductive lines, the current is resisted when certain forces are applied on the surface. Tekscan is a manufacturer that offers a wide range of MBTSS types, including sensors previously used in railway measurements. A certain protection will be needed to protect the sensor from being damaged by the ballast particles. <br/>Previous applications of MBTSS in railway structures showed the calibration of the sensor to be very difficult. This presumably has to do with the way the stresses are distributed over the sensor surface. Since the stresses of the ballast are often compressed to very small contact points, it should be made sure the stresses will not get lost between the sensels, that are the points on the surface where the stress magnitudes are measured. The advice is to cover the MBTSS with an under sleeper pad, this is a relatively stiff mat that, in addition to offering protection to the sensors, also spreads the ballast forces. Laboratory tests will have to be performed in advance of the field measurement to test whether a correct calibration is possible. It can not be made sure that a fully successful calibration method will be found and therefor additional measurements are recommended for a validation for the stress magnitudes. A first validation can be found by equating the sum of the vertical forces with the mass times the acceleration of the sleeper. To find the sum of the vertical forces, the load on top of the sleeper at the rail-sleeper connection, has to be measured as well. This can be realized by placing MBTSS between the baseplate of the rail and the sleeper. Similar measurements described in literature proved this type of measurement to be feasible. Furthermore, the result of the acceleration measurement will have to be used here as well. A second validation can be performed by determining the moment distribution over the length of the sleeper, this can be conformed to the magnitude and distribution of the vertical stresses on the sleeper. The most reliable way to perform this validation is by using fiber measurements to find the moment distribution over the whole of the length. The most important positions over the length of the sleeper are under the rails and in the middle of the sleeper, because the peaks in the moment distribution are expected here based on the computational model calculations.<br","Instrumented sleeper; Field measurements; Railway tracks; Train-track interaction; Transition zone; Railway track modelling; Dynamic monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

Our qualitative results showed that head shape was<br/>registered well by both the conventional and the deep learning registration<br/>method, while the deep learning method performed better regarding<br/>registration of the ventricles. Quantitatively, our results showed that<br/>white matter structures were registered well (Dice: 0.70-0.81). However,<br/>regarding registration of the cortical brain regions, both methods resulted<br/>in a sub-optimal accuracy (Dice: 0.45-0.63). In general, the approaches<br/>of using T2-weighted infant atlases or T1-weighted adult atlases outperformed<br/>the alternative approaches. In conclusion, we obtained the best<br/>registration result using the deep learning approach, probably as prior<br/>spatial information is incorporated in the training process. In addition,<br/>we showed that infant atlases based on T2-weighted scans lead to the<br/>best results in registration of infant scans.","Image Registration; Craniosynostosis; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

The stochastic model we use is an extension of the mean­-field voter model where we include a selection factor. In the model individuals with two different types of alleles in two different ecosystems are considered. The model is a stochastic Markov process that describes interactions of individuals with each­other over time. This means that the ratio of individuals with certain alleles stochastically drifts over time. The main goal of this bachelor thesis is investigate whether is it possible that individuals with two different types of alleles can coexist (a stable equi­librium) in two populations. We do this by taking the limit of this Markov process such that we can show convergence to ordinary differential equations. By studying these differential equations we ob­tain results: vector fields with equilibrium points. We conclude that, under certain conditions and with a selection advantage, coexistence of individuals with two different alleles in two different ecosystems is possible (see Section 4.4) in the form of a stable equilibrium. Furthermore we claim that the typical time to absorption, reaching an absorbing state where all the individuals have the same allele, of the two­-dimensional mean­-field voter model with selection scales exponentially with the system size.","Markov Process; genetics; Differential Equations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

A scenario-model framework was used to assess the socio-economic and environmental impacts on the construction sector, as a result of CLT construction in general and as a result of different timber material origins. The central research question is: “What are the impacts of a transition to a housing sector in PZH that is for 20% based on CLT? and could regional CLT production offer socio-economically and environmentally sustainable solutions?”. The outcomes from the scenario analysis show that regional production of CLT is beneficial from a socio-economic perspective, while simultaneously being environmentally sustainable. The CLT required to reach the CLT implementation aim in PZH is sufficient to operate a price-competitive CLT industry. On paper, national timber flows are sufficient to produce this CLT and if national timber flows are not adequately available sawn timber should be imported from other European countries. The most important action points are related to increasing the domestic timber stock, ensuring high-grade application of timber, standardizing and bundling of demand for CLT construction, and ensuring adequate carbon policies to create a financially level playing field.","CLT; Circular Economy; Timber Construction; Bio-Based Construction; Housing; Sustainable housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Although not a new topic, there is a noticeable lack of research on how existing cohousing projects, that were established decades ago, have developed in practice. Among other counties in northern Europe, the Netherlands experienced a rise of cohousing communities in the early nineteen-eighties, many of which still exist today. One example for this is the project of Centraal Wonen Delft, which was chosen as a case study for this thesis. Completed in 1981, it was part of a larger national movement called Centraal Wonen (CW) and was particularly experimental in its layout and spatial organization in the context of that time.<br/>As society shifts continuosly over time, the design intentions of CW Delft might no longer comply with the lifestyle of its residents fourty years after completion. To test this hypothesis the author conducted interviews with multiple residents and two of the founders. Further, the results of qualitative research methods including field notes, observations and photographic documentation were compared to historical documents, such as blueprints and images. The results showed that, while many of the initial intentions of collaborative living do not match the outcomes observed today, CW Delft as a whole can yet be seen as a successful project that is home to a thriving and diverse community to this day.<br/>The observations suggest that, together with its residents, the project was able to naturally evolve in time, particularly when the design of shared spaces was not too strongly attached to a certain ideology. On this basis, the design of spatial concepts in cohousing should consider a flexible approach that is not tied to specific social structures.","cohousing; History; Thesis; collaborative housing; Dutch; Delft; centraal wonen; Evaluation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

For clients, the methodologies and processes applied by creative agencies often lack sufficient transparency; so much so that working together needs to be subject to a carefully thought-out process. While agencies recognize the importance of such transparency, the implementation of said transparency remains a difficult characteristic to master. <br/><br/>In order to address this gap, the work performed in this project puts forward a strategy to approach both creative agencies’ client relations and their work in such a way that lasting relationships can be built together with clients for optimal growth and building towards an agreed vision. <br/><br/>To develop this approach, the literature on Service Design was first reviewed followed by that on leadership and creative agency-client relationships: the first because it is the specialization at the Service Design agency Unplugged; and the second because to be an agent of change the creative must lead the way. The derived insights brought to light different typologies of clients, relationships and scopes. From this foundation, three impact levels were identified, namely: organizational transformation, organizational process and organizational service. <br/><br/>Conducting interviews at Unplugged, with its leadership and creatives and clients generated data and insights on the situation or problem space as it exists for the agency. The combination of the problem space and the knowledge gathered from the literature and the discussions with experts enabled the creation of a strategy playbook. The playbook is built around six principles for the day-to-day practice of and development of thriving client relationships. In order for the creatives to live by these, question cards were developed which correlate with the six principles to give creatives a reference point throughout their projects. Furthermore, to measure progress and maintain focus on project goals, two impact portfolio graphs are included. Finally, to ensure integration of the strategy playbook, a workshop has been designed for defining the purpose of the client interaction and applying the principles and tools by using them through fictitious scenarios.","Agency-client relationship; Strategy playbook; Relational Design; Design principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Hence, the need for controlling and quickly damping these vibrations are paramount. In this thesis, a novel reset-based bandpass filter that employs velocity feedback to achieve finite-time vibration suppression for damped systems is introduced. The development of this filter stems from an energy based mechanistic approach, providing a clear understanding of the underlying mechanism for the improved transient response, which also motivates the use of reset. Systematic tuning rules based on describing functions are also developed to enable design in the frequency-domain, thereby increasing its relevance for industries. Finally, the effectiveness of the Resetting Velocity Feedback framework for improved transient damping is demonstrated experimentally on a single degree-of-freedom flexure stage.

New in this field is the development of offshore floating solar systems, consisting of multiple interconnected platforms that are covered with PV panels. Besides satisfying the demand for electricity, these floating solar systems may have a beneficial impact on their wave environment. If waves are attenuated, down-wave shadow zones could be useful for other marine activities such as aquaculture or for the protection of a harbour, creating opportunities for offshore multi-use. The overall research objective of this study is to research the effect of an interconnected multi-body floating solar structure on the transmission of wave height. This was done using a scale model test and a numerical model, in a two-dimensional setting.<br/><br/>From the scale model tests, wave transmission showed to be highly dependent on the wave frequency, and thus the wavelength, of the incident waves. The floating solar system acts as a low pass filter: it lets the low-frequency waves pass through, whereas the waves with higher frequency are attenuated by the structure. This dependence is governed by the ratio between the incident wavelength and the length of the rigid platforms that the solar structure consists of, measured in parallel to the wave propagation direction. When the wavelengths were smaller than twice the length of a platform, waves were almost fully attenuated. Apart from the dependence on frequency, the basin test results also showed that the amount of wave attenuation increases linearly with the total length of the system, but only with a small slope. Furthermore, analysis of the reflected wave signal indicated that higher-order dissipative effects are likely needed to describe the decrease in transmission accurately, because the amount of wave energy that was reflected by the structure was limited.<br/><br/>A proof-of-concept for applying a linear numerical boundary element diffraction model to a fixed shallow solar structure was carried out. The wave surface elevation could be obtained, and these solutions were in accordance with the physical expectations. The results showed similar trends to the basin test results, but did not match quantitatively. This difference could lie in the model approach, where a two-dimensional transmission coefficient is determined from three-dimensional simulations. It could also be that the scattering effects alone cannot approximate the transmission behaviour of the system, because linear radiation effects or higher-order dissipation effects might be of similar importance and are therefore required for an accurate simulation. Radiation could be included in a linear diffraction model, but dissipation requires higher-order wave theory.<br/><br/>Regarding the multi-use context, a down-wave shadow zone can form if the incident waves are short enough. For the North Sea location considered, waves are typically longer than twice the length of the rigid platforms, thus the floating solar structure might not have the breakwater performance that is desired to protect other offshore activities.","Wave Attenuation; Wave-structure interaction; Boundary element method; Diffraction model; Model tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-31","","","","","",""

To suit the railway industry setting the model includes an inventory control strategy which envokes continuous monitoring and a reorder level as well as an order up-to level. Moreover a condition based maintenance (CBM) strategy is used with periodical inspections. These strategies are combined in a simulation model which assumes stochastic step-wise deterioration of parts as well as stochastic lifetime lengths to predict the expected cost per part per period. The three maintenance scheduling and spare inventory decisions to be minimised in terms of their resulting costs are 1) when to replace parts based on their condition, 2) when to buy new spare parts and 3) how many spare parts to procure at each order. These decisions are represented by values of the three decision variables: the CBM threshold <i>L_p</i>, the reorder level <i>s</i> and the order up-to level <i>S</i>. The minimisation of these decision variables is performed through surrogate modelling, a branch of machine learning optimisation techniques which deals with complex black-box functions. It does so by running experiments and estimating a surrogate function which in turn is optimised mathematically. Multiple surrogate modelling methods are compared in experiments to test their performance, speed and stability. These experiments showed that the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator algorithm as used in the HyperOpt Python library was one of the best performing methods (only rivaled by the MVRSM algorithm), moreover it was shown to be the fastest as well as the most stable of the tested algorithms for this particular problem application. This research contributes to the existing theory by creating a modelling framework for the joint optimisation of spare inventory and maintenance scheduling decisions which is specifically tailored to the railway context and includes possibilities for minimal maintenance. In practice this model can be used by maintenance providers to increase the financial success of their maintenance operations and by infrastructure managers to increase insight into their maintenance providers' operations.","Spare part avaialbility; Inventory control; Maintenance Scheduling; Surrogate modelling; Simulation; Operations research; Railways; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

More so, small and medium-sized enterprises, also known as SMEs, are notoriously unstable and as a result, could be even more heavily affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The first major lockdown in The Netherlands was instated on March 23, 2020, which introduced several new measures, such as the prohibition of gatherings, the closing of food and beverage outlets, and the prohibition of all contact-based professions.<br/><br/>In such a time of economic instability as caused by the coronavirus outbreak, it is very useful for a company to know in what financial state they are going to be such that they can actively take precautions, such as liquidating their assets or decreasing their expenses. The financial state of a company is often reflected using Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs for short. These KPIs include metrics like the revenue, cost, and cash flow of a company. The forecasting of these KPIs can help a company in informing in what financial state they are going to be and are usually done using historical data of the company. Whereas the decrease in economic activity of business partners of a company is not reflected in the historical KPI data of the company itself, it can be seen in a network of companies that indicates whether there exists a relationship between two companies by using data on monetary transactions between companies. For this reason, we think that enriching historical KPI data using node features extracted from a dynamic network of companies can help improve the quality of KPI predictions during a period of economic instability such as the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This thesis answers the question of whether we can use utilize a dynamic network of SMEs to improve the quality of KPI predictions during the COVID-19 lockdown. To answer this question, we first focus on creating a dynamic network consisting of SMEs and the transactions between them out of unstandardized data by proposing a novel, lightweight entity resolution algorithm that is used to find a mapping between companies. The resulting network is analyzed, and we found that the effects of the coronavirus lockdown are visible in the network. Next, we examine several KPIs, such as the revenue or the cash flow of a company, and we found that we can also see the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown in several KPIs. Lastly, this thesis describes an analysis of whether node features can be used to improve the quality of the forecasting of several of these KPIs, where we found that node features such as the degree and clustering coefficient of a node can indeed help with improving KPI forecasting under certain conditions.","Network Analysis; Entity Resolution; Machine Learning; COVID-19; SMEs; KPI Prediction; Graph Embedding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When applying a potential, the opposite charges on the electrodes induce an electrostatic force which squeezes the elastomer, causing it to expand. This expansion can be used as an actuation mechanism, in a wide variety of applications. A specific field of interest are low actuation voltage DEAs. These DEAs require low stiffness and thin elastomer layers, but are easier and cheaper to implement due to the lower voltage requirements. The goal of this research is to develop a manufacturing process for an inkjet-printed low actuation voltage DEA while achieving insights into the requirements and limitations of the steps involved with this process. By using the PiXDRO LP50 inkjet printer in combination with the Dimatix DMC printhead, the bottom electrode is printed on a Novele substrate with Mitsubishi NBSIJ-MU01 AgNP ink. A dielectric elastomer ink has been formulated consisting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and octyl acetate (OA) in 1:4 and 1:3 ratios. These inks have been characterised on several printability parameters, placing both formulations in the jettable range based on their Z-value. Although theoretically jettable, both formulations showed difficult jetting behaviour. To resume the research, the PDMS layer is instead applied by spin coating. The PDMS surface is hydrophobic, requiring surface treatment before the electrode can be printed on top. Several methods have been investigated, of which O2 plasma treatment showed the best results. The top electrode is printed using NovaCentrix Metalon JS-B25P AgNP ink. Several different sintering methods have been explored to cure the printed silver. Next to the experimental work, a finite element analysis model has been built to provide a basis for designing low actuation voltage DEAs.","Dielectric Elastomer Actuator; Inkjet printing; soft electronics; PDMS; manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Atsma, Douwe (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Problem In the current care pathway for patients suffering from a Myocardial Infarction (MI), a paradox has been identified in long-term chronic care: modification of cardiovascular risk factors reduce mortality and prevent recurrent cardiac events. However, MI survivors rarely change their lifestyle and relapse often in old habits. The identified cause within the system is a gap created by a lack of professional and social adherence support in relation to cardiovascular risk management. Research has shown how social support from a partner can improve lifestyle change adherence. To fill the gap, this study looks at how the patient's partner can be supported and empowered by the healthcare system to positively fulfill this role. Therefore, this strategic design thesis aims to develop a tangible strategy for the Hart Long Centrum of the LUMC by answering the following research question: ""How can partners of chronically ill patients, that suffered from a MI, provide effective and positive support for the patient to maintain long-term preventive lifestyle changes by means of an eHealth innovation linked to The Box?” Dyadic Opportunity The partner of the patient is able to influence the patient’s health behaviour and motivation through the dyadic nature of their relationship. Therefore, a new perspective has been identified for 'The Box' to stimulate long-term preventive lifestyle change; using positive dyadic communication and support to influence the illness perception of patients and partners. This offers the opportunity to create a parallel track to bridge the chronic care gap. The track will be next to the current care pathway, in the form of an eHealth intervention that complements the existing 'The Box' innovation. Dyadic Experience Each individual in a couple, who have experienced a MI, goes through their own grieving process after a life changing event such as transition from a ‘normal life’ to a chronic illness. Within this process it has been shown that the needs of the partner and patient change over time. This dyadic adaptation process has been examined and the dynamic key needs of the partner have been identified: •How can the partner support the right way at the right time? •How can the partner themselves be supported? •How to strive for a relationship where the right balance between ‘patient’ and ‘loved one’ is achieved during the adaptation process? Solution Direction A future solution is envisioned in which the patient's partner is actively given a central role in participating in long-term lifestyle change: Partners will be empowered and guided by the healthcare system, by means of an eHealth intervention driven by hybrid intelligence and P4 mechanisms (prevention, prediction, personalization, participation), to positively support the patient in the right way at the right moment in changing their lifestyle in the long term. WeCAIR - Partner Perspective of the Hybrid Intelligence Portal (HIP) To make the strategy of influencing patient adherence by empowering and guiding the partner tangible, WeCAIR is designed. WeCAIR is part of a Hybrid Intelligence Portal (HIP) which monitors and guards the balance of human dynamic interactions and needs between partner, patient and care professional. WeCAIR is a user-friendly interface developed from the perspective of the patient's partner. As discussed in the chapter before, the interface has three different main features: (1) Personalized Dyadic Route, (2) Behavioural Support and (3) Lifestyle Education. These characteristics are aimed at empowering and guiding the partner to take on a balanced role in relation to their life partner (the patient) in the adjustment process to chronic illness, in order to positively support the patient in the right way at the right moment in changing their lifestyle in the long term. Conclusion The proposed strategic Product Service System (PSS) improves the current care pathway by involving, supporting and empowering the partner in the care process, resulting in long-term adherence to lifestyle changes. Ultimately, this leads to secondary prevention for the patient and primary prevention for the patient's partner. For the LUMC Hart Long Centrum, this means that by implementing the PSS they will be one step closer to their goal of providing the best clinical and innovative care to patients.","eHealth Intervention; Long-term Lifestyle Change; Myocardial Infarction; Dyadic Relationship; Partner Box; Healthcare Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Abraham, E. (mentor); van Breukelen, B.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Urban water management is faced with upcoming challenges due to climate change, the deterioration of existing infrastructures and the depletion of water sources. Climate change brings about more intense rainfall events and longer periods of drought. On top of that, the deterioration of the piped network urges for investments in the existing system, to ensure that the provision of water services can be maintained. Furthermore, the depletion of water sources is raising awareness regarding the value of freshwater which gives rise to the re­use of water flows that have up to now often been considered as nuisance rather than viable resource. Examples of these flows are the wastewater and the stormwater flow.<br/><br/>The existing centralised infrastructure consists of three reliable systems. The first system supplies high­quality water, the second drains out stormwater and the third one discharges wastewater. These three systems operate separately from each other and follow a linear approach to<br/>water management. In recent years, circular water management has become more prevalent. Instead of following a linear approach in the three separate systems, the re­use of water flows as viable sources are applied more often. New, often local, solutions can be designed to effectively complement existing systems in maintaining the high provision of water services that societies have consistently been using over the past decade. This circular approach can ensure that current water requirement levels can be met sustainably by the improved urban water systems. <br/><br/>By dealing with the upcoming challenges of high­intensity rainfall and long periods of drought– which both have a high spatial variability – local solutions are able to support the centralised infrastructure. This is done by both mitigating the pluvial flood risk, as well as by providing a high ­quality water source. An arguably ideal solution which addresses both the pluvial flood risk and also provides a high­quality water source, is the Bluebloqs system. The Bluebloqs system can help mitigate pluvial flood risk by the attenuation of flow, the result of implementing an attenuation tank in the stormwater drainage system. Also, the Bluebloqs system is able to filter and store this stormwater to provide a high­quality water source during water­scarce seasons.<br/><br/>Whether the Bluebloqs system is a viable solution which addresses both the mitigation of the pluvial flood risk as well as the provision of water challenge, is investigated in this research. The Bluebloqs system is a circular water solution that makes use of an attenuation tank, a bio­filter and an aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) system. The attenuation tank is physically connected to the drainage system and it consequently decreases the risk of surcharged pipes in the drainage network. From the attenuation tank, the water is pumped towards the bio­filter, where pollutants from the water are removed and the water is filtered to such an extent that it can be infiltrated into the aquifer. In the aquifer, the water is stored to overcome seasonal variations in<br/>water availability. The Bluebloqs system has the objective to supply water in the dry season, even though its source is stormwater, which enters the system during the wet season. This research has analysed the performance of the Bluebloqs system for different dimensions and operations.<br/><br/>Within this thesis, a framework has been built that presents the performance of the Bluebloqssystem. This framework consists of three groups; the interactions with centralised infrastructure, the water quality indicators and the impact of the Bluebloqs system on its environment. These three have their own distinct performance indicators, which characterise the effectiveness of the Bluebloqs system in providing a specific water service. The group of the framework dealing with the interactions with the centralised infrastructure uses performance indicators for the volume of water lost in overflow events, and volume of water supplied through the Bluebloqs system as high­ quality water source to the end­user. The indicators for the other groups characterise the Bluebloqs system differently. Each group within the framework projects the performance of the Bluebloqs system for other interest groups. For example, the indicators regarding the impact of the Bluebloqs system on its environment are of interest to municipalities thinking about implementing the system. <br/><br/>The behaviour of the Bluebloqs system has been modelled. This model presents the physical processes taking place within the Bluebloqs system. The output of the model are the performance indicators of the framework. By running the model under different input parameters, the performance of the modelled Bluebloqs system is tested on the three groups of the framework. <br/><br/>The outcome of testing the model on the framework has shown that the Bluebloqs system can be improved. One of the suggested improvements is to work with feed cycles for the bio­filter. These feed cycles consist of the periodic saturation of the bio­filter. Once the bio­filter is saturated, the flow from the attenuation tank towards the bio­filter is interrupted, to let the water gradually filter through the bio­filter.<br/>By applying feed cycles, the bio­filter is better capable of removing pollutants from the water. However, periodically interrupting the water flow from the attenuation tank towards the bio­filter negatively impacts the effective storage capacity of the attenuation tank. When having more feed cycles in a day, these interruptions last for a shorter period of time. Depending on the desired performance of the system, which is based on the performance indicators, these feed cycles should be aligned with the capacity of the attenuation tank and the discharge of the pump for the flow between the attenuation tank and the bio­filter. <br/>Fitting the feed cycles to the seasonality of rainfall patterns can further increase the performance of the system in mitigating flood risks. Applying predictive control when overflow events occur is an additional control option that minimises the environmental impact of the system. Finally, the performance of the Bluebloqs system can be presented based on all the performance indicators included in the framework, and the model can be used to adjust the system dimensioning and operations to present the consequences of adjustments to the desired performance of the Bluebloqs system.<br/><br/>The frameworks’ performance indicators can be used to understand the Bluebloqs ideal configuration to deliver a specific desired performance. The desired performance of the system determines the dimensions and operations of the system. Co­designing the Bluebloqs system is thus crucial to its delivered performance. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the framework and model can be used to present the Bluebloqs system for different scenarios. The framework can generate a comprehensive overview of what can be expected of the Bluebloqs system when implementing it in a specific project site, in comparison to other solutions that may be considered, such as green roofs or storage tanks. Also, its use as circular solution being complementary to existing urban water infrastructure can be presented by the framework and model output. This will help in the transition of urban water systems in dealing with the upcoming challenges related to climate change, the deterioration of the piped infrastructure and the depletion of water sources.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-01","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the emerging demand for energy-efficient products, the composite material has become a point of attraction for many product manufacturers. Furthermore, with its high strength to weight ratio, long life span, low maintenance and design flexibility, composite materials offer tailored properties by choosing an appropriate combination of reinforcement and matrix material. Being one of the leading users of composite material, the Netherlands is a global player in the field of design, automation, material development and sustainability in the field of high-grade-reinforced plastic. <br/><br/>Recycling of the decommissioned composite material remains underdeveloped research. The current shredding and inefficient recycling result in the loss of material property, struggling to find its scalable application in the market. However, the composite material has a longer life than its entire product, resulting in premature decommissioning of the material due to constant development in the product design. One way around this problem is repurposing. Therefore, there is a need to look for an alternative approach. <br/><br/>Repurposing aims to keep the material alive by utilising its shape and remaining potential in serving an additional product life with a different application. However, the concept of repurposing is undiscovered in the field of composite material.<br/><br/>This graduation thesis aims to create a set of guidelines for industrial designers and companies, guiding them to efficiently utilise the composite material’s value with the practice of scalable repurposing. <br/><br/>Further to industrialise and streamline the repurposing practice, there is a need for product lifecycle management, assisting repurposing industrial designers and companies with the set of prerequisite information.<br/><br/>By case study of repurposing an aircraft galley made from the glass fibre reinforced plastic into a bicycle cart for kids, various operations, including disassembly, dismantling and re-manufacturing, were executed to gain a closer look into the repurposing. In addition, different stakeholders’ roles in repurposing were identified by conducting interviews with various actors involved in the composite industry. With the help of the theoretical and practical insights gathered during the exploratory phase, the PLM framework and guidelines were formulated focusing on scalable repurposing of the composite material.<br/><br/>A revised set of guidelines was proposed by evaluating the draft guidelines through an interview with the repurposing company and a co-creation session involving various stakeholders, education experts and industrial designers. Based on the evaluation, it can be concluded that the guidelines can serve as a base for implementing the repurposing practice, where the industrial designer can connect the detached stakeholder and guide the implementation of composite repurposing. <br/><br/>However, to make these guidelines well qualified for all the composite products from different sectors, a wide range of case studies should be conducted. Although these guidelines are formulated to support industrial designers to impact repurposing positively, further work is needed to conduct a business model, real case scenario, and policy management to look into the guidelines’ pertinency. <br","Repurpose; Circular economy; product life cycle; Composites; Material Passports; Guidelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","EcoBulk",""

One of the most promising green resources is solar energy, which is a rapidly growing market. However, to fully use its potential of economy of scale, the application of offshore floating solar should be explored. A promising option is the use of a flexible type of Very Large Floating Structures (VLFSs), which are called Very Flexible Floating Structures (VFFSs). They are characterised by their large length to height ratio compared to rigid bodies and depending on their material properties have a hydroelastic response to the incident wave. In the late 1990s, a lot of research has been done on VLFSs by Tsubogo and Okada (1998) who derived an analytical dispersion relation assuming a zero­draught structure. However, only recently, Schreier and Jacobi (2020b) did experimental research on VFFSs in a towing tank at the Delft University of Technology, as little is still known about flexible structures. This report focuses on a numerical alter­ native that covers both VLFSs as well as VFFSs using a Finite Element Method (FEM) Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model which has been built based on potential flow to model the fluid and a dynamic Euler­Bernoulli beam that represents the floating structure using the Julia package Gridap. One of the main advantages is that the zero­draught assumption is not necessary and, therefore, structures with larger draughts can also be modelled. Next to this, the numerical model is able to cope with irregular shapes, for which no analytical method yet exists. The model is built such that it can handle 2D as well as 3D domains. A 2D analysis has been made to understand the influence of hydroelastic wave deformation of the incident wave, in terms of wavelength dispersion as well as amplitude dispersion on floating structures. To verify the model, the numerical results were compared to the analytical solution and experimental research in a towing tank, which showed accurate results. Test runs were set up that mimicked the towing tank set­up and a full­scale solar park. Furthermore, a sensitivity study was executed that shows the limits of the flexible domain and to see in which cases significant (&gt;1%) hydroelastic wave deformation would occur using governing mean and extreme ocean waves, as well as a typical lake wave. Finally, the influence of the draught of the structure was examined. This report provides a good overview of when wave deformation should be accounted for in terms of bending rigidity and density. Confirming existing theory, it was found that the stiffness of the VFFS causes wave stretching and the draught of the structure influences the extent of wave shortening. It was also found that significant wave deformation will not occur for ocean waves as the required stiff­ ness is beyond existing materials. For extreme ocean waves, there is even no dispersion at all. As the wave frequency increases, the hydroelastic interaction gets stronger. The typical lake wave showed to be well within the flexible regime and also showed significant dispersion with realistic material parame­ ters. The numerical model is able to cope with large draught scenarios which lead to wave shortening, which in its turn leads to wave focusing. Ultimately, the numerical model showed to be a good alternative to existing methods to investigate the behaviour of VLFSs outside the floating solar domain, where one could think of ice floes, floating islands or floating airports.","Very Large Floating Structures; Fluid Structure Interaction; Very Flexible Floating Structures; FEM; potential flow; Floating Solar","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://oriolcg.github.io/GridapOffshore.jl/FSI/VFFS/ Tutorial of numerical model","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Gürses, F.S. (graduation committee); Fiebig, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology became unregulated within the EU in 2007. Most recently, it was integrated into mobile phones in 2019, notably Apply and Samsung adding it to all their newer models. While UWB is characterised as a radio technology with any signal above 500 MHz, it operates within the 6-9 GHz<br/>range in mobile phones. This allows for fast data rate, low power secure <br/> communication, multipath facilities and accurate localization. While the integration of UWB is mostly advantageous to users and innovators, its ability of accurate localisation may lead to severe privacy concerns <br/><br/>The aim of the thesis is to understand the privacy concerns of UWB’s integration into mobile phones by answering the main research question: how do experts and users perceive privacy concerns of UWB usage in mobile phones; and how can they be mitigated? It was subsequently broken down into three sub-research<br/>questions: 1. What are the possible applications of UWB in mobile phones? Phones have other incumbent radio technology embedded such as Bluetooth (BLE) and Wi-Fi, however it seems like UWB is being integrated to serve additional purposes. The answer to this question seeks to understand from gray and research literature how UWB can be used in mobile phones and what advantage it gives over incumbent technology. Research shows UWB gives phones the ability for indoor navigation, gesture-based control, foot traffic analysis for smart retail, teleconference systems, proximity-based localization, key-less entry among others. <br/><br/>This leads to research question 2. What are the potential privacy concerns associated with UWB? The incorporation of new technology capable of accurate localization leads to privacy concerns. All privacy issues were categorised on the basis of three paradigms: social, surveillance and institutional mentioned in Gurses and Diaz, 2013. This was initially done by interviewing experts from the three groups of privacy experts, policy regulators and technology experts. Analysis of their answers showed that UWB privacy concerns seem relatively similar to BLE and Wi-Fi localization, albeit with higher granularity. UWB allows mobile phones companies, third parties and governments track people accurately indoors, push advertisements depending on location, obtain relative relationships between people based on distance leaving people with no place to hide. Subsequently, user interviews were carried out to see if they could identify the same concerns of UWB. Results showed that that from the data of users interviewed, all of them believed that accurate data <br/>localization of people is crossing a line that users cannot push back on. A majority of them saw most of the same privacy issues as the experts showing that, as people get more adept with technology they understand<br/>how it can affect their privacy. A common question that was asked across all the interviews was how can we protect our privacy in the face of such penetrating innovation as time lapses. <br/><br/>Which is the final sub-research question: 3. What are technical and societal approaches to address privacy concerns? Experts provided solutions that were more industry oriented which included decoupling UWBfrom other location-based services, provision of opt-out settings on a more prominent basis, reworking license agreements, industry wide discussion and self-regulation in terms of privacy. However, users gave answers that were more user-centric and gave more control to the common public. This included users neggotiating their own privacy agreements, compensation models for loss of privacy, a more holistic regulation process and finally, trying to break the control of big tech companies. This shows that users and experts have very similar understanding of privacy issues but very different views on how privacy should be protected. Perhaps, it may be time for regulators to pay heed to user suggestions. These suggestions were then compared with privacy mitigation strategies mentioned in literature. Notably, the most overarching concept that needs to be incorporated is the concept of Privacy-by-design which can then be broken down into technical and societal strategies. Technical approaches included concepts such as obfuscation, k-anonymiser, differential privacy, dummy localization and access control mechanisms. All the technical strategies seemingly had the same issue of requiring third-party applications to function. Sophisticated security measures and privacy statements would then be needed to ensure these companies do not choose monetary gain over user privacy. Societal approaches included concepts of data-for-all, technical regulatory bodies and finally, breaking up of big tech companies. As time passes and innovations become more pervasive, it may be too late to incorporate privacy protection actively. The time to protect privacy is now.","Mobile phones; thematic analysis; privacy; Ultra-wideband technology; radio technology","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","Master Thesis",""

Assistive technology for them is progressively being developed in order to enable independent living.

Therefore, haptic technology is being incorporated more in assistive devices meant for situations in which one cannot rely on sight to manipulate objects and conduct various activities.<br/><br/>An issue with currently available haptic solutions is that they typically use electromechanical systems that are heavy with large, obtrusive forms, produce sounds that hinder their usability and sometimes even provide unpleasant haptic feedback. A way to mitigate these problems is by incorporating soft, flexible and lightweight smart materials as actuators into these systems. Shape memory materials are a specific category of smart materials that have the ability to recover their original shapes from a deformation when certain stimuli are applied. They have the potential to bring hedonic characteristics to haptic technology such as providing organic sensations. Consequently, the haptic assistive devices become effective and comfortable interventions for the visually impaired.<br/><br/>This project demonstrates how these materials can successfully be incorporated to produce different types of tactile feedback as a form of an assistive-wearable and enrich the lives of the blind and visually impaired.

While global modelling and regional observation based studies have found significant effects from deforestation on precipitation, leading mostly to drying precipitation trends and shorting rainy seasons, this study represents the first global estimate of first order deforestation effects on precipitation. Using a recently developed precipitationshed database and actual deforestation data, a new measure is developed to quantify potential deforestation impact per grid cell which in turn is related to annual precipitation trends as well as seasonal differences in tropical regions. In seven regions analysed, a majority of subregions suggested a relationship between deforestation impact and a relative drying precipitation trend in the 2001-2018 study period compared to the long term average. While these results provide further evidence of deforestation contributing to a downwind drying precipitation trend across different continents and climate regions, five other regions studied showed no significant relation or suggest relative wetting related to deforestation impact. One of this regions is the South America Tropical (SAT) region, the region most well-known for its widespread and intense Amazonian deforestation. The two regions downwind of the SAT region however are highly impacted by SAT deforestation and experience most relative drying in the areas impacted most impacted by deforestation, suggesting strong teleconnecting effects. In the seasonal analysis, only two out of four tropical regions studied show more subregions linking deforestation impact to relative drying in the first wet month compared to the wettest month. While these results provide new insights into the global influence deforestation can have on moisture availability, more research needs to be done into the indirect and feedback effects related to deforestation. Additionally, a more robust way of including other factors influencing precipitation trends like large scale oscillations could further enhance the understanding of this important issue.","Deforestation; Precipitation; Downwind; Precipitationshed; Data analysis; Forest loss","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Tissue engineering, using either synthetic materials or decellularized tracheal tissue, opens up new possibilities for generating tracheal substitutes. Decellularization, a procedure in which the tissue's immunogenic cellular material is removed while the extracellular matrix (ECM) is preserved, seems the most promising approach. The majority of tracheal decellularization methods, however, are reliant on harsh chemicals and require lengthy wash procedures, resulting in damage to the ECM. To address these issues, a supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) decellularization approach has been suggested as an alternative solution due to its ability to both decellularize and sterilize tissues while leaving no toxic residues and requiring less treatment time. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to compare scCO2 treatment with a chemical decellularization method, which is the current gold standard reported in literature, for creating a decellularized porcine tracheal scaffold with good cytocompatibility.  Methods: A total of five different protocols were tested that varied in decellularization and sterilization methods used. Decellularization efficiency was evaluated in terms of DNA content, histological appearance, and retention of ECM components. Additionally, mechanical tensile testing and scanning electron microscopy were used to assess the effects of the different decellularization protocols. Further, decellularized scaffolds were recellularized with fibrin-encapsulated porcine adipose derived stem cells to assess the cytocompatibility of the scaffolds. Results: The highest reduction in DNA content was observed when samples were subjected to the detergent-enzymatic protocol, followed by sterilization with gamma irradiation, and when samples were subjected to scCO2 treatment, followed by washing with sodium hydroxide. The latter protocol, however, also negatively impacted the ECM, whereas good preservation of ECM components was seen with the DEM protocol. DNA and histological analysis showed that treatment with scCO2 in combination with a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) washing step was unable to completely decellularize porcine tracheas. Static surface seeding of the decellularized scaffolds led to poor cell adherence. Cells encapsulated in fibrin and seeded on the tracheal scaffolds were able to adhere and survive, showing the cytocompatibility of the decellularized scaffolds.  Conclusions: Decellularization with scCO2 in combination with a H2O2 washing step was not successful in completely decellularizing the porcine tracheas, and possibly requires the use of a co-solvent or secondary agent for successful decellularization. For recellularization of decellularized tracheal scaffolds, the use of fibrin as a cell carrier is an effective and simple seeding method. The findings in this thesis open up new avenues for potential optimizations in future research.","Tissue engineering; Decellularization; Trachea; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Tissue scaffolds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The power production of downstream wind turbines in a wind farm is significantly impacted by wake effects of upstream turbines. Improving the layout optimization process could reduce these wake losses and therefore result in more efficient wind farms. The wakes are also affected by atmospheric stability conditions, as stable conditions lead to a reduced wake recovery, and unstable conditions lead to an improved wake recovery. The topic of atmospheric stability has quickly gained more attention in wind energy research over the recent years. However, there is still little research done that focuses specifically on the effects of atmospheric stability on the wind farm layout optimization process.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to determine the effects of atmospheric stability on the optimal layout of a wind farm and to quantify the potential benefits of considering stability conditions in the layout optimization process. A stability-dependent Jensen wake model is developed, using a stability-dependent wake decay coefficient based on the non-dimensional Obukhov length. The developed model is implemented in FLORIS, a wake modeling utility for Python, to calculate the wind field and the annual energy production (AEP). A simplistic layout optimization method is used, in which the positioning of wind turbines relative to each other is fixed and only the orientation of the entire wind farm is varied. To quantify the potential benefits of considering stability conditions, the layout optimization is done twice for each analyzed case: once using the determined stability conditions and once using the assumption of neutral stability conditions. The resulting benefit of considering stability effects is expressed as the potential AEP gain. <br/><br/>The results of the first cases looked promising, showing potential AEP gains of 7.4%, 5.6%, and 9.2%. However, these cases consist of unrealistic wind conditions and were mostly intended to study the effects of different stability conditions on the resulting optimal layout. For example, it is found that it is more beneficial to reduce wake overlap for stable conditions than for unstable conditions, which results in stable wind directions playing a dominant role in the optimization process. Cases with semi-realistic wind conditions showed significantly lower potential AEP gains of 0.1% and 0.7%. Finally, a real case based on meteorological data from an offshore site in the Netherlands resulted in a potential AEP gain of 0.0%. <br/><br/>It is concluded that the benefits of considering stability effects in the layout optimization process are likely to be insignificant. In most cases, the layout optimization under neutral stability conditions already optimizes for wind directions with stable conditions, as stable conditions tend to be more frequent in wind directions with high wind speeds. It is expected that there can be a small potential AEP gain in cases with unusual stability distributions that differ significantly from the described trend. However, even in such cases it is likely that the benefits are still very small.<br","wind energy; wind farm layout optimization; atmospheric stability; wake modelling; Jensen wake model; Gaussian wake model; FLORIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The need for a transition is mainly accepted, but it is questioned whether all European Union citizens benefit from such a change. In fact, the greenhouse gas reduction will lead to a costly restructuring of carbon-intensive regions. Consequently, the European Union and its critics expect extreme job destruction and decreased economic activity in such areas. To cope with the ills that an energy transition brings, the Just Transition Fund is proposed. It serves as a financial buffer and provides strategic support for the successful energy transition to decrease injustices. Support for the most affected regions is undoubtedly necessary but is the Just Transition Fund increasing justice for these regions? The European Commission provided a similar strategic support program earlier with the Initiative for Coal Regions in Transition, which included providing support to apply for funding. As such, the question arises whether the Just Transition Fund increases justice when comparing to the predecessor programs.<br/>This master thesis serves as a first insight into the justness of the European Union’s proposed Just Transition Fund. To do so, several projects of the Initiative for Coal Regions in Transition are compared to the current setup of the fund. The data for the Just Transition Fund has been gathered in previous research while information on the Initiative for Coal Regions in Transition was acquired with an exploratory desk research approach. The gathered data was structured coherently by the creation of two main categories, the project and contextual factors. Each was complemented with subcategories allowing allowed the comparison of the projects. Ultimately, these findings could be evaluated with a transition justice framework that has been adapted to the research needs.<br/>It becomes clear that many injustice issues were present and often left unresolved in the assessed projects. Compared with the Just Transition Funds current criticism, many of these issues can be detected again. The most prominent justice issues found were of distributive nature due to scarce funding and a lack of stakeholder participation. The interplay of both problems leads to the desire to reach one goal: receiving as many funds as possible. As a result, the eligibility criteria seem to be seen as obstacles to overcome or boxes to tick leading to window dressing to meet imposed requirements. Implementing the same process kind for both programs is thus an inadequate path to take as the most critical justice issues stem from precisely this process.<br/>The inadequacy of some criteria leads to the conclusion that the Just Transition Fund merges indicators of funding needs with requiring solutions to grand societal problems. The European Union needs to reassess the posed criteria on their ends and make the said challenges a priority to be addressed during the energy transition. Furthermore, it becomes evident that the application process can lead to injustice due to a lack of capacities and political capabilities of the regions in need. <br/>With the current setup of the fund, transition justice can only increase to some extent. Still, there is potential for this program the first step is made towards a more holistic approach to coping with justice issues. The monetary aid, although insufficient now, can help the most affected if distributed and spend adequately. Besides, the fund serves as a symbol of solidarity with the most affected regions currently left behind. Policymaking is always a trial and error. Now, the identified shortcomings must be addressed to increase the fund’s impact.<br","Transition Justice; Energy Transition; Stakeholder Participation; European Union; Ethics of Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","Based Innovation & Entrepreneurship",""

Existing approaches use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to obtain safe robot behavior in such environments, but do not ensure collision avoidance or trajectory feasibility. This issue is solved by methods combining DRL with model predictive control (MPC). However, they do not account for static obstacle avoidance. Moreover, DRL-based approaches train their network in multiple environments with increasing difficulty to speed up training and improve generalization ability. By sequentially training the model on new (more complex) environments, new knowledge could interfere with old knowledge, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting.<br/>Despite performing well on the most challenging scenarios, performance on more simple scenarios is diminished. This paper introduces a continual reinforcement learning (CRL) strategy that can sequentially learn multiple navigation tasks while retaining performance on all previously learned tasks. For robot navigation, we utilize a combination of MPC with DRL, to develop an algorithm that can avoid not only dynamic interacting agents but also static obstacles. Our approach is shown to be able to safely navigate to a goal position in multiple environments. In addition, by sequentially learning multiple tasks, we improve navigation performance in terms of successful events and travel times and distances compared to other DRL approaches.","Continual Learning; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Motion Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Magnier, L.B.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Scientists have been warning for years about the consequences of the current take-make-waste system, and incremental change is needed to enable the environment to regenerate and move towards a sustainable society. Especially electronic waste (e-waste), which currently increases three times faster than regular waste and is hard to collect and recycle (The World Bank, 2021), is an increasing concern and an opportunity for improvement. In this project, the problem of premature obsolescence is addressed. The project investigates how to increase the lifetime of electronic consumer durables. By fully understanding how the consumers make replacement decisions, the decisions people make can be influenced. It turns out that as a product moves towards the expected lifetime, the perceived value of the product goes down, and the consumer is less likely to take care of the product or repair it when it breaks. Consequently, this project investigates how to increase the expected lifetime of products. This contributes to the Premature Obsolescence Multistakeholder Product Testing Program (PROMPT). PROMPT is working on a test program to assess the lifetime of products from a technical, user, and market perspective. The formulated assignment is to generate design guidelines that help to improve the expected product lifetime and illustrate this on a case example. The products that will be investigated are washing machines, televisions, vacuum cleaners, and smartphones. Two studies were performed. One qualitative study to get more insights in an explorative way, and a quantitative study to measure the most effective way to increase the expected lifetime. From the first study, it was concluded that people determine the expected lifetime at several moments throughout the lifetime of the product. Also, past experiences with the product, the average lifetime, the amount of warranty and expected change in demographics are factors that were considered by the participants while determining the expected lifetime of their products. Also, it was concluded that many people are not aware of their expectations of the (expected) lifetime of products, and therefore creating more awareness could lead to increased lifetime of products. In the quantitative study, only vacuum cleaners were studied. It turned out that warranty and the availability of spare parts are the most effective strategies to increase the expected lifetime of vacuum cleaners. However, the strategies build upon each other while increasing the expected lifetime. Therefore, to address all consumers, more strategies should be integrated in a product for the optimal result. The findings from this study can be used by PROMPT as a starting point for testing criteria. For example, criteria about the attempts of companies to increase the expected lifetime of products could be integrating in the testing program. However, before doing this, more research is needed about the influencing factors of the expected lifetime of products.","Premature obsolescence; Product Lifetime; Expected Lifetime; Warranty; Design Strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Frequentist SEM relies on Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and although this method works well for many simple situations, its performance is unsatisfactory when dealing with complex models or small sample sizes. In search of a method that resolves those problems, Bayesian SEM has been developed recently. These models produce more accurate parameter estimates. The Bayesian approach to SEM offers the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge into SEM, allowing for model extension and improvement. In this research, the theory of both frequentist and Bayesian SEM is described. Subsequently, Bayesian SEM is illustrated with an application in educational sciences. A method is proposed to specify prior distributions that use correlation estimates found in previous research to reflect prior information and our confidence in that information. The results obtained by an informative prior model are analyzed and compared to the results of a noninformative, weakly informative, and frequentist model. It was found that the informative prior model produces more accurate estimates than the noninformative and weakly informative prior models, indicating the correctness of the specified priors.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Ranging from default passwords to unpatched software, many systems, such as websites or databases, are being compromised due to these pitfalls. Often stemming from human error, it is difficult to avoid these misconfigurations, which is why they are repeatedly seen in the wild. Especially in the context of websites, we often find pages that were forgotten, that is, they were left online after they served their purpose and were never updated thereafter.<br/>In this thesis, we introduce the first methodology to detect such forgotten or orphaned web pages, a type of misconfiguration that has seen little attention. We combine the historic data set of the Internet Archive with active measurements to identify pages that can no longer be reached via a path from the index page, yet remain accessible through their specific URL. We show the efficacy of our approach and the real-world relevance of the issue of orphaned web pages by applying it to a sample of 100,000 domains from the Tranco Top 1M. This particular type of misconfiguration can pose a serious threat, as they can lead to forgotten and unmaintained web pages, which may not have seen security updates.<br/>In our measurements, we find 1,953 pages on 907 unique domains that are orphaned, some of which are 20 years old. In our subsequent security analysis, we find that these pages are significantly (p &lt; 0.01 using χ 2 ) more likely to contain some vulnerabilities than maintained pages: 7.1% of orphaned pages suffer from simple XSS vulnerabilities, while only 0.9% of maintained pages are vulnerable against this type of attack. We encounter similar patterns for following best security practices, such as for the use of Content Security Policies (CSPs) and setting HTTP Security Headers.

There have been numerous cases of local populations pushing back against the development of mining operations near their communities. This study aims to determine whether it is possible to assess the visual impact of surface mining operations before the development has started. With this assessment it would become possible to make informed decisions as to pitshell development and selection in terms of visual impact. A tool was developed to determine whether it is possible to make this assessment. This tool must be able to be used to determine the visual impact of two or more scenarios in the pre-feasibility phase of development to assist in the decision of <br/>which scenario will be developed further in the feasibility phase. In this context, the visual impact is defined as the perceived change in the landscape as a result of mine development on local communities around the surface mine development. The scenarios are defined as the option of pitshells designed during the pre-feasibility phase of mine development. <br/><br/>The tool makes a distinction between the physical changes in the landscape caused by the surface mining operation and how this physical change is perceived by anyone viewing the operation. <br/><br/>The tool is GIS based and utilizes the free open-source software QGIS to calculate the physical change in the landscape. The tool calculates the vertical and horizontal visibility angle. The visibility angle describes the extent that the change in the landscape takes up in the view of an observer. In addition <br/>to that, the tool calculates the contrast between the changed colour in the landscape and its surroundings, which describes how much the change stands out. It requires two sets of data to work: a digital elevation model of the prospected surface mine pitshell and the surrounding landscape and a <br/>RGB satellite image of the surrounding area. The DEM provides elevation data for every square metre of the landscape to the GIS, while the satellite image provides RGB colour data. All other data can be generated from the previously mentioned data features. <br/><br/>The tool is tested using a case study, in which several distinct pitshell scenarios are compared against one another on their visual impact. The case study is based on the extension of a limestone quarry in <br/>Belgium, which aims to secure reserve for future operations. The area of interest is surrounded by several small to medium size villages, which would be affected visually by the extension. Therefore, a comparison should be made regarding the visual impact of the several pitshell scenarios. The results showed it is possible to determine the visual impact of surface mining operations before the <br/>development has started. On this basis, it is possible to compare different pitshell scenarios and determine which scenario would be least impactful in terms of visual impact on the local community and surrounding landscape. The reliability of the tool can only be assessed theoretically, however a high level of accuracy is achieved by adhering to guiding principles which are set out in this thesis.","Visual impact; Landscape; Opencast; Mining; LVIA; pre-feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The advent of new technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing have enabled the users to access content from anywhere around the world. This results in a need for an efficient and fast resource allocation method based on demand acting on the network. Many researchers have developed various algorithms to address this issue. However, they have considered only flow-based network properties, while the contemporary networks communicate mostly through path-based communication using the shortest paths. Inverse shortest path algorithm (ISPA) is a graph-theory based heuristic developed to solve this network resource allocation problem which considers both flow-based communication properties through Effective resistance matrix and path-based communication properties through shortest path matrix. Nevertheless, ISPA is so far implemented only for unweighted graphs. This study aims at assessing the feasibility of ISPA for weighted graphs by understanding the nature of Inverse shortest path problem (ISPP) bounds in weighted random graphs and implementing ISPA for weighted graphs. ISPP bounds behaviour is studied for weighted graphs by analyses of Q-norm distributions, probability of failure distributions and hopcount distributions. A feasibility condition verifying ISPP bounds is derived in relation with the input parameters of the weighted random graph. The solutions obtained through hop count distribution analysis are observed to be Poissonian in nature. Finally, ISPA is implemented for weighted graphs such that demand matrix can be resolved into a simple distance matrix to obtain solution which is a non-negative weighted Adjacency matrix and feasibility conditions are verified for the solutions obtained through ISPA.","Resource allocation; inverse shortest path problem; shortest path computations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","","","","","",""

In Eurocode NEN-EN 1990 specific minimum reliability index values are defined, which depend on a certain reference period and reliability class. To ensure that the structures meet the reliability requirements, partial factors are applied in the Eurocode. The aim is to steer the design to the minimum reliability requirements in a relatively simple way without a complete reliability assessment. Since such a reliability assessment is much more complex and requires more time and knowledge of the engineer. This research investigates how the reliability of a steel main bearing structure in a wind excited building can be determined, taking into account all uncertainties on both the resistance and load side. A new method is developed in which wind tunnel measurements, wind speed models and a finite element model of the building can be directly linked. This is an improvement on recent studies. With this method it is possible to determine the load effects of the wind in specific elements of the building. This can then be used to determine the reliability of the steel main bearing structure in a wind excited building.<br/><br/>First of all, all probabilistic models concerning the resistance side of the reliability assessment are identified by means of an extensive literature study. In this way all material properties and uncertainties are included in the reliability assessment. In addition, wind speed models, boundary layer wind tunnel pressure measurements and a FEM of the case study building are used. A wind load effect model quantifies the forces that occur in the structure due to the given wind load (based on the wind tunnel research) on the structure. This wind load effect model consists of several deterministic and stochastic parameters as input. All these data and models are linked to each other to determine the peak load effects and associated sampling uncertainties in various elements of the case study building. To further use the wind load effects in the reliability assessment, extreme value theory must be applied to determine the extreme value distributions of these peak load effects. It should be taken into account that the extremes extracted from the data are independent and identically distributed.<br/><br/>To demonstrate that the method works, it is applied to a case study building. This case study building is initially designed in a deterministic Eurocode manner. Next, the reliability of a number of elements of the steel main bearing structure is extensively determined. For this particular case study building, it is evident that the design can be further optimised compared to the Eurocode design. In conclusion, this method shows that the possibilities in the field of a reliability-based design are certainly worthwhile for the further optimisation of a structure. And the use of this new method in which all data and models can be linked makes the application of a reliability-based design a lot more efficient, more accurate and therefore more interesting.<br","Reliability analysis; Wind loading; Steel structures; Eurocode; FORM; FEM; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Coupled models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

This is due to the inability to predict the oxidation behaviour during the processing of steel. In order to solve this challenge, experimental data regarding oxidation on a short timescale is required which is not yet well-addressed in literature. Some of this data required will be generated in this research project via the experimental investigation of the oxidation of Fe-Mn binary alloys at high temperature. In this project, the oxidation experiments are performed on Fe-Mn alloys having a manganese composition ranging from 0.5-7% Mn in temperatures ranging from 1000-1150 degrees Celsius and oxygen partial pressures ranging from 0.1-0.3 atm. The oxidation behaviour is studied using thermogravimetric analysis and the oxide layer is then characterised using X-ray diffraction. The in-situ evolution of oxide structure is observed using high temperature X-ray diffraction, and finally the rate determining mechanism for the oxidation of Fe-Mn alloys at high temperature is identified.","Oxidation; Steel; Manganese; Iron; Processing; Thermomechanical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-21","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Maden, W.L.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netflix documentary, ‘The Social Dilemma’, has shown that ubiquitous digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube tend to use artificial intelligence to optimize the system for user engagement. The documentary provides an example of why metrics that optimize engagement, such as time-on-site, can be detrimental to our society. Overemphasizing current metrics resulting in manipulation, short-term concerns, and other inadvertent negative consequences.<br/><br/>OPTIMIZE FOR WELLBEING<br/>Why do companies not optimize for wellbeing since it is in their best interest in the long-term to keep their users subscribed to their service? The answer is that it is easier and, in the short term, profitable to measure time on-site than wellbeing. In a 2016 TED talk, Tristan Harris provided an example: “Tinder, where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did, measuring the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created.” Here, the existing metric, the number of swipes left and right, is easy to measure; conversely, the alternative, fulfilling romantic relationship, is not. However, the goal of a dating app should be to connect two individuals meaningfully; the number of swipes not equal to a positive relationship. This problem highlights the difficulty of translating human values into feasible metrics.<br/><br/>DEEPER QUESTION BEHIND ETHICAL AI<br/>What if we want ethical AI, systems that can do good to people? What if we want AI value alignment, for instance, ensuring AI systems obey human value. According to the paper “Artificial Intelligence, Values, and Alignment.”, behind each vision for ethically-aligned AI sits a deeper question. How are we to decide which principles or objectives to encode in AI and who has the right to make these decisions?<br/><br/>INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS TO REACH AI VALUE ALIGNMENT<br/>One possible way of answering this is by including stakeholders and those most impacted in the design process and combine quantitative measures with qualitative information. Columbia professor and New York Times Chief Data Scientist Chris Wiggins stated,“Since we cannot know in advance every phenomenon users will experience, we cannot know in advance what metrics will quantify these phenomena”. In other words, we first need to understand the user’s perspective of AI experience to be able to develop suitable metrics. Thus, participatory design can be a way to translate human values into wellbeing metrics that fit the context. In this project, we focus on wellbeing as our value.<br/><br/>PROJECT FOCUS<br/>To operationalize wellbeing, we need to know which aspects of wellbeing require focus by giving users a voice to inform us of their perspectives. This project will focus on developing a method that could operationalize wellbeing concept for participatory design. This methodology will be applied to sensitize end-users and allow them to share their wellbeing concern freely and meaningfully. Although the motivation of this project comes from the needs of AI for wellbeing, the project focuses on a problem that exists outside of AI alone, namely, sensitizing wellbeing. Because to be able to design an AI for wellbeing system, we first need to enable people to talk about wellbeing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://joanne1993leave9.wixsite.com/my-site The project showcase website.","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

We show that by learning the order of the basis we can accurately learn the frequency of the filters, and hence adapt to the optimal frequencies for the underlying task. We investigate the well-founded mathematical formulation of fractional derivatives to adapt the filter frequencies during training. Our formulation leads to parameter savings and data efficiency when compared to the standard CNNs and the Gaussian derivative CNN filter networks that we build on.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Fractional Calculus; Frequency Learning; Data Efficiency; Structured Filters; Parameter Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

The shadows cast by neighbouring objects on the solar panel force shaded solar cells to operate under reverse bias. In this case, instead of generating power, the shaded solar cell dissipates power, which is converted into heat and may induce the formation of hot-spots. Many attempts have been made to improve the shade tolerance photovoltaic modules. In this work, we focus on solar cells with low breakdown characteristics to build shade tolerant photovoltaic modules. These types of solar cells allow the current flow at low reverse bias voltages (around −4 V). The main design challenge is to maintain high conversion efficiencies while achieving low breakdown voltages.<br/>In order to design shade tolerant photovoltaic modules, the carrier transport mechanisms in the solar cell under reverse bias conditions are firstly investigated. A robust simulation template is created in Sentaurus TCAD to perform a parametric evaluation, including both the structural and operating parameters, of the device I-V characteristics. The silicon heterojunction interdigitated back contact solar cell with a silicon oxide passivation layer is among the most promising cell structures to achieve both the low breakdown voltage and the high efficiency. Band-to-band tunneling happens between the heavily doped p+ and n+ regions at the rear side, which allow charge carriers to recombine without entering the bulk of the solar cell. We analyze the effect of the tunneling mass, the gap distance and the dopants penetration length on the forward and reverse I-V curves. Simulations suggest that it is possible to design high efficiency solar cells with breakdown voltages as low as −1.2 V. In addition, device performances under different temperature and irradiance conditions are analysed for the purpose of further investigations on the system level.<br/>While this research study is mainly focused on the performance of solar cells, the results presented in this thesis facilitate comprehensive system level energy yield analyses of shade tolerant photovoltaic modules with low breakdown voltage solar cells.<br","IBC solar cells; low breakdown voltages; narrow gap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It provides a reliability-based approach to the study case Kijfhoek and uses a multi-body dynamic model to simulate the collisions. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed implementing over twenty-five parameters to determine the probability of damage in case of a rear-end collision. From the results, a simplified method is designed to assess the probability of damage to the wagon’s structure. This method uses a newly found relation to determine the absorbed energy at the impact interface in case of a collision. Furthermore, the simplified method reduced the calculation to five parameters and an analytically solvable Limit State function. A first-order reliability method shows that the impact velocity is the single most important parameter in determining the probability of damage. <br/>The simplified method also allows for site-specific values and gives insight into the system and the most important parameters.

(mentor); Alonso Mora, J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Mobile manipulators will be deployed in supermarkets for a large variety of tasks, for instance, for restocking products. The operation time of mobile manipulators can be reduced by generating coupled trajectories for the base and the robot's arm. When planning for high Degree of Freedom (DOF) robots, such as a mobile manipulator, in an obstacle-cluttered environment, the graph construction for sampling-based planners is time-consuming. If changes in the environment occur, most sampling-based algorithms reconstruct the entire graph. In some dynamic environments, planning can be simplified by the assumption of an incrementally changing environment; this is a mostly static environment where slight changes occur that do not violate the connectivity of the free configuration space, indicating that a significant part of the graph remains valid.<br/><br/>The main contribution of this thesis is a new motion planning algorithm: the adaptive roadmap algorithm (ARM). ARM is a multi-query sampling-based motion planning algorithm that can locally adapt vertices and edges of the graph to account for incremental changes in the environment to allow faster planning than algorithms that reconstruct the entire graph. ARM generates a 3D grid to represent the workspace. The grid cells are marked as occupied or free based on the presence of obstacles in the environment. To determine what vertices and edges of the roadmap need to be updated due to a change in the occupancy of the 3D grid by an incremental change, ARM assigns the vertices and edges to the 3D grid cells. ARM performs this assignment based on the workspace representations of the vertices and edges of the roadmap by 3D bounding boxes surrounding robot configurations. If the occupancy of one or multiple grid cells is changed due to an obstacle, the algorithm resamples the vertices associated with the occupied grid cells and removes the edges associated with the occupied grid cells. Then, the updated roadmap is used for motion planning, and if additional changes occur, this roadmap update is repeated.<br/><br/>We carried out different experiments in simulation performing coupled motion planning for mobile manipulators. A simplified implementation of ARM, which enables the implementation in the Robot Operating System, reported a 35-40% speedup of the planning time compared to the single-query algorithm rapidly-exploring random tree, which reconstructs the entire graph for every new query or change in the environment. The speedup the simplified implementation gained compared to existing planners will be magnified for the non-simplified ARM as the roadmap adaptation by ARM is 10% faster than by the simplified ARM. Further experiments demonstrated that the algorithm successfully adapted the roadmap for a real-world system, not merely in simulation. We conclude that local roadmap adaptation by our proposed algorithm allows faster planning than algorithms that reconstruct the entire graph for mobile manipulators in incrementally changing environments.","Motion planning; Sampling-based planners; Mobile manipulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A detailed study was conducted to better understand the dynamics and possible limitations of the electron beam lithography machine. It was found that the stage motion generates a reaction force on the system, and this reaction force induces oscillations in the system resulting in the electron beam error. Furthermore, for sparse patterns, stage motion and electron beam settling consume most of the operation time. A solution method is proposed where an X­-stage counter mass and a fourth-­order trajectory generator is incorporated in the current system. This results in the elimination of system oscillations, reducing the settling time of the beam to zero and a reduction in stage motion time by 20%.","Dynamics; e-beam lithography; System Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The unbalance can cause issues such as capacity underutilisation, transformer losses and problems with induction motors. To ensure the reliability of the upstream grid, it is important to maintain balanced three-phase power. This becomes more relevant with the proliferation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and storage. This thesis explores the use of power electronic devices as a power redistributor.<br/>To begin with, different topologies of a converter are discussed. These topologies have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. Based on various operating and design parameters, a comparison between these topologies is made.<br/>Subsequently, different control strategies for the converter are analysed. Among these, the current control strategy ensures supply of balanced and sinusoidal current to the loads with low computational burden, and is hence chosen. This strategy involves the control of sequence components independently in the double synchronous reference frame.<br/>Low-frequency harmonics occur in the DC-link as a result of the compensation of negative-and zero-sequence components by the converter. The magnitude of this low-frequency harmonic and the overall harmonic Root Mean Square (RMS) current in the DC-link are derived mathematically and validated by simulations to represent this converter. It is observed that the DC-link sizing is mainly dependent on the low-frequency harmonics and thus, their accurate estimation will help in better sizing of the DC-side components.<br/>The various configurations of the converter under consideration are benchmarked against each other on parameters such as Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Power Losses, and DC-Link Sizing.","3P4W; Compensation; Redistribution; Power electronics; Sequence components; Power Unbalance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The propeller is positioned at an angle of attack with respect to the freestream which causes a variation in loading along the azimuth. The propeller is operated at 4000 RPM with an advance ratio of J = 0.4, corresponding to a free stream velocity of 8 m/s. The chord-based Reynolds number of the propeller is of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> and is investigated at two angles of attack: α<sub>r</sub> = 7.5° and α<sub>r</sub> = 15°. For reference, a steady case, α<sub>r</sub> = 0◦, is presented as well. Loads and noise measurements were carried out in the A-Tunnel of TU-Delft. Two microphone array configurations were used to mimic the observers positions above and underneath the flightpath of the propeller. Underneath the flightpath, an increase in SPL was found with increase of the rotor angle of attack. Above the flightpath, the opposite effect was observed, resulting in an asymmetrical directivity profile when the rotor is at an angle of attack. A quasi-steady loading model, based on the lifting line code Xrotor, is used to determine the azimuthal variation in loading. The variation in tip speed along the azimuth due to the propeller angle of attack is prescribed to determine the variation in loading in one rotation. Far-field loading and thickness noise are computed using an aeroacoustic model based on the Ffowcs-Williams &amp; Hawkings’ equation to predict the harmonic noise in the frequency domain of a rotating dipole and monopole, respectively. The numerical predictions for the steady case show good agreement for both the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance when compared with loading and noise measurements. For the α<sub>r</sub>≠<sub> </sub>0° cases it was shown that unsteady loading noise increases the SPL for all harmonics, with a larger contribution at higher harmonics.","Aeroacoustics; Low Reynolds number; propeller angle of attack; Experimental; FWH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The HVA as an institute has an outspoken ambition to improve their waste management with a focus on sustainability. They previously asked several student groups to research specific elements of sustainability within their waste management. This report however, will approach the waste management as a whole and will shed light on what is important to successfully improve their waste management considering all its aspects. The report starts off with a literature review which explains the holistic nature of waste management dilemmas. The literature also shows that the success of sustainable waste management largely depends on the willingness of all involved parties to comply. Therefore, it is important to first create an in-depth understanding of the organizational structure behind the waste management, to ensure all individual management bodies within the organizational structure are on the same page. This is also reflected in the explained mythological approach and the formulation of the research questions. Following the re- search questions, first the organizational structure of the HVAs waste management will be evaluated with a series of interviews and a survey. The interviewees were chosen based on their close involvement with a specific management body within the organizational structure. After the waste management as an organization is established, the waste streams within the HVA are estimated. For a holistic understanding of the waste streams an estimation on the quantity, quality, and composition of all the waste that comes through the HVA is determined. The estimations were made by using data that was made available by the HVAs current waste disposal partner RENEWI, and where later confirmed by verifying them with comparable data sets. Additionally the material based waste streams were evaluated on their environmental impacts, when disposed of on different levels in the waste Hierarchy. With the full understanding of the waste itself and the organization, potential improvement areas are determined. To find fitting solutions the literature on waste managements of higher educational institutes around the world were looked at and experts where approached for in-depth interviews. The results once again emphasized the importance of a holistic approach, pointing out that the success of a sustainable waste management can be significantly harmed by a single unwilling or unknowing actor. It is therefore suggested to involve the students as much as possible, to establish a continuous spread of awareness. Another result is the importance of knowledge on the waste, this can be achieved by better regulating the purchases and drawing information from them. As well as performing waste audits to determine the outflow waste. Putting these two data sets next to each other can uncover preventable problems.","Sustainability; Waste Management; Higher Educational Institutes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the different applications and requirements in each of these sectors the combination of multiple technologies with different characteristics will be needed. Among these technologies, Solid Oxide Cells have shown huge potential and increasing attention based on their unique characteristics. This research advocates for pushing further the integration of renewable energy sources trough Solid Oxide Cell based systems.<br/><br/>At first, a review of the state-of-the-art technologies for sector coupling and energy storage is presented, the limitations and challenges at the sector level are addressed, and the value and research status of Solid Oxide Cell systems is conveyed. A selection of suitable sector coupling applications has been done based on SOC unique characteristics. Their functional requirements have been investigated for the future system design. The selected processes have been modeled in Aspen Plus to further conduct an energy and exergy analysis with the objective to understand the effect of the operating conditions and functional requirements on the thermodynamic performance. To conclude, a techno-economic analysis has been performed to determine the economic competitiveness and feasibility of these systems.<br/><br/>Through the thermodynamic optimization, in electrolysis mode exergy efficiencies of 78.93% and 80.38% are achieved for the methane-based and methanol-based system respectively. When operating thermoneutral, lower temperatures are desirable for both systems, but pressurization only has positive effects in the methane case. The upgrading process has a considerable impact on the process performance highly dependent on the operating conditions. In fuel cell operation, the methane-based system achieves 60.33% in comparison with 52.10% for methanol at high temperatures and environmental pressure. From a techno-economic perspective, stack cost is the main driver of the plant capital cost highly influenced by current density and lifetime, while the operational costs are mainly determined by electricity and carbon price. Onshore wind is presented as the best alternative for renewable energy supply due to higher capacity factors, under realistic considerations a 445 EUR/tn LCOMEOH is accomplished which could become market-competitive for future carbon emission’s prices.","Solid Oxide Cell; Sector Coupling; Energy Storage; Power-to-X; Electrolysis; Fuel Cell; Exergy Analysis; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

High success rates in the detection of leaves and subsequent cutting action are required, which are limited by occlusion and the unstructured, dynamic greenhouse environment. As a consequence of manipulator constraints, detected leaves can not always be cut from the current robot position. In addition, detected leaves with an unfavorable approach angle are skipped as cut quality can not be guaranteed. Conversely, many leaves are not detected at positions from where they can be cut due to detection limitations. By combining detections from different viewpoints, the detection rate can be increased significantly. Moreover, fusing multiple detections of the same object is known to improve detection accuracy.

The surface composition can change during operation due to segregation, thus controlling and predicting the surface composition is essential. Computational modelling can aid in predicting the alloy's stability, along with designing surface alloys and near-surface alloys which can outperform existing catalysts. A computational model to predict surface segregation in ternary alloys is developed. The model is based on Miedema's semi-empirical model that is used to predict mixing enthalpies. The segregation enthalpy is parameterized to describe pairwise interactions between nearest-neighbours and then used in Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo simulations enable to predict short-range ordering in the surface and subsurfaces; both affect the performance of a material as a catalyst. The computational model obtained in this work is able to screen through a vast range of alloy compositions and can qualitatively predict the alloy's stability in a gas environment. In this thesis the model is applied to design a novel ternary Pd-based material for membranes that can be used to separate hydrogen from a gas mixture. Addition of specific amounts of Cu and Zr to Pd results in a material with reduced H2S poisoning as compared to a pure Pd surface as well as an enhanced permeability. The computational model obtained in this work allows to systematically assess the composition of ternary surface alloys and near-surface alloys and is a large improvement over the trial and error approaches currently used.","surface; segregation; Pd-based alloys; ternary; Monte Carlo simulation; Miedema's model; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-20","","","","","",""

Also in defence applications localisation of hidden objects in water is important. If the objects are made of magnetic materials, they disturb the Earth magnetic field. This disturbance is called the object's magnetic signature. An aerial drone that carries magnetic field sensors could in principle be able to locate magnetic objects autonomously. Another defence-related application of such a drone would be estimating magnetic signatures of ships under water, using measurements above water - signature translation. For both applications, algorithms need to be developed that process magnetic field data, and computes estimates. In this thesis, data-driven techniques are applied to the localisation problem and the magnetic signature translation problem.<br/><br/>For the localisation problem, an algorithm is proposed to localise a magnetic dipole using a limited number of noisy measurements from a sensor array forming a horizontal grid. The algorithm is based on the theory of compressed sensing. In the algorithm, a number of sensors is chosen which perform each a measurement of the three magnetic field components. The sensors can be chosen randomly from the sensor array, but also optimal placement using QR pivoting is considered. Using the obtained field measurements, a sparse representation in the location domain is computed using L1-optimisation. Based on the resulting sparse representation, a classification is produced, which consists of estimates on its location and on its magnetic moment magnitude and orientation. The possibility of performing iterations is explored, where the basis and chosen sensors improve after every location estimate. Using results from simulations as well as experiments, the algorithm is shown to be effective in localising magnetic dipoles.<br/><br/>To solve the signature translation problem, two approaches are investigated. One algorithm was developed using the Gappy POD technique, and one using neural networks. Using only a few measurements (a gappy measurement), a full signal can be reconstructed. This method is adapted to also be able to translate from a field above a ship to a field below a ship. Tikhonov regularisation is applied in the process to obtain better results. Second, different neural networks are created, trained using data above and below a ship. Linear and non-linear networks are compared, and standard loss functions are compared to physics-guided losses. Both the Gappy POD based algorithm and linear neural networks are shown to give good magnetic signature estimates. The Gappy POD method is greatly improved by applying Tikhonov regularisation. Results show to improve when more basis modes are considered, and when more sensors are used for measurements. Linear neural networks show the same results as Gappy POD using Tikhonov regularisation, indicating that some regularisation is done while training the neural network. Non-linear neural networks show no improvement over linear ones, and a physics-guided loss function is not needed for a resulting field that obeys known laws of magnetism.","Data-driven methods; Magnetism; Compressed sensing; Neural network; Gappy POD; Magnetic signature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there is a lack of consistent and clear support for this group. The tips for loved ones that can be found on the websites of euthanasia organizations are often about how to support the person who wants euthanasia. Less support is available on how to deal with this process emotionally as a loved one.<br/><br/>The Nederlandse Vereniging voor een Vrijwillig Levenseinde (NVVE) is involved as the client of this project. They provide support and information to people who want to apply for euthanasia (Missie en visie, z.d.). <br/><br/>Every euthanasia process is different, every person deals with this differently, but design can support people to find a way to get through this carefully. In this project, the research focus is on the process of people with physical health issues. The process is looked at, from the moment the conversation with loved ones about euthanasia starts until the grieving with other loved ones afterward. <br/><br/>This project is based on an extensive context research process. During this stage the different players in the system of euthanasia within the NVVE were interviewed. The main research was focused on the loved ones and the NVVE. The loved ones were both interviewed and had a booklet to share their story. This resulted into a list of recognizable themes for loved ones. The analysis of the data resulted into a design vision and interaction vision. <br/><br/>Design vision: <br/>“Design to foster the beauty of the process, by creating moments of silence and evaluation during the process of euthanasia.”<br/>Based on these visions the concept “moments of silence” was created. Together with a roadmap for the NVVE which shows them possible next steps to give more support to the loved ones. <br/><br/>From the evaluation sessions it can be concluded that both the NVVE and the loved ones see potential in this concept. They both recognize the need for recognition and support for the loved ones. They recognize that standing still will help the loved ones to reflect about their own experience and help to create and cherish the beautiful moment together. <br/><br/>Moments of silence<br/>The concept “Moments of silence” is a product-service combination for the NVVE which helps the loved ones to create moments of reflection during the process to be able to see/cherish the beauty of that process. <br/><br/>The folder will guide the reader through seven recognizable themes for loved ones during the process of euthanasia. Each theme consists of several stories which are based on real stories. They can either read or listen the stories, which fits their style of processing at that moment. Afterwards, the loved ones are asked to reflect on the theme in their own way. Positive questions and assignments are formulated to stimulate positive reflection.

Large wind speeds and the abundance of potential wind farm locations make Offshore Wind Turbines an interesting solution. Because of high continuous dynamic loading and extreme environmental conditions, the structural design requires a detailed assessment, especially in the Fatigue Limit State. In this thesis, the focus lies on improving the modeling of monopile foundations for Offshore Wind Turbines, which could pave the way towards more efficient foundation design.<br/><br/>The conventional method of modeling the monopile foundation of an Offshore Wind Turbine is with a nonlinear elastic distributed spring stiffness along the monopile (using p-y curves). Damping related to the soil is considered through either global damping (like Rayleigh damping) or local viscous damping. However, the response of the soil around the monopile under wind and wave loading is better described through a nonlinear hysteretic (rate-independent) model, which is computationally demanding to model in the time domain. Next to that, a conventional frequency domain method can not be combined with any nonlinearity. Therefore, linear elastic models are used to model the soil response in frequency-domain simulations.<br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to combine a nonlinear hysteretic soil model with a frequency-domain analysis. A response amplitude-dependent linearization of the nonlinear hysteretic element is made. The combination of the response amplitude-dependent element with an iterative solution strategy, the Equivalent Linear method, is shown to approximate a nonlinear time-integration under both harmonic and multiharmonic loading, as long as the nonlinearity is limited. <br/><br/>A nonlinear hysteretic model is fit to available soil reaction data and a response amplitude-dependent linearization is generated. A Finite Element model that can be combined with the Equivalent Linear method is set up and verified with a case study structural model of an Offshore Wind Turbine. The model is subjected to (high) Fatigue Limit State wave loading. The results are compared to both a conventional frequency-domain method (with a linear elastic small-strain soil model) and a nonlinear time-domain method (with a nonlinear elastic soil model). The deflections and deflection spectra in the foundation found through the Equivalent Linear method correspond to results from the nonlinear time-domain method, provided the influence of higher harmonics is limited and the response has a similar amplitude throughout the analyzed time window. <br/><br/>Results from the Equivalent Linear method show that the main frequency of the first resonance peak is around 2% smaller than the first natural frequency of the system, which is consistent with the results found through the nonlinear time-domain method. The identified soil damping in the first mode is 0.64-0.8% critical (4-5% log. dec.), which is similar to other literature. By combining observed system properties with literature about fatigue damage estimation, a hypothesis is stated: the fatigue damage in the foundation calculated through an Equivalent Linear method with a nonlinear hysteretic soil model will be lower than the fatigue damage calculated through a nonlinear time-domain method with a nonlinear elastic soil model.<br/><br","Offshore Wind Turbine; Monopile foundation; nonlinear hysteresis; Frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Even worse, research has shown data breaches are still waiting to happen. The occurrence of a data breach has consequences for several involved parties and for society in general. It is therefore only natural that there exists a pursuit to prevent data breaches from happening. Research claims that data breaches happen because of simple and preventable errors made by human, also known as security misconfigurations. This study aims to investigate whether the root causes of severe data breaches are frequently related to security misconfigurations, which would make most data breaches preventable. No such structured research had been done before. We conducted a multiple case study, wherein a number of data breaches was analysed based on publicly available case literature. Assessing the data breaches with the help of our developed framework was part of that analysis, resulting in a systematic characterization of each data breach. The results indicate that in breaches the data are mostly subject to unauthorized access by outsiders, which frequently is made possible by poor security. The organizations directly responsible for that data are large organizations which get breached especially in their storage facilities. Next to the organization which got breached, these sizeable data breaches always affect individuals since at least part of the compromised data is about them or linkable to them. Usually this is not even discovered by the breached organization itself and sometimes only after a long period of time. Ultimately, it can be concluded that data are frequently caused by security misconfigurations and therefore are mostly preventable. On this basis, it is recommended that organizations responsible for sensitive data should be more incentivized to thoroughly combat security misconfigurations, instead of treating IT security as only a technical endeavor.","Data Breach; Security Misconfiguration; Root Cause","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In this thesis research, it was examined to what extent the large-scale implementation of Azolla-based livestock feed production will affect the future environmental sustainability performance of the Dutch livestock feed sector, in the context of the transition to a circular agricultural system (CAS). To that end, two novel, circular, Azolla-based feed production systems (FPSs) were designed as alternatives to the incumbent, linear, soy-based FPS. Subsequently, these FPSs were combined into three feed production scenarios: a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario which primarily relies on soy, as well as a local farming project (LFP) and a regional supply chains (RSC) scenario, in which the Azolla-based FPSs become dominant by 2050. The environmental impacts of each scenario were quantified in an ex-ante life cycle assessment (LCA), using the Activity Browser (AB) modelling tool. It appeared that, under the given assumptions, the LFP and RSC scenarios perform substantially better on all included environmental indicators by mid-century. This study opens the way for more profound future-oriented environmental modelling research, and recommends follow-up research on the biogeochemical carbon cycle of agro-industrial production systems in an LCA context, the development of fore- and background data for (circular) feed production, and the advancement of the AB software tool.","Agro-industrial systems; Scenario-based modelling; Livestock feed; Life cycle assessment; Circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Giventhe pressure natural selection imposes onto living beings to optimize their body plans, eukaryotic flagella have demonstrated to be an optimal organelle for propulsion at low Reynolds numbers. Therefore, understanding how cilia beat is of central importance to understand any biological process involving the motion of a fluid. The well conserved internal structure of cilia, the axoneme, has been thoroughly reported but there is still no scientific agreement on how oscillations can emerge from the combina-<br/>tion of the myriad different components forming the axoneme. Current theories base their approaches on complex control mechanism to control the activity of the axonemal molecular motors, the dyneins. In the present thesis we propose a much simpler mechanism, demonstrating that no dyneins activity regulation mechanism is required since oscillations naturally emerge from the axoneme undergoing a dynamic buckling instability triggered by a system of follower forces exerted by the molecular motors.<br/><br/>Here, we first derive a numerical spectral methods solver to resolve the dynamics of a slender filament immersed in a low Reynolds fluid. We then use the solver to explain the emergence of oscillations in simplified synthetic versions of cilia. The structural simplicity of these experiments helps to identify the presence of follower forces and to model the structure, observing that our predictions based on the mechanical instability are in agreement with the experimental results. Given that a follower force can explain the dynamics of synthetic cilia, we then apply the model to study possible configurations of forces in the axoneme which can trigger the instability even if it is an isolated system, finding that the axoneme can indeed undergo a dynamic buckling instability leading to self-sustained oscillations reminiscent of cilia.<br/><br/>We finally build a minimal version of the model to capture the dynamics of cilia, simplifying the axoneme as a filament subject to a tip concentrated, tangential and compressive follower force. We use it to study the synchronization of cilia with external hydrodynamic and mechanical forcings and with another cilium, being able to capture non-linear features of flagellar dynamics which has been experimentally observed but previous simpler flagellar models fail to capture.","Eukaryotic cilia; eukaryotic flagella; axoneme beating; mechanical instability; buckling; dynamic buckling; follower force; emergence; synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a dataset of network scan data of The Hague as the empirical context for the defined knowledge gap, this research aims to look into the vulnerabilities IoT devices carry, and then look into relevant stakeholders to see what they can do through governance and why they are not doing this. To answer the main research question: How can the municipality of The Hague use governance instruments to decrease cyber vulnerabilities in IoT devices? <br/>Using a literature study to define IoT concepts and the governance of IoT and current governance examples, background information is provided for the rest of this research. The database of 1649 IP addresses of network scan data from the area of The Hague is then used to find what vulnerabilities are present and what stakeholders are identifiable from this data. Exploring this network scan data showed only 191 devices are fully identifiable from the total number of IP addresses. These devices all carry vulnerabilities for the user of these devices, and being visible is by itself a vulnerability. No device owners could be directly identified, only the providers of the networks these devices are found in. This results in the identifiable stakeholders from the dataset: ISPs and device manufacturers. <br/>Governance options are defined for these stakeholders (e.g. security-by-design, informing users etc.). These options are assessed on viability and validity through semi-structured interviews with three ISPs and the municipality. <br/>The conclusion found is that the most viable action to take is informing device users since secure configuration and usage of a device would take away vulnerabilities while waiting for European legislation to be implemented. This legislation will force more security-by-design. The recommendation for the municipality is to take the role of leading actor, provide a better problematization with the data available, and use this to generate more urgency with other stakeholders. Starting public-private partnerships (with ISPs, device vendors, universities, other municipalities: different perspectives to progress the problem) and starting information campaigns and therefore try to reach as many people as possible.

Furthermore, this study takes a dynamic stock analysis approach to look into material stock- and flow dynamics of European household furniture and project them over time. A total of 11 material categories in 14 furniture product categories are assessed. Using principles of dynamic stock analysis and IMAGE data on population and residential floorspace per capita: a Python model has been developed to assess required furniture- and material stocks, the required primary material used in furniture production and the total amount of recycled- and landfilled material per year, and to project the results overtime. To further inform the model, a material database is developed, containing material- and lifetime information on 14 furniture product categories and a survey (n=108) on household furniture has been conducted to derive furniture intensities per unit residential surface. To project the development of material stocks- and flows in European household furniture over time, two scenarios are defined: the business-as-usual or the ‘baseline’ scenario and a second scenario called ‘the reduced waste scenario’ in which reuse and recycle fractions are gradually increased over time. Following business-as-usual patterns in the baseline scenario, the total material stock for furniture is projected to increase with roughly 97 Mt (or 20%) to 584 Mt, towards 2050. The total amount of landfilled- and recycled waste material from household furniture is estimated to be 36 Mt and 4 Mt respectively in 2050. The total amount of required primary material is estimated to increase to 38.5 Mt in total in 2050. In the reduced waste scenario, the total amount of landfilled material is estimated to decrease to 15 Mt in 2050, where the amount of recycled material is estimated to increase to 15 Mt. Also the amount of required primary material is estimated to decrease to less than 18 Mt in 2050. The results from the reduced waste scenario show that a gradual increase from the reuse fraction from 2021 onwards (from 6% to 35% with a 1% step per year) and a gradual increase from the recycle fraction from 2021 onwards (from 10% to 50% with a 2% step per year), would be enough to reduce the need for primary material by half towards 2050. Based on these results, it is the author’s conviction that furniture should be given a separate waste status, similar to that of cars as set out in the end-of-life vehicle directive (European Commission, 2000): materials inside furniture should be labelled and furniture manufacturers should develop dismantling guidelines for their products to ease repair, remanufacturing and recycling. Targets should be set on the country level for the recycling of waste furniture and for the use of recycled (furniture) material in primary production. … Let’s wake up to furniture waste.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Atza, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The potato is a plant that can grow from another potato tuber. Farmers and producers have to contend with the declining quality of soil and are producing less vital potato tubers. The differences in emergence speed between batches of the same variety of potato tubers cannot be explained. This is why Project ‘Flight to Vitality’ (FtV) is developing a diagnostic test to make predictions about the vitality of different varieties of potato tubers, with various measurements. One of these measurements consists of hyperspectral images taken from potato tubers, prior to planting. Another measurement is the actual growth of the potato plants, which was recorded after emerging. This thesis attempts to relate both measurements by means of regression. After grouping both data sets on each batch of tubers, we are left with an explanatory matrix that has more columns than rows. This causes an ordinary least squares model to overfit new data. Therefore an alternative regression model is proposed, which is Partial Least Squares (PLS). The goal of PLS is to find latent variables, that maximizes the covariance between both sets, to explain the variance in the explanatory space as good as possible, and to provide good predictions on the response space. The predictive performance of PLS, which is for the most part measured with the Mean Squared Error, relies on the number of latent variables used. Cross-validation is performed for finding this number. By splitting the data into training and testing sets, we evaluate PLS and find that some of the variances are explained well with PLS. This model is extended by including variable selection on the explanatory variables, which are the frequency bands taken from hyperspectral imaging. With this extension, the same experiment was rerun and we saw that the predictive performance can increase. However, the number of variables omitted seem to be inconsistent across different experiments. We have also found that the performance can slightly decrease, but the number of omitted variables remain much more consistent (and were overlapping across different experiments). With this established baseline model, we have also looked at the predictive information on different tuber parts. By conducting a similar experiment, it appears that the model is capable of explaining almost all variance and performs outstanding. We have also looked at leaving one tuber variety out before training the model. This variety is then used for evaluation. From this experiment, it seems that there is a strong variety-dependent component found in the FtV data, which makes it impossible to predict the relative vitality of the tubers. Finally, we compare PLS with another model that belongs to the same Krylov Subspace method, which is LSQR. The same experiment is conducted on both models and it seems like PLS and LSQR are not identical in terms of finding the number of latent variables used. Regardless, as an independent regression estimator, LSQR is much faster than PLS.","Least Squares Regression; Hyperspectral Imaging; Partial Least Squares","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their experience will get lost when they retire; therefore, it can be valuable for future metal workers to capture the forming process of a double curved plate theoretically. An analytical description and understanding of the forming process will help craftsmen. In the future, it could even lead to the development of automatic forming machines.<br/>This research investigates plastic deformation initiated by a rolling and a three point bending machine forming a saddle shaped plate. A 2Doptimization for the three point bending process is performed using beam theory. A single bend is validated by a 2D Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The rolling process is analytically described by equations obtained from literature. These equations are used to find a relation between the material stretching/membrane strains and the rolling forces. Furthermore, an elastic perfectly plastic stress strain curve is used. Material hardening and residual stresses due to repeated bending or rolling operations are not taken into account.<br/>The bending optimization resulted in the least number of bending operations needed over a cross section, assuming the cross section behaves like a beam. The rolling equations resulted in required rolling forces for a desired membrane strain. The craftsmen know by experience that bending operations should be performed first to initiate a first curvature. Thereafter, the plate is rolled to initiate the second curvature and form the saddle shape.<br/>In this thesis, the first steps are taken to capture and predict the manual forming process of double curvature steel plates. Future work on this topic should take the 3D-effects of the three point bending into account which lead to more accurate analytical descriptions.

(graduation committee); Almar, Rafael (mentor); Bergsma, Erwin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To effectively mitigate environmental changes and to manage coastal environments, a good under- standing of nearshore bathymetry and its evolution is required. The coastal zone is expected to be vulnerable in the foreseeable future due to the combined effects of increased coastal impacts and a growing coastal population. The use of spaceborne remote sensing methods has been developed in recent decades to estimate nearshore bathymetry. Compared to traditional methods, spaceborne remote sensing techniques offer a relatively large spatial coverage as well as frequent temporal mon- itoring. The Sentinel-2 mission (EC/ESA) is potentially able to provide regular bathymetry estima- tions, mainly due to its significant revisit time and freely accessible data.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the development of a spatio-temporal cross-correlation model in order to construct a one-minute wave-representing video. The video is used to show the potential for wave- derived bathymetry estimation, exploiting a DMD-based DIA to invert depth. The model is ap- plied to two distinct datasets: a synthetic FUNWAVE dataset and Sentinel-2 imagery. The Sentinel-2 imagery covers research sites in Saint-Louis, Senegal and Capbreton, France. An application frame- work related to the model is furthermore developed by analysing a set of synthetic sinusoidal waves.<br/><br/>Three model requirements are created based on the research objectives. The model should show wave propagation for at least one minute and, moreover, the waves in the video should accurately represent the wave field. Both requirements are demanded by the use of a DMD-based DIA. Lastly, the resulting video should enable an accurate bathymetry estimation. Based on the requirements, the developed spatio-temporal cross-correlation model includes four model parts: pre-processing, image resolution augmentation, wave characteristics estimation and video construction.<br/><br/>The research has led to a range of insights. A discrepancy between the quality of constructed videos and related bathymetry estimations is observed. The videos as constructed by the model generally show a good representation of average wave propagation for a sufficiently long duration, while the bathymetry estimations are less accurate. The low quality of bathymetry estimations is explained by three main error sources: celerity estimation errors, the applied filtering methods and the way in which the video is constructed. These three error sources together lead to videos that lack pixel-wise detail and therefore decrease the bathymetry estimation quality. The developed application frame- work shows that estimating wave characteristics from Sentinel-2 imagery by means of the model is at the edge of possibilities. In temporal sense, relatively large celerity estimation errors are expected for wave periods lower than 5 s and higher than 7 s. The model is less sensitive for spatial parame- ters: as long as wavelengths are larger than circa 150 m the celerity estimation error is acceptable.<br/><br/>All together, the developed model and related video constructions offer added value, although not for the purpose of a bathymetry estimation by means of a DMD-based DIA. The constructed videos represent wave propagation in an average sense and can therefore be exploited for wave-related purposes, e.g. obtaining wave spectra, estimating dominant wave direction and estimating wave climates. In general, the video offers a way to enlarge the temporal range of Sentinel-2 imagery. It is furthermore concluded that the model is probably more suitable for use in combination with other types of imagery, including satellite imagery with larger burst duration and increased spatial resolution as well as standard video imagery.","sentinel-2; Bathymetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Brand, D.I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This graduation project is done with the Industrial Design Engineering faculty for the Master’s programme Integrated Product Design (IPD) and cooperating with the End Of Life Lab. Loop-Biotech is a Dutch start-up based at YES Delft and sells the product the ‘Living coffin’. A coffin made out of the living material mycelium. Loop’s purpose is to enrich nature and has the ambition to restore the human-nature relationship. Its objective is to grow its business and become a trend worldwide. The scope for this project concerns Natural burial in the Netherlands. 1. Introduction The reasons for the research are to ensure consumers’ wellbeing and meet their needs. The current design can cause stress and insecurities with the end-user and providers due to product failure and design mistakes. Internal communication with Loop showed a desire to improve the shape, experience and production process. The assignment of the project is to redesign the mycelium coffin to reflect and communicate the contribution to the cycle-of-life through aesthetics and create an experience to support the funeral ritual. The research will be used as input to realise this goal. As guidance for the development of mycelium or fungi-based products and growing in the funeral industry, the main research question is as follows: How can a mycelium funeral vessel be designed on a technical and experiential level to support and optimise its meaningful value in the funeral industry? 2. Research The research investigates five topics; These five topics mainly focus on providing insights about the current coffin, opportunities for the funeral ritual in the industry, the material and a contribution to the cycle-of-life. (1) The company: Research about the production, company and current coffin. The ‘coffin’ product perception causes failure and insecurities during usage. (2) The material mycelium: Testing the material’s performance with the MDD method shows it is possible to see and feel the material, which emphasises the material’s naturalness and ‘living’ characteristics. Additionally, the basic instinct of the material (to demolish) is suppressed, and products are shaped in basic shapes and forms. (3) The market: The funeral industry is changing and teaches us that it will move in four directions. Personalisation of mortuary rituals, increasing environmental awareness, high-quality services and death becoming a more accessible topic to talk about. (4) The end-users, researched through interviews and desktop research, are expected to follow the trends the funeral industry provides. They feel the need to mourn the death of someone, come together, perform a ritual and create a meditative experience that intends to help with emotional healing and thereby creating a memorable moment through a greener burial ritual. (5) The providers are researched through interviews and desktop research. Providers want to present consumers with product and service options that are sustainable and biodegradable. The natural burial trend meets the needs and offers opportunities. Since they do not want to overkill the consumer, simplicity and back-to-nature will become more popular styles to offer. 3. Design direction With the improvement of design elements, this project will showcase an experience supporting and enriching the funeral process experience using aesthetics and rituals. “Design a funeral vessel that includes an optimised mould system for sustainable production and product-use, while creating a memorable moment when life comes to an end”. The challenge is to create a different product perception. The ambition for the redesign is to distance the consumer’s perception from a coffin and stimulate perception as a vessel or Cocoon for the body. 4. Ideation The diverging phase, described in this chapter, shows the search for a design that fits the design direction. It investigates possibilities that are used later on during the concept design phase. Methods such as collage-making, brainstorming, sketching, and a speedform study are selected, and the required physics are investigated. All the requirements and wishes eliminate ideas that do not meet these demands. The ideation resulted in three concepts. 5. Conceptualisation For the concept design phase, three concept designs are developed equally. The design process of the three concepts is visualised. Different elements (the shape, the interaction and the production) are worked out apart. 6. Final Design The research, ideation and conceptualisation resulted in the redesign of The Loop Cocoon. To allow the transformation from death into new life, restore a connection with nature and create a memorable moment when life comes to an end. 7. Recommendations and discussion The recommendations concerning the aesthetics, samples, functional development, sustainability, the assembly process and costs are discussed. They can be used as future steps to develop the Cocoon into a fully functional product. The discussion provided a project evaluation and personal reflection.","Mycelium; Funeral industry; Coffin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

We exposed participants to 4 conditions, employing a within-subject experiment design, manipulating our independent variables motion and motivation. We collected motion sickness data via the motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire, misery scale and motion<br/>sickness assessment questionnaire; motivation data via the situational motivation scale; workload data via the NASA TLX workload scale and task performance data via the total score obtained, the total time spent on the task and the average time spent per question. We found that our motion profile caused motion sickness in participants, with some evidence for habituation. We also found some evidence for training effects present in our data. Performance decrements, associated workload and motivation scores across the 4 conditions were statistically similar and we could not conclusively prove our hypotheses. Further analysis showed that amotivation scores almost showed significant effect on task performance which does match anecdotal evidence. MSAQ scores also negatively affected how much time people could spend on a cognitive task. We found that workload scores of participants increased significantly with increase in motion sickness which could give<br/>us an insight on performing cognitive tasks under sickness. Overall, our experiment design could not show the trends that we had hypothesized, and we obtained partial results via our secondary analysis. Our findings indicate that further attention is to be given to the motivation variable to make it more robust. Further, a much large sample size is needed to better test our hypotheses, with perhaps, a mixed subject design for our study. Our study also showed an unexpected interaction of lateral and londitudinal motion profiles, causing significantly higher levels of sickness than what was predicted using existing models, which warrants further research into the same.","Motion Sickness; Cognitive performance; Motivation theory; comfort; Intelligent Vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thereby, the transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) aims to keep products in use and to design out waste. In the construction industry, one way of reducing the use of raw materials is by transforming waste residuals from demolition projects into resources to be reused. By implementing these resources in new buildings, the supply of harvested (structural) elements and the demand for resources in new buildings can be matched. Due to the high amount of embodied carbon in superstructures, this research focuses on the reuse potential of harvested concrete (structural) elements in the design of new buildings. The demolition and construction of buildings are analysed from the point of view of structural engineers with an extensive literature study, interviews and a case-study. This resulted in the process of ‘Deconstruct &amp; Reuse’, which includes all information required to assess the reuse potential. The assessment is made operational in the Decision Support Tool, which makes this research the first of its kind. For use in practice, the Decision Support Tool is validated and verified with a test-case that considers the disassembling of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) in Amsterdam. In the Decision Support Tool, the test-case is executed by the researcher and by experts resulting in remarks, opportunities, challenges and further research. In conclusion, the Decision Support Tool has a high practical value as it stimulates the reuse of concrete elements through an operational method. The output provides valuable insights with which a structural engineer can decide if a harvested (structural) element can be reused and implemented in a new building. Hence, the assessment of the reuse potential is considered to be a step towards circularity in the construction industry.","Deconstruct; Circular Economy; Sustainable Design; Structural Engineering; Reuse; Reuse Potential; Decision Support Tool; Disassembling; Concrete; Existing building stock; End of Life; Construction Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (graduation committee); Nijsse, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The usage of tanks has been quite common throughout the industry during the last decades. They fall into the category of shell structures and this is how they need to be studied. The focus of this thesis is concentrated on ground based thin cylindrical tanks filled with water made out of steel. Thin shells are susceptible to buckling, a phenomenon that takes several forms and calls for extra attention. The one which is investigated is shear buckling through the application of a static horizontal ground earthquake force on a clamped at the top tank. Such a problem is quite common nowadays to be tackled by engineers with the aid of FEM programs for practical purposes, something which on the other hand deprives the engineer of getting a deep understanding and insight of the phenomenon. For that reason, an analytic approach will be followed, in which shear buckling is studied within the boundaries of elasticity for a nonlinear shell theory in order, in that manner, to simulate reality in the best possible way. The first chapter is devoted to help the reader understand the basic aspects of buckling found in the literature, which are vital for someone who desires to investigate buckling in general. Also, a synopsis of the modern structural codes and standards given regarding the matter, showing the lack of information on shear buckling for liquid filled tanks. The next chapter starts by demonstrating the initial step towards formulating the problem which is no other than the choice of an appropriate displacement field along with a suitable middle surface strain theory. After the most common shell theories are discussed, it is concluded that a deep nonlinear thin shell theory would fit the case under study. For educational purposes, the applied theory is developed from scratch, despite the fact that popular shell theories, which meet the aforementioned criteria are thoroughly described. Moving on, the equations of motion are derived and a discussion is held on how a solution can be reached in order to acquire the critical-buckling load, revealing all the different methods found in the literature regardless if they were used or not. In the third chapter, the strong form of the initial problem is converted into a weak formulation due to the high complexity of the nonlinear partial differential equations of motion. For this reason, the perturbation method is utilized, an approximation technique which by expressing the displacements in terms of a very small perturbation parameter ε, it allows the breakdown of the nonlinear problem into an infinite number of linear sub-problems. The simplest equations that could describe the problem are employed and the solution is divided into two different cases based on the order of ε; the linear and the nonlinear one. At first, the solution of the 1st order in terms of ε linear problem is determined, in relation to the unknown buckling force, which serves as a tool for the 2nd order problem. The resulted EoMs, despite the linearization process that has taken place, are still hard to tackle due to the existent variable coefficients. For that purpose, calculation of the buckling load is searched numerically, a procedure which requires the final system of EoMs for the desired number of modes to be converted into a system of 1st order odes. Due to the high computational cost, the numerical approach has been implemented solely for a beam clamped onto the ground under the application of a distributed load along its length and a concentrated force on the top, as an example to demonstrate the methodology. The steps of the numerical procedure that should be followed for the case of the cylindrical tank filled with water are then extensively described and illustrated. In that sense, it is crystal clear of the method in which instability due to shear can be investigated in complex problems such that of a shell tank. After this thesis, the future researcher is provided with all those tools that will allow him to follow the correct path in order to extract some quite interesting results like; the effect of the tank’s geometric characteristics, the various boundary conditions, the different levels of water as well as the effect of the miscellaneous existing non-linear shell theories on shear buckling. Such conclusions will definitely fill the gap in the current structural codes and standards and will contribute largely in the field of research regarding the cylindrical liquid tanks.","Cylindrical Tank; Shear Buckling; Water; Nonlinear Theory; Perturbation; Thin Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides the foundation for the structure and distributes the imposed loads. Consequently, soil has an influence on the condition of a track structure and a low quality soil can ultimately cause failure of the track structure. To be able to include the condition of a soil in the assessment on track quality, the following research question is posed: <br/>“What is the quantitative influence of soil on the track condition for the railway tracks between Utrecht and Den Bosch?” <br/><br/>To be able to answer the research question, first the influence of soil on track condition is distinguished. The most important failure types, progressive shear failure and excessive plastic deformation, are best characterised by the strength of the soil and the deformation of the tracks respectively. For these characteristics a method is developed, which assesses the track condition. For strength a bearing capacity approach is used and for deformations a beam-on-an-elastic-foundation model is used. The process of the method is illustrated by executing it for a specific trajectory, being the Utrecht-Den Bosch line in the Netherlands. To take into account the variability of different soils, the soil type and some specific soil parameters derived from Cone Penetration Tests are determined and applied in the calculations for the assessment. <br/><br/>From the results can be concluded that for the Utrecht-Den Bosch line, the track quality considering passenger trains will either deteriorate limitedly or not at all. This is the case for quality related to both strength and deformation. For cargo trains, the quality related to deformation is such that limited deterioration can be expected. For strength, however, a large number of sections has a condition varying between the failure level and the desired level, which means that significant deterioration is possible, though, there are sections with higher quality as well. <br","soil characterisation; Railway tracks; Track condition; CPT; Quantification; subsoil; soil influence","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is a useful tool to reveal the impacts of products and services on freshwater biodiversity. Current methodologies in LCA address the impact of climate change driven by reduced average river discharge on freshwater biodiversity. However, given the ectothermic nature of fish, previous studies have highlighted the importance of including water temperature changes as a driver of species loss. In addition, the impact of climate-driven changes in extremes might be more important than changes in average conditions. This thesis develops a novel methodology to include the impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity in LCA. A novel dataset of range contractions, based on extreme streamflow and water temperature parameters, is converted into extinction risk via a metric originating from the classic Species Area Relationship (SAR). A characterization factor is derived for each of the 63 greenhouse gases (GHGs) included in the study. The recommended sets of global characterization factors range from 1.33·10-15 - 7.16·10-11 PDF·yr·kg-1 for the average approach and 4.62·10-16 - 2.49·10-11 PDF·yr·kg-1 for the average and marginal approach respectively. The results imply that freshwater biodiversity impacts per unit of GHG have been underestimated in previous LCA methods that excluded the impact of extreme values and water temperature-driven losses. Future contributions can help to increase taxonomic coverage (e.g., by including lentic species and macro-invertebrates) and by developing complementary models to reflects all the various levels of biodiversity.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Several contamination sources were used to identify contamination scenarios. A river model of the Ayeyarwady and its main tributary, the Chindwin, was made to understand the workings of the river system and the distribution of contaminants throughout the Basin after contamination events. This study found that contamination is diluted to a high degree over long distances in the Ayeyarwady Basin. At low river discharge, the remaining contamination peak downstream of large contamination events like waste water treatment plant failure or tailings dam failures occurring upstream in the river near the limits of detection. During high river discharge these concentrations can be over 17 times smaller. The study showed that in case of pulse water quality incidents for most common water quality parameters, the monitoring system should have a temporal frequency of once per week with an analytical accuracy of around 0.1 microgram/l. A high-quality monitoring station is required in both river branches just upstream of the confluence of the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers as significant dilution occurs here.

This study therefore focuses on; understanding the context of use and application for a new diagnostic that is needed to make a first use for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis haematobium? Q-methodology was applied within this study. Q-methodology investigates subjectivity by exploring how stakeholders rank-order opinion statements about a phenomenon. The method was use to understand; the subjective view-points of stakeholders on the context of use and application of new schistosomiasis diagnostic device and how these viewpoints are shared with other stakeholders within this study. As a result, four key viewpoints (factors) on the context of use and application for a new diagnostic device for schistosomiasis haematobium in Ibadan-Nigeria we pinpointed. New diagnostic device needed for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis haematobium will either need to (i) be deployable to nearby and remote communities, (ii) provide affordable diagnostic test at the grassroot or community level, (ii) test (diagnose) patients before treatment and equip community healthcare facilities and, (iv) fit the local healthcare infrastructure. The findings in this study will guide development of new diagnostic devices for schistosomiasis that matches the contextual landscape and stakeholder diagnostic strategies in Ibadan-Nigeria.","Q-methodology; Stakeholder perspective; Schistosomiasis haematobium; Diagnostic Device; product-service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-19","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It has been reported that this model has convergence issues when the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is applied. This is due to the linear system being ill-conditioned. Moreover, in a recent research a subspace decomposition deflation method has been proposed. Unfortunately, the method requires too many deflation vectors, which results in an implementation of the Deflated PCG (DPCG) algorithm that requires a high demand of RAM. In this thesis a different subdomain decomposition strategy is proposed. This subdomain decomposition method utilises the $k$-means algorithm applied on the matrix of correlation among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This method has been applied on a simulated data set of dairy cattle. This method results in halving the number of deflation vectors required for the same rate of convergence compared with the previous subdomain decomposition deflation method. <br/><br/>In practice for genetic evaluations the data sets increases over time by incorporating new information. In this thesis a specific initial solution has been investigated. This initial solution closely resembles the solution of the updated system to solve the ssSNPBLUP model efficiently. Also a deflation method that utilises the previous solutions of genetic evaluations can be applied. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based deflation method is proposed in this thesis to full fill this requirement. Moreover, only a few deflation vectors are needed to improve the rate of convergence.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the subdomain decomposition deflation method deflates the largest eigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix and the POD deflation method deflates the smallest eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix. Combining the deflation vectors of both methods results in an improvement in the rate of convergence compared with the methods on their own.<br/><br/>Based on the results the best performing method is a combination of selecting the initial solution as the previous genetic evaluation, the POD deflation method and the k-means++ clustering applied on the subdomain decomposition deflation method. In this research a reduction of 81% in iteration time and 19% in total computation time has been observed. Note that the initial solution as the previous genetic evaluation approach can only be employed if that solution is available. Likewise, the POD method can only be applied if multiple solutions of genetic evaluations are available.","ssSNPBLUP; Conjugate Gradient; CG; Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient; PCG; Deflated Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient; DPCG; Subdomain Decomposition; k-means; k-means clustering; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; POD; Genomics; Iterative solvers; Simulated data; Big Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Users rely on such systems in situations with many potential choices, such as watching a movie on a streaming service, reading a blog post, or listening to a song. Traditionally, these systems use techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. Both approaches have disadvantages, so to reduce those, recent research combines various techniques in different ways to create hybrid recommender systems. Creating a well-performing hybrid recommender system generally requires extensive knowledge of recommender systems, the domain on which one wants to provide recommendations, and trial and error. Automating this process makes recommender systems accessible for organizations that lack the resources to build these systems themselves. However, there is a lack of research regarding automating this process. This study aims to provide an initial exploration into this area by proposing RACE:GP, an end-to-end approach that automatically produces accurate non-trivial hybrid recommender systems with only a dataset and a definition of 'relevance'. RACE:GP automatically creates a programming language from a dataset in which any valid program is a recommender system on that dataset. By defining the relevant interaction, it can automatically evaluate the accuracy of these programs. It uses a search strategy based on genetic programming to find the best performing recommender systems in the language. To test our hypothesis, RACE:GP is used to produce recommender systems on three well-known datasets in recommender systems literature, and the results are compared to baselines based on collaborative filtering. Additionally, to verify its adaptability, we analyzed the produced recommender systems given different recommendation scenarios. The results showed that RACE:GP is able to produce recommender systems that outperform our chosen baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, analysis of the produced recommender systems on different recommendation scenarios within a dataset shows that it can find systems that are especially accurate in situations with different densities or recommending specific interactions in datasets that contain different interactions. These results suggest that RACE:GP is a viable and generally applicable approach that makes creating hybrid recommender systems accessible for anyone with a dataset.","hybrid recommender systems; genetic programming; automating recommender systems design; generic recommender systems; collaborative filtering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A particular problem is the fall from height (FFH) accidents on construction sites, due to failing barriers with the underlying cause of insufficient planning. In previous research it has been suggested to develop dedicated BIM plug-ins to automate and visualise risk identification and evaluation of construction sites as a means to assist the safety management process. To explore the impact of BIM on FFH accident reduction through automation and visualisation, a digital tool prototype is developed. This prototype focusses on fall from height (FFH) identification on construction sites during early project phases of civil engineering projects. It is programmed in Autodesk Dynamo for Revit, based on technical and functional requirements derived from literature and industry professionals. A simulation of the FFH tool prototype has been conducted through a pilot project. The result of this product development is a working fall from height detection prototype that is to be used as a supporting tool during the safety analysis of construction site design in Dutch civil engineering projects. The developed tool is added to the body of products that can be used for digitalisation and innovation within the construction process, where it digitalises part of the safety management process that is otherwise performed manually. The added value of the tool prototype is the addition of automated risk detection, creating support in the design and planning process and providing added information to group discussion on safety matters in risk identification and evaluation meetings. Recommendation for future use of the tool is to implement the FFH tool prototype during the design phase to provide the designer with insights in the safety of the constructability. Additionally, the FFH tool prototype can be implemented by safety managers to use the results during safety meetings for better discussion and evaluation of the construction site. For the implementation, improvement of the level of detail in the 3D models for the projects and including temporary construction site works is essential. For further development it is recommended to focus on improving the import of linked models into the script and developing alternative operations to determine the height differences. More developments and improvements can be made to the script to increase the applicability on more complex projects. Concluding, the FFH tool prototype is considered to bring added value in digitalising an otherwise manual process regarding safety management. It is suggested to incorporate use of the FFH tool prototype in the design and planning process to proactively engage in digitalising and innovating engineering processes.","Safety Management; Risk Analysis; BIM; Dynamo; Construction site; Fall detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Also, the susceptibility of various elements of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) to time constraints is explored. Moreover, the impact of different SERP interfaces on user experience and the degree to which affinity for technology moderates the relationship between time constraints and task performance is examined. To that extent, a crowd-sourced user study in which participants are tasked with finding arguments against or in favor of a controversial topic under a time constraint is conducted. The results show that task performance is considerably decreased by stricter time constraints. Furthermore, as time constraints tightened, the rate at which participants issued queries increased. Exploratory results suggest this comes as the cost of reduced depth to which individuals click on results in the ranked list. As for the interaction between SERP interfaces and time constraints, no susceptibility to the effects of time constraints was found. Interestingly, user experience was neither worsened nor improved because of the experimental SERP interfaces and affinity for technology interaction was not found to play a moderating role in the relationship between time constraints and task performance.<br/><br","web search; search behavior; task performance; user experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It should lead to locating opportunities for transitioning them into the Circular Economy.<br/><br/>Ski-helmets are single-impact items, comprised of multiple different materials in inseparable product assemblies that prevent disassembly and recyclability. They are discarded after critical impacts, when safety critical parts fail. This also happens, when product parts with crucial perceived value deteriorate visually or fail to fit current fashion trends. Facilitating repair or refurbishment is currently obstructed through certifications and future developments seem promising but unsure. After discarding, helmets are not recycled, which leads to the loss of resources, energy and value.<br/>Different ski-helmets were analysed on their ease of disassembly and their environmental impact using tools like HotSpot-Mapping, Disassembly Maps and Life Cycle Assessment. A survey and interviews were conducted for gaining insights into user-behaviour and expertise in ski-helmets and beyond.<br/><br/>The project’s outcome is a visionary concept for transitioning ski-helmets into the Circular Economy — the Airguard concept.

As a stepping stone, it should be used to improve product architecture and for gathering insights on part durability for later remanufacturing. A roadmap was developed to indicate development steps over the timeline of six years.<br/><br/>In the end, both concepts should stand as a vision towards sustainability, with many features to further explore and the possibility to gradually decrease environmental impact in ski-helmets.","Circular Design; Helmet; Design for Disassembly; design for remanufacturing; Sustainability; Sports Innovation; recycling; update","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); de Vos, P. (graduation committee); Xu, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Stimulated by the energy efficiency indices introduced by the International Maritime Organization, the increased attention for the environment as well as economical pressures emphasize the relevance of accurate resistance estimation for ships. This leads to a particular interest for added resistance in waves, a resistance component that is currently hard to predict. One of the uncertainties lies within the phenomenon of bow wave breaking, which is expected to have a nonlinear, reducing impact on added resistance. A literature review reveals a lack of research done on this aspect. However, a better understanding of the phenomenon is key to improve the accuracy of added resistance estimates. If current methods are proved to overestimate added resistance, present estimations of required engine capacity would suffer the same bias. As a result, less powerful engines could then be installed which in turn would lead to more efficient ship designs.<br/>Within this context, this thesis aims to gain new insights into added resistance by studying how it is affected by bow wave breaking. To reach this objective, experiments combining two fields, namely experimental hydrodynamics and optical measurements through stereo vision, are performed at the Delft University of Technology. The ship model no. 523 of the Delft Systematic Deadrise Series, a hard chine planing hull, is towed through calm water and regular head sea conditions at a constant speed. The speed and wave conditions are selected such that they gradually cause the bow wave to break. The ship model's speed is varied between a Froude number of <i>F<sub>r</sub> = 0.15</i> and <i>F<sub>r</sub> = 0.30</i>. The incoming wave steepness is varied between a wave height to length ratio of <i>H/λ = 1/60</i> and  <i>H/λ = 1/30</i> for short, intermediate, and long wave conditions, corresponding to a wavelength to ship length ratio of <i>λ/L<sub>pp</sub> = 0.5</i>,  <i>λ/L<sub>pp </sub>= 1.1</i> and<i> λ/L<sub>pp </sub>= 2.0</i>, respectively.<br/>During these experimental runs, the breaking of the bow wave is evaluated through visual observations, the added resistance is measured using resistance tests, and the relative wave elevation is assessed using a newly developed waterline detection method. Using the fact that the hull is semi-transparent, this latter method employs stereo imaging through cameras that are placed inside the ship hull. The waterline can then be traced using a Canny edge detection algorithm which is based on the intensity gradient at the free surface. By solving the stereo correspondence problem, the hull can be reconstructed and the detected waterline projected onto 3D coordinates.<br/>The analysis of the experimental results shows that the linear approach, in which added resistance is proportional to incoming wave amplitude squared, does not hold. With increasing steepness, the added resistance coefficient decreases. Contrary to expectations, no clear correlation between the added resistance coefficient curve and the onset of bow wave breaking is revealed. However, the decrease in added resistance coefficient is strongest for conditions where the bow wave breaks most violently, which indicates an effect of bow wave breaking. The intensity of breaking could not be quantified by these experiments and therefore it is suggested to extend this study by applying CFD methods. <br/> The relation between the added resistance and the incoming wave amplitude squared does not consider nonlinear phenomena (e.g. induced by green water and wave breaking). It would thus not take into account a possible decrease in relative wave elevation due to bow wave breaking and this is hypothesized to be the source of added resistance overestimation. This hypothesis is studied by reconstructing the relative wave elevation from optical measurements. Bow wave breaking seems to specifically affect the maximum relative free surface elevation with respect to the undisturbed waterline while its minimum elevation is characterized by the disappearance of the stationary bow wave for intermediate wave conditions, F<sub>r</sub> ≥ 0.2. Considering the complexity of added resistance which is influenced by different factors, bow wave breaking effects are difficult to isolate. Nonetheless, the analysis of the experimental results led to the introduction of an alternative added resistance coefficient which nondimensionalizes the added resistance by the relative wave amplitude squared. This coefficient takes into account different factors affecting added resistance, e.g. the combined effect of ship speed, incoming waves, and bow wave breaking, and shows a constant trend compared with the common added resistance coefficient. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate relative wave height estimation.","Added resistance; Bow wave; Wave breaking; Experimental hydrodynamics; Stereo vision; Waterline detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

One potential genetic risk factor is tandem repeat expansions, which have been associated with over 40 diseases, most of which affect the nervous system.

We hypothesize there are many more VNTR expansions to be discovered that associate with an increased risk of AD.<br/>Results: We created a pipeline with which we overcame the common limitations of VNTR detection (namely, the need for a predefined set of repeats and limited detectable VNTR sizes due to read length).

We detected 71 VNTR expansions and 1242 contractions, including expansions in genes ADAMTSL3, ARHGEF10, DIP2C, EVC2, GRM8, MPPED1, PID1 and an expansion in the SCIMP gene close to a well-known AD single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

However, PV installation on roof surfaces of buildings is not always easy. One of the challenges comes from the fact that monumental buildings are highly restricted on changing their appearance because of the social value of their architectural features. Visibility assessment of the roof surfaces of these monumental buildings to the public domain is therefore key to finding as much permitted roof surface area as possible that may be used for PV installation. This project aims to develop a large-scale visibility assessment tool that can assist in assessing whether a surface is visible, as well as assessing how visible it is. Additionally, this tool is combined with a module yield estimation algorithm to find the annual DC yield potential of the total permitted roof surface area.<br/><br/>The visibility assessment tool operates in a raster-based representation of the environment with a resolution of 0.5 by 0.5 meters, generated using the openly available height point cloud of the Netherlands (AHN3) along with cadastral data (BAG) and road network data that represents the public domain. The output of this tool contains multiple maps that include binary visibility (classifying whether a surface is visible or not), domain visibility (quantifying the length of visible roads), the average solid angle (quantifying the average relative size of the surface to the visible roads) and total visibility (a multiplication of domain visibility and average solid angle). To reduce the computational demand of this large-scale assessment algorithm, the amount of operations was reduced using an observer filter based on surface tilt and orientation. Additionally, to save time, a sensitivity analysis is included where the assessment terminates once the optimal assessment range and observer spacing is found for individual building roof surfaces. Given the raster resolution, the visibility assessment takes on average 0.619 s/m^2 for estimating all properties, or 0.063 s/m^2 if only binary visibility is needed.<br/><br/>The visibility assessment tool was cross-validated using the ArcGIS Pro software. It was found that the binary visibility accuracy of all analyzed buildings combined hit 99.70%. In the case of domain visibility, for all roof surfaces that were found visible by both models, 90.99% of surface cells have a domain visibility accuracy of above 90%, while 0.89% of surfaces have a domain visibility accuracy below 50%. The tool has been implemented on 15 monumental buildings on the TU Delft campus, doing visibility assessment on their building roof surfaces. 46563m^2 out of 62350m^2 of cumulative total roof surface area was found to be invisible. The invisible roof surface area has the potential to deliver a total of 4.743 GWh annual DC yield, assuming an economic threshold for specific yield of 650 kWh/kWp and a roof-integrated, fully covering layout of the modules on the found suitable roof surface area.<br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing complexities of structures and material behavior, classical approach for non-linear finite element analysis has become computationally expensive (Gulikers, 2018). In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model, Machine Learning (ML) is introduced. The ever-increasing accessibility and magnitude of computational power has made machine learning gained popularity since 1990s. Artificial Neural Networks have especially been proven to be a versatile machine learning framework, capable of solving complex tasks such as voice recognition to solving failure analysis of structures. This thesis aims at implementing soil constitutive models such as Linear Elastic and Elasto-plastic models and integrating them into a Finite Element Engine. Two different approaches have been attempted to implement the ANN into the constitutive models. The first approach involves the implementation of a ""Generic"" Neural network to simulate the natural anisotropic behavior of soils. Datasets have been generated with the help of theoretical soil tests classified as ‘Standard’ and ‘Non-standard’ tests. The standard tests depict an isotropic behavior, where the strains and stresses in different directions are proportionate. Non-standard tests consist of data representing anisotropic behavior where the strain increments in every direction are randomized. The neural network has first been implemented for a linear elastic soil model. Itis observed that when the network is trained and tested with similar kind of data, predictions are accurate. However, when the neural network is trained with a certain type of data (such as standard test), it is unable to predict the response for the other data (non-standard test). When the neural network (trained with standard data) is subsequently implemented in Finite Element analysis by deriving and substituting the material stiffness matrix from the neural network in a constitutive model, the difference between the isotropic linear elastic matrix (for linear elastic model) and the matrix derived from the neural network lead to significant errors, despite the accurate predictions of the neural network. The second approach is a component based approach in which the neural network is modeled to learn the typical behaviors of soil such as linear elasticity and plasticity. The data for training and testing the neural network are generated using standardized laboratory tests (CRS, DSS, Biaxial etc.). The neural network is modeled for linear elastic soil, by applying certain weight constraints. It is observed that the neural network has accurate predictions. Further implementation in constitutive model shows that the neural network is able to mimic the behavior of Linear elastic soil model. The neural network model, is subsequently implemented to predict Mohr-Coulomb behavior, and the predictions are significantly accurate. Further the generalization ability of the network is analyzed to evaluate the practical applicability of the network, followed by a sensitivity analysis to get an understanding about the influencing parameters in the network. The devised neural network, when implemented in a constitutive model displays a behavior similar to the theoretical constitutive model of Mohr-Coulomb soil. Finally, this thesis concludes with the implementation of the neural network constitutive model in Finite Element Analysis where it leads to convergence errors in the model.","Finite Element Analysis; constitutive modeling; Geotechnical Engineering; soil stress model; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

On Greenland surface meltwater percolates to deeper layers where porous firn retains it, directly inhibiting runoff. However, secondary effects such as the formation of impermeable ice slabs may indirectly and irreversibly accelerate runoff and with it global sea level rise. Microwave remote sensing offers opportunities to monitor these processes, but due to the simplicity of their underlying snow models retrieval methods fail over areas subject to melt and refreezing - areas where the firn's (in)ability to buffer meltwater is critical. This study presents a new forward model which given initial conditions and atmospheric forcing first solves for the firn state through a full-complexity snow model (SNOWPACK) and then simulates multifrequency brightness temperature (Tb) time series (using radiative transfer model SMRT). As part of a comprehensive sensitivity analysis three ensembles of multi-decade Tb time series (19 and 37 GHz) were modelled for the DYE-2 site in the percolation area of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Model performance based on RMSE w.r.t. independent Tb satellite observations was found to be sensitive to biases introduced in the atmospheric forcing record (with air temperature, precipitation and relative humidity controlling variance) and snow model settings (new snow grain size and albedo settings) and not to initial profile conditions. However, computed RMSEs were high (min. 17.8 K at 37V and 19.4 K at 19V) due to trends in modelled Tb consistently underestimating observed trends when taken over an accumulation season. It is shown that this can only be explained by the constant-with-time stickiness assumption used to link the snow model’s microstructure representation to the sticky hard sphere model employed for the radiative transfer scheme. A seasonal stickiness signal is made evident for the conditions at DYE-2 and linked to its yearly melt-refreeze-accumulation cycle. These results demonstrate that earlier approaches to forward model microwave satellite observations based on a constant-with-time stickiness assumption (or that lack a third snow microstructure parameter altogether) are not valid for ice sheet areas prone to melt. This study is expected to be the starting point for a more sophisticated implementation that estimates a snow layer's stickiness from microstructure information already available in the snow model. If successful it would be the first of its kind and open the door to satellite-based retrieval of subsurface firn properties and processes from areas where observations are currently lacking, greatly reducing uncertainty in ice sheet mass loss and global sea level rise projections.","microwave; remote sensing; brightness temperature; snow model; Greenland; ice sheet; radiative transfer; GRS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","66.4800, -46.2800"

First, a literature study was conducted to define the relevant concepts such as project complexity and opportunity management. Next, to understand the current approach of identifying opportunities in practice, interviews with practitioners in the field of infrastructure were conducted. After that, the aim was to study the possibility of exploiting complexities. This was achieved by organizing a workshop session, where four Project Managers collaborated to identify opportunities, in four infrastructure projects, that result from the technical (T), organizational (O) and external (E) complexity elements of the TOE framework developed by Bosch-Rekveldt et al. (2011). As a result, a technique that aims particularly at identifying the opportunities that emerge from the complexities was developed: the Complexity-Driven Opportunity Identification Technique (CDOIT). Finally, this technique was integrated in a roadmap that aims for the effective implementation of opportunity management in complex infrastructure projects. This study suggests having a common understanding among the project team of the concept of opportunity as a positive risk and how it is linked to the project objectives. These objectives should be clearly stated from the beginning of the project. Also, if the team is determined to identify and manage opportunities, and even more, the opportunities that result from the complexity of the project, this should be clear from the start and included in the risk management plan (RMP). Another important factor is to determine the people who should be involved in identifying opportunities. Furthermore, the techniques that can facilitate the identification of opportunities and how these will be assessed, handled and monitored should be determined. Also, individuals looking for opportunities should be equipped with the right positive mindset. This will help in switching from a threat-focused mindset to a mindset that focuses on the positive side of risk. This study also proposed five possibilities into how complexities can be exploited. This can be done using internal strengths, taking advantage of external weaknesses combined with internal strengths, aiming to turn internal weaknesses to strengths, through a better use of available resources, and by increasing the scope of the project.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, the foundation of a numerical model is considered by means of a concise overview of numerical discretisation techniques and their characteristics. We assess the representation of the typical set of physical processes that one may encounter in present-day morphodynamic models and compare their (mathematical) representation following from the underlying choice of discretisation technique. Hereto, we refrain ourselves to the two commonly used methods - finite element and finite difference method. The second pillar gives an overview of the methods that geomorphologists may employ to reduce the model input, and methods to accelerate morphological computations. The last pillar sheds light on different methods that may be applied by geomorphologists to give more insight into the performance of morphodynamic models. These results can, in turn, be of considerable interest in the pursuit to quantitatively validate model predictions. Lastly, this research is concluded with a set of interviews wherein esteemed applied morphodynamic experts were asked about their perception on a possible best practice in modelling skillful meso-scale features in the timeframe of reference. This research hints, therefore, towards an overarching systematic strategy that could be applied by geomorphologists to acquire accurate morphodynamic model predictions on the temporal scale of 5-10 years and for meso-scale features in the order of tens of kilometres.","Morphodynamic modelling; Tidal Inlet Systems; Estuarine Morphology; Delft 3D; Model Validation; Model Skill; Model Accuracy; Model Acceleration Techniques; Model Calibration; Model Discretisation Techniques; Finel 3D; input reduction; Ebb-Tidal Delta; Western Scheldt; Delfland Coast; Ameland Inlet; Wadden Sea","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Earth magnetic field is used in many applications such as navigation. Magnetic field sensors are mainly used on satellites for attitude control and in limited missions as scientific instruments. These magnetic field instruments are: specifically designed for the mission, expensive and/or require knowledge of the magnetic noise sources present in the complete satellite. Therefore a proposal was made of a magnetic field instrument consisting of multiple COTS sensors that doesn't require knowledge of the satellite and could be placed inside the satellite. Two measurement processing methods were used to test the effectiveness of such a system. Both methods were tested simultaneously testing if an ideal sensor placement exists and the effect of the number of sensors was considered. <br/><br/>The requirements for a sensor system to be used for attitude control and/or scientific purposes are as follows. Firstly for both kind of systems (attitude or scientific) a measuring frequency of at least 10 Hz is preferred. Secondly the sensitivity for an attitude control instrument needs to be 50 nT or less and for a scientific instrument 0.5 nT or less. Lastly the accuracy for an attitude control instrument needs to be 50 nT and/or 3 degrees or less and for a scientific instrument 0.5 nT or less.<br/><br/>The two measurement processing methods used in this research are the averaging method which averages the measurements of multiple sensors and the SOE method which uses a system of equations to determine the location, direction and magnetic strength of the noise sources. It was found that the SOE method can maintain an accuracy of less than 50 nT if a determined or overdetermined system of equation could be realized. This can only be the case if the number of sensors is $3\frac{1}{3}$ times as much as the noise sources which is not feasible for a satellite. Another limitation of the SOE method is the computational time which is at least 7 order of magnitude bigger than the computational time of the averaging method. The averaging method can produce better accuracies than 50 nT and/or 3 degrees but is very dependent on the sensor placing and less dependent on the number of sensors. An increase in accuracy can only be gained if all sensors are placed far from the biggest noise sources and there should be a minimum distance from small noise sources. If one of the sensors doesn't adhere to this then there is a decrease in accuracy and a single sensor could perform better. The sensitivity of a sensor system improves when multiple sensors are used.","Magnetic field instrument; magnetic field; satellite; Attitude; COTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The research follows two different approaches, the double-diamond and the Dive method and includes extensive literature review, remote user research, future context definition, generative and creative sessions and a final round of ideation, prototyping and testing. The whole process keeps the user experience and interaction at the core of the research. The project involved a Consortium of three experts in the realms of businesses, people perspectives and technology from three different companies: Muzus, Ford and Miro. Their participation was vital to generate knowledge at the verge of their fields of expertise and evaluate the ideas generated during the different phases of the study. The initial section of the project was devoted to <b>understanding the past and the present</b> by focusing on the effects of forced remote working caused by the pandemic through literature research, interviews with experts, workers and students. This helped to identify relevant gaps in knowledge for further research, as well as potential opportunities for design purposes. The first phase highlighted a new way for workers to perceive remote working, an increased sense of responsibility rising from the work from home practice and an evolved connection with the team. To <b>approach the future</b> exploration, a generative session with the experts investigated the insights collected and explored some future scenarios. A series of context factors were used to develop a Future Vision, useful to contextualize the next research steps. Two creative sessions were held to <b>explore the future</b> vision and analyse the differences between hybrid and remote. The last design phase was meant to <b>communicate the future</b> vision by creating a fictional future Magazine published in 2030 and by designing a vision concept, a physical token that connects workers through a virtual office. A proof of concept of the vision was prototyped, showing that it is possible to create serendipitous encounters and connect dispersed workers by means of a physical token and a video call platform. In conclusion, the next future will see a rising trend of hybrid workspaces and, in order to keep the work efficient, it is imperative to facilitate collaboration with the help of people and tools designated for this scope, as well as fulfil the gaps of time zones, cultures and expertises.","Boundless collaboration; Collaboration; distributed teams; post-pandemic; remote; working; team building; User Centred Design; chance encounters; dive; facilitation; hybrid work; distributed work; hybrid session; creative session; context mapping; 2030; future; Design fiction; Magazine; colleagues; bonding; remote work; Future Vision; Vision Concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Owing to the array of advantages that the Cloud offers many businesses have been moving towards cloud-based environments. A technological transition like Cloud adoption is often not restricted to a technological change but also influences every other aspect. Because of the agile nature of the process, it is often complex and convoluted. Given the large spectrum of possibilities, multiple organisations and academic researchers over time have explored this line of interest to create generic frameworks to help companies move from on-premise to cloud. This scientific research was also directed towards creating a generic framework for the cloud transition. The goal of this research is “To develop an integral framework to assist companies in realising control while moving their applications to the cloud”. The integral framework is aimed to function as a generalised document by integrating various aspects, actors and factors to help organisations plan end-to-end strategies and thus to realise control. The framework includes a governance module that addresses 5 broad aspects required to formulate an End-to-End strategy, namely, Business and IT Drivers, Cost, Security, People and Resources and Platform and Operations. There are about 15 agile steps in the hybrid cloud transition process. For every step in the critical path, the governance module is considered. The possible challenges and boundary conditions are addressed and included in the framework design. The detailed steps- and aspects-based organisational measures list is made with best practice guidelines to increase transparency.

(mentor); Meester, L.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","We live in an online world: we date online, we do business online and we communicate online. To make sure this happens securely, almost all transferred data is encrypted by cryptosystems. This paper focuses on one of these: the knapsack cryptosystem of Merkle and Hellman, which relies on the hardness of solving the knapsack problem (1978). In general it works as follows.<br/>Bob, who wants to communicate with Alice, encrypts his message with a public key and sends this to her. If a third party now intercepts it, he must solve an instance of the knapsack problem, which is NP-hard in general. However, this becomes computationally infeasible if the number of items is large, and therefore Bob’s message is safe. Alice has access to a private key, which she uses to transform the hard knapsack problem into an easier one: one where the vector of weights is superincreasing. That is, each component of the vector is larger than the sum of all previous components. In this case she can solve the problem efficiently and read what Bob sent her.<br/>This method seems to be reliable at first sight. However, a few years after it was published, cryptographer Shamir proposed an algorithm that breaks the system (1984). The algorithm finds a pair of numbers by solving two systems of inequalities. Then a third party can use this pair to transform the hard knapsack problem into one he can solve, which may be different from the one Alice finds. However, he will find the same solution, and therefore he can also read Bob’s message.<br/>This algorithm can be implemented as a computer program and in this paper we used Python. The first system of inequalities is written as a optimization problem and since there is fixed number of unknowns, we can solve it in polynomial time using Lenstra’s integer programming algorithm (1983). In this paper we used the Gurobi optimizer to solve it, as Lenstra’s algorithm is hard to use in practice. The second system of inequalities is solved by comparing lower and upper bound, which can also be carried out in polynomial time. Nevertheless, the total algorithm finishes in polynomial time only with a certain high probability since we made some probabilistic assumptions. This implies that there is a small probability of failure. However, if it finds a solution, then the algorithm is fast, and therefore it is still valuable to use in real life.","Knapsack problem; Cryptosystem; Cryptography","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Increasing turbine size and further structural cost reduction require more advanced insights into the dynamic system. One practice of analysing these vibrating structures is called Operational Modal Analysis (OMA). OMA estimates parameters of a structural dynamic model of which damping is considered especially important due<br/>to the direct relation with the magnitude of the response. Although OMA is an established field, damping estimation of operational Offshore Wind Turbines is often difficult due to violation of the stationary white noise excitation condition posed by classical OMA algorithms. Rotor rotation causes a harmonic loading on the non-rotating part of the structure, which is problematic for conventional <br/> methods. Harmonics-mitigating OMA methods were developed in recent years to tackle this issue. Four state-of-the-art OMA algorithms are selected to identify the damping of an operational OWT. Each algorithm is applied to a dataset obtained from a simple simulation test case and a wind turbine simulation before considering field measurements. Subsequently, algorithm<br/>robustness is examined by comparing estimates from multiple measured datasets with corresponding simulations and estimates from different algorithms for multiple wind speeds. It was found that the first mode corresponds well with the model for wind speeds under 15 m/s, whereas the second mode frequency has a large offset from the modelled value, revealing modelling flaws. Moreover, the estimates of the Modified Least-squares Complex Exponential (LSCE), PolyMAX, and Kalman Filter-based Stochastic Subspace Identification (KF-SSI)<br/>algorithms correspond well for both measured and simulated data. They are well-suited for identifying the damping of operational OWTs. Cepstrum editing is not recommended for damping identification as the editing affects the damping value. Enhanced Power Spectral Density Transmissibility (PSDT) is not recommended when few sensor levels are available. Novel enhancements were developed in this thesis. First, the results of the KF-SSI algorithm were improved by concatenating datasets in the identification steps and reducing variance.<br/>Also, numerical issues were addressed by implementing the Square Root Covariance Filter (SRCF) instead of the conventional Kalman filter. Other developments include an algorithm for automated interpretation of stabilization charts and a harmonic localization method based on the rotor velocity.","Operational Modal Analysis; subspace identification; Kalman Filtering; Damping Estimation; Offshore Wind Turbines; LSCE; PolyMAX; Transmissibility-based Operational Modal Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-06-30","","","","","",""

In the photovoltaic (PV) community, they are normally required to provide sufficient lateral carrier transport towards metal electrodes at the illumination side. Thus, a trade­off between optical and electrical<br/>properties is of critical importance in relevant device fabrications. So far, within the PVMD group, the investigation on TCOs has been mainly focused from an experimental perspective. In this thesis, a firstprinciples approach based on DFT software is investigated to obtain the self­consistent opto­-electrical properties of TCOs.<br/><br/>A comprehensive study is carried out to understand the fundamentals of DFT software, as this is crucial to get reliable results from it. Within the PVMD group, the DFT method is applied on the indium­oxide (IO) host material. It was found that referable results for the (partial) density of states and band<br/>structure could be obtained for this structure using the PBE exchange­correlation (XC) functional. The dielectric function could be obtained by combining the PBE and HSE06 XC functional through the PHSmethod.<br/><br/>Based on a preliminary validation of IO, two case studies are carried out. In these case studies, it is investigated if DFT can be used to compare the opto­-electrical properties of different doping types and ratios. This is done for post­transition metals (Sn), transition metals (W and Mo) and anionic doping<br/>(F). By observing the partial density of states of each element, it was found that significant hybridization of dopant states with the CBM of the IO host states occurs for the cases of Sn­ and F­doping.<br/>Such disturbance in the host conduction band may lead to detrimental influences to the opto­-electrical properties of corresponding TCOs. However, in the cases of W­ and Mo­doped TCOs at commonly used doping concentrations, no hybridization between dopant states and the host conduction band was observed. Furthermore, physical parameters of different TCOs at different doping levels are extracted and compared, such as band gap, effective electron mass, work function and dielectric functions. These results may provide supportive and indicative information for the experimental work.<br/><br/>This thesis work has successfully introduced DFT calculation into TCO investigations within our research group. Although the preliminary results were not sufficiently accurate to predict the opto­-electrical properties of the TCOs in a quantitative way, the qualitative trend can still be used as guidance and support for explaining experimental results. However, many challenges still remain, especially for determining some optical properties like the band gap and dielectric function.

To ful fil in the growing demand for offshore wind market, one has to look for floating offshore wind solutions as nearshore shallow waters are depleting. Several types of floating wind structures can be distinguished in the following categories; Spar, semi-submersible and Tension Leg Platform (TLP) structures. Blue water developed a floating wind TLP, the BLUE-STAR, which is still under development and has not yet been applied in offshore wind projects.At the moment there are many factors unknown about the concept. This in comparison to semi-submersible structures of which more knowledge is available. The aim of the thesis is to describe if the TLP concept has an advantage over the semi-submersible structure and if the newly developed TLP concept can be a viable solution. For this, a simulation model to simulate the logistics of both structures, is developed. First, different types of offshore wind turbines are classified, including TLP and semi-submersible structures. This is followed by challenges the logistics of offshore wind farms are currently confronted with. This points out that the most important challenges are due to substructures, environmental conditions and T&amp;I. Next, the logistic process of both the TLP and SSB structure are described. This is followed by a literature study which is divided into literature on weather conditions and literature on operations and logistics, in which the analytical approach and simulation-based methods are described.Discrete Event Simulation is used for the simulation model in Matlab. This is followed by an extensive description of the logistic process in general. The second part of the chapter elaborates on implementation of both structures into the described model. The fourth part of this thesis, elaborates on implementation of the simulation model by explaining the decisions and assumptions made for the simulation model. Furthermore, this part also discusses the inputs of the logistic process simulation.  The weather data provided by Blue water for the use of the simulation model is presented and this part of the thesis gives an evaluation of the simulation model. Based on this evaluation, is it concluded the simulation model functions correctly. In the final part of this thesis, the results of the logistic simulations of both structures are compared and a  sensitivity analysis is performed. For the sensitivity analysis, 4 cases are studied, these are: varying wind speed and wave height, variation of transport duration, seasonality and varying team performance. The aim of this sensitivity analysis is to study the influences of different input conditions.  Finally, results of the simulations and performed sensitivity analysis indicate that the newly developed TLP concept is not a realistic alternative compared to the SSB structure.    ","Wind Turbine; Floating Wind Turbines; offshore wind; Simulation model; offshore floating wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

With this new smart grid architecture many opportunities for control methods arise. While this can improve the efficiency of the power grid, all these methods require communication, which is a limited resource. In this thesis I focus on one particular concept of the smart grid called demand side management. One of the possible ways to apply demand side management is by use of game theory. By molding the game into a specific kind of game called potential game, similarities between the convergence of these potential games and the methods used in event triggered control, which is a method to reduce communication in networked control systems, can be observed. By using these similarities the principles of event triggered control can be applied to potential games. This way I create an event triggered potential game, which reduces the amount of communication required to reach the Nash equilibrium. To accomplish this I design two algorithms for event triggered potential games. One in which the decision on whether or not to communicate is made in a centralized way and one in which this occurs in a decentralized way, where all players decide for themselves when to communicate.","event triggered control; Potential game theory; Smart grids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Currently, the most used procedure to complete the Fontan circulation is the Extracardiac Total Cavopulmonary connection and is performed when the patient is at an age of 3-5 years old. In this procedure, a prosthetic extracardiac conduit is implanted that connect the Inferior Vena Cava directly with the Pulmonary Arteries, bypassing the heart. This extracardiac conduit is available in several conventional sizes. However, little knowledge is available on the performance of these different conduit sizes, especially when patients grow older. Therefore, it is difficult to make a well-informed choice on the conduit size at the time of implantation.<br/><br/>This study aimed to obtain more insight into the performance of three conduit sizes (16, 18 and 20 mm), using computational fluid dynamic simulations conducted on anatomically three-dimensional models with accurate boundary conditions, both reconstructed from MRI (N = 19). In addition, it is proposed in the literature that body growth affects the conduit’s performance in the Fontan circulation. In order to include body growth in this study, the effect of an increasing body surface area is analysed for the patients with a 16 and 18 mm conduit implanted. Power loss, pressure drop, normalised resistance and the flow stagnation volume were used as parameters indicating the performance, i.e. efficiency of the Fontan circulation. Furthermore, to get a complete picture of the performance, two physical conditions (rest and exercise) are included and a distinction is made in respiratory phases (inspiration and expiration).<br/><br/>For all three conduit sizes, the power loss, pressure drop and normalised resistance increase with exercise. Also, the power loss and pressure drop increase with inspiration. An increase of these parameters indicate a decreased efficiency of the Fontan circulation. Furthermore, the results describe higher values for the 16 mm conduit than the 18 and 20 mm conduits according to the power loss, pressure drop and normalised resis- tance, with significant differences found during expiration in rest and exercise. In contrast, flow stagnation volume, decreases with exercise and inspiration, and no clear trend was seen for the flow stagnation volume between the conduit sizes. The flow stagnation levels were close to zero, indicating that the performance is not limited by oversized conduits in these patients.<br/><br/>According to the body growth, for the 16 mm conduit, significant correlations were found between the body surface area and power loss, pressure drop and normalised resistance. No trend was seen for the 18 mm conduit. From these findings it appears that probably a smaller conduit is disadvantageous considering the patient’s growth.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that the 16 mm conduit is the least beneficial compared to the 18 and 20 mm conduit. However, whether the 18 and 20 mm conduit perform sufficiently is question- able and should be investigated patient-specific by linking these results to clinical relevant parameters such as exercise tolerance. Furthermore, the main limitation of this study is the small patient population. Although already convincing trends have been found, the results should be confirmed by further research with a larger patient population.","Fontan patients; Fontan circulation; Conduit size; hemodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It is believed that an autonomous vessel design operates more efficient compared to a manned design. In this thesis the challenges of autonomous shipping and its consequences on ship design and the operation are identified. This information is used to give a cost analysis on the autonomous variant of a manned vessel. The results from thesis can be used by researchers and ship owners to determine whether its autonomous ship design and its operation are economically viable. This is valuable for investors to decide whether their case is favourable for autonomous shipping. The main question answered is: What are the operational conditions under which an autonomous battery powered vessel design is economically viable over its electric manned variant?<br/><br/>The changes in ship design and its consequences result in a change in capital and operational cost. The removed crew systems and additional equipment cost are presented. Overall a decrease in both capital and operational cost is expected. The actual size of the cost reduction is case dependent. Therefore the operational conditions which affect the economical viability most, are identified. They are identified in a case study on a dredger operating in a port. The design and capital cost factors are presented, where after it is concluded that the displacement, battery capacity, distance to shore and the vessels specific operation influence the cost benefit. Therefore they are presented as the operational conditions. <br/><br/>The operational conditions are tested in two case studies. For both case studies a significant cost reduction is obtained. These vessels are thus economical viable. The size of the overall reduction is dependent on the operational conditions. It is concluded that the displacement has a relatively small effect on the total cost. The battery capacity however, does have a significant effect. The capacity decrease is largest for vessels with an original large hotel load and large battery capacity. The larger the battery decrease, the larger the decrease in cost. Furthermore, vessels that operate within the Wi-Fi zone are favourable over vessels operating further from shore because of its communication system. Finally, the vessels specific operation regarding crew and accommodation size are most significant. The operational cost decrease for manning is larger for larger crews. In addition, the cost decrease for the accommodation section and its operational benefits are significant.","Autonomous Shipping; Fully Electric Propulsion; Operational conditions; Economic assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-15","","","","","",""

(mentor); Bliek, Laurens (mentor); Panichella, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Train Unit Shunting and Servicing (TUSS) problem is an NP-hard problem encountered by the Dutch railway operator, Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS). It considers trains at a shunting yard when they are not transporting passengers. It consists of four subproblems, involving assigning the trains at the yard to a transporting timetable (Matching), planning the maintenance tasks that need to be performed for each train while they are at the yard (Servicing), assigning trains to parking tracks during their stay at the yard (Parking), and calculating routes for the movements of the trains over the yard (Routing). The problem<br/>entails finding a conflict-free plan that solves all subproblems.<br/><br/>Currently, plans for the trains at a shunting yard are still devised by human planners, which is a time-consuming and difficult task, which the NS wants to automate. To that end, they are in an advanced stage of the development of an algorithm that can solve instances of TUSS using a local search heuristic, called Hybrid Integrated Planner (HIP). Because it is a heuristic, it has no guarantee of being optimal. Another meta-heuristic that shows good performance on scheduling problems, is the class of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). This research creates an EA, called Conflict-Based Crossover (CBC), that can solve TUSS and can outperform the local search heuristic on a subset of locations.<br/><br/>The most complex part of creating an EA for a complicated problem like TUSS is devising a crossover operator, which is a method that can combine two solutions to TUSS to create a new, valid solution. This research devises a functional crossover operator for TUSS, using a graph representation of solutions which is also used in the local search heuristic. Using the same representation as HIP makes it easy to hybridise the algorithm. The operator treats schedules for individual train units as variables and combines solutions by mixing these<br/>variables. To decide which variables are selected from which solution, a heuristic is developed that uses the conflicts of individual train units as the basis of a selection mechanism; the method derives its name from this heuristic.<br/><br/>The performance of CBC is compared to HIP on a set of different shunting yards. <br/>Results show that on Grote Binckhorst, which is a location where most tracks have only one entry and exit, CBC gets outperformed by HIP. However, on Kleine Binckhorst, a location with a lot of open-ended tracks, CBC consistently outperforms HIP. This implies that, on a subset of locations, CBC can be an improvement over HIP to devise feasible plans for TUSS.","Evolutionary Algorithms; Train Unit Shunting Problem; Optimisation; Heuristic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in reality, the focus is often on the patient’s needs and not on the family caregiver’s needs. Therefore, the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) has developed the Oog voor Naasten en Nabestaanden (ON2) method, stimulating healthcare professionals to provide systematic support for family caregivers. However, this method needs to be personalized and detailed for every institution to fit its current workflow. Therefore, this project aims to design a tool that lets healthcare professionals visualize the journey of the family caregiver in their institution, so they can personalize the method and gain insight into which aspects of the ON2 method will be most interesting for them to implement.<br/><br/>During this project, various research activities have been performed to get insight into the family caregiver’s journey. The needs and experiences of family caregivers have been investigated with literature research to use as input for interviews. In the interviews with family caregivers and healthcare professionals, the journey of the family caregiver is explored in four healthcare settings. The healthcare settings involved in this project are the hospital, nursing home, hospice and home care. The result is four journey maps.<br/><br/>The input and experience of these journey maps have been used as input for the design brief. This project aims to let healthcare professionals create the journey of the family caregiver in their institution, so they can reflect on the desired quality of life of the family caregiver and become inspired to implement the ON2 method. Twelve design guidelines provide insight into how to achieve the design goal and interaction vision and are used as input for the ideation phase. In ideation, various concepts are explored in iterative brainstorming and co-creation sessions, which have led to the final design.<br/><br/>The Oog voor Naasten workshop is the final design of this project. The workshop is used as an inspiring kick-off for the implementation of the ON2 method. The design lets the healthcare professionals create the journey of the family caregiver with the help of various tools. Once they have visualized the journey, the workshop provides questions to reflect on which needs should be better fulfilled and how these can be fulfilled in the future. At the end of the workshop, the insights are summarized and used to detail the implementation’s action plan further.<br/><br/>The final design is tested in the hospice setting with four healthcare professionals who reacted enthusiastically and positively. During the workshop, they became aware of the steps that were part of the journey of the family caregiver, were inspired to act, and better fulfil the needs in the future.<br/><br/>However, further research is required to evaluate the workshop in other healthcare settings. The following design should be more intuitive, so it will take less time to figure out the steps. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the workshop supports healthcare professionals in personalizing the ON2 method by letting them create the journey of the family caregiver, so they can reflect on the desired quality of life of the family caregiver.","Family caregivers; Journey mapping; Service design; Social Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Ghodrat, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Interwoven refers to material structures made by growing plant roots into man-made patterns. Originally developed as an art piece to demonstrate root intelligence and bring attention to human-nature relations, Interwoven shows the potential to disrupt various commercial industries, especially as textile-based natural fiber reinforcements for composite materials. The artist that created Interwoven, Amsterdam-based Diana Scherer, started a collaboration with the TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering to help further develop Interwoven from an art piece to a sustainable material for products design. Following the Material Driven Design method (Karana, et al., 2015), two students have identified materials experience opportunities created by Interwoven materials, the mechanical properties and internal structure of Interwoven are still not fully understood. <br/><br/>This study tackles the challenge of performing a technical characterization on Interwoven structures in an effort to correlate processing parameters to its structure, properties, and performance. It is known from past works that Interwoven is fragile and “weak”, but a quantified value for these terms serves as a point of comparison with other materials in the market. To determine these values, a series of tensile tests were performed on grids with a simple square pattern. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) tests performed on single roots proved that the amalgamation of roots that make up an Interwoven structure do not efficiently transfer tensile loads since the tensile strength and elastic moduli of Interwoven samples were nearly two orders of magnitude lower than those of a single root. Load transfer between roots was improved through the design of natural fiber-reinforced composites (NFRCs). The (bio)-polymer matrix used for these NFRCs was made up of agar gel, which improved the tensile properties of Interwoven samples, but was still lower than the single root.<br/><br/>A full characterization of a material correlates the observed properties to the structure of the material, which is done through the use of microscopy. Microscopic analyses were performed on all the tested samples to find any correlation between the observed tensile properties and the structure of Interwoven samples. In addition to providing insight about the complex interactions of roots as they form the patterns that they grow into, the microscopy also revealed that there is a direct correlation between the number of root tips (root endings) present at the intersection of squares in the grid and the mechanical properties of the sample. <br/><br/>With further research, this result can be tied to a parameter that the designer has direct control of, giving them better control of the properties of their Interwoven structures. Varying cell size in square patterns also allows designers to create structures with locally varying properties. The correlations between design parameters and material strength are summarized in the Guidelines to Designing with Interwoven booklet. A material demonstrator was also designed to showcase the locally variable mechanical properties in one structure while summarizing the test results in a way that is accessible and easy to understand.<br","Material Driven Design; Biomaterials; Characterization; Composite Material; Growing Design; Biofabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The country also needs to increase the integration of renewable energy into the electricity system. Wind energy, one of the renewable energy alternatives, is severely underutilized in Indonesia. Accordingly, the Indonesian government aims to increase the installed wind farm capacity by twelvefold within the next five years. This research aims to fill a knowledge gap in the literature by determining economic potential of onshore and offshore wind energy in Indonesia and formulating recommendations for institutional changes to proliferate wind energy development. A techno-economic analysis is performed by means of a GIS-based modelling to determine the technical and economic potential. Based on the analysis, onshore and offshore wind technical potential amounts to 17.6 – 30.9 GW and 470.6 – 595.6 GW, respectively. Meanwhile, the LCOE of wind energy can be as low as 6.1 (onshore) and 13.4 (offshore) USD ct/kWh. However, only up to 8.0% and 1.4% of the onshore and offshore wind technical potential, respectively, is economically feasible under the current regulations. An institutional analysis is then conducted to identify the institutional barriers hampering wind energy development. The analysis focuses on the institutional environment (L2) and governance (L3) layer of Williamson’s four layers of institutions framework. Barriers related to electricity pricing (L2) include regulatory uncertainty and a low purchase price of RE-based electricity. Furthermore, the barrier in infrastructure planning (L2) is the low amount of additional wind farm capacity being planned and the inconsistency in planning. Issues on property rights allocation (L2), i.e. ownership transfer and foreign ownership restrictions on wind energy projects, have been addressed in recently enacted laws. Lastly, barriers in contracting (L3) encompass prolonged negotiations between PLN and IPPs, poor law and contract enforcement, insufficient coordination and leadership in the multi-layered governance, and limited availability of project funding. Three institutional recommendations are derived based on the identified barriers. First, the Government shall create an electricity pricing masterplan, which entails a phased implementation of economic policy instruments. Second, project funding should be provided by sustaining the Government’s subsidy to PLN and promoting local participation and ownership in the projects. Third, an independent regulator dedicated to the electricity sector should be formed to ensure sufficient stakeholder involvement and monitor the actors’ activities in this sector. Future research can perform a similar study at the regional level, particularly at provinces with promising economic wind energy potential. Furthermore, future studies can involve a comprehensive design of institutions and a roadmap for wind energy development in Indonesia.","GIS; Wind Energy; Institutional analysis; Williamson; Indonesia; Economic Potential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Geerlings, J.J.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To reach the goals of the European Green Deal (CO2 emission reduction of 55% by 2030 and climate neutral by 2050), North-Western Europe has to import sustainable energy as locally produced renewable energy will not be sufficient to meet the total demand. This will be realised by importing green hydrogen from areas with a surplus of renewable energy. If those areas are in another continent, the hydrogen is expected to be imported by vessel and received and stored in a hydrogen import terminal. Since Gasunie has an LNG plant in the Port of Rotterdam that becomes available within a few years, they want to investigate the possibilities to retrofit this plant into a hydrogen import terminal.<br/><br/>This research has investigated if the current LNG-Peakshaver can be retrofitted to an LH2 import terminal. This import terminal will receive, store and process LH2 to be delivered to the hydrogen Backbone (future hydrogen grid in the Netherlands owned by Gasunie). The imported LH2 will be received from maritime vessels at conditions just above ambient pressure and below its boiling point (-253˚C). It will be stored in the retrofitted LNG storage tanks, and depending on the hydrogen demands of the grid, LH2 will be processed (regasified) to the requirements of the grid (5˚C and 50 bar). This send-out process is very similar to LNG and requires pumps, BOG compressors and evaporators as process equipment.<br/><br/>The differences in physical and chemical properties have been analysed to determine if retrofitting LNG process equipment into LH2 application is feasible. The three main property differences that most affect the processes at the terminal are 1. the lower temperature (-253˚C instead of -162˚C), 2. the lower density and 3. the lower latent heat of vaporization of LH2 as compared to LNG. In view of these differences, it has been established that the reuse of the current LNG equipment is not possible. Even the pipes cannot be reused, as the LH2 pipes must be vacuum insulated to prevent liquid oxygen formation at the outside of these pipes.<br/><br/>Enhanced research has been carried out into the required process equipment. For the LH2 pumps, cavitation and the low pressure-head of the centrifugal pump are a problem. To overcome these, a special inducer is used, and three HP pumps in series to reach the desired pressure of 50 bar. Regarding the hydrogen BOG compressors, a vertical labyrinth (reciprocating) type is considered. However, manufacturers cannot yet design compressors that operate at temperatures as low as -250˚C. For the evaporator, a Super-ORV design with seawater as the heat source is considered the best option to evaporate the LH2. This design is an enhanced ORV that improves the heat transfer, which is desirable considering the lower temperatures of LH2. <br/><br/>Retrofitting the LNG tank is essential since it is the most expensive part of the plant. The current inner tank material and insulation are not capable of handling LH2. Therefore, two solutions have been explored to retrofit the storage tank. The more expensive solution -resulting in a lower BOR- is implementing a new vacuum insulated storage tank inside the existing concrete construction. The other option is to attach membrane insulation panels at the inside of the current storage tank.<br/><br/>Simulations have been performed to analyse the desired terminal configuration with regard to energy efficiency. The differences in configuration depend on the tank's insulation method, BOG processing, and cold exergy utilization. From these results, it is concluded that a compressor that can handle temperatures as low as -250˚C is essential for an LH2 terminal as it dramatically improves energy efficiency. Considering the terminal configuration, it is concluded that a membrane insulated tank combined with a recondenser to process the BOG flow is the desired solution if the terminal has baseload send-out. However, when a low minimum flow is required, a vacuum insulated tank in combination with “cold” BOG compressors is the best solution. Both configurations have an energy efficiency loss for baseload send-out of 0,13% of the HHV. To determine the feasibility of the terminal configuration, a further cost-efficiency evaluation is essential, next to this energy efficiency analysis.<br/><br/>The overall conclusion is that for the storage tank, the most expensive part of the plant, potential solutions to retrofit it exists. Especially the membrane insulation method is very promising and deserves more in-depth research. However, reusing the LNG process equipment is not possible. The equipment for the LH2 process is not yet commercially available except for the LH2 pumps. Further research is recommended because an LH2 import terminal has many advantages over other hydrogen import terminals, namely a relatively simple and flexible send-out process that requires little energy input.","Hydrogen; Liquid hydrogen; Hydrogen import terminal; Converting LNG to LH2; Process efficiency; Thermal exergy LH2; H2 BOG compressor; LH2 pump; LH2 evaporation; Para ortho hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

They believe in their Car-as-a-Service strategy that unburdens users with the hassle that comes with the ownership of a car. The fleet of cars and light commercial vehicles is allocated for 73% at corporate client (companies with a fleet &gt;25 vehicles). There is continuous movement in this market segment due to developments such as mobility budgets and total mobility solutions. During the last years, there was much talk around these subjects. However, it was mostly talking without concrete action leading to change. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt around the world. The restrictions to our daily lives to contain the virus had far-reaching consequences on how we moved around the last 1,5 years. The number of kilometres driven for business purposes decreased in 2020 by 26% in comparison to the year before (NZMO, 2021). With the lease cars sitting on the driveways, companies were looking to update their mobility policy to facilitate the ‘new normal’ after the pandemic. In the first part of this report, the mobility trends, market movement towards total mobility solutions, LeasePlan and the changing mobility needs of the employer and employee are analysed. The call to create more sustainable and flexible corporate mobility solutions were present in the different analyses. The market is rapidly moving in the direction where the employee chooses between different modalities to travel the needed business kilometres. The direct competitors of LeasePlan are working on total mobility solutions that, next to the traditional lease car, include shared car services, public transport and e-bikes. LeasePlan is currently moving in the same direction with the development of a total mobility solution. The employees are divided in their view towards the lease car. There is a growing group that is actively avoiding the lease car choosing for a cash option even though they are eligible for a lease car. They do not want the rigidity of a four-year contract. The counterpart is the group that uses the lease car for personal mobility needs. When the lease car was stationary for corporate kilometres during COVID-19, it was still regularly being used to drive privately. Using the current strengths of LeasePlan and the insights from the analyses, an ecosystem was designed to transform the lease car into a shared modality. SharedLease is a new proposition that LeasePlan integrates within their future total mobility solution. The new proposition allows colleagues without a lease car to make business kilometres in an appropriate car. The lease car drivers will receive credits when they make the car available to their colleagues. With these credits, they can purchase a vacation car. Solving one of the main reasons employees do not want an electric lease car is range anxiety (Crothers, 2020). In this report, SharedLease is elaborated and the horizon before and after is presented. SharedLease allows LeasePlan to venture towards shared car services while staying within their current Car-as-a-Service strategy. Meanwhile, the changing mobility needs due to the ‘new normal’ after the COVID-19 pandemic are met, giving the employee the needed flexibility.","Mobility; Car-Sharing; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By 2030 this will be approximately 5 billion (Lea, 2017). On the one hand, with fast urban growth also come challenges in the way we build and manage cities. On the other hand, technologies that are discovered in this era of digitization can produce opportunities for the economic and social development of cities. Not only making sure that cities stay safe and livable, but also to improve them, these technologies are indispensable. Worldwide engineers turn to technology to tackle challenges of fast urban growth (Arroub et al., 2016). Aside from tackling these challenges, technologies provide opportunities for economic and social development of cities keeping the cities safe and livable. Both of these aspects are often gathered under the term: ‘Smart City’. Though there are many definitions, visions or imaginaries of what a smart city is or should be, there are key elements that can be attributed to ‘smart cities’. One of the key elements of a smart city is collecting data through sensors embedded in our surroundings to better understand, monitor, regulate and plan the city, with the goal to stimulate and support innovation and economic growth and provide sustainable and efficient urban management and development (Kitchin, 2014). However, data raises concerns regarding its design, development and deployment for smart cities (Al Nuaimi et al., 2015) as well as other concerns relating to ethical issues (Kitchin, 2014). Privacy certainly proves to be the most prominent issue in digitization and big data (Kool et al., 2017). Several international organizations have even identified privacy as a key policy, regulatory and legislation challenge of the 21st century (van Zoonen, 2016). This leads to the following design goal:<br/>“Designing a tour that enables citizens of Utrecht to critically reflect on the collection and use of their personal data and its privacy consequences within the smart city”. Pusca is an application based Personal Utrecht Smart City Assistant that takes the user on a one time tour through Utrecht to explore and experience smart city technologies that could improve their quality of life. Each of the stops presents a service provided by a smart city technology that can be experienced by sharing personal data. The user is asked to make a trade-off between their estimated privacy value of the asked personal data and the benefits of the presented smart technology. At the end of the tour the user gets confronted with privacy consequences of sharing their personal data that provokes a critical reflection on the trade-offs that the user made during the tour. This design is a start for knowing how we want our privacy to be protected, by letting people create an opinion about this. I hope that this project can be a first step into creating a society where open and standard policies about safeguarding citizens’ privacy within smart city technologies will be secured. <br/><br","Smart City; personal data; privacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","br/>Elections polls have been known to exist since 1824 [14], to fulfill the objective of what is happening and may happen. In this thesis it is investigated what the performance of election polls is and if the aggregation of polls give a better forecast than the polls themselves. The data is used of Spain during years 2012 until 2017 and The Netherlands during years 2010 until 2021. Furthermore, in this thesis the results of Spain and The Netherlands are compared. The aggregation of polls is done by using The Classical Model of Roger Cooke [2] and by using two types of Equal weighting. When using the Classical Model two different methods are used, namely a window-shift way and a cumulative way. The comparison between the aggregation of polls and the polls themselves is done by looking at the unnormalized weights and the total absolute differences. The results were quite different for the two countries. However, for both countries it appeared that method 1 was better when looking at the unnormalized weights, while method 2 was better when considering the total absolute differences. When looking at the unnormalized weights for the Spanish data the forecast when aggregating the polls, using the Item weight decision maker, was better than most of the polls’ forecasts. In addition when looking at the absolute total differences of the Spanish data, the forecast when aggregating the polls, also using the Item weight decision maker, was better than most of the polls’ forecasts. Similarly for the Dutch data when looking at the unnormalized weights, the forecast of the election when aggregating the polls, using the Performance-based decision maker, was better than most of the polls’ forecasts. In addition, when looking at the total absolute differences, the aggregation using the Equal weight decision maker based on distribution was better than most of the polls’ forecasts.","Decision theory; Classical Model; Aggregation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Awan, N.N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","At present, there are two common ways to understand the impact of industries on the environment. One of them is to abstract statistics from the real industrial pollution scene and base the understanding and decision making on those statistics. The other is to regard the images of industrial landscape as a certain type of aesthetics. Neither of these two perspectives can give us a real insight of what is actually happening around Yekaterinburg, one of the cities in the world most polluted by heavy industry, what the causes are and how they have reshaped the local life. Instead, we need a ‘transcorporeal’ perspective - a term developed by Astrida Neimanis and Rachel Loewen Walker. Being transcorporeal, in her essay, means to go beyond the bifurcations of nature-culture or human-weather opposition, and instead to feel the process of ‘weathering’ where human body interacts intimately with the change of temperature, humidity, sunlight resonating in our skin, veins and nerves, for a better understanding and reaction to climate change. This essay applies and adapts Neimanis’ inspiring theory of transcorporeality to the realm of industrial impacts, because climate change and industrial impacts are similar to each other, in the sense that they can both be seen as the disturbance or damage to the natural environment, where human activity has played the main role combined with the feedbacks from the ecosystem, and in return has influenced the living conditions of people. With this ‘transcorporeal’ perspective, we might truly internalize the industrial impact on the environment, and even help us be critical about our moves towards the industrial impacts.","weathering; industrial; transcorporeal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Although the metro is a very energy efficient option for passenger transportation compared to internal combustion vehicles, it is still a very prominent energy consumer. Further, due to the global pressure to reduce CO2 emissions, there is a worldwide demand for efficiency and sustainability improving solutions and approaches for railway traction systems. Also, in Amsterdam, the municipality sets great ambitions regarding installed PV power in the city and the emissions related to public transit. The municipality of Amsterdam has the goal to have an installed PV power capacity of 250 MWp in 2022 and to reduce CO2 emissions with 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. Also, the metro system has to become 35% more energy efficient in 2030 compared to 2013. Moreover, the municipality wants to offer emission free public transport in 2025. To reach these ambitious goals, no piece of land suitable for PV can be left unused. </p> <p>In the past, PV systems have already been installed on metro station roofs, connected to the AC-side of the metro traction network. However, no PV systems have yet been connected to the DC-side of the traction network, which would have enabled the connection of PV systems anywhere along the track. Also, there is still a lot of unused land along the metro tracks in Amsterdam, with a total available surface of 47991 m2. This land could potentially be used to install PV systems with a total installed power of 4511 kWp [1]. To increase the amount of installed PV power and to fully utilise the available land along the metro tracks, this report focuses on the connection of PV systems directly to the metro traction system, at the DC-side of the traction network, to accelerate the energy transition and to reach the sustainability goals in Amsterdam.</p> <p>This report includes a comprehensive study on the challenges related to the integration of PV systems at the DC-side of the traction network, as well as possible solutions to mitigate these challenges. To further increase the energy efficiency of the traction network with PV systems, the integration of additional solutions like energy recuperating inverters in power substations and energy storage systems are discussed as well.</p> <p>To study the energy saving effects as well as challenges of PV systems connected to the DC-side of the traction network, a Simulink model of the traction network is created, using measurement data of an M5 metro, the metro timetables and traction network parameters as an input. The input data for a specific pilot location, located nearby station Amsterdam RAI, is used for the simulations. Also different PV systems, with sizes of 202 to 799 kWp are simulated with PVsyst, using meteorological data for the pilot location. The simulation results are used in the Simulink model, to simulate a PV system connected to the traction network. Also inverters and storage systems are simulated using the Simulink model. </p> <p>The results show an energy saving enhancement effect, due to decreased ohmic losses in the network as a result of the injection of PV power, meaning that more energy is saved than supplied by the PV system. However, due to the intermittency of the load and regenerative braking, only 51.5-83.0% of the potential PV energy yield can be supplied to the traction network, depending on the PV system size, resulting in a waste of PV energy. A variable PV output control strategy is proposed, which can increase the energy output of the PV system with about 13-22%. When using an inverter in a substation, the amount of supplied PV energy can be increased to 83.4-97.6%, by exporting the surplus of energy to the power grid. Also, using the inverter, a significant amount of braking energy can be recuperated, which would otherwise have been wasted in the braking resistors of the metros, leading to even more energy savings. Also, an energy storage system is simulated. The results show that the storage system could theoretically prevent any waste of PV energy, while also saving braking energy and decreasing ohmic losses even more. </p> <p>Using the results for an economical feasibility study on a PV system with and without inverter shows that a PV system operating alone would have payback period of 11 years, which can be reduced to 5 years by using an inverter. Although this research focuses on integrating PV systems on the metro network of Amsterdam, the methodology can be applied to DC traction systems worldwide.","PV; metro; traction; DC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-15","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Meulen, Mark-Jan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis, the resistance of a single degree of freedom liner is investigated experimentally. Semi-empirical resistance modelling fails at higher Mach numbers (M<sub>0</sub>&gt;0.3) and sound pressure levels (SPL&gt;130dB), and experimental work is missing in these conditions. An experiment combining in-situ impedance measurements and phase-locked particle image velocimetry is selected. This combined approach allows to evaluate the resistance, in-orifice velocity, friction velocity, vorticity and turbulence intensity.<br/><br/>The high grazing velocity and low acoustically induced velocity form a wide range of velocity scales that the PIV measurement must resolve. This sets a requirement for the dynamic velocity range that typical PIV with advanced interrogation techniques is not expected to achieve. A multi-frame approach is selected, which combines measurements with different pulse separation times. A second benefit of such a multi-dt approach is that information from different pulse separation times allows to decompose the PIV measurement noise from the turbulent fluctuations. Limits on the pulse separation time are seen in the freestream velocity, acoustic frequency, correlation strength and spatial filtering. The resulting timing ranges are evaluated before the experiment, and experimentally confirmed to be appropriate.<br/><br/>The decomposition between PIV measurement noise and turbulence is shown to be not applicable to the current data, as the measurement noise is correlated with the pulse separation time. This is caused by turbulence intensity and laser sheet reflections near the liner's face sheet. A DVR of 600 is achieved, and an improvement with respect to a grid refinement approach is seen. The difference between multi-dt and grid refinement vanishes towards the wall, and the DVR itself is also seen to decrease, due to the increase in measurement noise towards the wall. It is shown that the DVR must exceed the expected range of velocity scales by approximately 25% to accurately resolve phase-dependent quantities.<br/><br/>Results for the friction velocity found from a momentum-integral method and from a log-law fit, modified for surface roughness, transpiration and inclusion of the outer layer, agree well with direct drag measurements. The boundary layer is seen to develop in a periodic manner over the orifices, and the influence of the aero-acoustic interaction at the liner on the local friction velocity can not be neglected. The in-orifice velocity fluctuation RMS is consistent between the in-situ impedance and PIV measurements. A lumped-element model suggested in literature is shown to accurately predict the in-orifice velocity scale, but it requires an accurate value for the orifice quality factor. The quality factor is associated to the reduction in effective open orifice area, known as a vena contracta. It is thereby inversely proportional to the friction velocity, and the in-orifice velocity scale. The current results on the quality factor agree qualitatively and quantitatively to statements and suggestions from literature. The resistance is confirmed to be a function of the friction velocity and the in-orifice velocity \gls{rms}, with both velocity scales associated to vena contracta. A velocity scale associated to the intensity of vortex shedding from the orifices is introduced by integrating the acoustically induced vorticity near the wall. The onset of non-linear resistance is confirmed at a ratio between the in-orifice and friction velocity scales of 2, and is clearly linked to the intensity of vortex shedding.","Aero-Acoustic Noise; acoustics modeling; liner; Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV); Dynamic Velocity Range; sound absorption; Aircraft Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

While Operations Research (OR) has mainly focused on long-term strategical fleet planning optimisation, certain operators such as humanitarian air services must make shorter-term decisions due to their operating environments and mission specifications. This research proposes a novel methodology for combining fleet planning and flight scheduling on a tactical time frame, weeks to months, using the United Nations Humanitarian Service's (UNHAS) South Sudan mission as a case study. The scientific approach consists of using two different linear programming models sequentially to divide the decision making process and reduce the computational complexity of the problem at hand. A multi-commodity network flow model is first used to size an initial fleet and investigate the transshipment of passengers throughout a network. The outputs are then used by a Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) model to further increase the accuracy of vehicle routes and passenger operations. The main results show that the methodology proposed can reduce the weekly routing costs by 40% compared to expert flight planners who schedule and route humanitarian requests on a daily basis, and reduce the fleet size by 60% from 14 air assets to 6. The research demonstrates that the developed optimisation framework can effectively be used as a decision support tool for both aircraft contracting, and flight routing and scheduling with the main objective to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian air operations.","Fleet planning; Operations Research; Humanitarian air operations; Vehicle routing and scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This urban environment is highly constrained due to being limited to the low-altitude airspace directly above the existing road network. To increase understanding of the factors influencing the capacity of urban airspace, multiple empirical studies have been performed using fast-time simulations. However, the empirical nature of these simulations hampers the extrapolation of their results beyond the specific conditions that have been tested. At the same time, the emergent behaviour of aircraft in constrained urban airspace, such as queueing and local hotspots, yields the existing analytical models for general airspace invalid. In this paper, we derive and validate an analytical model approximating the relationship between the mean flow rate and mean density in a two-dimensional orthogonal grid network airspace, expressed in the so-called Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram. This analytical model is based on road transportation queueing theory and can explain the different interactions occurring in constrained urban airspace compared to general airspace. Notable findings show that the entire airspace can become unstable when the maximum capacity of a single intersection only is reached. Furthermore, the maximum airspace density is found to be unaffected by cruise speed. The results demonstrate how the derived analytical model for the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram provides an increased understanding of the factors that influence capacity of constrained urban airspace, thereby offering an effective tool for urban airspace design applications. Moreover, this model lays the groundwork for the derivation of more expanded models, including the altitude dimension and non-orthogonal or non-four-way intersections, that can further improve comprehension of constrained urban airspace.","BlueSky ATM simulator; Decentralised airspace; Constrained urban airspace; Speed-based conflict resolution; Analytical model; Airspace capacity; Airspace stability; Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram; Urban Traffic Management (UTM)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Connected arrays are becoming more prevalent as a well suited solution to achieve the desired bandwidth. In order to increase the bandwidth and the scan angle of this type of array, horizontal artificial dielectric supersaturates have been used with good results. However, those superstrates come with an increase in cross polarization. The cross polarization of connected arrays with isotropic dielectric substrates and superstrates is thoroughly investigated in this thesis, along with an analysis on the cross polarization of the connected array with artificial dielectrics. In order to reduce the cross polarization as a result of that superstrate, a novel artificial dielectric is introduced which implements vertical vias to form a wire medium. For this medium a method of moments analysis is performed and a closed form expression is found. Additionally, the wire medium is implemented in the horizontal artificial dielectric to form the top-hat loaded wire medium as a solution to the restricted height between layers of the artificial dielectric slab. The wire medium increases only the z-component, since the wire is oriented vertically, of the effective permittivity without impacting the other effective constitutive parameters. The increase of the refraction index for transverse magnetic wave reduces the cross polarization level and aids in the matching for E-plane scanning, while maintaining a decay over the scan angle. However, a trade off between the reduction in cross polarization and the E-plane scanning is observed. This trade off is a result of the large z-component of the effective permittivity which promotes the propagation of the TM0 surface wave mode. The effectiveness of this novel structure is shown by considered a satellite communication application for simultaneous operation in the Ku- and Ka-transmit bands with a scan angle up to 60 degrees . A design for this application is performed with good matching, -10dB for broadside and -6dB for scanning in both E- and H-plane, and with a low cross polarization level of &lt; −10dB. An evolved design with the manufacturing necessities, such as bonding layers and support layers, is obtained which exhibits a cross polarization level &lt; −15dB with the use of the introduced wire medium, however, the layer height restriction set by the manufacturer and the feeding structure still provide a challenge at the frequency bands which are considered.","Connected Arrays; Artificial dielectric; Cross-polarization; Wire Medium; wide-band; tightly coupled array; Wide Angle Impedance Matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","","","","","Antenna user terminal with Wide Angle Impedance Matching (WAIM) metamaterial radome",""

Therefore, heuristic methods are often used, especially when approximate solutions can be satisfactory. One such method is quantum annealing, a method where some initial Hamiltonian is slowly perturbed to anneal towards a problem Hamiltonian. The annealing schedule should follow the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics and should therefore be slow to yield the most accurate results. Finding a schedule that is both fast and still accurate has been referred to as a 'black art' and is usually just guessed. In this thesis reinforcement learning (RL) is explored to see if it can help with finding the optimal quantum annealing (QA) schedules. The Hamiltonians used are of<br/>the form of a transverse field Ising model. These are well studied Hamiltonians that can map to many NP-complete problems [1]. Finding a good balance between going both fast and being precise proved to be difficult and needs further research. Therefore this thesis mainly dealt with training an RL agent to find the most accurate QA schedule. The results show that the agent learns to find the most accurate (slowest) annealing schedule after 300,000 learning steps for a problem Hamiltonian with a single coupling constant J and no reward shaping. Annealing in an environment with a spin glass problem Hamiltonian proved to be difficult and has not shown good results in this thesis This needs further investigation. Nonetheless, the result on the single coupling constant Hamiltonian shows the potential of an RL agent for learning in a quantum annealing environment with very sparse rewards. This paves the way for further research into an RL agent that can find a schedule that is both fast and accurate on a wide range of problem Hamiltonians.","Quantum Annealing; Reinforcement Learning; Optimisation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Tindemans, S.H. (graduation committee); De Vries, Laurens (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To keep the generation adequacy of the power system up to standards, more and more countries in Europe are setting up capacity mechanisms. In a capacity mechanism power generation units receive payments for having their capacity available when this is needed (during moments of electrical supply shortage). These payments are received on top of payments that could be received from the energy markets or ancillary service markets [4]. This gives incentives to generation units to be available when needed and create a better investment climate in generation capacity. In this way, these capacity mechanisms can increase the security of supply. In the past, countries in Europe could implement such a capacity mechanisms locally, only local capacity providers (e.g. generation units) were allowed to participate. But the European Commission has developed new regulations which state that it is allowed for capacity providers to participate in cross­border capacity mechanisms. In this way capacity providers can receive additional payments from participating in foreign capacity mechanisms. But this raises questions, because the contribution (capacity value) of a capacity providers is thought to be dependent on its location. This thesis analyzes what the effect of the new EU regulations regarding cross-­border participation is on the payments resulting from capacity mechanisms. To answer this, the relevant EU wide regulations are analyzed and combined with the regulations of the capacity mechanism as implemented in Great Britain (at the time of writing), to find a likely implementation of a capacity mechanism in which cross­-border participation is allowed. A generation adequacy model was built and combined with the likely implementation of a capacity mechanism to analyze what the expected payments from the capacity mechanism will be to local and cross-­border capacity providers. This was done to analyze how attractive it is for capacity providers to participate in two capacity mechanisms. The generation adequacy model that is used consists of two areas, these areas represent Great Britain and France. For the model the same input data was used as in [38]. A Monte Carlo sampling method was used to analyze when payments are due. It was found that with the implementation of the new regulations regarding cross-­border participation in capacity mechanisms it is very attractive for capacity providers to be participating in two capacity mechanisms. But EU regulations set a limit on the amount of capacity that is allowed to participate in a cross­border capacity mechanism. Capacity providers have to compete with other capacity providers in a market based manner to be allocated to participate in a cross­-border capacity mechanism. This will likely lead to a break even point where participating in two capacity mechanisms generates an equal income as participating in just a local capacity mechanism. To analyze how much generation units contribute to the security of supply of a cross-­border capacity mechanism, the two area adequacy model was used. An analytical method was used to calculate the capacity value of the generation units. It was found that generation units can contribute to the security of supply of a cross­-border area, although it does support the area it is located in more than the cross-­border area. When the interconnection between the areas has a larger capacity, the effect of a generation unit to the cross-­border area becomes larger. It was concluded by implementing the new regulations in the model in this thesis, that the capacity-mechanisms do not give financial incentives to invest in generation capacity for the security of supply of a cross­-border area. This might lead to sub­optimal investments, because generation units can contribute to the security of supply of a cross­-border area.","capacity mechanisms; cross-border; generation adequacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background: The covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals worldwide and clinical prediction models may assist in timely identification of covid-19 patients at risk for clinical deterioration, i.e. `early warning'. In this article, we report on the development and validation of a new early warning model that predicts unplanned ICU admission or unexpected death within 24 hours from the moment of prediction, specifically for covid-19 patients. We compared the performance with two well-known and widely used early warning scores (EWSs), i.e. the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) [2] and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) [3]. Methods: We collected electronic medical record (EMR) data from covid-19 patients admitted to six Dutch hospitals between February 2020 and May 2021. We defined the clinical endpoint as a surrogate of unplanned ICU admission or unexpected death. To examine the added value of including non-linear predictor-outcome relations, we trained both a (linear) logistic regression (LR) and a (non-linear) random forest (RF) model. We included predictors based on patient demographics, vital signs and laboratory test results. We validated the models retrospectively in a `leave-one-hospital-out' cross-validation (LOHO-CV) procedure. Furthermore, we simulated a prospective validation by splitting all included patients admitted before and after August 1 2020 and simulated as if the models would have been developed based on the data collected until August 2020 and implemented during the remaining study period. Additionally, we examined different strategies for monthly model updating. We evaluated model discrimination and calibration for the proposed models as well as the traditional EWSs, and performed a decision curve analysis [22]. Importance of individual predictors was quantified using SHAP values [13]. Findings: In the retrospective validation, the LR model yielded a significant improvement in partial area under the receiver operating curve (pAUC) compared to the traditional EWSs in four of the six included hospitals, and in all hospitals by the RF model. In the simulated prospective validation, significant improve- ment was shown in two and four hospitals by the LR and RF models, respectively. Without any model updating, both model showed risk overestimation. We proposed a combination of monthly model retraining and hospital-specific re-calibration that could correct for this miscalibration effectively. In the decision curve analysis, the proposed models outperformed the traditional EWS in terms of net benefit (NB) over a wide range of clinically relevant model thresholds. Interpretation We have derived and validated a new early warning model specifically for covid-19 patients that outperformed traditional EWSs and showed good generalizability over different Duch hospitals. Also, we introduced SpO2-to-O2 ratio as an important marker for disease severity in covid-19 patients. Finally, we showed the importance of repeated model updating when developing medical prediction models in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic and proposed an effective model updating strategy. Future research is needed to validate the model outside the Netherlands. Background: The covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Improved prediction of a covid-19 patient's risk of dying may assist decision making in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. In contrast to traditional mortality models like APACHE II [1] and SAPS II [2], dynamic mortality models allow for repeated risk stratication of patients throughout the ICU stay. Earlier works [3, 4, 5] in dynamic mortality modelling show promising results, although most of these works propose models for the general (non-covid) ICU population and use relatively long or unspecied prediction horizons. In this study, we report on the development and retrospective validation of a model for dynamic, near-term mortality for critically ill covid-19 patients. Methods: We collected EMR data from 3 481 ICU admissions with a covid-19 infection from the Dutch Data Warehouse (DDW) [6], coming from 25 dierent ICUs in the Netherlands. We extracted daily samples of each patient and trained both a linear (logistic regression) and non-linear (random forest) model to predict in-ICU mortality within 24 hours from the moment of prediction. Isotonic regression was used to re-calibrate the predictions of the trained models. We evaluated the models in a leave-one-ICU-out (LOIO) cross-validation procedure. Findings Validation in 21 out of 25 and 18 out of 25 ICUs yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) &gt;0.80 for the logistic regression and random forest model, respectively. In the four hospitals that yielded an AUROC&lt;0.8, local differences in protocols concerning discontinuation of treatment may have played a role. The re-calibrated model estimations showed good calibration for both models (calibration intercept = −0.12, slope = 0.87 for logistic regression and intercept = −0.05, slope = 0.82 for random forest). Interpretation: This study is different from previous works on dynamic mortality prediction in the ICU as we presented a model speciffcally for covid-19 patients and introduced near-term mortality predictions (compared to long-term or in-hospital mortality). The predictions were calculated based on a mixture of static information (e.g. age and sex) and dynamic information (e.g., vital signs and laboratory values) and the importance of individual predictors was quantied using SHAP values [7], where we found FiO2, oxygen saturation and pH to be important predictors. The potential clinical utility of dynamic mortality models such as guidance in resource allocation and real-time patient benchmarking could be topics for future research.","risk model; Health care; machine learning; Multivariate analysis; Data Science","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The control and design of kites for airborne wind energy requires an extensive understanding of kite dynamics. While these have been thoroughly analyzed with fluid-structure interaction models, very little experimental data exists to validate them. Specifically, most experiments on kites so far have not obtained local measurements that can be compared to these models. Measuring deformations of a kite during flight can provide a basis to validate computational models and additional insights on its dynamics. In this study, a kite shape measurement method using inertial measurement units is developed. In parallel, a stereo-photogrammetry technique is implemented in the software <i>Blender</i> and used to validate the new method.<br/><br/>The inertial sensors are placed along the leading edge of a leading-edge inflatable kite to obtain the orientations of its tubular elements. The misalignment between the sensors and the leading edge elements is determined using a short photogrammetric measurement of the kite shape. With the corrected orientations, the shape of the kite is reconstituted using an algorithm that uses a reference shape of the leading edge and a basic structural model. Both measurement methods are used on a small-scale setup with a kite-surfing kite. Photogrammetry and the inertial shape measurement are compared and show a moderate agreement, but the two measurements could not properly aligned, making the comparison unreliable. Nonetheless, the inertial measurement is consistent with the turn rate, according to theory, and the new method is considered partially validated.<br/><br/>The inertial shape measurement is used to establish a link between the tip deflection and three flight parameters: the apparent wind speed, the turn rate, and the roll angle of the kite. The data is fitted to a function with physically relevant parameters that describe the sensitivity of the deflection to the different variables. The fitted function accurately follows the main trend of the data, but many outlier points cause a significant error, due to the poor quality of the measured data. This analysis still shows a possibility of empirically developing a simple description of kite deformations from shape measurements.<br","Kitepower; kite; Photogrammetry; Inertial Measurement Unit; Deformation; Airborne Wind Energy; Wind Energy; Experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The same goes for robots or other machines, which are also referred to as agents. Advances in e.g. technology and science have made such agents more and more sophisticated and capable. This opens up a plethora of possibilities for solving problems or automating processes.<br/>However, as agents and the problems they solve become more and more sophisticated, the software that controls these agents naturally also becomes more complex. Especially when considering systems of multiple cooperating agents. With rapidly increasing amounts of agents, observations and capabilities to take into account, the plans used to come to decisions become increasingly infeasible to create by hand. Thus automated methods are necessary to create such plans. <br/>The approach this thesis uses is inspired by the ability of human intelligence to abstract away pedantic details when planning. We do not for example include which muscles we will utilize, when we make a plan for picking up groceries. Deciding to get groceries is on a completely different level than deciding how many centimeters we want to move a limb in a particular direction. Abstracting away such details greatly reduces the size of any potential plan. Which makes plans easier to construct, while the scope of the problem remains the same. <br/>Thus, utilizing this notion of different levels of abstraction during planning, is the approach this thesis uses to improve planning for agents. This is done by extending the Macro Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MacDecPOMDP) framework to allow for an arbitrary number of levels of abstraction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

More and more researches present ways to build lightweight deep neural network (DNN) models that can retrieve the secret encryption key by analyzing a few power traces of the captured devices. In the meantime, traditional countermeasures are rendered more or less ineffective against these sophisticated SCA.<br/><br/>This research aims to present a novel approach in building SCA countermeasures using adversarial examples, cleverly crafted inputs that trick DNN models and force them to misclassify. As modern SCAs rely on DNN models, an adversarial-based countermeasure could alter the side-channel leakage so that the attacking model cannot identify the correct key. To investigate this approach, we add artificial adversarial noise on an unprotected dataset using evolutionary computation techniques and see how SCAs are affected. We present different methods on how this noise can be designed and how the different parameters of each method affect its performance. Our results indicate that an adversarial-based countermeasure can decrease sufficiently the performance of the attack.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we compare our adversarial-based countermeasures with traditional countermeasures. We show that our proposal can provide equivalent or better protection in some cases, while it presents worse performance than others. Through our systematic research, we identify the reasons behind this weakness and find solutions for future work.<br/><br/>Additionally, we investigate how such a countermeasure can perform against non-profiled SCAs. We show that our adversarial-based countermeasure is effective against this specific family of SCAs, even though it is designed against DNN-based attacks. Comparing this performance to traditional SCA countermeasures, we see that our proposal can be an alternative to noise-based countermeasures, while it fails to provide better security compared to time-based countermeasures.","Side-Channel Attacks; adversarial examples; SCA countermeasures; one-pixel attack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The project is in collaboration with Breman Schoorsteentechniek, an installation company located in the Netherlands. The initial brief was kept vague on purpose and described a project in which I was to find a way for Breman, to make their products more recognizable on the market. At the time, Breman was starting to rebuild their companies vision with ecologically sustainable intentions. <br/><br/>The initiation of the project became a search for what the vision for this product should be. Next to a small analysis of the current workflow, a trends and development research was conducted. This resulted in core movements for the year 2030 in the fields of: sustainability, construction industry and general world developments. These were then used to communicate a proposed world vision and were discussed with the board members of Breman. From these meetings three ideas where generated. After consideration of the core movements and the initial aspirations of the project, the direction of ventilation in renovation was chosen.<br/><br/>After a short transition from this general vision to the design phase, I constructed a model in which I could order my decisions. The model made that the overall design stayed consistent and that gaps in the argumentation for the concept could be determined. Concluding from this model, I designed a component based product. This product consists of a full central ventilation system with integrated IoT functionality. A distinction was made between a full fletched version and a budget version. I implemented the product in a virtual space, to offer a more tangible impression of the product.<br/><br/>With the conclusion of the design phase, I continued to a small evaluation phase. The virtual space visualisations where used in meetings with experts on different levels of the ventilation industry and the field of plastic injection molding. The gained feedback on the feasibility, desirability and viability of the concept was then used in combination with left over insights of the project, to write recommendations for Breman. As a conclusion to the project, the initial brief is reflected upon. The final result is Breman flow, the next step for ecologically sustainable ventilation in the renovation industry.","ventilation; renovation; construction; design; concept design; sustainability; branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This longer cruise results in an increase in the overall energy consumption. Only when performing the exact same mission, with and without regeneration, the regenerative mode can save up to 2.9% mission energy of the analysed mission.

(mentor); Tan, Y. (mentor); Rukanova, B.D. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the introduction of the shipping container as early as 1968, the shipping industry experienced great increase in trade and efficiency. The shipping container revolutionised the way goods are handled within the ports and enabled the growth of international supply chains. However, as this growth of trade continued into the late 1900s and early 2000s, both customs and the organisations within this chain experienced an increased administrative burden. This administrative burden was experienced within the different information streams to get the goods smoothly from the selling actor to the buying actor. Additionally, many actors within the supply chain perceive opportunities to greatly increase trade efficiency. Improving their business model through the addition of information based new services, expanding business through integrating other actors, and lowering costs through the development of cost-effective in-house capabilities. Early digitisation efforts have only produced limited results, as these mainly focused on automating internal business processes. These internal processes were often not able to automate communication with other actors. Processes still relied on a significant amount of paper communication.<br/>The introduction of digital platforms has greatly affected different industries, for example enabling direct booking within the air travel business. Replacing paper documentation with an electronic equivalent can enable an increase in efficiency, through reduced administration costs and improved planning and operational capabilities. Efforts in introducing a digital platform within the shipping industry have been taking place using different governmental research efforts. However, as a possible additional effect, the digital platform may put reconfiguration of the network in motion. This reconfiguration enables certain actors to partake a bigger role, whereas other actors might lose control of the supply chain process.<br/><br/>The TradeLens platform launched in 2018, is such a digital platform. This platform allows sharing both documentation (e.g. the commercial invoice, packing list, bill-of-lading) and supply chain events (e.g. lodging ENS, the actual time of arrival) with the other actors. The platform uses a blockchain infrastructure. This structure is used to increase the trustworthiness of the data. Firstly, the auditability hinders documentation fraud as the actors within the network can trace the exact moment and actor that placed uploaded a document. The immutability of the blockchain infrastructure allows the automation of information processes. When the information is uploaded it cannot be changed. It was developed by a co-operation between a shipping carrier and a technology developer. The platform was tasked with alleviating the pressure on the administrative systems of the different actors within the supply chain. This research investigated possible scenarios due to the introduction of a digital platform using the TradeLens platform as the main research case.<br/><br/>Research Question and Objectives<br/>This research aims to address the different possible future configurations of the network and roles within the container supply chain. To address this, the following main research question was developed: What is the possible supply chain configurations that come with a digital information infrastructure?.<br/>In addressing this research question a number of research steps and clarifications have to be answered. Firstly, the research has to determine what is considered an actor within the supply chain ecosystem and what are the key activities performed in that ecosystem. Secondly, the research aims to perform an analysis of each actor and thus explain the different roles to be able to perform this analysis a theoretical model has to be developed. Thirdly, the research will evaluate the ecosystem using this model. Fourthly, the different scenarios will be developed using the developed model.<br/>Research Method<br/>The research employed three main methods of data collection. Firstly, a literature review is performed to identify the important information and innovation concepts to be used throughout the research. Secondly, through analysing many different public sources, the research gains company insights and information for constructing different roles, activities, and resources. Thirdly, through interviews with experts on the TradeLens platform where careful attention is given to the shifting activities, resources and control within the configuration of the network.<br/><br/>The used approach can be defined in four steps. First, the researchers developed an initial meta-framework using the findings from the literature review. Secondly, the different concepts within the meta-framework were combined into constructing a model for the assessment of the ecosystem. Thirdly, a generic container shipping case is construed from the information gained from the different public and academic sources. Lastly, a comparison is performed between the construed case and a test case of a Dutch tyre importer. The main findings within these steps will be discussed in the following paragraph.<br/>Main Findings<br/>The research identified five key theories to be of importance within the model. These are 1. Ecosystem theory, 2. Stakeholder theory, 3. Diffusion theory, 4. Control Point theory and lastly, 5. Barriers and Stimulating Factors. Firstly, the concept of the business ecosystem. An ecosystem describes how different actors within a business domain influence and interact with the other actors outside and within the direct business network. This research investigates the effect of digital platforms on ecosystem reconfiguration. The chosen system of analysis for this ecosystem reconfiguration is the blockchain-enabled platform, TradeLens. This platform enables information sharing between the different actors using a trusted blockchain structure. The TradeLens ecosystem can be considered a service ecosystem, as the main value creation is intangible and the many different actors within the ecosystem co-produce the final value within the system. Secondly, stakeholder theory describes when someone can be considered a stakeholder and how to evaluate motivations and incentives. Thirdly, diffusion theory described how an innovation such as TradeLens goes through different phases before mass-market adoption. Fourth, the control points theory explain how different actors within a business process are able to exercise control on that process. Control points were used to describe how different actors are able to perform certain roles within the ecosystem. Lastly, barriers and stimulating factors describe how certain factors can enable or disable a certain development to progress further. In the case of TradeLens this was used to investigate further growth barriers and stimulating factors. <br/>This meta-framework was converted into a six-point assessment model. This model uses a comparison between different states of an ecosystem, to evaluate possible scenarios. The first case is that of the generic constructed benchmark. This benchmark has been developed from cross-referencing a selection of public and academic sources. The main task of the constructed case was to show a generic and common supply chain structure. To assess the enhanced version of the supply chain, a case study of a Dutch tyre importer was selected. This case was selected due to the extensive documentation around this case. Additionally, this case has ships of non-hazardous and non-perishable goods that do not require additional certificates and documentation that might be applicable for other goods. The constructed benchmark case and the tyre importer case were both evaluated using the six-point assessment. With regards to key activities, the main difference found was that the tyre importer self-organises its land transport as the organisation owns its own transportation vehicles. Secondly, the tyre importer case performed the import declaration itself. This in contrast with the benchmark case, where this task was delegated to a freight forwarder who organises both the land transport and the lodging of the import declaration. This main difference becomes more visible when assessing the second point, the key actors. Here it was observed that the freight forwarder was missing on the importing side within the tyre case. This was possible as the buyer/tyre importer performed the activities of the freight forwarder. Within the value exchanges and the key information, it was observed that the buyer was able to directly lodge the required data for the import declaration. This automated the customs lodging process and increased cost-effectiveness. Secondly, within the TI case, the buyer had its own land transport capabilities and did not rely on an intermodal operator to collect the goods from the port. This allowed the buyer to redevelop its strategy with regard to the supply chain. The effects of the digital platform allowed the process of lodging the customs declaration to be more efficient as the commercial invoice and HS codes could be directly gathered from this platform. This was made possible due to the API and blockchain data pipeline architecture of the digital platform. The API-structure allowed the data to be automatically collected, whereas the blockchain structure enhanced the trustworthiness of the submitted data. Regarding, intermodal transport. The digital platform allowed the buyer to have an accurate and actual time of release and arrival of the container. This allowed the buyer to improve the planning of the collection of the container. When observing the control points it was identified that the main control points of the freight forwarder are two-fold. First, it has the expertise and capabilities to be able to perform the customs lodging. Secondly, it has the capability of gathering and forwarding logistics data within the network. Within the tyre case, both of these control points were absorbed by the buyer.<br/><br/>Using the control point evaluation a set of four different scenarios were identified. These developed scenarios are not comprehensive, but a combination of these scenarios are likely to be observed in the near future. For every scenario, it is evaluated how the actor could use its current control points and the digital infrastructure to increase its control on the process and thus enable reconfiguration. Firstly, the status-quo scenario. In this scenario, there is not a clear actor who absorbs the activities of other actors. The main benefits of the digital infrastructure are experienced throughout the chain as the different actors increase their efficiency using automation and digitisation of the communication processes. In this case, no reconfiguration is thus observed. The second scenario is the development of capabilities to perform more logistical tasks within the supply chain by either the buyer, the seller or both. As observed within the tyre case, the buyer is able to more efficiently perform the customs lodging and the arrangement of land transport due to having access to the commercial invoice and the actual time of arrival and release of the container. An identified stimulating factor within the capability development of the buyer/seller is the standardisation of the data and the development of a market solution to booking and tracking logistical transport. The third scenario is where the carrier becomes a one-stop shop for logistics. Using their central position within the supply chain, they are able to redevelop their value offering. This offering is expanded with the logistical support of lodging customs data and providing intermodal transport. The fourth scenario is that of the freight forwarder expanding its value offering. Here the freight forwarder expands into managing the customer’s warehouse and perform a larger set of logistic services towards the customers.<br","Digital Infrastructure; Digital Platform; Ecosystem; Container shipping; Reconfiguration; Control point; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The sources suggest that British health care managers face financial and personnel availability pressures, and this makes it difficult to follow the instructions provided by the various organizations for the implementation of HTM activities including procurement. It is worth mentioning that the guidelines and decision-making frameworks provided by national organizations and various authors, mainly follow a project-based approach, characterized by linear HTM implementation/decision-making, and usually focusing on purely technical and legislative aspects of HTM. However, the health care sector, as well as procurement of medical devices, is characterised by complexity, constitutes an interconnected network of actors, parties and policies, and it is mainly context-dependent. Therefore, in addition to technical and legislative advice, it would be sensible to train health care managers in recognising the presence of internal networking relationships, and how to negotiate with all the actors involved in the different procurement, or more in general HTM, activities. <br/><br/>From an academic perspective, almost all the articles analysing procurement aim to identify potential challenges, mainly related to financial and technical concerns, and subsequently provide decision-making frameworks to indicate the right path to follow when deciding which device to purchase. Very few articles perform a satisfactory analysis of the main actors involved during the procurement process and their responsibilities. Moreover, no attempts have been made to look at hospital-based procurement from a networking perspective and apply ‘Management in Networks’ theories and strategy to understand and improve it. <br/><br/>Considering the aforementioned practical and academic issues, this study wants to investigate how hospital-based procurement could be analysed under the network point of view. Therefore, this dissertation wants to propose a new way of looking at hospital-based procurement, taking into account the presence of potential internal networks and interactions proper of an interconnected world. More specifically, this thesis project aims to provide a satisfactory description of the main procurement activities performed within the hospital, inform about who are the actors involved, how they interact, how/if they follow specif guidelines, and the main challenges encountered. Once the author will arrive at a satisfactory description of hospital-based procurement, she will analyse this last one under the paradigms of an interconnected world, explaining how the various networking strategies and paradigms can be used to understand and analyse hospital-based procurement. Finally, this research will identify factors that could be addressed by health care decision-makers to manage technology successfully. In particular, this study intends to identify valuable strategies for technology management decision-making and activities, to detect which one should be addressed by hospitals, and to establish technology management system priorities for health care managers and clinical engineers.","Procurement; network; Management; process-based; BPMN; Health care; UK","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Increasingly capable cyber actors breach secure networks at a worrying scale. While network monitoring and analysis should identify blatant data exfiltration attempts, covert channels bypass these measures and facilitate surreptitious information extraction. The many legitimate uses and widespread availability of DNS, the ""phone book"" of the internet, make it an attractive protocol for such covert channels. Covert DNS storage channels encode information in the payload of outbound DNS queries. <br/><br/>This thesis aims to assess the effectiveness of using machine learning methods to detect covert DNS storage channels. Our literature survey identified distinct differences in 1) algorithm type, either unsupervised anomaly detection or supervised classification, and 2) the information source for features, either isolated DNS queries or query sequences. <br/><br/>We performed experiments with (Extended) Isolation Forest algorithms for anomaly detection and Random Forests for classification, combined with different feature set compositions to evaluate their relative performance. Payload-only features were derived from isolated queries and behavioral features were extracted from time-based or fixed-length sliding windows over per-domain query sequences. We evaluated our models using a large-scale corporate DNS dataset of real-world proportions and a novel dataset of connection tunneling traffic and simulated credit card exfiltration malware.<br/><br/>We found that the majority of experiments were able to achieve high detection rates of 98.6% or more on a variety of storage channel threats, at low false positive rates. Classification models significantly outperform anomaly detection models on threats seen during training. Evaluation on unseen threats, however, revealed that generalization is difficult, provided the limited set of training threats and showed anomaly detection models more capable at detecting a variety of threats than classification models. We furthermore showed that feature sets with a behavioral component consistently outperform payload­-only features, although our experiments were inconclusive regarding the relative performance between composite feature sets.<br/><br/>Given the prevalence of benign storage channels misusing DNS for legitimate data transfer, we recommend rigorous filtering of training data beforehand to improve model optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, extending the malicious training set with DNS command-and-control (C2) malware is a promising future research direction to improve generalization of classification models.","Machine Learning; DNS storage channels; Anomaly Detection; Classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Naaijen, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In offshore operations a trend is forming where vessels are more often required to do multiple short operations within a small-time frame. Traditional mooring systems require execution time far beyond the operation time. Dynamic positioning systems offer great advantages for short time span operations such as crew transfer or lift operations. <br/><br/>Currently operations are planned based on DP capability plots and experience of captain and DPO. DP capability plots have little operational value as this is a static calculation and only provide information for average station keeping capability. During operations, the displacements made by the vessel around the DP set-point, also referred to as DP offset, are of great importance to determine the operability of an operation. Currently, the only way of calculating the DP offset is by conducting extensive time domain simulations, which are hard to integrate in the operational workflow of a DP vessel involved in walk-to-work operations. Therefore, a new approach is developed which predicts the vessel’s DP offset in the frequency domain, which enables a quick and robust calculation of the DP offset which is suited to merge into the on-board workflow. A frequency domain model is per definition a linear model. This leads to the main challenge of this research. A vessel operating on DP is non-linear. Currently there is no insight in what the effect is of non-linear components present in a DP system, on the linear approximation of a frequency domain model. <br/><br/>To investigate the effect of non-linear components onto the DP frequency domain model, a time domain model is developed that is capable of systematically enabling/disabling different non-linear components. The time domain model will serve as the ’truth’ in this research as no actual vessel data is available. Furthermore, this helps identify the effects more easily, as the input for both models are identical. From the time domain model transfer functions can be derived that serve as the basis for the frequency domain model. The transfer function is a linear relation between two variables. In this case, between second order wave drift forces and displacement of the vessel in surge, sway and yaw direction. The following non-linear components are investigated in this research: Thruster ramp up, thruster turning rate, forbidden zones, saturation and thruster allocation. Thruster allocation is present in each model that will be tested, as this is an essential part of a DP system. <br/><br/>Using two methods of determining transfer functions the model and the effects of all non-linear components are tested. The model is subjected to a variety sea-state, with different wave directions. Both methods offer similar results even though different approaches to determine the transfer functions are used. The selected method is capable of accurately predicting vessel offsets, although some extreme offsets are not captured. <br/><br/>It is concluded that the presence of non-linear components have little to no effect on the DP offset as calculated by the time domain model. Because natural frequencies characteristic to these non-linear components are expected to exist at much higher frequencies that naturally present in second order wave drift forces. Thus, making a linear frequency domain model suitable for DP offset forecasting. It is advised to investigate the effect of including 2D input spectra as this is expected to improve the current model.<br","Dynamic Positioning; model; Forecasting; Offshore engineering; Non-Linear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","","",""

(mentor); Vogt, M.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Climate change and global warming effect is currently one of the main threats that humanity is facing. The significant increase of greenhouse gas emissions since industrialisation has contributed to the global warming and therefore, the use of sustainable energy sources with zero greenhouse gas emissions has emerged as an urgent priority. Photovoltaic modules have become one of the world’s leading methods of generating electricity using solar energy. The share of solar PV electricity generation has significantly increased in the last decade and is expected to keep rising in the following years. However, the land area cost required for the development of photovoltaic solar systems is very high and it is therefore of foremost importance to increase the energy yield per unit area of PV modules. This is achieved using bifacial PV modules which make use of the irradiance incident on both sides of<br/>the module leading to higher energy generation. This, combined with the prediction that bifacial modules will dominate the market in less than 6 years, a parameter used for the evaluation of PV modules performance in different climates needs to be defined namely ”energy rating”.<br/>Energy ratings have been developed only for monofacial modules as described in IEC61853 standard and this work focuses on the extension of this standard to bifacial modules. For the calculation of the energy rating the energy yield and the irradiance incidence on both faces of the module have to be obtained. For this reason, an irradiance model is developed in MATLAB to calculate the irradiance on the rear side of the module using the data given in the standard IEC61853. Note that the front side irradiance is available in the existing data and as a result no further calculations for the front side of the module are required. The irradiance on the rear side of the module is obtained using 2D view factors taking into consideration the shading of the ground which can substantially affect the results. Also, the effect of the elevation of the module from the ground surface is examined and found that at sufficient height (≥ 1푚) the impact of ground clearance on the rear side irradiance is minimised. Finally, the ground reflected irradiance is obtained using the spectral reflectivity of different ground materials where it is shown that the use of improper albedo values can lead to inaccurate results.<br/>The next step is the calculation of the energy yield of the bifacial module. For this, a similar methodology used to obtain the energy yield of monofacial modules in the standard IEC61853 is used. More specifically, the incident irradiance on the rear side of the module is corrected for the angle of incidence and spectrum effects to generate similar conditions as in the STC. Additionally, the operating module temperature is obtained and using the total irradiance on the front and the rear side of the module the energy yield is calculated. Finally, the energy rating of bifacial modules is determined using two different approaches. In the first approach, CSER of bifacial modules is obtained using the energy yield and the total irradiance on bifacial modules. This approach results in lower energy rating than unity but needs re-scaling of the monofacial module energy rating compared to the standard. The second approach use the energy generated from both sides of the module but only the irradiation on the front side of the module is taken into account leading to CSER values higher than one, while the energy rating of monofacial modules as obtained in the standard is used. In both approaches the energy rating of bifacial modules found to be up to 17% higher than that of monofacial depending on the bifaciality of the module and the climate conditions.<br/>The developed model is validated using real outdoor measurements for a system located in Weurt, Eastern Netherlands. First, the in-plane irradiance on both sides of the module is obtained from the model and then, the simulated energy yield is calculated and compared to the measured energy yield of bifacial modules. The results show a small difference between the simulated and measured energy yield for the time period between October 2019 and June 2020 with a total variation of 4.65% in the total energy yield.","Bifacial PV; Energy rating; View fators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this thesis focuses on this method. The main objective of this thesis project is to build a model that accurately describes the motions of the Stella Synergy, the monopile, and the motion-compensated gripper, depending on the environmental conditions.<br/>This model is built in Anysim, which is a time-domain simulation software program of MARIN based on the RK2 numerical method. The model considers the early pile driving phase because this phase is governing in terms of risk. The monopile acts as an inverted pendulum in this phase, and the motion-compensated pile gripper must guarantee the stability of the monopile. The vessel uses its DP-system for station keeping. The DP-system contains a position reference system, a filter, a control system, and a thruster allocation algorithm. <br/>The vessel describes the wind, current and wave forces on the monopile and vessel. The environmental conditions are assumed to be collinear, and wave spreading is added to the model for some simulations. The wave forces on the vessel are determined with diffraction calculations in Ansys AQWA. The diffraction calculation for the vessel is verified with a diffraction calculation of MARIN, and the diffraction calculation for the monopile considers the shielding effect and is verified with a calculation with the Morison equation. <br/>A motion-compensated pile gripper with two PD-controllers is built in Python. The gripper considers static and dynamic friction forces and a maximum delta force per numeric timestep to model the pressure build-up time of the hydraulic cylinders. <br/>Multiple 3-hour simulations are run to generate results. These simulations, which considers each a different sea condition, are tested by the six limitations of the model. First, the preferable incoming angle of environmental conditions is determined. The workability of the Stella Synergy is calculated operating at the North Sea using this preferable incoming angle of attack. Then, two adaptations to the model are tested to increase the workability. Using fast-rotating thrusters or changing the DP-gains result in the workability of 96.4%. The governing limitation is the pitch motion of the vessel. <br/>It is tested if using mooring lines in combination with the DP-system results in a footprint reduction. It is concluded that adding mooring lines could result in a footprint reduction, but it is crucial to gain insight into the optimal axial stiffness of the mooring lines. The monopile's influence on the vessel's motion is also tested. It is concluded that the vessel's surge, sway, roll and yaw motion increases significantly due to the environmental forces on the monopile, which are passed through the gripper to the vessel. Finally, the workability of the vessel during the worst-case single failure is determined. After improving the DP-gains for particular sea conditions, the workability for the worst-case single failure was 96.0%. The failure results thus in a minor difference in the workability.<br","Workability; DP-system; Motion-compensated gripper; monopile; installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-21","","","","","",""

For this purpose, this study identifies, defines, and evaluates reusable food container handling methods in the meal delivery industry. We conduct a simulation study to measure the environmental- and economical performance of different container handling methods. Our experimental findings suggest that: (i) food container returnment by drivers results in the largest amount of cost- and emission savings, (ii) customer returnment to any random reusable restaurant results in a less controllable system, resulting in more redistribution events, higher costs, and more emissions, (iii) the hybrid container handling method gives two options for return which enlarges the convenience for return by a wide variety of customers. We thus conclude that the passive handling method results in the largest cost- and emission savings, however, the practical implications i.a. concept convenience remains an important topic for further research.","Evaluation study; meal delivery industry; reusable food containers; economical performance; environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This improves the already known bound of (1 - 1/e - ε), for all ε &gt; 0. We then show that the same result holds true, if we allow elements to be covered by multiple sets. Furthermore, a completely novel extension is introduced, where weights differ per combination of sets. It is proved that, under the assumption that the weights are submodular and increasing, a greedy algorithm still provides a (1 – 1/e)-approximation. <br/>The latter algorithm is tested in the framework of optimal sensor selection. To this end, we consider all official weather stations in the Netherlands as our sensor group. We test the performance of the approximation algorithm, if some of the assumptions do not hold and no theoretical bounds exists. Corresponding weights are calculated, using two approaches: <i>inverse distance weighting</i> and <i>multiple linear regression</i>. For both approaches the in practice performance of the greedy algorithm is shown to be even higher than (1 – 1/e), even though not all assumptions hold.

Light is a mysterious phenomenon and the possibilities are endless, which required a broad exploration of various elements and applications of light. With a design driven approach this exploration took many forms. Ranging from finding inspiration, sketching ideas and building prototypes.  However, to be able to steer the creative process towards a valuable end result a deep understanding about the experience, needs and requirements of the user had to be formed. This understanding grew over the course of the project by holding interviews and organising a generative session. Results from these activities resulted in a structured overview of how the meditation ritual someone could be supported.  Research revealed that the user needs help in three areas, the creation of a routine, a formal practice of meditation and the relationship the user has with the ritual. The user is helped by shaping the routine, visualising this routine and by receiving notifications to show it is time to meditate. In terms of practice, the user is supported by getting into the mood of the meditation, through focus support (to avoid being lost in thought too much) and by having a transition between the meditation session and everyday life. Lastly the relationship the user has with the ritual is strengthened by creating a moment of clear awareness during the day. During this intervention the user is able to take a moment out of everyday life and reflect on its state of mind. Based on the created structure the creative process could be channeled towards a product. With a focus on the interaction and aesthetics it was possible to find a balance between the functionality and appeal of the product. This resulted in Prana, your luminous meditation assistant. A dynamic and interactive wall lamp with a focus on guiding a user in his or her meditation journey.  An evaluation of the product showed its potential to support a user through the meditation journey while providing an aesthetically pleasing experience that immerses you into the mysterious phenomenon of light.

However, studies on lattice structures in various fields focus on mechanical characteristics, design, and manufacturing methods. Lattice structures are known for being lightweight, shock resistant, etc., but repair and maintenance of these lattice structures are rarely investigated. In this study, the repairability of lattice structures is explored to extend product lifespan by enabling multiple Repair &amp; Reuse loops before the recycling loop in a circular economy. The principle of modularity was tested on lattice structures and its impact on the ease of repair, and manufacturing of large-scale lattice structures was analyzed. Modularity is a design principle of subdividing the structure into smaller parts called modules which can be independently created and assembled to form the desired structure. A hierarchical modular approach was introduced for cuboctahedral lattice structures that proposes assembling desired large-scale structures by using modules that are themselves assembled as a result of interconnecting sub-modules. The design of these unique sub-modules, intraconnection to form modules, and interconnections within these modules involved various prototypes and simulated iterations. The final prototype was fabricated using fused deposition modeling and tested under a quasi-static compression test to validate that there is no/negligible negative impact of modularity on the lattice structure’s mechanical strength. The hierarchical modular approach and its benefits for ease of repair and manufacturing were demonstrated over a fabricated and assembled scaled-down model of an arch-type pedestrian bridge. The product journey of structures built using this approach is illustrated with a focus on ease of manufacturing and the repair &amp; reuse loops. The study concludes with possibilities for future explorations in regards to this study and potential applications of such hierarchical modular lattice structures.","lattice; lattice structure; Circular Product Design; modular lattices; Repairability; Modular assembly; Modularity; Additive Manufacturing; 3D Printing; cuboctahedral; Lattice unit cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

An attempt to link the fraction of oscillators to the order parameter resulted in experience through the process of deriving the result, but a plot of the first few terms of this expansion showed it not being close. The assumption on which the expansion was based however was shown to be valid in simulations. More successfully an upper bound on the probability of synchronization was found. This probability was found on a ring consisting of N oscillators, and verified of a ring of 3 oscillators. The results was a bound better than one that was already calculated, though the method of verification used was not ideal. An analysis of the stability of solutions on this 3-ring resulted a visual representation of entrainment and an amount of stable solutions possible, which was 1. This result was in accordance with the more general result following from the investigation of a system of coupled rings with arbitrary sizes of either ring. We then expanded this system to conclude that the stability of the entire system could be split into the stability of either ring and the possibility of having a solution for the linking phase difference. We elaborated on general practices when numerically analyzing SDEs and integrations methods. The Kuramoto model proved to be kind in the sense that the Euler-forward and Milstein scheme coincided. In a more physics-centered approach we studied the Ising and XY model. This prompted literature study on the Kosterlitz Thouless transition, through analysing the spin-wave Hamiltonian and the energy of free vortex of a pair of vortices.

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.T. (mentor); Meinhardt, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A modular product-service approach has the potential to facilitate behaviour change within the snowboard boot context. The circular design strategy proposed in this report, including the 6 circular design principles, navigates the process of creating a product-service aiming to maintain a products’ value throughout its lifetime. With a special focus on Design for Attachment and Trust, Design for Durability and Design for Adaptability and Upgradability. Once a product-service has been established for a while, Attachment and Trust help estimate future consumer behaviour within the service. For snowboard boots in particular, Durability is defined as the main angle on sustainability to approach this project. The environmental impact of this product over a certain period is reduced by prolonging the lifetime of the product. When the value attached to a product by the user, slowly decreases over time, Adapting and/or Upgrading a product potentially renews the product value for the user. This is especially true for the functional and emotional values. This increased product value is complementary to product retention and thus longevity, the ultimate goal. <br/><br/>What motivates users to buy certain snowboard boots depends on the type of user. A beginner has more ignorance and a lack of knowledge to overcome in their purchase decisions , resulting in a price and comfort based purchase. While an experienced snowboarder demands certain qualities or features. The different types of snowboarders are captured in four personas, including their level of investment, attitude and behaviour on the slopes. Snowboarders can identify with different personas over time, as people's needs, abilities or interests develop over time. The created lookup table regarding persona shifting can be utilised to inspire user centered design while designing the product service system. The table further elaborates on the user's perspective during persona shifting, including the user's attitude, focus and purchase behaviour (table 1). To facilitate these changes, the adaptable and upgradable aspects of the product service system should include: <br/>- the level of comfort<br/>- the stiffness or firmness<br/>- the tightening mechanism<br/>- appearance <br/><br/>Sustainability is viewed differently among the participants of the qualitative user research. The various sustainable attitudes are independent from the snowboarder personas, which have been created from the user research data. Additionally, one's sustainable attitude is not necessarily linked to sustainable actions. Therefore, the designed sustainable, alternative product-service interaction should be superior to the current standard to avoid relying solely on benefits regarding sustainability. By doing so, an attempt is made to get both sustainable and non-sustainably behaving people on board. <br/><br/><br/>A market positioning analysis shows the opportunity to approach sustainability from a durability point of view. Deeluxe currently has a basis of a repair- and replaceability focussed product offering, so the transition to enter a modular system seems to be within reach compared to other brands. Deeluxe could be a pioneer in this field and potentially gain greater visibility and grow as a company, while establishing a more sustainable way of product handling. <br/>A modular product-service is proposed including a service set-up, a product-service vision and a product possibility that could enhance product longevity and stimulate the intended durable and modular behaviour. The service proposal includes the offering of separate product parts and a take-back system for repair or refurbishing of used products. The user is introduced to a different product interaction from the start, to trigger a mindset that thinks ahead. By evaluating the ease and benefits that comes with the service, the user is invited to think about their personal development as a snowboarder. Do they challenge themselves to become better? Are different product qualities demanded if so? and Do they want to explore different terrains? The threshold for trying different terrains might be lower when only one boot part has to be switched to support the rider properly. <br/><br/>This product-service represents freedom, growth, and sustainability without compromise. The boots are high end and high performance . the user is investing in their future, without spending too much. <br/><br/>The current standard of snowboard boots has been, re-thought, revised and redesigned in a modular fashion to prepare them for a more circular future. A possible product, the Exo-Flex, has been designed in a way that enables the user to alter the stiffness of the boot to their desires. By creating that possibility, the functional value imposed on the boots can be increased throughout a product's lifetime. Enabling the increase of a value that deteriorates over time, stimulates product retention thus creating product longevity.<br/>The Exo-Flex is especially designed for the All-in snowboarder persona, who enjoy freestyle snowboarding in the park. A form study concerning leg ergonomics and the specific movements required in snowboarding have defined the shape-design of the Exo-Flex. The main function of this prototype is to evaluate the design dimensions, demonstrate the intended use and evaluate the ease of use. The materials, the actual stiffness and structure still have to be designed and defined.<br","Product; Service; System; Design; Snowboard Boots; Sustainable Behaviour; Winter Sports; Modular Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.0959469,4.3040526"

The model is a version of run-and-tumble motion, where a particle performs both symmetric random walks and active transport. The direction and the speed of the transport are governed by an internal state process. We show that this motion converges to Brownian motion upon diffusive scaling and determine the limiting diffusion coefficient. The internal state converges to a stationary distribution, by which it manifests itself in the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we prove that the active particle satisfies the large deviation principle. This allows us to derive an implicit expression for the rate by which the probability of rare events tends to zero. Numerically, we investigate the influence of excluded volume interactions on the diffusion coefficient and the average velocity. We find that the velocity converges exponentially to its theoretical value as the number of particles allowed per position increases. In addition, this exclusion number strongly influences the manner in which the velocity decreases for high particle densities. Predictions for the velocity as a function of particle density based on the model are compared to experimental data of the molecular motor kinesin-II. We find that the model is not adequate for approximating the velocity of molecular motors in crowded environments and extensions in the form of Langmuir kinetics are suggested.","Markov processes; Molecular motors; Large deviations; Exclusion processes; Brownian motion","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Petkow, Dejan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A Low-Pressure Micro-resistojet (LPM) is a type of in-space electrothermal propulsion system for satellites that works by heating low-pressure (50 to 300 Pa) fluid flowing through microchannels/slots (typically &lt;1 mm diameter) using resistive heating elements like thin-film Molybdenum. This thesis delineates a response surface based method to explore and optimize the cross-sectional design of microchannels, which, as documented in literature, have so far only been either rectangular or circular in shape. Experimental studies place the efficiency of LPM systems at 25% which can be increased to 30% by reducing heat losses from the heat exchanger to the plenum. The concept is still in its early stages of development and therefore offers plenty of opportunities in the improvement of the propulsion system whether it be regarding the choice of propellant, design of propellant management system, choice of thruster materials or the design of the microchannels, which is the focus of this thesis. Usage of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the design of a microchannel for greater thrust efficiency requires the following steps: Design of Experiment (DoE) run to select samples from the design space, performing experiments to evaluate the performance of selected samples, building a response surface (or surrogate model) from the generated data and finally using an optimization algorithm to find a high-efficiency design. In this thesis, these steps were performed using (respectively): Sobol Sequences, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method using Sparc Industries' VSTRAP software, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). As a case study, the optimization was performed for Argon as the propellant, inlet pressure of 50 Pa, inlet temperature of 300 K and microchannel wall temperature of 600 K. The number of design parameters were set as 8 though the base geometry supports higher numbers as well. Using Sobol sequences to determine parametric values, 512 designs (termed polar designs) were generated. After DSMC simulations (validated with an experimental study in literature), the best performing design was found to have a thrust efficiency of 0.7019. 512 Rectangular designs were generated as well among which the best performing design had a thrust efficiency of 0.6566. From this dataset, the main takeaway is that the thrust efficiency peaks at a certain slot area and that small areal rectangular slots, common in literature, are not as efficient as broader slots with higher cross-sectional area (up to a limit). The CNN was trained on the polar dataset (CNN1) as well as the combination of both datasets (CNN2) to predict thrust efficiency from slot images. The predictions were, on average, within 10% from the simulation results. A GA run with 8-parameter geometry and with CNN1 as the response surface resulted in an optimum design with a thrust efficiency of 0.732. With CNN2, the optimized efficiency for 8-parameter and 15-parameter geometry was 0.7281 and 0.7455 respectively. However, on simulating the GA results it was found that CNN1 and CNN2 had overestimated the thrust efficiency by 11%. Thus in this case study, the most thrust efficient design is the best one from the polar dataset. The conclusion drawn is that a high number of designs generated using Sobol Sequences are enough to find the best performing design for a given set of input conditions i.e. choice of propellant, inlet pressure and temperature, and heaterchip temperature. As it seems that there is a strong correlation between slot area and performance, the number of designs to be generated can be based on whether it spans the allowable minimum to the allowable maximum area set by the designer. However, if the correlation between slot area and performance is not found after a DoE run for a different set of input conditions, then a CNN would have to be trained and used by the GA for design optimization. The thesis concludes with a design recommendation for the shape of a microchannel that may on experimental testing result in a high performing thruster. Improvement in LPM technology will further the capabilities of PocketQube satellites (5 x 5 x 5 cm^3 form factor) and also of large satellites for which it could function as precise attitude control thrusters. Low pressure operation allows for a compact and lightweight propellant management system and the thruster's high thrust-to-power ratio gives it a major advantage over competing propulsion systems such as hall-effect and electrospray thrusters.","Low-pressure; microresistojet; thruster; Propulsion; Design optimisation; Resistojet; DSMC; response surface; RSM; genetic algorithm; Convolutional Neural Network; CNN; Deep learning; Neural Network; Sobol; Direct simulation monte carlo; microchannel; PocketQube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The propeller has a chord based Reynolds number of 10<sup>4</sup>≤ Re<sub>c </sub> ≤ 10<sup>5</sup> and operates at an advance ratio of 0.225. The mean flow model of Hough and Ordway (H&amp;O) is used to compute the streamtube upstream of the propeller. This allows the distortion of turbulence due to streamtube contraction to be predicted by means of Paterson and Amiet's distortion model. The distortion of turbulence by the leading edge of the blade is modelled with the asymptotic solution of Hunt. Amiet's propeller turbulence ingestion noise model is used to couple the distorted turbulence to noise. The models are validated by means of an experiment. A square bar grid with mesh size 0.1m and bar width 0.01m is placed upstream to generate turbulence. A load-torque cell measures the thrust which serves as input for the analytical mean flow model. Using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and hotwire anemometry the turbulence statistics upstream and up to the propeller plane are measured. PIV is also used to measure the distortion of turbulence by the leading edge of the propeller blade. The experiment is done in the TU Delft A-tunnel, where acoustic measurements are performed using a microphone array. Results reveal that the model of H&amp;O overpredicts the induced velocities and a correction has to be applied such that the experimental results are matched. The analytical model and flow measurements show that the isotropic turbulence is not distorted due to the contraction of the streamtube and isotropy is conserved. The turbulence intensity and integral lengthscale do change and this is ascribed to the decay of turbulence behind a grid. Turbulence is distorted by the leading edge and an increase of the turbulent upwash velocity of 25% is observed. It is found that by using the decayed turbulence statistics, the tones at the blade passing frequency harmonics are best resembled. The correction for distortion by the leading edge does not improve the predictions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Thus, predicting the pressure loads is an important safety issue to ensure the reliability of critical structures in the event of a severe accident.<br/><br/>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes can be used as numerical tools to assess the risks of hy­drogen combustion and predict detailed transients of the pressure loads. The scenarios simulated in nuclear safety engineering can be analyzed with low fidelity models based on reduction assumptions of the physical phenomena. Specifically, the flame gradient models are chosen to model the com­bustion phenomena based on a turbulent flame speed to which the combustion propagates. Different approaches to compute the turbulent flame speed are implemented and compared in this study, in­cluding the Turbulent Flame Closure (TFC) and the Extended Turbulent Flame Closure (ETFC).

The MK-II rocket powered spaceplane uses High Test Peroxide for its main engine and reaction control system. Catalyst beds are required to decompose High Test Peroxide (HTP) to steam and Oxygen. To investigate the decomposition of HTP in a pellet catalyst bed a numerical model was developed which is capable of predicting High Test Peroxide flow decomposition in catalyst beds. <br/><br/>The model developed is based on a two-phase flow through the catalyst bed that is chemically reacting by undergoing decomposition. The flow is assumed homogeneous, adiabatic, and continuous resulting in steady state model outputs. Fast equilibrium adsorption and finite rate desorption of Hydrogen Peroxide on to the catalyst surface is assumed in a single step. The decomposition is modelled using the Arrhenius relations. Additionally, the flow pressure losses are computed using an extended Ergun relation for two phase flowthrough packed beds. The model can predict the flow temperature distributions up to 98% reaction advancement. The model was verified by comparing it to existing model results, this showed good agreements in 7 of the 8 cases. The results showed consistently that the model predicted 98% of the decomposition progression is achieved in a shorter catalyst bed length than the catalyst bed lengths in an existing model (4 to 14% shorter). The flow pressure losses of the models showed deviations compared to the existing models ranging from 5.55% to 12.18%. The differences in the flow temperature and flow pressures are discussed and related to the governing theories of the models. <br/><br/>To validate the model, experiments were performed. The test data were used in model validation and a good agreement was found between the test data and the simulated results. The simulated flow temperature and the measured temperature deviated from 0.41% to 1.93% of the adiabatic flow temperature. The overall pressures showed good agreement with the experimental average, with pressure drop deviations less than 1% of the operating pressure. In all experiment cases the flow distribution predicted was within the measured pressure roughness.<br/><br/>Many simulations were performed and compared to investigate the impact of varying design choices and operational conditions. In all cases the flow development along the catalyst bed length was assessed. In comparison to the simulations results it was found that an increase of operational parameters such as pressure promoted gas phase decomposition resulting in shorter bed length requirements. Similarly, the influence of feed High Test Peroxide concentration was evaluated and finding showed increasing concentration to shorten the required bed length. The analysis of the simulated conditions showed that the increase of mass flow inversely impacts the required catalyst bed length. This model serves as tool to identify the operational parameters and their impacts in catalyst beds. The Model outcomes demonstrating the effects of operational parameters and design choices on catalyst bed helps in understanding their interactions and can aid in catalyst bed design and optimisations processes.<br","Hydrogen Peroxide; Decomposition Modelling; Catalyst bed; High Test Peroxide; Thruster; Gas generator; Rocket; Spaceplane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The aim of our study was to program a social robot that tutors mathematics through verbal explanations supported by deictic, beat, and iconic gestures that align with explanations, and to analyse its effectiveness on learning outcomes. The learning outcomes entail cognitive outcomes and affective outcomes. A between-subject experiment was performed to research the effect of the robot’s use of supporting gestures on cognitive and affective learning outcomes compared to a robot that does not perform gestures or performs random gestures. In total, 78 children (Mage= 8.3 years) from Dutch primary schools participated. Results showed that the social robot effectively taught children mathematical equivalence by a significant increase in test scores between the pre- and post-test. No differences were found in test scores between participants in the supportive gesturing condition, the no gesturing condition, and the random gesturing condition. Participants showed high task and tutor engagement scores and head direction estimations revealed that participants were attentive towards the robot, but no differences were found between the three conditions.

(mentor); Walters, C.L. (graduation committee); Liu, Ping (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the need for more renewable energy, interest in floating wind turbines has greatly increased over the last years. These turbines have to withstand harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme waves called rogue waves. These rogue waves (or freak waves) are exceptionally large waves compared to the surrounding sea state and are defined by two different size criteria, one relating to the crest height and the other to the wave height. Research has shown that these rogue waves occur more frequently than expected, from which the question arose whether these rogue waves could be dangerous for floating wind turbines.<br/>This thesis aims to answer that question by evaluating the probability of such a wave interacting with a floating offshore wind turbine and the subsequent induced motion response. A location off shore California is evaluated for a spar-type floating wind turbine (SFWT). In this research, different time-extreme (TE) and space-time-extreme (STE) statistical wave crest and crest-to-trough models are used with historical wave data to estimate rogue wave occurrence probabilities. The STE models approximate the probability of a wave occurring within an area in time, as opposed to a point in time (TE), and are considered state-of-the-art. Wave data from 1998-2020 is used, which is a significant amount compared to the life of a typical offshore structure. A frequently chosen model for research into a SFWT is the OC3-Hywind concept, which consists of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5MW reference turbine and a substructure based on the Hywind spar.<br/><br/>The area size which leads to the STE models estimating a higher rogue wave occurrence probability than the TE models is investigated for the first time. This is done by comparing the TE and STE probability models to each other on the basis of their maximum estimated exceedance probability of the rogue threshold, for different area sizes. Only on rare occasions, with a very small area, did the most conservative TE wave crest model estimate a higher probability than the STE2 (wave crest STE) model. Therefore, the STE2 model appears most conservative when evaluating rogue crests for a SFWT. <br/>The Rayleigh model was the most conservative among TE crest-to-trough models that were considered, and estimated higher probabilities than the STE1QD (wave crest-to-trough STE) model in several sea states up until an area size of 12x12m2.<br/>The influence of the shape of the wave spectrum was investigated by two spectral bandwidth parameters. All four wave crest models showed an increase in rogue crest probability as the wave spectrum became narrower. Regarding the crest-to-trough models, no clear preference was observed. <br/>Long-term rogue wave probabilities were calculated for four sizes of rogue crests and waves, where the squared area of the STE models was based on the waterline diameter of the OC3-Hywind spar (6.5x6.5m2). Probabilities were averaged per sea state bin, and it was observed that for this area the STE1QD model was more conservative than the Rayleigh model. When single maximum exceedance probabilities are compared, the Rayleigh model can be more conservative in several sea states until an area of 12x12m2, but when overall occurrence probabilities are considered, this area appears to be roughly 6.5x6.5m2.<br/>Following the long-term rogue wave probability analysis, four rogue waves were each embedded in random wave series, based on their most likely wave spectrum, using a deterministic extreme wave model. With these wave time histories, simulations were run in OrcaFlex using a publicly available OC3-Hywind model. During the simulation the turbine was assumed to be in parked condition and only the wave loading was considered. Mostly the pitch angles and nacelle accelerations are limiting for safety, due to stability criteria and sensitive components in the nacelle. These limits are imposed by turbine manufacturers but are never shared publicly. Therefore, the results were compared with reference values from the literature. The dynamic response did not exceed these maximum reference values, but they can be considered quite serious as some did exceed lower thresholds.<br/><br/>Based on the long return period of the considered rogue waves, together with their induced dynamic response which does not exceed maximum reference values, it appears that these rogue waves alone are not dangerous for the considered SFWT. However, ultimately this will depend on the sensitivity of the components inside the turbine, as well as the desired risk profile of the wind farm owner.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-14","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Integration of these equations froma n initial displacement in the formof the fundamental mode resulted in significant mode coupling: energy was transferred from the fundamental mode to several other modes, before the energy would return to the initial condition. To date, very little observations of such behavior in mechanical vibrations have been reported. Recent developments in fabrication of high stress Silicon-Nitride (Si3N4) string resonators have shown that it is possible to generate resonators with extremely high Q-factors, proving a potential testbed for these mechanics. This research shows, through modal conversionof the FPUT potential, that one may observe significant FPUT behavior in systems with non-integer frequency ratios and certain coupling coefficients. In addition, it is shown that for the default FPUT beta-model, the effect of damping is negligible for fundamental mode Q-factors higher than 10,000. Simulations of the experimental<br/>frequency response of a high-Q Si3N4 string resonator show that the nonlinear dynamics of these resonators may be approximated by an analytical model that does not possess the required frequency ratios and coupling coefficients for FPUT behavior. Another string model, for which no mechanical equivalent<br/>has (yet) been found, may potentially show FPUT behavior. Several string-like resonator designs are tested using a numerical tool which can extract the modal coefficients. These resonators are modelled using simplified<br/>deformation models, which account only for axial deformation of the structure. The results for various string-like designs show that the eigenfrequencies and nonlinearity may be engineered easily, but these do<br/>not generate the required coupling coefficient for FPUT behavior.","Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou mechanics; Silicon Nitride; String Resonators; String Dynamics; Mode Coupling; Internal Resonance; Duffing Nonlinearity; FPUT; FPU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-13","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to climate change, glaciers are melting on the Tibetan Plateau. These glaciers are the water source for big rivers as the Brahmaputra which stream towards the most densely populated area on Earth. Previous studies indicated that water surface heights of lakes connected to the glaciers are increasing in the north of the Tibetan Plateau, while they are decreasing in the south. Current literature does not provide a clear answer on the reason why the north and the south are behaving differently. For determining why the south is behaving different than the north, the processes in the basin should be identified and distinguished. For addressing what all the processes in the basin are, the waterbodies in the upper Brahmaputra should be monitored and their relation to the processes and the other waterbodies should be determined. For determining this relation it is of importance to first determine the lake surface heights and river surface heights in this area. This research focusses on determining water surface heights in the upper Brahmaputra and Nam Co basin (located in south of the Tibetan Plateau) using remote sensing, which is the preferred method since waterbodies in this area are difficult to reach for in-situ measurements.<br/>In this study, data of ICESat-2 is used for water surface height measurements. The laser satellite mission ICESat-2 has been launched in 2018 and makes use of three pairs of beams. Lake surface heights are determined by first computing the water surface heights per beam and finally per ICESat-2 passing. Several additional steps to determine the river surface heights are required due to the slope of rivers. Therefore, the passing beams are clustered, resulting in several locations in the river which can be further analysed. It is found that river surface heights are harder to determine due to the presence of bars and shorelines. Therefore, the method for determining the river surface heights should only be used for non-braiding rivers.<br/>A precision for both lake surface heights and river surface heights of 0.1 meters is found. This research found that ICESat-2 can have a contribution for determining lake and river surface heights due to its relatively good precision, but also due to its high spatial resolution. The ground-track spacing of ICESat-2 is lower than other satellite missions, resulting that ICESat-2 passes the most amount of lakes and river locations. In total the water surface heights of 299 lakes and 127 river locations are determined. This small ground-track spacing is at the cost of the temporal resolution resulting in large time gaps in the timeseries of the lakes and river locations. Therefore, a seasonal variation and generic water surface height curve will be difficult to assess. It is possible that ICESat-2 will miss the moments with the extreme water surface heights resulting in a misconception of the water surface heights. But, over a longer time period it may be possible to fit a generic water surface height curve through the water surface heights of lakes larger than 10 km<sup>2</sup> due to its higher amount of ICESat-2 passings.","Water surface heights; ICESat-2; Tibetan Plateau; Brahmaputra; Nam Co; river; lake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These five structural elements support a way of working that facilitate the environmental factors for creativity. To Summarize this, the innovative success of these firms can be explained by their ‘collective character’. Most Young firms have an environment very much suited for creativity and innovation, although they might not have the experience or capacity to develop these. When firms grow they do so along a number of paths these paths are ‘one way streets’. As a side effect these bring systems into the organization that could be counterproductive to innovation. When innovation is the main purpose a collective structure is more suitable than the traditional business structure.

It involves the acquisition of time series of MR images while the brain is at ""resting-state"" and serves as a biomarker for various neurological conditions. The acquired resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data, however, can be corrupted with various artefacts (head movements, physiological movements like breathing etc.). Several preprocessing pipelines have been developed to counter the effect of these known artefacts. However, there might be some artefacts that could not have been attenuated from the signal and might lead to incorrect assessment. Therefore, the thesis proposes model-based filtering of the minimally preprocessed (free from known artefacts) resting-state BOLD signal. It was observed that these signals have long memory dependencies. Hence, the usage of autoregressive fractional integrative process filters is proposed for this purpose.<br/>Furthermore, the utility of the approach is demonstrated by removing the effect of white noise from a synthetic signal with statistical properties similar to the resting-state BOLD signal. Afterwards, the proposed method is implemented on the minimally preprocessed resting-state BOLD data of 98 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The results suggest that the proposed filter, in contrast to the low-pass filter, attenuates the higher frequencies but do not eliminate them. Additionally, four different evaluation measures (power spectrum, functional connectivity using Pearson's correlation and coherence, and eigenmode analysis) were considered. The results provide evidence that the proposed method can be used as an additional step in the already existing preprocessing pipeline to mitigate some artefacts that could not have been filtered out. Besides, the results also provide evidence that the proposed scheme is suitable to capture the dynamics of resting-state BOLD signals.","resting-state fMRI; Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data; ARFIMA; Fractional Filter; denoising; Eigenmode analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

As a result, R2P is regarded as a promising production process for micro- and nano-scale features which exceed the conventional wafer sizes. In addition, the process has the potential to scale up the production of wafer based textures at a low costs, which would make the implementation of nano-features in products more accessible. To compete with alternative fabrication techniques, R2P NIL must meet requirements set by the industry for position accuracy and system repeatability. In this thesis, a study is performed on the positioning of micron- and nano-sized features in a two-dimensional plane in collaboration with Morphotonics, a company based in Veldhoven the Netherlands. The metrology of overlay from the semi-conductor industry is applied to NIL, to quantify the relative displacement and deformations of a given nano-pattern. Experimental results, obtained in a preliminary phase of the project, characterized the current overlay performance of machines available at Morphotonics. From the test results, a positioning error of the complete nano-pattern was found, in combination with a complex deformation which affected the relative distance of the imprinted features. Based on the characterization of overlay in R2P NIL, an interest in deformations of the flexible mould is developed. Concepts from roll-to-roll (R2R) production processes are used, to quantify the deformations observed in experiments. In R2R processes, deformation of a thin elastic material (web) is quantified by applying a beam model to the web. Using the beam model, the deformation of a web segment, constrained by two rollers, could be quantified in both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The models based on literature of lateral web dynamics, combined with experimental results obtained at Morphotonics, have given insight in the behaviour of the elastic mould during the imprint process. The models describe the transverse motion of the web on a roller surface and the deformation of the web in between two consecutive rollers in a dynamic system. Verification of the model was performed on the machines of Morphotonics. The transverse motion of the elastic mould over the rollers was clearly observed in the measurement, including a repeatable deformation pattern of the imprints as a result of a forced disturbance exposed to the system. Both of which, were expected to be observed based on the modelled expectations. Nevertheless, the exact error magnitude did not meet the expectations and only a rough relation between model and experimental results was found. In spite of the verification results not perfectly matching the model, the theory applied in this thesis has given insight in the behaviour of elastic materials in roller based transport. From the observations and gathered knowledge of this thesis, the performance of overlay in large scale roll-to-plate nanoimprint lithography has been characterized and considerations for future imprint modules have been made.","Nanoimprint lithography; Roll-to-Plate; Flexible substrate; Large area imprinting; Overlay; Lateral web dynamics; Web guiding; Elastic mould; Patterning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-13","","","","","",""

Green hydrogen is often suggested as a key-player to decarbonize the industry, replacing fossil fuels used for process heat generation as well as in hydrogen feedstock production. As there are an increasing number of projects that aim to produce green hydrogen and a Dutch hydrogen backbone is scheduled for completion 2030, the question remains how green hydrogen has to be priced in order to be competitive with its alternatives. This research project assesses the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen based on its alternatives towards 2050 for the Dutch industry. It compares four different process heat generation fuels and technologies as well as four hydrogen production alternatives to green hydrogen for hydrogen feedstock production, by using an altered levelized cost of energy method. The costs of these alternatives are based on a 25 year lifetime, assessed over investment in 2021, 2025, 2030 and 2035 with a commodity and CO2 price forecast up to 2065. The results are divided over two scenarios. Scenario I aims to demonstrate the real LCOE for green hydrogen alternatives at the time of investment and Scenario II compares the alternatives from 2021 to 2050 combined with business as usual costs up to the four investment moments. The results show the development of the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen based on the cost development of its alternatives over the coming years. The order of sectors where green hydrogen competitiveness is the highest are high temperature process heat generation, followed by hydrogen feedstock, medium temperature process heat generation and low temperature process heat generation in 2030. It can be seen that fuel costs are by far the largest part of the LCOE of all the alternatives that are assessed, which implies investment decisions ought to be made based on the expected fuel costs and not so much on overnight capital costs of investment. It can also be seen that for the majority of all investigated investment moments for the two scenarios, that the most economically sound investment options simultaneously is the option that contributes most in terms of pollution through CO2. This is a prudent indication that the current free market forces unfortunately do not aid the transition towards a lower polluting industry without nudging or pushing them into the right direction. This implies that well directed policy measures are vital to free market forces to take the first step towards lower pollution. With this research a contribution to science is delivered in assessing and implementing suggestions for improving the LCOE method as well as using the LCOE for process heat generation and hydrogen feedstock production, when comparing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources across various industrial sectors. A comprehensive overview of the research green hydrogen alternatives presents insights in costs corresponding to four different investment moments for the Dutch industry.","Green hydrogen; Carbon capture and storage; Process Industry; Cost assessment; LCOE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many of these studies are focused on developing deep learning models for a particular RF application. Therefore this master thesis focuses on the implementation of these kinds of deep learning models by using FPGAs such that these deep learning models can be used in an FPGA-based Software Defined Radio.<br/><br/>In this master thesis, a custom FPGA accelerator is designed for CNN models using reusable and configurable building blocks. The accelerator employs a streaming architecture and is fully pipelined, such that it accepts new input data every clock cycle. A key design aspect is that all building blocks in the accelerator are designed to be able to work on a portion of its input data. The implication is that the building blocks can produce an output as soon as enough input data is available. As a result, the work that the building blocks<br/>have to performis spread out over time and thememory required for storing data is also reduced. Moreover, the precision of the fixed point parameters and operations is configurable. Therefore there is no limitation of only specifically supporting binary or ternary operations.<br/><br/>This accelerator has been tested for the automatic modulation classification problem. The result is an accelerator that can process real-time data at 600MHz and consume fewer FPGA resources than other similar initiatives. In a direct comparison with hls4ml, the designed custom accelerator achieves 2.4 times higher throughput and 2.3 times lower latency for the identical CNN, while also achieving the same accuracy and significantly lower resource utilization. In addition, the custom accelerator is compared to a ternary neural<br/>network FPGA accelerator formodulation classification as proposed by Tridgell et al. The custom accelerator uses 3.3 times fewer LUTs, 9 times fewer FFs, 4 times fewer DSPs, and uses no BRAM, while the accelerator proposed by Tridgell et al. uses 48.5% of the available BRAM in an RFSoC FPGA.","FPGA; Deep Learning; Cognitive Radio; Software Defined Radio; Artifical neural networks; FPGA acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, Nasri et al. have introduced an exact reachability-based response-time analysis that is based on exploring the space of possible decisions that a scheduler can take for a set of jobs/tasks. Their solution is at least three orders of magnitude faster than other exact response-time analyses and scales well. <br/><br/>Despite its current success in scalability, the schedule-abstraction-based analysis still faces one big fundamental limitation: in the reachability graph that it builds, each edge can only include one single scheduling decision. As a result, as soon as there are large uncertainties in the release time or execution time of the jobs in the input job set, the number of states generated by the schedule-abstraction graph grows exponentially because the analysis will try to explore all (valid) combinations of ordering between jobs.<br/><br/>We improve the scalability of the schedule-abstraction-based analysis by introducing partial-order reduction (POR) rules that allow combining multiple scheduling decisions on one edge and hence avoiding combinatorial exploration of all possible orderings between jobs in cases where there are large uncertainties. Our solution is an exact schedulability analysis and provides a safe response-time analysis that reduces the size of the graph while only introducing a small overestimation on the WCRT of the jobs. <br/><br/>Our key idea is to identify subsets of jobs for which the combinatorial exploration of all orderings is irrelevant to the schedulability of the job set. Exploring these combinations is irrelevant when all scenarios lead to a system state without encountering a deadline miss in any of those scenarios. Dispatching such jobs can be considered in a single step (that combines all those scheduling decisions), which further defers the state-space explosion.<br/><br/>We show that our solution is able to reduce the runtime of the analysis by five orders of magnitude on average, and the number of explored states by 98% on average in comparison to the original schedule-abstraction-based analysis of Nasri et al. for randomly generated periodic task sets. This achievement comes with a negligible cost of an average 0.1% increase in the WCRT of the jobs. This shows that POR allows us to analyze even more task sets than the original and has the potential to scale even further. <br","response-time analysis; real-time systems; partial-order reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Secondly, to be able to analyze the character of a dead-end street, the interruption is not seen as a static state, but rather as a change in the urban dynamic, which then leads to thinking of the reason why this change happens, and how this change is consequently manifested in space.

The results show that industrial demand response provided by the chlor-alkali and hydrogen plant can minimize imbalances significantly between -89% to -99%. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed the effect of important plant and controller parameters on the imbalance minimization which notably indicated that the storage capacity of hydrogen/chlorine and high utilization rate (&gt;95%) of the industrial plants can be a major limiting factor for minimization of imbalances. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of renewable energy based Virtual Power Plants and the wider participation of industrial processes in distributed energy systems.","Virtual Power Plant; Sustainable Energy; Imbalance minimization; Model Predictive Control; Demand Response; Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The challenges of operating with high volumes of containers have propagated from the deep-sea terminals into the hinterland network resulting in extensive use of road transportation, long waiting times and high carbon emissions. Synchromodal transport has addressed these challenges by promoting integration of services and real-time decisioning to increase the overall flexibility of the system. However, little is known about the effects of applying flexible concepts on operational planning decisions and whether these decisions have reflection on the performance of the system when centrally taken. This paper proposes a research for a design of an operational strategy which supports operational decisions on container routing and mode choice among trucks and barges. Model Predictive Control planning approach is applied to optimize the simultaneous routing of containers, trucks, and barges. The effectiveness the proposed strategy is evaluated in the presences of increased container volumes and compared to a Benchmark strategy by the means of simulation experiments. The impact of implementing flexible decisions on system performance and realized operational costs is investigated.","Synchromodality; Container Transport; Centralized Modal Predictive Control; Simultaneous Routing Modelling; CTT Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","NWO project “Complexity Methods for Predictive Synchromodality (Comet -PS)”",""

Recycling of the yearly 12 Mton concrete waste results in roughly 7 Mton coarse recycled concrete aggregate (CRCA) and 5 Mton fine recycled concrete aggregates (fRCA). Currently, fRCA is not used in structural concrete, but only for low grade applications. This research aims to investigate the effect of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) incorporation on the performance of structural concrete mixtures. Three streams of fRCA were considered in this research and two deliveries of each source were examined. River sand was replaced by 25% fRCA, which was found to be the optimal amount that does not require cement increase. Both deliveries were used in order to identify potential differences. Additional concrete mixtures with simultaneous replacement of river sand by 25% fRCA and river gravel by 30% CRCA were evaluated. Parallel work was conducted during an 8months internship at TNO, where optimization of mortar mixtures with full replacement of river sand by fRCA was investigated. This was performed by considering the water demand of solid constituents (binder and fRCA) and packing of fRCA. Optical microscopy was used for closer inspection of the microstructure of fRCA. Fresh properties of studied mixtures were measured. Assessment of the mechanical performance of concrete mixtures was expressed by means of compressive strength and elastic modulus. Long term behavior was also investigated by shrinkage deformation measurements up to 95 days after casting. Results show that substantial rise in cement content is necessary for obtaining the desirable flow and high levels of compressive strength, when full replacement of fRCA is performed. Regarding concrete mixtures with 25% fRCA, increase in air content was measured. Entrapped air is strongly dependent on the porosity of adhered cement paste on RCA, content of 00.25 mm fraction as well as agglomeration and presence of impurities in as received fRCA. This affects negatively their mechanical performance. Additional porosity resulting from CRCA incorporation was responsible for further reduction in mechanical properties of concrete mixtures. Mixtures with RCA showed three times higher mass loss at the age of 95 days.","fRCA; Recycled aggregates; CRCA; Construction and demolition waste; CDW; CD&W","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In particular, the DGFF on Z^d , with homogeneously weighted nearest-neighbour interactions, i.e. all conductances equal to 1, has been studied in detail. These models can be simulated with great efficiency. In this research, we abandon the homogeneity requirement and look at three-dimensional DGFFs with arbitrary conductances. Our goal is to find a quick and reliable method to simulate such DGFFs on a finite lattice. Since this is, in essence, a high-dimensional Gaussian sampling problem, we investigated this problem using the Conjugate Gradients (CG) linear solver as a Gaussian sampler. To see how it performed, we compared our implementation of the CG sampler with known methods for DGFFs in the unit conductance case. Finally, as a showcase of our implementation, we studied level-set percolation on a DGFF with a simple checkerboard conductance pattern. Our main conclusion is that the CG algorithm is very suitable for simulating Discrete Gaussian Free Fields. Since it does not make any assumptions on the conductances, it can be used to generate DGFFs with arbitrary conductances. However, there are still a number of issues with our implementation. The biggest one is concerning the stopping tolerance of the CG sampler. Once the tolerance is set smaller than some lattice size-dependent threshold, the percolative behaviour of the resulting sample changes drastically. We have not been able to explain this. Moreover, we would recommend making the implementation usable for parallel computing. We have been limited to relatively small lattice sizes during this project. Consequently, the use of certain finite-size scaling arguments when analysing level-set percolation might not always have been as justified. Finally, based on our study of the DGFF on a lattice with checkerboard conductances a and b (a &lt; b), we conjectured that, in its percolative behaviour, this DGFF resembles a DGFF defined on a lattice with constant conductance c, where c is a weighted average of a and b. The weight of a is expected to be larger than the weight of b.","Gaussian Free Field; Conjugate Gradient; Arbitrary Conductances; Level-set Percolation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being the owner of two of the largest semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCVs), the choice for single lift jacket removal is straightforward. However, jackets in the Northern North Sea have a weight and height exceeding the crane capacity of these vessels. Moreover, not all jackets have the structural integrity to be single lifted. Piece small jacket removal can be a solution but is often overlooked by the expectance of being labour-intensive and therefore too expensive. This thesis has the objective to develop a methodology for advising a jacket removal strategy based on a decision support model while comparing piece small versus single lift decommissioning. Comparing the two removal methods is done for a single case study of the Kinsale Bravo jacket, provided by HMC. <br/><br/>The budgets of both removal methods, resulting from the case study, are used as input for the decision support model (DSM). Based on the jacket characteristics, the model uses constrains, rules of thumb and calculations to determine several possible outcomes.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Most wireless devices use the radio frequency spectrum which is reaching its limits, as almost all frequencies are in use. Devices which communicate on the same radio frequencies are interfering with each other and this creates problems in the communication. Currently, there are around 10 billion of these devices. This number is rapidly growing and this increases the issue of interference. One of the possible solutions for future wireless communication is a communication technology called Light Fidelity (LiFi). This technology uses light waves to communicate rather than radio waves. Since light operates outside the common radio frequencies, LiFi does not introduce additional interference to today’s commonly used radio communication technologies. Signify is the first company with a commercially available LiFi system and has branded their system Trulifi. The Trulifi network can consist of multiple Access Point (AP)s and End Point (EP)s. These devices have a cone­like coverage area in which devices can communicate with each other. Outside this coverage area, communication is not possible. As with other communication technologies, devices within a LiFi system are also affected by interference. In the overlapping coverage areas between two APs two types of interference can occur. Downlink interference occurs whenever an EP receives messages from multiple APs at the same time, while uplink interference occurs whenever an AP is able to receive messages from an EP which is connected to a neighbouring AP. To overcome this issue Signify uses a so called LiFi controller (LC). The main task of the LC is to create an interference free communication schedule for all APs in the LiFi network. This schedule is based on the interference reports received from the APs and EPs. Validating large scale LiFi systems can become complicated, in terms of high costs involved and in the very large spaces needed to install such a large scale system. To ensure the LC operates as specified, a stress­test simulation model was designed by Signify. The stress­test simulation’s sole purpose is to ensure the LC keeps operating as specified in the worst case situation. E.g. all the possible APs, all the possible EPs and all the interference that can occur. This test is, however, not realistic as these worst case situations are not common in real­world deployments of the system. In this thesis, the problem of creating a realistic Trulifi simulation model is addressed. A literature study has been performed to investigate if existing models can be used. The conclusion of this literature study shows that a radio model needed to be designed which addressed the needs of the Trulifi system. This model has been designed with a high level of abstraction, while keeping the simulation as realistic as possible. To validate the new radio model, the Trulifi simulation has been compared to a real­world Trulifi system. Once this radio model was validated, the scheduling was compared based on different configuration sizes, as the main goal of the thesis is to create a realistic simulation model with which the Trulifi system can be validated. For this validation, the Trulifi simulation was compared to both the real­world Trulifi system and the stress­test simulation.","LiFi; Simulation; OMNEST","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-13","","","","","",""

Usually, at first trenches are dredged, in which approximately one month later the cables are installed. During this period the trench should remain sufficiently open to install the cables, fulfilling the depth requirements. This thesis focusses on the influence of sand wave fields on the sedimentation rate. It is investigated how trench sedimentation can best be assessed: with a simple model in combination with an extensive probabilistic assessment, or with a more complex model in which a less detailed probabilistic assessment is possible. The research is based on a case study at the Borssele Wind Farm Zone, for which the sedimentation rate is determined during the month April.<br/>The sedimentation is primarily caused by a reduction in (the perpendicular-directed) flow velocity. Shifting of shoals or banks does not occur during the short timescale. The same holds for the sand waves, which do not migrate significantly during this time. Under influence of bedload transport however, the largest sedimentation rates are found for trenches around the sand wave crest. Closer to the troughs, less sedimentation can be expected.<br/>During the probabilistic assessment of the trench sedimentation in flat bathymetries, it was found that the uncertainty obtained by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) with an 2DV-model is reduced compared to the Monte Carlo-analysis (MC-analysis) in SedPit: the median is for both cases 0.06m, the 5-95 percentiles are 0.03m-0.09m and 0.04m-0.13m respectively. Including (idealized) sand wave perturbations in the 2DV-model, increases the range of the P05-P95 values for in trench sedimentation to 0.01 and 0.13m.<br/>Based on the results, it is concluded that SedPit can be used as first assessment tool for the trench sedimentation, since it covers the range obtained with the more complex 2DV-model. The main advantage is the limited computation time of around 1.5 hours, compared to around 48 hours with the sand wave model. On the other hand, the 2DV-model is able to produce more accurate results. <br/>The siltation rate in trenches located at sand wave crests is underestimated by SedPit compared to the results obtained from the 2DV-model. The opposite holds for trenches located at sand wave troughs, in which more sedimentation is predicted by SedPit. Adjusting the calibration parameter of sand transport in SedPit within the ranges provided in Van Rijn (2013) (0.5 for a sand wave trough and 1.0 for a sand wave crest), can at most decrease the difference between the models. For trenches located near a sand wave crest or trough, it is therefore advised to use at least the 2DV-model to assess trench sedimentation.<br/>Furthermore, the 2DV-model can only be used in the case of perpendicular flow with respect to the trench-axis. Inclusion of the sand wave processes, which act in the 2DV-direction, for non-perpendicular flows therefore requires 3D modelling. <br","SedPit; Delft3D; Trench sedimentation; probabilistic assessment; uncertainty; Sensitivity Analysis; Borssele Wind Farm Zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.73955, 2.98500"

In Africa, 90% of the agricultural yields rely only on precipitation for irrigation purposes and approximately 80% of the population’s livelihood is highly dependent on its food production. Parts of Ghana are prone to droughts and flood events due to increasing variability of precipitation phenomena. Crop growth is sensitive to the wet- and dry spell phenomena during the rainy season. To support rural communities and small farmer in their efforts to adapt to climate change and natural variability, it is crucial to have good predictions of rainfall and related dry/wet spell indices.<br/>This research constitutes an attempt to assess the dry spell patterns in the northern region of Ghana, near Burkina Faso. We aim to develop a model which by exploiting satellite products overcomes the poor temporal and spatial coverage of existing ground precipitation measurements. For this purpose 14 meteorological stations featuring different temporal coverage are used together with satellite-based precipitation products.<br/>Conventional machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms were compared in an attempt to establish a link between satellite products and field rainfall data for dry spell assessment. The deep-learning architecture used should be able to efficiently manipulate spatial data. Hence, Convolutional Neural Networks were used in order to detect spatial patterns in the satellite data.<br/>Using these models we will attempt to exploit the long temporal coverage of the satellite products in order to overcome the poor temporal and spatial coverage of existing ground precipitation measurements. Doing that, our final objective is to enhance our knowledge about the dry spell characteristics and, thus, provide more reliable climatic information to the farmers in the area of Northern Ghana.","Deep learning; Machine Learning; Precipitation; Water Resources Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

The solution is formulated via an optimization problem and can perform a comparison of communication and sensing costs side-by-side. The sensing resources are allocated using a cost minimization and the communication strategy is found by formulating a selection problem. The solution demonstrates that cooperation can lead to higher accuracy for all sensors involved across multiple targets while using resources more efficiently.

Using a custom mutator that leverages domain information as well as model-specific information such as splitting thresholds and dataset-specific information such as training samples, FATE is able to find good adversarial examples: for non-image classification models they are within 1 percent-point difference from examples generated by the state-of-the-art (Zhang et al., 2020). However, the coverage-guidance of grey-box fuzzers actually limits the performance of FATE: running the mutator of FATE as a (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm makes FATE show competitive performance to the state-of-the-art, even outperforming it on some datasets.","adversarial examples; tree ensemble; machine learning; Fuzzing; blackbox; Evolutionary Algorithms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Inherent to these types of simulations is the fact that an enormous amount of data can be generated, which needs to be analysed in order to make the simulation useful. At the moment, the available tools to perform this analysis are limited for most platforms in terms of functionality or usability. Model designers are often not experienced programmers, so processing and analysing the data from these experiments in Python or R can be challenging. The goal of this master thesis is to determine the best way to make data mining methods accessible to model designers so they can easily execute and analyse model experiments for NetLogo. In order to achieve this goal, the limitations of the currently available tools will be established by communicating with the target group. When there is a clear overview of what exists and what still needs to be done, we will attempt to develop an accessible tool that addresses the current limitations. The tool that was created consists of a GUI that allows the user to design experiments, run simulations and visualise results. With this GUI, the coding aspect of data analysis is taken completely out of the users hands, so anyone with NetLogo experience should be able to conduct extensive analysis of their model and its results. To determine whether the tool achieved its goal of being easy to use while still providing advanced analysis options, a usability study will be conducted with the target group. In this study, the users will execute a certain number of tasks with the tool and the results are recorded. After the tasks are completed, the user will fill in a questionnaire to get more opinion based data to give a complete overview of the usability. This usability study will allow us to determine whether our tool is indeed an improvement for the field and something that people could see themselves actually using during model development. Every measurement goal that was set before the usability study was achieved, most of them with wide margins. The ASQ questionnaires obtained an average result of 4.69 out of 5, where the target was set at 4. Furthermore, the SUS questionnaire obtained an average result of 85 out of 100, with the target being 75. These results show that developing an accessible data mining tool is possible and thus that the goal of this thesis was achieved. This research can be used as a basis for future development in order to provide the agent-based simulation community with more tools for the analysis of models.","Data Mining; Agent-Based Models; NetLogo; Simulation; Usability; User-Centered Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Joosse, Peter (mentor); Pascoe, J.A. (graduation committee); Teuwen, Julie J.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With a growing demand for longer blades in the wind turbine industry for higher rated power per turbine, a structurally sound blade-root connection is of commercial importance. Bushing connections have been a commercially favoured design in the past few years, replacing the commonly used T-bolt connection as the joining method of choice. The new design replaces the barrel nut in the T-bolt with an axial bushing that the bolt connects to and can be assembled with the laminate during the lay-up stage of the blade skin. It has been theorised that it can result in a reliable connection due to the elimination of laminate stress concentrations. However, literature outlining the performance of a blade-root connection with bushings is lacking in the current body of knowledge. While several patents for bushing designs exist, they don’t provide verifiable results on their efficacy due to trademark laws. The objective of this project is to design and conduct a numerical study of a blade-root connection with bushings with an aim to replace the T-bolt connection, along with providing evidence of the effect of various parameters on the structural performance of the blade root. The design is to be based on a Suzlon Energy-make blade with a pitch circle diameter of 3m and a blade length of 63m. The project has been planned in three phases: (1) Design of the root; (2) Validation of the design; (3) Comparative analysis. Modelling and FE analysis has been carried out in the ANSYS environment. Parameters of the bolted connection have been determined according to industry standards provided by VDI and GL. Design validation was conducted based on structural constraints; the key design constraint relevant to the blade-root as a sub-component of the wind turbine is the accumulated fatigue damage. For the final phase of the study, various parameters associated with the assembled root were identified and tested in iterations and their effect on the structural performance, weight, and cost of the assembly were studied. The results confirm the hypothesis of reduction of stress concentrations within the laminate; this eliminates several failure modes associated with composite laminates at the blade root. As is, the bushing connection can be considered a viable alternative to the T-bolt joint. Within the connection, higher absolute stresses and stress gradients were developed in the bolt joining the blade to the hub. Hence, this was the area of focus for fatigue damage evaluations. Conservative estimates of the accumulated damage show values well within the acceptable range. The connection has been designed keeping several concurrent variables in mind. Given the commercial applicability of the design, a rigid optmized design is not feasible due to unpredictable parameters like certification costs, total assembly times, and procurement costs. Therefore, an effort has been made to understand the effect of varying component parameters. The design lends itself to flexibility of dimensioning and material choice within the sub-components; parameters can be optimised according to cost, manufacturability, and performance requirements. While the base design configuration for the bushing connection is heavier than the T-bolt design, improved fatigue performance can be seen as a favourable trade-off.","Wind turbine; Wind turbine blade; Blade root; Fatigue damage; Bolted connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.290023, 6.781693"

The feature-set, scalability, transaction cost, and efficiency have all improved. Yet, as the development continued, the goal of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency as a digital payment form started to take a backseat to their utility as a store of value and investment vehicle. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are missing the crutial features of scalability in transactions per second and basic price stability. This calls into question whether fully decentralized currencies can ever serve as a global payment system.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the world of payments outside the crypto-sphere is going through a transformation. With the use of physical money declining in favor of privately banked money, payment systems are going digital. Yet, banks are being found unreliable, unavailable to many people across the world, and unable to match the convenience and feature set of new payment providers. With decentralized cryptocurrencies not sufficing as payment solutions, centrally controlled currencies like Tether and Diem (previously Libra) are trying to fill the exact hole in the market left by banks. Consequently, the global digital payment system may eventually belong to the first bidder, be they decentralized, run by governments, or by private, profit driven corporations.<br/><br/>We present EuroToken, a design for a CBDC that is focused on solving the open issues in cryptocurrencies from the perspective of a trustworthy central bank. By centralising some infrastructure required to run a cryptographically secure currency, we achieve a network that can scale to arbitrary size, handle offline transactions, and remain price-stable and guaranteed in value by the Central Bank.<br/><br/>The EuroToken system is a Peer-to-Peer blockchain system that stores every wallets' history on the users personal device. This allows basic transactions without an online connection. Double-spend prevention is handled by a set of centralised nodes that periodically verify the transactions of a given user and condenses their chain into a single ""checkpoint"" block for scalability. In order to create price stability, we attach EuroToken to the IBAN system and enable a 1:1 exchange in either direction.<br/><br/>We present a working implementation of EuroToken including a wallet and an IBAN / EuroToken exchange. We also show how our system can grow to an arbitrarily large scale without sacrificing efficiency.<br/><br","CBDC; Block-DAG; Offline transfer; Cryptocurrencies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to stop the further increase of the global temperature, the international community has decided to aim at reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the near future. To achieve this ambition, various alternatives in shipping need to be explored including sailing on alternative fuels. <br/>This study investigates the consequences of sailing on alternative fuels. It is investigated which problems might occur when sailing on alternative fuels, which rules are mandatory when sailing on alternative fuels and as a consequence what the effects are on the cargo transport costs. <br/>The problems occurring when sailing on alternative fuels are caused by the lower energy densities of these fuels, the rules and requirements with regard to the storage of some of these fuels and the shape of the storage tanks for some specific fuels. The shape and requirements regarding the fuel storage tanks can make it necessary to replace cargo for storage tanks, which will result in increased transports costs. Furthermore, the lower energy density of alternative fuels result in more fuel weight, or volume as compared to conventional fuels. In order to transport the same amount of cargo, an extra bunker stop, or taking less fuel and reducing the sailing speed, can be an option. Another option to compensate for the increased weight, or volume of the alternative fuels, is to reduce the cargo taken on board. All options will result in higher transports costs as compared to sailing on conventional fuels. To investigate how these extra costs are composed a main question has been formulated: ""In a situation where the transport costs are minimized, how do the transport costs compare when sailing on various fuels with different energy densities than conventional fuels?"". <br/>To answer this main question, a model was developed. The model is suitable to calculate the transport costs in various situations. For this research, three vessel types on three operations, using seven fuel types have been analyzed.<br/>The analyzed vessels were a container vessel, an oil tanker and an ore carrier. The chosen voyages are common voyages. The analyzed fuels are fuels which are able to achieve the goal of reducing the CO2 emission with 70% per transport work in 2050 as compared to 2008. Heavy fuel oil was used as benchmark. Based on the simulations used in the developed model it was found that: the costs of alternative fuels are higher than those of conventional fuels. Batteries are too heavy, too large and too expensive to be considered as an option, for the researched vessels and operations. The capital costs of fuel cells make that the use of fuels in combination with a fuel cell is currently expensive at higher speeds. High fuel storage costs make hydrogen currently not competitive with conventional fuels. The transport using an oil tanker are the lowest for hydrotreated vegetable oil, second lowest for ammonia in combination with an internal combustion engine and the highest for battery electric.<br","Alternative fuels; Transport costs; minimized","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Moreover, the inclusion of grid-independent energy generators requires accurate tools to predict energy yield in order to simplify matters such as grid-congestion management. One such tool useful to compute solar energy yield, which is under development, is the PVMD toolbox from the PhotoVoltaic Devices and Materials research group within the Delft University of Technology. This toolbox, which is completely based on MATLAB , allows users to specify parameters ranging from the micro-scale (such as the chemistry and characteristics of a single cell) to the macro-scale (such as the electrical parameters of the whole system).<br/>However, in its present version, the toolbox can simulate the yield only for<br/>simple systems, such as a single PV panel without any obstructions present nearby.<br/>This makes it incompatible to solve complex problems such as models with solar panels installed in the built environment.<br/><br/>Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis is on the optical side of the PV simulation, by enabling the toolbox to precisely compute reflected component of irradiance and include shading effects on modules from nearby objects in the scene. This functionality will help consider the presence of features such as dormers, chimneys and highly reflective surfaces present in urban environments which contribute to solar power output. To achieve this, attention was paid towards the formats and sources of geometric data (3D objects in particular) which could be used as an input in the toolbox. Once the data format was selected, the 3D object is parsed into a MATLAB readable format and refined in order to preserve geometric information.<br/>Afterwards, the scene was completed by enumerating the geometric data of<br/>the solar cells and placing them beside the object or on an external surface of the object. Optical properties were then obtained in the form of spectral reflectance data from NASA’ ECOSTRESS Library and converted into the appropriate format to assign these material properties to the geometries. This Opto-geometric data is then parsed back into a file which can be read by RADIANCE, a visual rendering software capable of backward ray-tracing. This ray-tracing technique is used to obtain the irradiance available for each solar cell at a given time instant.<br/><br/>The developed workflow is validated by comparing it with real data stored at the PV Monitoring Station within the TU Delft Campus. For the given data-set, the mean percentage error is computed to be 1.89% , with a standard deviation of 12.49%. This proves that the proposed workflow is suitable to visualise shading performance and the effect of reflected irradiance. This model can be further improved by considering parameters such as spectrally responsive albedo and inclusion of other geometry formats. The outputs from this project can also be used as inputs to compute the spectral absorptance of different layers within a solar cell, such as tandem solar cells or develop sensitivity maps for different modules present in the scene.","Opto-Geometric Data; Urban PV Potential; Irradiance Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","PVMD Toolbox",""

Therefore, a lot of research is currently underway with respect to closing the carbon cycle. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising technology that could help utilize the CO2 as a feedstock to produce chemicals and fuels, while storing the excess energy generated from renewable energy sources in chemical bonds. Due to its simplicity and economic feasibility, the conversion of CO2 to CO has a high potential in the industrial market. Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) is an interesting electrochemical reactor configuration to produce CO on industrial scale due to the low ohmic losses and reduced risk of catalyst poisoning. Optimizing the catalyst and operating conditions are key steps towards the commercialization of the process. This research focuses on understanding the influence of different process parameters on the CO selectivity while analyzing the performance challenges. Multiple inlet flow rates of CO2 were tested at different current densities to evaluate its impact on the faradaic efficiency. The experiments were performed using KOH-exchange MEA cell with gas diffusion electrodes and Sustainion membrane. Since the product of interest is CO, Ag-based catalyst layer was sputtered on the gas diffusion electrode. The cathodic products were identified and quantified using gas chromatograph. The experimental results have shown that increasing current density resulted in lower CO selectivity, while the inlet flow rate did not have a significant effect. It was also shown that the cell could not achieve higher than 200mA/cm2 due to the accumulation of salts blocking the gas flow channel.<br/>On top of that, a simple 2D model was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics to understand the mass transport and concentration distribution in the gas flow channel. The model was not able to simulate the complexities of the electrochemical process and represented an ideal plug flow reactor.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The aerospace industry is always trying to improve aircraft designs in an attempt to improve its performance and also make it clean and sustainable. Boundary layer Ingestion (BLI) is one of the concepts which has the potential to improve fuel and overall propulsive efficiency of an aircraft. The BLI configuration have the engines integrated with the fuselage. The previous research and studies done so far have shown that the inlet distortion, from the ingested boundary layer and the consequent flow non-uniformity has detrimental effects on the aerodynamic performance of the fans and compressors in an engine. This novel concept of BLI has a lot of potential to not only improve the overall propulsive efficiency of an aircraft engine, but also to address the sustainability goals that the aviation industry has, with regards to emissions and noise pollution. For this technology to be viable, the engine fans need to be able to operate reliably and efficiently in continuous distorted inflow conditions.<br/><br/>The present thesis is an experimental investigation on how the spinner shape influences the performance of the fan operating with distorted inflow. The main objective is to understand how the flow field behaves and in turn affect the stability and performance of the fan in subsonic uniform and non-uniform flow conditions with different spinner shapes. Performance maps and noise data are obtained at different flow speeds and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements are taken to understand how the flow behaves downstream and upstream of the fan. This helped in understanding the effects of the fan interactions with the flow, which in turn was used to understand and explain the influence of the spinner shape on fan performance. Not much research has been done on the influence of spinner shapes and very few have studied PIV downstream of the fan. So this thesis yields valuable results that will contribute to the research done by the scientific community in this field.<br","Experimental fan performance; distorted flow; spinner shape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With this project, a new approach is taken on, in which an old concrete structure, riddled with bullet holes, part of the great variety of dilapidated and unfinished buildings that have characterized Beirut’s urban landscape for decades, is to be transformed and provided continuity. The structure in question dates back to the Lebanese Civil War, and was most likely built for its strategic position, just south of the city center, and it has been occupied ever since by the Lebanese military. In this project the structure will be transformed and completely redefined by the method of ‘creating by removing’. The rough edges, resulting from the cutting process and the existing scars marking the structure’s history, are proliferated in the transformation process as traces to preserve. The new intervention, housed in autonomous structures, will inhabit the existing concrete skeleton, and will absorb the program of a military first aid clinic, responding to the state of urgency Lebanon is currently in. A great contrast arises between the rough edges and exposed aggregate, with the sterile and seamless surfaces of the new intervention. The collision of both, grants an entirely new meaning to the neglected structure and its traumatic past, as it becomes the carrier of something prospective. Subsequently, in order to have the project further reflect on the status quo of Beirut’s built environment, it aims, through the transformation process, to attain a state of latency, in between demolition and construction, and in between a ruin and a building. The final result proposes a scenario which is neither stable, nor unstable, it simply exists in the inbetween.","Beirut; Post-war architecture; Transformation; Commemoration; Healthcare architecture; Decay; Ruins; Reverse engineering; Memorial; Intervention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","Thakanat Al Bashoura First Aid Clinic Beirut","33.892772, 35.502657"

These intensity patterns are created by phase shifting specific parts of an incoming field of light. These phase shifts are determined by a B-spline surface, which is in turn controlled by so-called control points. Only a handful of control points can describe a whole surface. The position of these control points is then determined using machine learning and specifically a technique inspired by ‘physics-informed neural networks’, which were introduced last year by Raissi et al. [1]. With this method, simple experiments which sought to recreate intensity patterns known to be in the solution space were carried out. These experiments showed some success, but suffered from the fact that they used too sensitive parameters in the input of the machine learning model, reducing the sophisticated method to a Monte Carlo search, or they used no input at all, which degraded the machine learning model to simple parameter optimization. Nevertheless, these experiments showed that this method has the potential to be used in more flexible optical setups, where multiple configurations can yield the same intensity pattern or where changing the parameters defining the setup do not induce enormous changes in the resulting intensity pattern. In addition, the proposed method relies upon Fraunhofer diffraction, which, when discretized for numerical computation, introduces aliasing issues when the incoming field changes too rapidly. This phenomenon was especially apparent when using point sources that create spherical wave fronts. A possible solution for this issue is to consider ray tracing techniques in future research.","physics-informed neural networks; PINN; Freeform Design; machine learning; Fraunhofer diffraction; B-splines; optics; SLM; Illumination","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","NWO-TTW Perspectief program (P15-36) ""Free-form scattering optics""",""

It’s a mathematical approach to obtain the factor of safety, without using the strength definitions given by advanced soil models. The proposed method is able to overcome the limitations of both LEM and FEM.

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Background, issues, and main research questions: Circularity (circular economy) is being developed in many countries around the world where it has been set as a development goal (Schröder et al, 2019). However, the progress in implementing circularity varies from country to country. Most of the countries that are leading in circularity are European countries (Construcia, 2020). The Global South is less advanced than the former, but the development of circularity is necessary and urgent for the Global South. For example, in Indonesia, where lagging industrial development and high levels of waste generation are currently causing problems such as industrial depression, environmental pollution and threats to human health, the implementation of circularity can help sustain and promote industrial development and address the problems caused by growing waste (Preston &amp; Lehne, 2017). At the same time, in the face of the current global problem of increasing resource consumption, the implementation of circularity has been identified as an important goal not only for regional development, but also as a common priority for global development (Circular Economy Action Plan, 2020). In this context, this study therefore aims to investigate how to accelerate the implementation of circularity in the Global South and European countries. Specifically, the study decided to conduct a comparative case study between several European countries and Indonesia. Furthermore, innovation related to circularity is included in the theme of this study. The main research questions are therefore how circularity/innovation has been or is being implemented in European countries and Indonesia, what are the distinctive characteristics behind the implementation, and what recommendations can be made for the development of circularity/innovation in Indonesia and European countries.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Methodology: It is a literature-based study. A multidimensional perspective, entailing the levels of the state, civil society and individual enterprises, is the main research approach of this study. Furthermore, the functioning and rules of Systems I and II (Kroesen et al, 2020) provide theoretical and conceptual support for the entire study. Three cases (biogas technology, circularity of plastics, and innovations in the pulp and paper industry) were selected for this study, corresponding to three selected European countries (Finland, Germany, and Sweden) compared to Indonesia. Three main steps were established to conduct this study. Firstly under each case, the selected European countries and Indonesia were subjected to their respective case descriptions and analyses. A comparative analysis and discussion of the selected European countries and Indonesia was then carried out under each case. Finally, corresponding conclusions and recommendations were drawn for the implementation of circularity/innovation in Indonesia and the selected European countries.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Results, conclusions and recommendations: Towards circularity/innovation, a transition is taking place between System I and System II, with both the European countries and Indonesia in this study navigating through it. This study shows that the European countries' distinctive characteristics in terms of circularity/innovation are close to those of System II, independent of those of System I, while a large number of Indonesia's distinctive characteristics in terms of circularity/innovation lack to some extent those of System II, and in addition, some of Indonesia's distinctive characteristics are close to those of System I. The distinctive characteristics of System II are of key importance for the implementation of circularity/innovation, as progress in implementing circularity/innovation is positively correlated with the extent to which countries make the transition to System II.The efficiency and effectiveness of the state, civil society and individual enterprises in implementing circularity/innovation has been positively demonstrated in the European countries studied. There is a beneficial interaction between state policies with a high level of scientific and technological research and civil society and individual enterprises with a high level of initiative and planning, thus facilitating the implementation of circularity/innovation. However, in Indonesia, although the state, civil society and individual enterprises were all involved in the implementation of circularity/innovation, the interaction between them was less efficient and effective than the former, as unclear vision-setting and over-intervention by the government, poor citizen behaviour and a lack of local initiatives and planning may have hindered the interaction between the various levels when it comes to circularity/innovation, as was observed to some extent.The following are three particular examples of conclusions and recommendations. In the European countries studied and in Indonesia, open cooperation and complementary relationships between multiple stakeholders in the product supply chain, as well as the openness of customers to accept circular innovative products, are reflected in a more effective implementation of circularity (1). Based on the experience of the European countries studied, the state leaves the space for initiation and implementation to civil society and individual enterprises, while policy development is strictly focused on R&amp;D, which could serve as a reference for more effective implementation of circularity/innovation in Indonesia (2). Indonesia, which is to a large extent close to System I, is at risk of excessive state intervention and over-dependence of stakeholders on relationships, while for the European countries studied, which are close to System II, there may be a risk of too much corporate individualism and liberal behaviour at the expense of the role of the state. Thus, the role of Systems I and II in the implementation of circularity/innovation is not black and white, but more or less so (3).","Implementation of circularity/innovation; Circular economy; Social transformation; Comparative case study; European countries; Indonesia; Entrepeneurship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Even though methods to obtain such models exist, e.g. profiling, tracing, source code inference and existing log-based inference methods, they can not successfully be applied to the case of large, real-time systems. Profiling and tracing add overhead which may alter the system's behavior and source code inference does not scale for systems of this magnitude. Existing log-based approaches also suffer due to the intrinsic scalability issues of deriving a minimal model as proven by Gold. In this work, this issue is tackled by applying Reinforcement Learning to the model inference problem. First, an initial model is created from the traces and then Q-Learning is applied to shrink this model into a concise and accurate representation of the system. The approach is evaluated using log traces produced by the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. Its effectiveness is assessed based on the accuracy and the conciseness of the inferred models as well as the execution time of the algorithm to infer the model. Results show that the Q-Learning implementation used in this work, is not able to converge to consistent action values. These results might be implementation specific meaning future work should experiment with and extend the current implementation of the algorithm, or due to assumptions made in this work about the underlying systems do not hold. Future work should apply this approach to a different system so as to assess its feasibility.","Model inference; Log; Reinforcement Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Neural networks have often difficulty with determining the differences between a talking person and noise. Humans have a much better understanding of this and could possibly apply their knowledge of the structure of the signals to improve the understanding of the neural network. A problem that is extremely difficult for a neural network is understanding and transcribing the lyrics of a song.<br/><br/>This thesis analyzes signal-processing techniques that can be applied to a song to improve the understanding of a speech-recognition algorithm. It is mainly focused on filtering the fore- ground lyrics from the accompaniment. Some basic filtering methods are described including a low-amplitude filter and a band-pass filter. But also two more complicated filters which make use of the periodicity of the background music will be treated.<br/>The first filter is a method of voice separation using the two-dimensional Fourier transform. This method, proposed by Prem Seetharaman, Fatemeh Pishdadian, Bryan Pardo in 2017 [15], combines techniques of signal-processing and image-processing by finding periodic repetitions in a signal by identifying peaks in the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the spectrogram of the signal.<br/>The second filter is a newly proposed method that can be used for the separation of foreground from background music. The algorithm compares columns in the spectrogram and classifies columns as overlapping if there are multiple occurrences of columns similar to the selected col- umn (repetitions). The frequency components, the different frequencies obtained from a discrete short-time Fourier transform, of overlapping columns are afterward compared with components of the same frequency in other columns. Under certain circumstances, overlapping frequency components are subtracted from components in other columns of the spectrogram. This removes repetitions of that frequency throughout the song. The components of the spectrogram that re- main after several iterations of this method are most likely to correspond to the least repetitive parts of the song.<br/><br/>The decisions that are made while constructing the method of comparing spectrogram columns are discussed and are compared with steps performed in the method that uses the two-dimensional Fourier transform. An implementation and demonstration are also attached. From the research it is expected that the two-dimensional Fourier transform perform better on strict periodic accompaniment, while the method that compares spectrogram columns is more likely to perform better on songs with a less tight rhythm.","Spectrogram; fourier analysis; Filtering; Music; Voice; Speech recognition; Neural Networks","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

However AM still imposes some restrictions on the design, most notably on its minimum feature size, overhang, and enclosed voids. Enclosed voids are problematic because for most AM methods it is impossible to remove supports from them, additionally for powder-based AM these enclosed voids trap unmelted powder adding parasitic mass. In this thesis, two new methods have been investigated to alleviate this issue, the eigenfrequency method and the flood fill method. The eigenfrequency method utilizes the eigenfrequency of an inverted density field, which changes enclosed voids to floating masses. These floating masses have rigid body modes, which can then be prevented by applying a minimum eigenfrequency constraint. The eigenfrequency method encountered a large problem in the form of intermediate densities, which were used to satisfy the eigenfrequency constraint instead of the elimination of enclosed voids. The flood fill method utilizes a modified flood fill algorithm, which is a filter with a resulting density field where every enclosed void element is changed to solid. The flood fill method did successfully eliminate enclosed voids in both 2D and 3D problems, at the cost of very little additional computational effort. It also allows for direct control over the location, amount, and size of the void elimination features by varying boundary elements, running additional flood fills, and morphologic operators, respectively.","Topoloy optimization; Enclosed voids; Additive manufacturing; Manufacturability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

These cyclothems are often coal-bearing and no more than 15 m. Studying the fluvial cyclicity has a good potential for improved stratigraphy because the cyclothems show cyclic signals and provide a possible way of high-resolution correlation. An integrated approach using multiple approaches to come to a solid outcome also enables improving the stratigraphy. The previous studies mainly focused on large-scale stratigraphy with a vertical resolution of a few hundred meters. This study has analyzed the fluvial cyclicity and constructed an improved stratigraphic framework of Westphalian B and lower Westphalian C to better understand the sedimentary system. An integrated approach including lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy and Integrated Predictive Error Filter Analysis (INPEFA) is applied to the series. Six intermediate-scale biozones with a thickness of tens of meters to around 150 m are applied. Six intermediate-scale units named stratigraphic packages were recognized by INPEFA curves of the gamma-ray log. The correlations of the biozones and the stratigraphic packages are consistent with each other, and the offset between the boundaries of these two zonations is generally between 2-15 m. Individual intermediate-scale units have a highly variable thickness and the standard deviation of one unit can be up to 42 m. Constrained by the biozones and INPEFA stratigraphic packages, four main coal seams are correlated and their lateral extent can reach 15 km. The small-scale cyclothems that range from 7 to 15 m can be extracted by INPEFA of potassium content log, referring to the small-scale INPEFA cyclicity. The cyclothems and the corresponding INPEFA cycles are thicker and better developed in the southern area. The average thickness of small-scale cycles is 12 m and these cycles are related to obliquity with a duration of approximately 35 kyr. The duration of Westphalian B calculated by the number and the time span of obliquity-scale cycles is nearly 1.2 Myr.

Precise intraoperative localization of the lesion and correct needle placement are crucial factors for complete tumor ablation. These are difficult tasks due to interpatient variability and technical limitations of current technologies. Surgical navigation provides a live virtual representation of the surgery by showing the position of surgical instruments with respect to the critical anatomy. Navigation can improve tumor localization during surgical resection and it is therefore expected to similarly improve tumor ablation. The development and the clinical implementation of surgical navigation for hepatic tumor ablation were therefore explored in this thesis. A sterilizable adapter was developed carrying an electromagnetic (EM) sensor. This adapter is attachable to the ablation needle in order to track the surgical instrument. The tracking accuracy for this adapter calculated with respect to an EM tracked calibrated block was comparable to the Aurora 6DOF probe, a pointer currently used in the standard workflow of surgical navigations. With the use of this adapter, a virtual representation of the ablation needle could be presented to the surgical team. The workflow for navigated liver ablation was tested intraoperatively by three hepatobiliary surgeons. A cross-hair (i.e., bullseye) view was preferred by the surgeons to guide the ablation needle to the center of the target lesion. In this view, the tumor was visualized as if looking through the tip of the ablation needle. With the system usability score (SUS) of 65, refinement of the software visualization was indicated. Nonetheless, the surgeons want to use the system frequently and responded that it aided in localizing tumor(s), reducing complications, obtaining negative ablation margins and increasing certainty in decisions and actions. Next, a method for validation of the needle tip tracking accuracy at final needle placement was proposed and showed a mean accuracy of 2.2 mm in phantom experiments.<br/>In conclusion, a workflow for open navigated liver ablation was developed and the first in vivo experiments have been performed which showed promising results. Intraoperative validation will be performed on 28 patients.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

These networks can be obtained by decomposing rs-fMRI data into components, using independent component analysis (ICA). Recently, these ICA components have been used as inputs for neural networks to learn complex relations between the intrinsic networks of the brain and mental disorders or demographic variables. Instead of training a non-linear classifier on these linearly decomposed components, this work asks whether unsupervised representation learning can lead to linearly separable representations for multiple downstream tasks. <br/><br/>We propose to apply non-linear representation learning to voxelwise rs-fMRI data. Learning the non-linear representations is done using two versions of a variational autoencoder (VAE). The first version is a vanilla VAE with 3D residual blocks in both its encoder and decoder. The second version is based on the identifiable VAE and uses a time-dependent prior. The models train to reconstruct the original input data from latent variables it infers. Three predictive models then evaluate the predictive power of the latent variables on an age regression, a sex classification, and a schizophrenia classification task. Each of the predictive models performs predictions for each of the three tasks. The predictive models are a support vector machine (SVM), a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.<br/><br/>We show that our method performs exceptionally well on the age regression and sex classification tasks without any supervision. These results imply that VAEs can model predictive variations in their latent spaces for demographic variables. The models, however, do not do well on the schizophrenia classification task, even when the models are pretrained. Despite the lower performance on the schizophrenia classification task, the overall results are encouraging and pave the way for future work on voxelwise representation learning.","variational autoencoder; resting-state fMRI; schizophrenia; deep learning; neural networks; Representation learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Among other reasons, tests are frequently used to ensure that a system meets all the specifications, which is especially important when designing systems for the medical industry. Software changes that have a detrimental impact on a real-time system's performance can accumulate until the systems no longer meet the required performance levels. At this point, fixing accumulated defects can become a costly and complex endeavor. The goal of this thesis is to create a method that can detect changes in performance metrics from a continuous integration pipeline with minimal manual intervention.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, we have created a novel online, univariate change detection method, which consists of a diverse ensemble of more than 10 existing change detection algorithms. The ensemble is robust against changes in distribution and requires little tuning. The contributions of this work include the proposal of a generic architecture to combine both statistics and decisions from individual algorithms. Related work uses simple majority voting for decision fusion in the ensemble - we demonstrate that an ensemble can benefit from more complex decision fusion, for example using a Random Forest.<br/><br/>Synthetic data and a case study, using a dataset provided by Philips, are used to demonstrate that the overall ensemble is consistently able to outperform the individual algorithms in the ensemble. In addition, unlike the individual algorithms, the ensemble generalizes well to data that is not normally distributed and have not been encountered during training. Compared to the monitoring system for performance metrics that is currently being used by Philips, the ensemble is able to detect 75\% more changes with a 50\% lower false positive rate.","change detection; control chart; ensemble learning; multiple classifier systems; continuous monitoring; performance benchmarks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

PSSs are touted as a critical tool to decouple environmentally harmful resource extraction from continued economic growth. However, for them to be implemented at scale, they must demonstrate clear value to decision makers who consider procuring them. As such, the value of PSSs in rental housing is theoretically explored and empirically studied through case studies to understand what drives housing providers to use PSSs within their developments and portfolios. The research reveals additional advantages perceived by housing providers, how housing providers analyze the use of a PSS, what challenges they encounter, and a preliminary review of how circular the studied cases inherently are.

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research will calculate the extended LCOE of internal hydrogen production and stor- age in offshore wind turbines at remote locations and will be done in collaboration with Van Oord. Van Oord is a global offshore marine contractor which is focused on dredging, land infra-structure, offshore wind and oil gas infrastructure.<br/><br/>To test the competitiveness of this technology a test location is selected; Grenada in the Caribbean. Grenada is selected because of its suitable conditions: the island is remote, which makes energy supply from outside the island not feasible. The current energy is generated with diesel generators, whereby the diesel is transported from onshore. This makes the elec- tricity relatively expensive and creates excessive carbon emissions compared to sustainable energy systems. This high electricity price also makes renewable energies competitive in an early stage of development. Lastly, the location conditions are favourable for wind energy; high average wind speed, high capacity factor and water depths which are suitable for fixed bottom wind turbines.<br/><br/>To calculate the LCOE of this technology, first a base load calculation is made with the wind speed data from one year. The output of this calculation is the input for the technical com- ponent selection of the hydrogen system. The overproduction of the offshore wind turbine is used to produce hydrogen with an electrolyzer. For this process, fresh water is required, which is produced by a desalination system. The hydrogen is pressurized with a compressor and stored in a storage tank. If the wind turbine is not able to produce the required energy, the hydrogen is reconverted into electricity. All these components are located inside the foundation of the offshore wind turbine. The LCOE is calculated with the hydrogen com- ponent cost and the cost overview of the the wind turbine. This design is tested for the Grenada location, with various base load scenarios and number of wind turbine generat- ors (WTG’s). A sensitivity analysis on these input variables will show their impact on the LCOE and makes design optimization possible. The extended part of this LCOE analysis is the carbon emission decrease calculation between the current non-sustainable diesel gen- erated energy and the offshore internal hydrogen wind turbine system. This sustainable impact is converted into financial input values which shift the financial competitiveness of the technology.<br/><br/>With the base load and LCOE models the following results are obtained. The extended LCOE for an internal hydrogen production and storage system depends on many variables and therefore is given as a range. The LCOE of the Grenada scenarios ranges between †604.03-246.53/MWh. If electricity is supplemented with diesel generated power, at the current energy price, the LCOE can drop to †230.09/MWh. For a single structure with gen- eralized system design, Grenada location input, without the use of overproduction and a base load of 1.5 MW, a LCOE of †501.32/MWh is calculated. If this energy is used, this LCOE will drop to †390.46/MWh. With the addition of the hydrogen system, the security of supply of a traditional wind turbine is increased from 68% to 76%. Depending on the configuration and number of WTG the security of supply can increase to 100% for low base loads. The extended analysis of this LCOE calculation is the sustainable impact of the tech- nology. According to the calculations, the assumed carbon emissions can be reduced up to 96% for a wind turbine system supplemented with diesel energy and up to 99% if the energy production is only generated with wind turbines. If carbon certificates need to be bought, the competitive financial break-even point of this technology will shift. For Grenada, the price of these certificates ranges between †42.03/kg tonnes of CO2 up to †489.86, depending on the selected base load and configuration.<br/><br/>From the sensitivity analysis the influence of the parameters on the lCOE are obtained; an increase in base load, Number of WTG’s, power output or storage volume will de- crease the LCOE. However the LCOE will increase if the energy losses, discount rate, OPEX, CAPEX, decommissioning cost or growth rate are increased. Most of these variables are inter-depending, which requires iterations to decrease the LCOE.<br/><br/>Many stakeholders are involved in the roll-out of new electricity technology. For Grenada as remote location, the stakeholders are the electricity provider, electricity consumers, gov- ernment, investors and secondary stakeholders. The competitiveness of a technology is not only depending on the LCOE, even with a sustainable impact analysis, but also on the im- plications for these stakeholders. Examples of these additional factors are view pollution, political incentives and benefits from byproducts.<br/><br/>Due to the early stage of development, many assumptions and simplifications have been made. These assumptions can be divided in four categories: technical, financial, location specific and stakeholders. Examples are; the foundation is assumed to be feasible for this technology, the carbon emissions are only based on the direct diesel emissions and the car- bon emissions of the wind turbine and the base load calculation are based only on a data set of 2020. Therefore future research is recommended for detailed analysis on this technology.","Sustainable; Offshore wind; LCOE; Hydrogen; Remote locations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These junctions are fabricated on a planar and a non-planar NbTiN base layer to characterise the uniformity. On a planar<br/>base junctions fabricated with a Dolan bridge showed higher uniformity and yield than junctions with the Manhattan layout. On a non-planer base junctions fabricated with a Manhattan layout showed a higher uniformity<br/>than the Dolan bridge junctions. This can be attributed to the through silicon vias, which affect the resist spinning required for the Dolan bridge.<br/>Manhattan style junctions are fabricated on a Si base layer in an attempt to improve the uniformity across a 100 mm wafer. By fabricating junctions on Si overall fabrication complexity is reduced, while also reducing the fabrication time. These junctions are used to investigate the role of oxygen ashing prior to the junction deposition. We find that the ashing increase the uniformity of the junctions, however, further attempts to improve the uniformity using different ashing steps did not how any additional improvements. Finally, to explain the variations in Manhattan style junctions a geometric model is introduced. This model is based on the thickness of the top resist stack, which could potentially affect the width of the junction electrodes. The model is compared with SEM images and with the coefficient of variation. The model shows correspondence with the SEM data, but overestimates the variations when compared with the coefficient of variation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its semi-open inlets allow for North Sea waters to enter and leave the Eastern Scheldt estuary with each tidal cycle, and can be closed during extreme storm events. The flow through the barrier is strongly contracted, and complex flow patterns emerge. Among characteristic flow features are the shallow jet and shallow mixing layer, generated as a result of large transverse shear stresses with horizontal lengths scales greatly exceeding the water depth. Large mean velocities in combination with the developing lateral non-uniformity of the flow between slack water and maximum flood gives rise to higher bed shear stresses. A bed protection up to a distance of about 600 m from the barrier is applied to stabilize the bed against increased hydraulic loading. Scour hole development adjacent to the applied bed protection was anticipated for, but expected equilibrium depths have not yet been reached. Reaching local depths of 60 m with respect to the water surface, these scour holes may on the long term be a threat to the stability of the barrier. Broekema (2020) concluded that during flow contraction, separation of flow near the bed of the scour hole is suppressed and high flow velocities in streamwise direction are found near the bed. Cyclic variations in lateral non-uniformity affect turbulence intensities and subsequent mixing of mass and momentum. Scour growth is therefore enhanced in two ways: i) velocities in the main flow remain high due to horizontal flow convergence, and ii) lateral velocity gradients are associated with larger turbulence intensities that are likely leading to larger bed shear stresses...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A compartment model describes the dynamics of a disease by implementing differential equations for the different states that belong to that disease.

We begin by extending the standard compartment model to a model which is applicable to COVID-19, this extension is based on characteristics of the virus. After this extension we are going to counteract on the assumption that susceptible and infected individuals are heterogeneously in contact with each other, since social distancing and quarantine prevent these two compartments from interacting. Also, we use specific time intervals and optimise the mortality rate. After these improvements we create an external model which estimates a contact tracing queue such that authorities can forecast how many contact tracers are needed to keep the pandemic under control. Then using the implementation of this queue, another queue is made which is dependent on its own length to forecast what happens if the government is not in contact with individuals who possibly are infected with COVID-19. Then we extend the model in such a way that vaccinated individuals can be assigned to a specific compartment, and at last we create a queue as described above with this extended model.","COVID-19; Compartment model; Numerical Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Powered by nature: ground temperature &amp; gravity for cooling, wind for energy generation &amp; ventilation, and sun for the heat and natural draft, this system claims not only to use little energy but also naturally purifies while humidify/dehumidify the air. No study has been done to see the performance of the system in a warmer climate, such as Tokyo. This thesis intends to answer that question.The dynamic duo of EWF: air supply system called Climate Cascade (CC) and air exhaust system called Solar Chimney (SC) are sized and calculated using 2 separate Excel models, from which the key parameters are identified, and design choices can be made. It was clear that as Tokyo’s temperature is warmer than Amsterdam’s, the focus needs to be given to cooling rather than heating. The challenge: space is limited in Tokyo hence the proposal of making SC a plug &amp; play unitized system.Armed with a case study integrating EWF into a relatively new 10-story medium-sized office building in Tokyo, the study explored and compared 4 different systems: the existing energy-conscious VRF system, conventional VAV system, EWF with a chilled ceiling, and EWF through chilled beams.In conclusion, EWF can contribute to energy reduction (40%) without compromising thermal comfort in comparison to the conventional VAV. Regarding VRF, further research needs to be done to properly simulate EWF with HR in the dynamic simulation software used. Moreover, EWF contributed to ventilation energy reduction in all cases evaluated, as well as improving thermal comfort.","Earth, Wind and Fire system; natural ventilation; air conditioning; HVAC systems in buildings; energy retrofitting; energy neutrality; Energy Neutral; energy refurbishment; Office buildings; Tokyo; Thermal comfort; Solar Chimney; Climate Cascade; Sustainability; Cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34.666548836765564, 135.5077543375245"

As the built environment strives to achieve a circular domain, there is an increasing need for solutions that close product and organisational systems together with the material and information flow running through them. These flows currently ‘leak’ and waste materials due to classic linear approaches they have been based on for decades. Furthermore, the context of a circular supply chain is still under research, and it mainly consists of fragmented information over various topics. Therefore, this thesis explores how circular economy principles could be implemented and enhanced within the whole construction supply chain<br/>by investigating also its control environment. This thesis’s scope is the circular supply chains and the information/ material flows needed throughout the process and the respective actors involved in such flows.<br/><br/>The modelling of a supply chain was observed as an appropriate approach to the representation of a circular supply chain environment, as it visualises in a simplified way the complex nature of supply chains. The proposed model provided insights within three levels of analysis: process, organisations and product. The process level identified the additional process phases that are needed in the reverse loops of information and materials. The organisation level elaborated on the traditional stakeholders and new circular specific stakeholders that could be introduced into these processes. Within this level<br/>traditional stakeholders were observed to adapt their operations by introducing some of the circular specific stakeholder activities internally. The third product level, investigated the control environment and the data residing within it, both provided and required data information. Identifying the data, processes and the involved actors facilitated into the design of a Modular Circular Supply Chain Model (MCSCM). In addition, the modular structure of the model enables the adaptability of any of the modules, whether this be adding or modifying modules and functionalities to suit a wide range of circular supply chain situations. The MCSCM is expected to introduce a general image of a circular supply chain environment by making this concept more tangible into nowadays society.","circular economy (CE); circular supply chain (CSC); supply chain modelling; supply chain management; building industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Inadequate cleaning disturbs the disinfection and sterilization process and increases the risk of cross-contamination. An automated washer-disinfector is often used for cleaning medical instruments, by using fluid flow. fluid flow induces shear stress at the wall of medical instruments and is able to detach contamination from the surface. However, there is a lack of studies on the effect of flow rate on the cleaning performance. Also in the ISO standards, no flow requirements can be found to remove contamination. In this study, the relationship between the flow rate and removed mass fraction at different soaking times is investigated to get more insight in the effect of fluid flow on the cleaning performance. The results in this study show that, for smooth tubes with a diameter of 9 mm, the removed mass fraction increases for flow rates up to 7.1 L/min where after the removed mass fraction stagnates. An ANOVA test was performed in combination with a Tukey HSD multiple comparison test to determine significant effects. There is a significant difference in the mass fraction removed, by applying different flow rates (F = 88.24, p = 9.49*10^-33) and different soaking times (F = 15.35, p = 2.8*10^-6), with F as the test statistic from the F-test and p as the p-value. The Tukey HSD test shows significant difference comparing flow rates greater than 5.9 L/min with flow rates smaller or equal to 5.1 L/min. For cleaning with 7.1 L/min, 5.9 L/min or 8.0 L/min no significant differences in the results are found. Furthermore, no<br/>significant differences in the cleaning performance of flushing with 3.5 L/min compared to lower flow rates is found. Moreover, this study shows that there is a significant difference between soaking and no soaking. Comparing 5 minutes and 10 minutes soaking no difference are found. This study shows the effect of flow rate on the cleaning performance and it can be concluded that for adequate cleaning of hollow medical instruments the shear stress induced by the flow rate should be taken into account. The results in this study can be used as ground truth to compare to the cleaning performance of different complex geometries with each other.

(mentor); Scheltes, J.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Laparoscopy is a type of minimally invasive surgery in which instruments with long, slender shafts between handle and end effector are inserted through small incisions in the abdominal wall. A laparoscopic aspirator-irrigator (LAI) has a hollow shaft used to evacuate undesirable substances using a vacuum pressure, rinse tissue using a stream of pressurized saline, and manipulate adherent tissue.<br/>Although laparoscopic instruments typically have a steerable tip to compensate for the loss of maneuverability due to the small incision, all currently available laparoscopic aspirator-irrigators lack a steerable tip. This lack is associated with sub-optimal aspiration and irrigation efficacy, mechanical trauma resulting from interference with obstructive tissue, interference with other instruments, and a lack of fine motor control of the tip. Although LAI’s with a steerable tip are known from patent literature [1]–[6], they all seem to have been abandoned, which suggests that the implementation of a steerable tip on an LAI tends to compromise performance relative to cost. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to design a new laparoscopic aspirator-irrigator (FlowFlex) with a steerable tip that mitigates the limitations of a conventionally rigid, straight tip to the extent of warranting its additional cost.<br/>To meet the objective, design requirements have been generated, tentative prototypes have been designed and evaluated, and a Final Prototype has been designed based on the superior tentative prototypes. Its steerable tip consists of an inner tube that is rigid and straight and an outer tube with an elastic, pre-curved silicone tip. Whereas the inner tube is stationary, the user can rotate, retract, or protract the outer tube by moving the tip control wheel on its proximal end using the index or middle finger, causing the tip to rotate, straighten, or deflect.<br/>The Final Prototype meets all important design requirements; it is cost-effective, due to the particularly simple and cheap steerable tip, it has ample flow rate capacity, it is unsusceptible to clogging, and it is sufficiently maneuverable. Although its main limitation is the low stiffness of its pre-curved tip, the ability of the tip to be rigidized by straightening makes it at least as capable of manipulating tissue as a conventional laparoscopic aspirator-irrigator.","Laparoscopy; Aspiration; Suction; Irrigation; Steerable; Surgery; Medical; Instrument; Design; Vacuum; Flushing; Steerable tip; Handheld; Handpiece; Aspirator; Irrigator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Using the toilet for micturition and defecation is familiar to everyone. However, discussing personal troubles with going to the toilet is frowned upon. Constipation complaints and urine retention are common, especially among the elderly. There are multiple ways of countering these complaints, with this report focusing on taking the right body posture while sitting on the toilet. This posture consists of raising the knees above hip height, aiming for more pelvic floor muscle relaxation.This report explores a new product design that helps people to fight constipation and urine retention complaints, by assisting them to get an ergonomically beneficial toilet posture. First, the current scenario of this problem and its environment was explored thoroughly, in order to create the full relevant picture. Information was gathered from the target group, medical professionals from ErasmusMC Rotterdam (i.a. urologists and pelvic floor therapists), nursing home staff and other IDE experts. Existing solutions are not fulfilling, or even dangerous, especially for elderly users. Therefore, the target group in this project is focused on the elderly. Through solving sub problems, researching technical possibilities and pinpointing wishes and demands, possible design directions were explored. Eventually, the EasyRaise was chosen as the proposed concept that aimed to solve the problems best. The EasyRaise consists of a platform that effortlessly lifts the legs of the user upwards to the user’s personal perfect height. The user operates the platform by him-/herself with a wireless remote and is informed by a medical expert on the desired optimal height of the platform. Hand support can be included to help the user get on and off the platform and provide help with standing up and balancing. The remote can be stored on the hand support extension. The proposed concept of the EasyRaise went through three types of evaluation. A physical prototype was created to test the working of the lift mechanism. Target group participants were asked to assess the functionalities and desirability of the concept. Finally, ErasmusMC staff were invited to share their medical insights on the EasyRaise, and whether they would recommend it. The EasyRaise leads to increased quality of life and decreased health costs, as autonomy is enhanced and medicines like laxatives are diminished. The report is concluded with a set of recommendations and conclusions that elaborate on the steps needed to take this concept to the next development stage.","Toilet design; Toilet posture; Ergonomics; Constipation; Pelvic floor relaxation; Toilet extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In this manner, it is of great significance to explore to what degree these methods can be viably utilized by potential adversaries. The majority of adversarial techniques are designed for unconstrained domains such as the image recognition domain, where these methods apply alterations to the pixels in a picture. Therefore, the applicability of these techniques to the NIDS domain is very limited. Related work on adversarial techniques for NIDS generally considers feature-space techniques, which cannot be applied in a practical situation since only the extracted network traffic features are modified and not the actual network traffic. To solve these limitations, a traffic-space approach for creating adversarial examples for evading ML-based NIDS is proposed and assessed with several classification models. The proposed constrained adversarial crafting method is based on the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (IFGSM) and is called the Constrained Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (CIFGSM). A constraint set is added as a penalty term to the loss function of the optimization to ensure that the adversarial values remain within the valid space. Additionally, an L2 regularization term is used to minimize the distance between the original and adversarial network traffic samples. The proposed method is evaluated and shown to be an effective way for generating realistic and practical adversarial evasion packets. To achieve this, network packet components and their characteristics are defined as a constraint set which can be used for the optimization task and a custom adversarial loss function is created that encapsulates the different elements of this optimization problem. Furthermore, multiple models are evaluated to test the transferability of this method. Conclusively, the proposed method is evaluated in a realistic scenario, where adversarial packet captures are crafted and examined. Where other state-of-the art works only modify the network traffic features in feature-space or on a connection level only and do not apply their method in a real world scenario, this work modifies the packet captures on a per-packet level which is subsequently used to evaluate flow based classification models.","adversarial; optimization; network traffic; Intrusion Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Their goal is to develop interventions in the form of neighbourhood meetings, campaigns, and other activities that aim to activate the residents of Reyeroord<br/>in the discontinuation of natural gas in their homes. This thesis project set out to explore how the service designers can be supported in adopting a new approach to design more inclusively in this context.<br/><br/>It seems that currently the interventions by the designers attract only a select group of “early adopters”, but ultimately the energy transition takes place throughout the entire neighbourhood and thus influences all residents. Therefore, every resident needs to be aware of the changes to come and make choices about the changes that likely impact their home environment. It is a wish of the municipality is to include as many residents as possible in the transition.<br/>In this thesis an adapted design process<br/>is proposed for the service designers to contribute to a broader and more diverse participation in the neighbourhood. A three diamond approach is used to identify the problem, research possible solutions, and iteratively develop a solution.<br/>The design goal of this thesis is formulated as: ‘To design a toolkit that enables service designers to practise a more inclusive design process when designing interventions in Reyeroord for a fairer energy transition.’<br/><br/>From the literature research, it is concluded that an inclusive design approach looks different depending on the applied<br/>context. The complex context of the energy transition shows points for improvement and challenges that can be solved with an inclusive approach. A shared understanding is drawn up, in which an inclusive energy transition aims to include and integrate all people and groups in the activity of shifting residential homes from natural gas to a residual heating system while promoting the reduction of energy use and insulation in homes, especially those people who are disadvantaged.<br/><br/>During the idea finding phase, additional and relevant research supports the brainstorm for ideas. This explorative study focuses on the users of the toolkit and the essential elements for an inclusive approach. The design activities then lead to opportunities regarding the designers’ process, insights about building a toolkit and various components. The exploration leads to the discovery of eight solution spaces, which forms the basis of the final toolkit.<br/><br/>Finally, this study looks at what solution could enable the designers to implement<br/>a more inclusive design process. In an iterative design approach, various ideas are then tested with students and designers<br/>of Zeewaardig leading to the proposed inclusion toolkit. The final toolkit supports the designers with four different tools<br/>that can be used during the design of interventions. Lastly, the toolkit is evaluated through a validation test which proves that the toolkit has multiple valuable additions to the current design process. Furthermore it provides relevant insights for future improvement.<br/><br/>To conclude, this thesis dives into the role of inclusion in the energy transition and what service designers can do to create a broader and more diverse participation in the energy transition as a whole. The final deliverable to the designers is a toolkit to reach this goal.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Energy transition; Social innovation; Inclusion; Diversity; Inclusive design; Inclusive energy transition; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a result this thesis proposes the final design REcolor, a consecutive three step process that visualizes employees’ apparent normal within work related situations. It appeals to the Dutch belief that manifestations of racism are wrong in order to adjust their behavior regarding reproduction of racism. <br/><br/>Within the first phase of this project the context exploration has been examined through an exploration of the systemic level of racism revealing how it touches upon individuals, organizations and institutions. In which manifestations are embedded within cultural and institutional processes. The exploration continued with a focus on the reproduction of the individual within the context of Dutch society. While white Dutch citizens have no intention of executing manifestations of racism, they unconsciously continue to be reinforced and reproduce the cycle of racial injustice. In which white people behave according to the norm that is reinforced through social structures of the dominant culture. Allowing white Dutch people to remain ignorant towards their own manifestations of racism during social interactions. <br/><br/>Continuous context exploration of institutional racism placed these individuals in the social structures of organizations and institutions. As such, decisions and products individuals make at work are influenced by their reinforced social structures. Via the distribution of these products like a meeting agenda or a policy within the social network of an organization they gain a power of influence. In other words, organizations hold power to influence the reproduction of during their social interactions via their created in/visible elements. Based on these insights a focus has been put on the individual with unintended racially unjust decisions during work situations. Combined with both the insights of white Dutch people that are unaware of racial reproductions and the acceptance of these as the norm, the design statement became:<br/><br/>‘In order to reduce systemic racism, I want white people to break with work oriented reproduction of racially unjust choices by broaching their apparent normal for review so they can adjust their actions towards their beliefs.’<br/><br/>The final design of this thesis exploration is REcolor, intersecting at individual and organizational levels of systemic racism by visualizing shared individual actions, allowing people to be critical towards the current organizational culture. Reveal is the first step, and visualizes the social relations of an organization to allow participants to be critical upon the societal contribution of the organization. Reflect is the second step in which participants are confronted with the effects of unintended behaviors during social interactions through dilemmas about institutionalized situations at work. Redirect is the third and final step in which a new shared social structure is documented on a visible element allowing participants to monitor undesired behaviors despite the intentions of the actor. Crossing of these manifestations from the visible elements confronted participants with their self perception of an equal society and involvement with racially unjust decisions. The three distinct steps of REcolor facilitate employees to broach manifestations of racism in social interactions in order to adjust their behavior regarding reproduction of racism. <br","Systemic Racism; Social design; Inclusive; race-related issues","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Kapelan, Z. (graduation committee); Lhermitte, S.L.M. (graduation committee); De Vries, R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Plastic pollution is one of the most challenging global environmental problems. Currently, more than 1000 rivers transport approximately 80% of the plastic influx into the oceans. Naturally, more and more companies are interested in tackling this problem. One of them is Noria Sustainable Innovators, a company based in Delft (Netherlands). It is focussed on the detection, removal, and reuse of plastic from Dutch waterways. The company has the ambition to automate the detection of plastic for a wide range of applications. The quantification of plastic and understanding its spatiotemporal variability are crucial for the mitigation of plastic pollution. Current monitoring methods (e.g., visual counting) are tedious, time-consuming, and labour-intensive. Furthermore, the detection of different plastic debris objects could provide more insight about the source of plastic pollution. This thesis explores the feasibility of automating plastic detection in waterways using modern deep learning (DL) algorithms named convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with image classification and object detection techniques. To train these models, a large dataset is required. Due to the unavailability of data, images were gathered in a controlled environment with two GoPros and a Huawei P30. The data was aggregated during sunny and cloudy conditions, different camera heights (2.7m and 4.0m) and angles (0 and 45 degrees). For the simplest case (2.7m/0 degrees), a maximum accuracy of 87.6% was obtained for the multiclass classification of plastic debris in images, using the DenseNet121 model. By applying a majority vote for the three best performing models (DenseNet121, ResNet50 and InceptionV3), the accuracy could be increased to 91%. A qualitative and quantitative analysis found that the following factors influence the model performance negatively: presence of organic material, wind, transparent objects, submerged objects, small objects, overlapping and occluding plastic debris, sun glint and reflection of other objects on the water surface. Sunny conditions yielded a lower accuracy (79%) than cloudy conditions (90%), explained by the presence of sun glint. By applying object detection, the error sources influencing the model performance could be reduced. For training and testing data from 2.7m/0 degrees on one class (‘plastic debris’), the YOLOv4 model yielded an accuracy of 95.61% (GoPro). For four classes (e.g., plastic bottles, other plastic, paper, metal tins) an average accuracy of 66.04% was found, indicating that the model experienced difficulties distinguishing different floating debris in water. Furthermore, it was also shown, that the use of a different image source (Huawei P30), does not have a negative effect on the accuracy (96.63%) compared to the original image source (GoPro). Furthermore, due to height differences, discrepancy in object sizes and different camera settings, the trained model had large difficulties generalizing to a dataset from Indonesia (12.23%). On the other hand, training on the dataset from Indonesia and testing on the dataset from 2.7m/0 degrees achieved an accuracy of 63.51%. Although the error sources could be reduced, the model was still negatively impacted by small, transparent objects, submerged objects and the presence of sun glint. This study clearly showed that Deep Learning-based computer vision can detect floating plastic debris with a high accuracy and have the potential to automate the process of plastic detection in the future. Future work would comprise the following aspects: sensor improvements (polarising filter for sun glint and multispectral sensor for continuous monitoring), data collection from the natural environment and different image sources, implementation of guidelines for Citizen Science platforms, addition of an object tracking module for monitoring (YOLOv4) and focussing on the detection of specific plastic debris objects after the removal from waterways.","Plastic pollution; Artifical Intelligence; Deep Learning; Object detection; Image Classification; Computer vision; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Urban Water Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Ribeiro Monteiro, Luciana (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","People need to move from one place to another for different purposes, from education and work to leisure activities. Transportation means are a way to facilitate these movements. Nevertheless, the transportation sector generates negative externalities, the major ones being safety incidents, environmental impact, and traffic congestion (van Wee et al., 2013). Innovations in transportation can reduce the sector’s negative externalities (Wiesenthal et al., 2015). Innovations can also benefit companies by accelerating growth and increasing profits (van der Panne et al., 2003). Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a transport innovation that can be attractive from a societal and business perspective. UAM refers to an aerial transportation system operating within or traversing an urban area, with different applications, including passenger and goods movement, as well as emergency and surveillance services (Ragbir et al., 2020; Reiche et al., 2021; Straubinger et al., 2020; Winter et al., 2020). UAM can help to reduce traffic congestion, especially in large cities (Balac et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Straubinger et al., 2020), can be safer than existing transport modes (Peksa &amp; Bogenberger, 2020) and thanks to advances in battery technologies and in distributed electrical propulsion systems, UAM vehicles can be fully electric, generating zero local emissions (Straubinger et al., 2020). However, UAM faces significant challenges, including achieving a level of noise acceptable to society (Straubinger et al., 2020) as well as safety concerns that could hamper user adoption (Winter et al., 2020). As explained above, materializing UAM innovations can bring benefits to society and companies, but it is challenging because UAM creates negative externalities. Innovation projects are risky and have a high probability of failure (van der Panne et al., 2003). A literature review process of what could make innovations succeed or fail showed that early stage innovation indicators are lacking. A better understanding of indicators for early stage innovations is still needed (Dziallas &amp; Blind, 2019). Thus, a knowledge gap was identified, namely a lack of early stage innovation indicators. The early stage of an innovation starts with the initial innovation idea and ends before the formal development process begins (Dziallas &amp; Blind, 2019; Eling &amp; Herstatt, 2017). The early stage is important because the most critical decisions are made there (Cooper &amp; Kleinschmidt, 1987). The use of indicators can improve decision making processes by ensuring decisions are made based on established criteria (Cooper, 1990). Assessing an innovation project before it enters the development phase can help companies identify projects that will likely fail and thus avoid investing resources in them (Dziallas, 2020; Martinsuo &amp; Poskela, 2011). In order to address the knowledge gap, the research question answered in this master thesis is: “What indicators are important to support decision making at the early stage of the innovation process for Urban Air Mobility innovations?”. The following methodology was pursued to answer the research question. The first step was to obtain scientific literature from Scopus, which was coded using the qualitative content analysis software Atlas.ti, producing a code set of indicators. Secondly, gray literature was obtained via snowballing from scientific literature and with search queries in Google, which was coded to produce another code set of indicators. The independently generated code sets from scientific and gray literature were compared, serving as an initial validation, and used to produce the Indicator Set V1. Thirdly, case studies provided by the external thesis supervisor were coded to extract indicators, using the Indicator Set V1 as coding scheme. Fourthly, an interview protocol and an interview guide were created, and eight semi-structured interviews with experts from industry and academia were conducted. Interview transcripts were coded to elicit indicators. The indicators found at interviews were compared and merged with the Indicator Set V1, producing the Indicator Set V2. Additionally, a framework was created, showing how indicators can be used to make decisions at early stages of the innovation process. Finally, a workshop was conducted with experts from a company manufacturing an UAM aircraft. The feedback obtained from the workshop was used to validate and revise the Indicator Set V2 and the framework, answering the research question. The results of this thesis show that the actions that can be taken regarding early stage indicators fall into three types. Firstly, some indicators can be determined at the early stage, such as the fulfillment of key requirements, alignment with company strategy, synergy with company capabilities, and the value proposition. Secondly, there are indicators whose value can be influenced at the early stage, although these indicators are also dependent on later stages. Examples are production and operation costs, operational downtime, sustainability (which includes emissions and recyclability at the end of life), and user comfort. Thirdly, there are indicators that although they cannot be impacted at the early stage, they should still be identified early to assess if they could become showstoppers at later stages. Examples are the perception of UAM as visually polluting, and its perception as a service only benefiting people from higher income classes. The thesis findings were compared with previous research, namely with Dziallas (2020), who investigated early stage indicators for incremental innovations in the automotive industry, with Cooper (2008), who listed a set of criteria to assess whether a new product should continue to the development phase, and with Feitelson &amp; Salomon (2004), who proposed a model of how transport innovations are adopted. This comparison resulted in the following insights. Firstly, there are many indicators in common between this thesis and Dziallas (2020) and Cooper (2008), suggesting there are early stage indicators applicable to innovations in any industry. Secondly, some indicators found by Dziallas (2020) that were not elicited in this thesis seem to be relevant only for incremental innovations, while indicators found in this research not elicited by Dziallas (2020) seem to be only useful for radical innovations. Indicators related to the societal and political acceptance of the innovation are an example of those that are likely applicable to radical innovations only. Acceptance indicators are also absent at Gate 3 in the research of Cooper (2008). Finally, while the results of this thesis roughly confirm the Political Economy model proposed by Feitelson &amp; Salomon (2004), namely that the factors that influence the adoption of an innovation are its technical feasibility, social and political feasibility and financial feasibility, this thesis contributes to the model in the following ways. It specifies that indicators belonging to the social and political feasibility should be identified at the early stage and it identifies early stage indicators belonging to the categories of user adoption and timing feasibility, which were not conceptualized in the Political Economy model.The main takeaways resulting from this thesis are the following. Firstly, the early stage of the innovation process is critical because there are several indicators whose value is already determined at this stage, as well as indicators that although they are dependent on implementation, their value can already be influenced at the early stage. Even for indicators that are fully dependent on later stages, it is important to identify them early to assess the likelihood that these indicators become showstoppers, which aids companies to assess the risk of innovation projects and decide whether to continue them or not. Secondly, user adoption, which is critical for the innovation’s success, can be addressed by involving potential users early in the design process. Ways to do this include employing surveys, interviews and simulators. Finally, societal and political acceptance are paramount for innovation success. The indicators relevant for them can be identified at the early stage in order to assess if they are likely to become showstoppers or if they are enablers that can be leveraged to boost the acceptance of the innovation. Then, companies can assess if they can be influenced early in the design process. For UAM, noise is an example of such an indicator. An UAM aircraft could comply with noise requirements from certification perspective and still not being allowed to fly in its target markets because the local regulators or the citizens consider the noise level generated as unacceptable. To avoid this, acceptable noise levels can be investigated at the early stage and translated into design requirements. Investigating at the early stage what indicators drive societal and political acceptance can be useful to any transport innovation, and not only to UAM. Further research is needed to conclude about this and to better understand how to address social and political acceptance at the early stage of innovation. Possible avenues are researching how previous successful and failed innovations have dealt with acceptance, and how current candidate innovations in transportation or in other sectors are addressing these issues at the early stage. Other opportunities for future research are the following. Firstly, given that most of the indicators found in this thesis can only be evaluated qualitatively (soft indicators), future researchers can continue looking for early stage innovation indicators that can be evaluated quantitatively (hard indicators). Secondly, to investigate the differences between early stage indicators for incremental versus radical innovations.

There, the shopping mall of the Molenpoort Passage has implanted itself in the middle of the old town. A manifesto of contemporary architecture from the 70ties, comprising a faceless building complex, merely dedicated to shopping and consumption in an atmosphere of constant overstimulation. Based on two hypotheses, (i) that human beings are strongly dependent on rituals and routines on the one hand, and (ii) that we are increasingly in need of a built environment that radiates stability and community on the other hand, the question arose about the connection/interaction between architecture and the performance of rituals. How can we develop an architecture, which encourages daily as well as ceremonial rituals which become an integral part in humans regular habits, in order to strengthen a sense of belonging and togetherness? The idea for my urban plan was to break up the big mass (the shopping center), into a loose ensemble of smaller buildings, which fit in size into the surroundings and unite the plot into a new community. Overall it shall be a place of education and hospitality. With the design of a primary school and boarding house I wanted to create a safe environment and once again a community, a school community, with its own rituals and routines.","bricolage; ritual; school buildings; reuse; Nijmegen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

For this microplant, gaseous carbon dioxide must be compressed from 1 to 50 [bar] with the low mass flow of 336.7 [g/h]. This thesis examines the compression system which uses rolling piston compressors. This thesis also examines a solution to compress the carbon dioxide optimally.<br/><br/>Because of the low mass flows, the compressors are very small and have relatively high friction and leakage losses. Meanwhile, due to the high pressure ratio of the system, the temperature increase due to compression also poses a problem for the lubrication of the system. Therefore, this thesis looks for solutions for these problems while trying to gain a better understanding of what exactly is happening inside the compressors.<br/><br/>For the temperature regulation, different options for active cooling were assessed with a dimensionless analysis. Eventually, the concept of cooling through the compressor housing was chosen. Afterwards, a computational model was made to calculate the inner workings of the compressors and assess whether the concept of active cooling would still work. Then the computational model was verified by doing experimentation.<br/><br/>After that, the results from the model and the experimentation were compared. The model was able to predict the mass flow and the outside heat transfer coefficient accurately. However, the model was still off from the experimental values by quite a margin. After assessing all the data, the system seemed to perform better as a 2-stage system then as a 3-stage system. However, due to the inaccuracies of the model and experimentation, a definite recommendation on the number of stages of the system cannot be formed.","Rolling Piston Compressor; Active Cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-08","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); Zwick, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To mitigate the growth of space debris, it is vital that Active Debris Removal (ADR) is performed in the near future. Since ADR will require robust relative navigation, future spacecraft should be marked with fiducial markers that are robustly extracted from an image taken by a chaser spacecraft. To prevent the restriction of robotic movement and occlusions of features, planarity of these fiducials is desired. While numerous planar fiducials exist, the performance of these systems suffers from pose ambiguities and loss of precision under frontal observations. In order to mitigate these issues, encoding markers have been proposed in literature. These markers encode an extra dimension of information in the signal between marker and sensor, thus increasing the robustness of the fiducial system. However, little research has been done on these encoding markers and existing solutions are hard to manufacture, qualify and scale. This thesis proposes a novel fiducial marker design based on the compound eye of a Mantis insect. The fiducial proposed in this work, the so-called Mantis Marker, is planar and encodes a virtual point in its signal. This virtual point is located at a distance from the marker plane. This makes the marker system mathematically equivalent to a fiducial that uses a protrusion or indentation. This increases pose robustness by an order of magnitude with respect to planar fiducials of the same dimensions, as demonstrated in this thesis. Furthermore, the marker is easy to manufacture, is scalable and has low complexity. Finally, the marker is suitable for pose estimation for robotics and Augmented Reality (AR) on Earth where additional pose robustness is required.","Fiducials; Markers; Active Debris Removal; Relative Navigation; Aruco; Mantis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Consider a surveillance camera that suddenly outputs corrupted data, where up to 95% of the pixels per frame are corrupted. Real time video completion and correction is often desirable in such scenarios. Therefore, this thesis improves the Tensor-Networked Kalman Filter (TNKF) as presented in [12] by developing the Tensor-Networked Square-Root Kalman Filter (TNSRKF). The TNSRKF is a Square-Root Kalman Filter (SRKF) realized in a Tensor Networks (TN) structure. The square-root Kalman filter is an inherently stable algorithm, and indirectly allows for more information retention throughout the algorithm. Thereby, the filter aims to improve the performance of the TNKF. Furthermore, implementing the filter in TN results in an intuitive implementation of the filter while allowing for larger video dimensions than the widely used matrix format. This thesis concludes that the TNSRKF is too computationally burdensome to complete a video in an online fashion due to the implementation of the Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm in Tensor-Train (TT)-format. In addition, results demonstrate that a low-rank orthogonality matrix is not realizable, making it impractical to update the state covariance matrix via any method that uses an orthonormal matrix.","Kalman Filter; tensor networks; online video completion; tensor-trains; square-root kalman filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The industry has a complex problem to solve and an important role to play during the energy transition, that is needed because of global warming. Many industrial processes use heat generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. An alternative sustainable solution needs to be chosen in the future. Fossil fuels can be replaced by biofuels, hydrogen, electric power or a hybrid solution.<br/><br/>For this study a solution using electric power is investigated, which could also be used in a hybrid solution. Electric combustion air preheating can be used to shift the energy input from fuel energy to electrical energy. This is new since normally combustion air preheating is accomplished in the convective part of the fired heater. A system to heat up the combustion air to a temperature of 300°C is designed using correlations for tube banks and CFD modelling. An experiment is also conducted to investigate the impact of the combustion air preheater on the burner and fired heater performance. It is important that the burner and fired heater performance remain almost unchanged since the whole fired heater is designed around specific performance parameters.<br/><br/>The design includes a staggered and finned tube bank that can reduce CO2 emissions with 3.2 % by using green electricity when operating 3000 hours per year. This method for combustion air preheating will also result in an operating cost reduction and a payback time of less than five years. A drawback of this system is that the NOx emissions will increase by a factor of 2, which is bad for the environment since it is responsible for the formation of smog and the general acidification of soil and water. This could be avoided by improving the burner design or applying other combustion control mechanisms.<br/><br/>The outcome shows that electric combustion air preheater is suitable technology for CO2 emissions reduction in the short term for fired heaters. With the increasing CO2 emissions cost and increasing volatility of the electricity market, this is an attractive grid balancing equipment.","burner; combustion; air; Electric power demand; industrial; fired heater; furnace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As a branch of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained interest among researchers in the field of flight control. Flat reinforcement learning (FRL) methods often require many samples to achieve the desired training result, which is a time-consuming process. One learning method that has the potential to improve the learning efficiency is hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL); this learning method divides the control tasks or control inputs into several hierarchies and the hierarchies are solved by lower-level agents or lower-level actions. Besides, it is often unsafe to apply flat reinforcement learning models to the learning of flight control. This is because the exploration process of the RLA can lead the aircraft into unsafe states. The contribution of this research is mitigating the curse of dimensionality and improving the safety of an existing hierarchical reinforcement learning method on fixed-wing flight control. The curse of dimensionality is mitigated by embedding the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) in the existing HRL based on the dynamic decomposition framework. The safety of reinforcement learning is improved by an auxiliary safety modification layer (SML) with prior knowledge of the system dynamics that corrects the action generated by the agent. In this research, both the HRL and safe reinforcement learning (SRL) methods are applied on fixed-wing flight control and further effects on sample efficiency and learning performance are investigated with a fixed-wing flight model. It has shown that the HRL based on dynamic decomposition method has higher sample efficiency than FRL method and the SRL by SML method can effectively ensure the safety of the HRL learning progress.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Traffic jams without a clear cause, such as an on-ramp or an accident, are called phantom traffic jams and are said to make up 50% of all traffic jams. They are the result of an unstable traffic flow caused by human driving behaviour. Recent studies have shown how automating the longitudinal vehicle motion of only 5% of all cars in the flow can dissipate phantom traffic jams. However, automation introduces new problems, mainly regarding safety when human drivers need to take over the control. This research tries to answer whether phantom traffic jams can be dissolved or prevented using haptic shared control. This means of control keeps the human in the loop and would therefore eliminate the takeover problems while still benefiting from the advantages of automation. 24 participants took part in a driving experiment in a fixed base simulator. In these experiments, we tested haptic shared control against manual control and full automation for longitudinal motion. Results show that traffic jam dissipation performance for haptic shared control lies between manual control and automation. The number of unsafe situations is reduced compared to the automated condition. We conclude that haptic shared control is able to reduce the increased fuel consumption and crashes caused by phantom traffic jams.","Phantom traffic jam; Haptic shared control; Active pedals; Longitudinal vehilcle motion; Simulator; Silent automation failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (graduation committee); Pasterkamp, S. (graduation committee); Vernooij, R.G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The orthotropic steel deck (OSD) is a deck system applied regularly in steel bridges all around the world. It consists of a steel deck plate which is stiffened by structural elements placed in two orthogonal directions. The deck plate can be used as an integral part of the structure, causing OSDs to achieve a high material efficiency and therefore low self-weight. However, this structural integration requires a large number of welded connections between the deck plate and stiffening members, which also make the system susceptible to fatigue. The fatigue evaluation of these connections is complex and time-consuming, hindering the manual optimization of orthotropic deck designs. <br/><br/>The use of structural optimization could be a solution for this. With parametric optimization, the best possible ratio between structural dimensions may be searched for automatically, while topology optimization could assist in finding new design concepts that could form alternatives to the traditional deck layout. This thesis investigates how these techniques could reduce the self-weight of the design of a case study (the renovated Van Brienenoord bridge) without reducing its fatigue service life. The two methods are treated in separate parts.<br/> <br/>In the first part, considering parametric optimization, the traditional OSD concept is maintained and the values of seven selected dimensions are adjusted to obtain a design with a minimized weight. A workflow is developed in which an existing mathematical optimization solver (the artificial bee colony algorithm, a metaheuristic) is coupled to a parametric model, finite element program, and fatigue damage calculator. This enables an iterative process in which designs are generated by the solver and then evaluated in the remainder of the workflow. The information gained from the evaluation is returned to the solver and used to search for lighter designs. <br/><br/>In the second part, the deck remains a stiffened steel plate, but the location and orientation of stiffeners may be changed. Two possible leads for finding new structural concepts are explored. The first considers a topology optimization using the ground structure method, which can find the optimal orientation and size of stiffeners in a plate. This thesis evaluates the method’s current applicability on steel bridge decks. The second lead interprets the results of a topology optimization from existing literature. This gives a new design concept in which the crossbeams curve directly towards the supports instead of being indirectly connected by main girders. A weight minimization using the workflow of the first part and a study of the force transfer in the deck are performed to assess the new concept’s potential.<br/><br/>The first part showed that a 17,4 percent lighter deck structure (280 kg/m2 instead of 339 kg/m2 ) could be obtained for the case study by breaking with the general trend for designing orthotropic steel decks. The optimized design uses smaller and more rectangular troughs than commonly applied, but the largest differences are found in the deck plate thickness and stiffener spacing. For the latter, a value of 300 mm has been in use since the introduction of OSDs in the 1950’s and is present in almost any bridge using an orthotropic steel deck. When fatigue issues started to appear from the 1970’s onward, it was generally decided to increase the deck plate thickness. The results in this thesis strongly suggest that decreasing the stiffener spacing and trough top width is the preferred option when material efficiency is considered. A cost estimation further showed that the price of the optimized design would be comparable to that of the preliminary design that was suggested for the case study. <br/><br/>The topology optimization using the ground structure method showed that the optimal placement of stiffeners for a plate-like bridge deck contains two distinctive zones. Between the supports, the traditional longitudinal-transverse orientation is preferred, while the optimal direction of stiffeners in the middle of the bridge segments is arbitrary. The conventional OSD concept could be seen as optimal based on this result, but for definitive conclusions more research is needed towards a non-linear relation between cross-sectional area and resistance in the applied method. The similar support conditions of decks in other bridges make it likely that these conclusions will apply to those cases as well.<br/><br/>The optimization of the curved crossbeam concept showed the versatility of the workflow developed in the first part of this thesis, as only minor adaptations in the parametric model were needed for the application on a significantly different design. Despite the successful optimization, the potential of the new design to replace the traditional OSD concept is considered low. In its optimized form, the concept was 9,8 percent heavier and less than half as stiff as the best found result in this thesis’ first part. The comparable support conditions for plate girder bridges in general again suggest similar outcomes for other cases, while a different setup of the optimization would not tackle the fundamental stiffness problem of the design. Further research towards the curved crossbeam concept should therefore stick to the original application of box girder decks.<br","Structural Optimization; Topology Optimization; Orthotropic Steel Deck; Stiffened plate; Stiffened panel; Van Brienenoord bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

One of the methods to determine if a bridge still has sufficient safety is proof load testing. Stop criteria are values of structural responses at which further loading may course irreversibly damage to the structure. Measuring all currently proposed stop criteria requires a lot of single sensors, and it is holding back the application of the method in practice. A method to improve the applicability of proof load testing in practice is to simplify the sensor setup by using semi continuous fiber optical sensors. In this research, a fiber optical measurement system is developed to measure stop criteria for proof load testing. For application of the system to the slab a stiff glued anchorage system is designed, which is able to transfer the concrete strains to the reusable, long gauge fiber optic sensor system. The performance of this anchorage system is checked by preliminary experiments that include the comparison of various glues and investigates time-dependent effects. An installation method for these anchors is developed to improve practical applicability. Stop criteria are developed and checked by a 1:2 scale experiment on a concrete slab bridge. The results from the optical fiber sensors measure the global behavior of the slab bridge such as cracking and deflection well. Internal optical fiber sensors were included within the reinforcement. These sensors provide information on the strains up until the yielding point of the reinforcement bars. In conclusion, the fiber optical measurement system does provide insight on global and local behavior of the slab, and is able to monitor stop criteria. More importantly, the critical location cannot be missed with this sensor setup, as well as that more simplifications in the measurement setup are possible. It is therefore recommended to apply this measurement technique in future applications of proof load testing.","Stop criteria; FBG; Long gauge; Proof Load Testing; concrete; slab bridges","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Zhao, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) unfortunately limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this thesis, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types with complex distributions. CTAB-GAN is extensively evaluated with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17%. <br/><br/>Additionally, to ensure greater security for training tabular GANs against malicious privacy attacks, differential privacy (DP) is studied and used to train CTAB-GAN with strict privacy guarantees. DP-CTAB-GAN is rigorously evaluated using state-of-the-art DP-tabular GANs in terms of data utility and privacy robustness against membership and attribute inference attacks. Our results on three datasets indicate that strict theoretical differential privacy guarantees come only after severely affecting data utility. However, it is shown empirically that these guarantees help provide a stronger defence against privacy attacks. Overall, it is found that DP-CTABGAN is capable of being robust to privacy attacks while maintaining the highest data utility as compared to prior work, by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score.","Tabular Data; Generative Adversarial Networks; Differential Privacy; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Coenders-Gerrits, Miriam (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Many conceptual hydrological models do not include any information on plant phenology, which represents the dynamic behavior of vegetation, to partition evaporation in a catchment. Such models often use potential evaporation to quantify evaporation from the interception reservoir and what remains afterward to quantify transpiration, or the other way around depending on the modeler’s decisions. Such defined orders are the opposite of what is perceived in reality. Vegetation is alive, continuously developing, and impacts the partitioning of evaporation through its ability to transpire. Hence, vegetation is able to constantly change this defined order and thus the ratio of transpiration over interception evaporation over time.<br/><br/>This study aimed to include information from plant phenology, representing the dynamic behavior of vegetation, to partition evaporation in a catchment in conceptual hydrological models. This study hypothesized that the conceptual hydrological models that do include this information provide more reliable hydrological responses. To test this hypothesis, this study used two conceptual hydrological models, which are the lumped FLEX and GR4J models, to simulate daily values streamflow and evaporation for two distinct catchments in the United States.<br/><br/>To include information from plant phenology, this study applied three separate modifications to the conventional structures of the two conceptual hydrological models. The first modified structure uses a part of the Jarvis model, in which stomata respond to temperature, to partition evaporation. The second modified structure uses a method similar to the crop evaporation method of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Lastly, the third modified structure uses a combination of the other two structures.<br/><br/>This study concludes that conceptual hydrological models that include information from plant phenology, as in the three modified model structures, are able to provide streamflow simulations as good as models that do not include plant phenology. The streamflow simulations of conceptual hydrological models, such as the three modified model structures, are therefore not necessarily more reliable. However, conceptual hydrological models that do include information from plant phenology might still benefit hydrological studies that take into account the effects of long and short-term changes to the vegetation in a catchment, such as the effects of climate change, land-use change, and forest fires. Before plant phenology should be used in the models of such studies, challenges such as the uncertainties in the simulations of the evaporation components need to be addressed.","Hydrological modelling; Conceptual hydrological model; Transpiration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the 6 millionm3/y of brackish seepage that occurs in the deep Horstermeer Polder, located in between the cities of Amsterdam and Hilversumin the Netherlands, is mitigated by using up to 207 millionm3/y of freshwater. This is very unsustainable, especially since the<br/>pressure on the freshwater reserves in the Netherlands is rising. Therefore, this research focuses on evaluating a new mitigation measure of the brackish <br/>upconing below the polder: the extraction of brackish water. In March 2021 AD, a pilot well has been installed in the polder, and its effects were assessed in this research. To enable the evaluation, an extensive analysis of all available measurements of the geology, hydraulic head, and chloride distribution in the area was performed, and a 3D regional variable-density groundwater model using MODFLOW 6 was built. The model result has a reasonable good agreement with these measurements, since at 70% of the measurement locations, the simulated hydraulic head deviates less than 30 cm, and at 80% of them, the simulated chloride concentration deviates less than 200 mg/l. Moreover, compared to previous research, the representation of the brackish upconing was significantly improved. The effects of the pilot well were calculated using five different operational settings. The results indicated that a shallow well, starting below -50 m NAP, reduces the chloride load in the polder more than a deep well (-100 m NAP). However, even in the best scenario, i.e. an active shallow well with a constant pumping rate of 100 m3/h, the reduction of the chloride load is limited to 5.5%. In perspective, these results suggested that at least 24 of these wells are needed to lower the chloride concentration in the discharge water out of the polder to 250 mg/l. On the contrary, the shallow wells cause a considerable average drawdown of 4 cm at surface level in a radius of 50 meters around the well, which might result in damage to wooden pile foundations in the northeast of the polder.","variable-density groundwater modelling; brackish upconing; Horstermeer Polder; brackish groundwater extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.248118, 5.073741"

Several researchers mention WWTPs to be an important source for AR as the growth of bacteria is stimulated in an environment with a selective pressure facilitated by a relatively high concentration of antibiotics.<br/><br/>Tertiary treatment steps are implemented primary to polish the effluent and reduce the OMP load of the effluent. The O3-STEP filter is an innovative example of such a tertiary treatment combining the oxidative effects of ozone with the adsorption effects of a Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filter. In addition to these effects, a coagulant is dosed for the removal of Phosphorus (P). The implications for AR are still unknown. In literature varying results are found on the disinfecting effects of ozone, GAC and coagulation and nothing is found on the combination of these treatment steps yet. The purpose of this document is to present how effective the treatment with ozone and coagulation is in the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in comparison with antibiotic sensitive bacteria (ASB).<br/><br/>Agar growth media are used to test four different microorganisms: two faecal indicators (E. coli and Enterococci) and a resistant strain of each of these bacteria (ESBL E. coli and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE)). Several experiments are conducted in the laboratory to test disinfection of ozone and coagulation on these microorganisms.<br/><br/>In confirmation of the hypothesis, ozonation and coagulation disinfect ARB as well as ASB. However, as both treatment steps are not aiming at the removal of microorganisms but at the removal of OMPs and phosphorus respectively, the microorganism removal is limited (with 0.7 log on average). Increasing the coagulant and ozone dosage showed promising results in the laboratory. Dosing the coagulant above the optimum sweep coagulation dosage is not favourable because the increase in removal stagnated above this concentration whilst the residual coagulant concentration in the supernatant water increased.<br/>In the GAC of the O3-STEP filter and its backwash water, an increase of VRE is found relative to Enterococci in comparison with the ozonated water but not over the complete O3-STEP filter. This was different for the 1-STEP filter which showed the worrying result that VRE increased in the same amounts as Enterococci decreased. As the 1-STEP filter is a filter with a matured biology, where O3-STEP was recently started, the O3-STEP filter might increase the absolute and relative amount of ARB in long term as well.<br/><br/>In case the aim for the O3-STEP filter is to remove AR as well, several suggestions are made. As ozone and coagulation both potentially remove ARB, an increase in these concentrations is a no-regret possibility. Furthermore, ultrafiltration (UF) and the combination of ultraviolet (UV) and O3 are proposed as possible alternatives. Using a multicriteria analysis (MCA), increasing the ozone dosage with the existing bypass is recommended.<br","Antibiotic resistant bacteria; ozone; disinfection; Fe-EC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-09","","","","","",""

After this, during different experiments on a simple CNN, a better understanding of the variables that can be chosen for the network is gained. In the first experiment the network was trained on two translated images of a cat in order to test the common believe that CNNs are translation invariant. The result of this experiment refuted this believe and led to the understanding of translation equivariance, with which translation invariance often is confused. After this, the network was trained to learn the difference between a cat and a dog. From this, it appeared that the network can become translation invariant if the right training data is chosen. Also, a look was taken at the kernels of the convolution layer and the feature maps they produce. Finally, there was looked into an other transformation of the images, namely rotation. This led to the idea that the resolution of the images has influence on classifying the rotated cats and dogs.","Neural Networks; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Machine learning; Translation invariance; Translation equivariance","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to, among other things,<br/>modernisation, globalisation and individualisation of society, mutual ties are diminishing (Schiefer and van der Noll, 2016). This thesis aims to map the aspects that influence social cohesion and investigate whether improving these aspects by reviving an underused space can lead to improved social cohesion. The main question of this thesis is, therefore; How can an underutilised space contribute to improved social cohesion? The answer to this central question is sought by means of an extensive literature study. By<br/>comparing different literary sources, the various aspects of social cohesion are mapped out. In addition, the literature also looks for the effects<br/>of underutilised space in the urban context. Six main pillars influence social cohesion; social participation, physical environment, liveability, safety, health and economy. These six aspects influence the degree of social cohesion that is experienced. The consequences of underutilised space for the neighbourhood, such as impoverishment, a reduced sense of security, and little social interaction, negatively affect social cohesion. By tackling these problems in the underutilised space, social cohesion in a neighbourhood improves. There are three main topics crucial for solving the problem. First, interactions and encounters need to be stimulated. Thus, people will cross paths and will have spontaneous conversations. Secondly, a safe environment needs to be created so the inhabitants feel comfortable visiting the site and finally, there should be no exclusion. This means that the building should not only be inviting for all residents but also physically. The building should not be exclusionary, which means that the relationships between inside and outside and the building and the public space play an important role.","Social cohesion; Underutilised space; Diversity; Architecture; Urban Design; Urban Developments; Inclusivity; City of the future","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.933313, 4.492178"

Soon this type of building became a symbol of power and representation which started to migrate within America and then to the other parts of the world. As technology improved new types of skyscraper facades were introduced which migrated as people were inspired. A persistent issue that can be seen throughout the migration is the unchanged urban implementation of these buildings. The street life and the way it interacts with the building have not been clearly addressed. Many architects have addressed these issues on their own way, but this connection between both the spaces varies with their location and context and has to be addressed with respect to that. Netherlands is a country which has a strong urban street life connection, outdoor social and interaction spaces such as markets, outdoor cafes, bars and restaurants can be found throughout the cities. Rotterdam is one such city where in spite of the urbanization and the modern architecture, the spirit of Rotterdam remains outdoors with a good social interaction. However, the modern High-rise buildings in certain parts of the city still stands as an isolated entity in the neighborhood severing the urban street life connection with the building.

Looking at the industrial sector, the largest share of energy is used for process heating, with fossil fuels as its primary source. A way to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the emissions of process heating is by the integration of heat pump technology.<br/><br/>However, operational costs are still a limiting factor in the widespread uptake of this technology. A potential of industrial heat pumps that will have a positive effect on the operational costs, as well as its general applicability, is the possibility to operate the equipment in a flexible manner. At this point, the potential to respond with high temperature industrial heat pumps to heat demand, the electricity market or to grid congestion, is not yet unlocked.<br/><br/>The focus in this study is on gaining more insight into the dynamic characteristics of industrial heat pump operation. The approach is based on the modeling of a 2 MW high temperature industrial heat pump in the Dymola simulation environment. Based on the system dynamics, a suitable control method is selected and the controller settings are optimized. With this control system in place, the dynamic limitations are studied.<br/><br/>The limiting factor in the considered economizer based heat pump cycle is the ability of the control system to keep the superheat at the screw compressor injection port within acceptable limits during load level changes. The heat pump is found to be able to ramp up and down at a maximum rate of approximately 20%/min. This level of flexibility allows use of the heat pump for both heat demand and electricity price response, as well as for participation in grid load balancing pools. On a higher level, based on these results flexible heat pump operation can be considered possible.","Industrial heat pump; Dynamic modeling; Flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Retrofitting the existing stock is a critical step in every nation to achieve these goals. The building sector has a significant role in the Net-zero emission transition. The ambitions for retrofitting the Netherlands´ by 2030 and 2050 bring the need to explore new products taking sustainability and circular economy as the basis of design. This research explores the application of a “cradle to cradle” design approach to redesign a sandwich panel currently used as a renovation strategy to wrap existing dwellings in The Netherlands. The research in performed from the perspective of a façade company in the national market. <br/><br/>The current product manufactured by the company is not studied with the end of its service life in mind and is designed mainly with fossil fuels related products. Also, the time component is detached from the product, and scenarios where the materials are “processed and disposed” or “mined and reused” are not considered. The research explores three different façade concepts that contrast with a traditional linear production based mainly on fossil fuels. The analysis brings a set of 24 options, each with three circularity scenarios. The conclusions reveal that the environmental impacts and success of a “cradle to cradle” design strategy has a close relationship with the number of years the existing dwellings will be used. By reusing the existing dwellings for prolonged times (50 and 100 years), the best option for the company is to develop a biobased sandwich panel relying on renewables and materials with low environmental impacts but as an efficient “cradle to grave” strategy. However, for a shorter span of usage in the existing stock (25 years), the best option is a “cradle to cradle” strategy where the resources are taken back to the technical cycle combined with reduced usage of materials for the cladding system. <br/> <br/>Some of the technical recommendations suggested are to test the biobased panel for a mechanical test. Afterward, develop the construction details for connections in foundation, windows, and doors to finally build a 1:1 mock-up to be tested for meteorological degradations and durability. Also, further analysis is needed for a financial case for the scenarios where materials are used after a first cycle. Finally, further research is needed to develop fully biobased matrixes to biocomposite fully biodegradable, allowing them to get back into a biological cycle.","Retrofitting facades; Sandwich panels; Sustainability; Circular Economy; Existing stock; Life cycle Assessment; Composite structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-09","","","","","",""

(mentor); Molin, E.J.E. (mentor); Veeneman, Wijnand (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is the third largest airport in Europe in terms of passenger volumes and has been growing rapidly over the past years. This growth is expected to continue in the future (KiM, 2018). Due to the rapid growth in travel demand, AAS reached the maximum allowed number of flight movements of 500.000 per year in 2018 (Schiphol Group, 2018a). According to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) carried out by Schiphol Group (2018), growth to 540.000 flight movements per year in the period of 2020-2023 is possible without violating current restrictions on noise nuisance and emissions. This number of 540.000 flight movements per year also represents the maximum number of flights that can be safely handled at AAS without further expansion and will soon be reached as well1 (Schiphol Group, 2018a). In the case of WLO scenario high, more than a quarter of the passenger demand in 2050 cannot be handled at AAS without violating set restrictions (CPB &amp; PBL, 2015). AAS wants to maintain its leading position in the European transport market and wants to deal with the growing passenger demand, while staying within the set restrictions in terms of the number of flight movements per year. In order to deal with the expected increase in travel demand for long-distance travel in the future, AAS is considering alternative ways of transport and aspires to become the multimodal hub of Europe. To realize this, the focus of AAS is on short-haul flight substitution within Europe by HSR or by innovative modes. The hyperloop, initially introduced by Elon Musk (2013), is one of the innovative modes being considered by AAS and the Dutch Government (Ministery of Infrastructure and Water Management, 2020). Hyperloop consists of pods travelling through a tube, propelled by magnetic levitation, while maintaining a partial vacuum in this tube (Musk, 2013). The literature on hyperloop has focused on the different technical aspects and the technical feasibility of hyperloop (Gkoumas &amp; Christou, 2020a, 2020b), others highlight the energy consumption, and some criticize hyperloop for not being feasible, but nobody has examined to what extent HPT can function as substitute for short-haul flights and which role HPT could play in the future of multi-modal transport. The aim of this study is to design the future transport system of hyperloop passenger transport (HPT) in the transport market with air passenger transport (APT), highspeed rail (HSR) and HPT for longdistance travel within Europe and to assess whether or not the passenger demand in WLO scenario high can be met, including the share of passengers that cannot be dealt with by means of APT alone. The methodology this thesis has used is discrete choice modelling (DCM). Trade-offs and mode choice of passengers when choosing between APT, HSR and HPT are analysed in order to assess the impact of different system designs of HPT on the potential of HSR and HPT in the substitution of short-haul flights at AAS. A stated preference (SP) experiment has been carried out in order to collect choice data. The focus of this study is solely on substitution of flights at AAS with both origin and destination in Europe, i.e. OD-substitution, and examines destinations that are located approximately 500 km from AAS. Substitution of transfer passengers, both within Europe and for intercontinental destinations, is disregarded in this study. The second research objective this study seeks to address is a methodological research objective. The aim is to examine the impact of using images in the presentation of unfamiliar alternatives in the introduction of the SP experiment on preferences, attitude and drop-out of respondents. Based on these two research objectives, the following research questions have been defined 1. How could different design scenarios for hyperloop passenger transport influence traveller’s mode choice between, and the transport demand for, air passenger transport, highspeed rail, and hyperloop passenger transport for the future long-distance transport market within Europe at AAS? 2. What is the impact of the way in which HPT is introduced in the stated preference experiment on preferences, attitude and drop-out of respondents?","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(ZEF) is developing a microplant, which ultimately provides a pathway to produce a hydrocarbon in a sustainable manner. This microplant consists of several subsystems. One of which is an alkaline water electrolyser, in which water is split into oxygen and hydrogen under specific operating conditions.<br/>As a mixture of the product gasses can be highly explosive, gas crossover in alkaline water electrolysis (AEC) systems is a point of concern in terms of safety. This explorative study aims to identify the main routes for crossover in AEC systems, as well as characterizing the ZEF AEC system. This characterization has been accomplished by studying the effect of process conditions and system geometry on gas crossover.<br/><br/>Based on a literature study, gas crossover is found to be the result of diffusion as well as convection. Both of these phenomena occur at the interconnects between the sides of the system, which is over the diaphragms and over the pressure equalization tube (PET) in case of the ZEF AEC system.<br/><br/>Gas measurements where conducted during over 194 hours of experiments. From this it was concluded that hydrogen crossover is the main point of concern in terms of safety. Operating pressure and temperature both very clearly affect hydrogen crossover. The effect of current density is also significant but obscured by the fact that temperature is an uncontrollable variable in the ZEF AEC system. From the steady-state data a window for safe operations has been framed. <br/>Upon start-up of the system a spike in oxygen-side hydrogen concentration is consistently measured, which is a result of crossover by diffusion during system off-time. This spike in concentration also poses a threat in terms of safety.<br/>Three different pressure equalization tubes have been tested to investigate the influence of interconnect geometry on gas crossover.<br/><br/>In order to identify the main route for hydrogen crossover a CSTR model of the oxygen side gas phase was developed, in which temperature and pressure effects were taken into account. The model showed that hydrogen crossover by diffusion could be held accountable for ~8% of the total amount of crossed-over hydrogen, which is in line with reports in literature for a mixed electrolyte cycle AEC system. The model also showed that crossover by solely diffusion through the PET is negligible compared to through the diaphragm.<br/><br/>From this, it was concluded that the ZEF AEC system behaves more like a system with mixed electrolyte cycles with respect to gas crossover levels. Recommendations are made in order to reduce hydrogen crossover, and enlarge the window for safe operation as a result.","AEC; Alkaline electrolysis; electrolyser; electrolyzer; Electrolysis; hydrogen; gas purity; Measurements; high pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-09","","","","","",""

The industrialisation and globalisation of agriculture in Westland has prioritised economy and efficiency, creating issues of liveability and sustainability. The market-driven expansion of the agri-food industry has contributed to spatial competition in Westland and has created many spatial consequences, one of the most serious being the fact that according to surveys, areas around agri-food business parks have the lowest liveability scores in the region. These food-related issues are multi-faceted spatial matters that architects can address. The aim of this research is to better understand how the synergistic integration of food system processes with urban functions through architecture can create a more liveable and sustainable development of agri-food business parks in Westland. <br/><br/>First, key strategies towards integrating food systems with urban areas are identified through a theoretical exploration of case-study projects of past architects and planners. Following this exploration, the matters that architects can have an impact on in the food system are determined. Next, a spatial analysis of the selected agri-food business park is carried out to determine spatial factors that are contributing to low-liveability in the area. Missing spatial qualities that can restore liveability are then identified. Based on the result of the theoretical exploration and spatial analysis, a design framework is devised and synthesised in a set of spatial design tools that can be used to create an architectural intervention that can act as a catalyst and disrupt the problematic urban development around agri-food business parks in Westland. The spatial design tools are then interpreted in a design of a master plan and architectural proposal that reimagines a more liveable and sustainable future of Westland’s Honderdland agri-food business park in the town of Maasdijk.","Liveability; Agri-food; Synergy; Circularity; Sustainabilty; Business Park; Hybrid; Food; Research; Laboratory; Intergenerational; Housing; Immigration; Ecology; Food System; Urban design; Connectivity; Phasing; Temporary Use; Clusterisation; Network; Self-sufficiency; Mixed Use; District; Neighbourhood; Industrial; Westland; Symbiosis; Metabolism; Placemaking; Green-Blue; Node; Hub; Adaptability; Modularity; Green Space; Public Space; Honderdland; Maasdijk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","City of the Future","51.968339, 4.213622"

A potentially crucial ecosystem service is soil carbon (C) storage, as negative soil C balances have the potential to offset some of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions mitigating climate change. This research studied the soil C storage in the urban greenspaces of 2 districts in a typical Dutch city (The Hague districts’ City Centre and Scheveningen, 21 km2 , 37% greenspace) as a case study. The following research question was addressed: ‘What is the carbon storage potential of urban soils in The Hague?’ Soil samples were collected along a transect going from the suburban seaside towards the city centre of The Hague. The transect crossed a toposequence from sandier dune soils to peaty inland soils. Besides soil C densities, several soil-quality characteristics were measured namely dissolved organic C levels, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur levels, calcium carbonate, the water-holding capacity of the soil and the degradability of soil organic C.<br/><br/>Although urban soil can be highly disturbed or altered by anthropogenic activities, the high C densities in The Hague suggested that its potential to store C appeared unaffected. Along the transect, a mean C density of 88 t/ha, of which 82 t/ha was considered organic C, was detected, which was higher than the values currently assigned to urban soils in national C inventories. The urban soil C storage was dependent on the type of vegetation, urbanization extent and land ownership. The hypothesized links between land use and soil type were not apparent in this case study, suggesting that processes driving soil C storage are controlled by different factors.<br/><br/>The total soil C storage of the upper 30 cm of the greenspaces in The Hague was estimated at 18.8 kt of C. The use of high spatial resolution GIS data with a scale of 10 x 10 m enabled the inclusion of small patches in the total soil C storage of The Hague, which proved to be significant as the smaller urban greenspaces, which are typical for dense urban centres, contained similar soil C density as the larger urban greenspaces, such as urban forests.<br/><br/>Soil C storage in urban ecosystems is highly variable. How generalizable these results are across other Dutch cities requires further research. Moreover, to translate current soil C stocks to annual C fluxes further research is required. This study found that urban soil C stocks are underestimated, which potentially also is the case for urban soil sequestration rates that are currently applied in C modelling studies.","carbon; urban soil; soil carbon storage; carbon mineralization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Tang, Yuchen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Surface water tracing experiments help to identify the flow paths of in-stream mass transport. This provides useful information for developing mitigation measures for contamination, and thereby for solving environmental problems. Salts, fluorescent dyes and isotopes are commonly used tracer substances.<br/>However, it is well known these tracers have several drawbacks, including, for example, a finite number of unique tracers with similar transport properties, which limits the possibility to repeat an experiment due to system memory. Additionally, it is difficult to perform multi-tracer experiments, due to a lack of specificity. Lastly, the detection limit becomes an important constraint when using a tracer in larger water bodies or over longer travel distances, due to the vast dilution. The recently developed silica encapsulated synthetic DNA nanoparticle with a superparamagnetic core (SiDNAMag), can theoretically overcome the aforementioned limitations of existing tracers. SiDNAMag particles can be recovered from a sample by magnetic separation. This limits the influence of water quality on the qPCR analysis and provides an easy<br/>method for up-concentration of samples. However, with the presence of natural colloids, particulate matter,<br/>and river bed sediments, SiDNAMag particles are likely to undergo complex interaction processes in addition to<br/>dispersion and advection. Moreover, little is known about the possible SiDNAMag tracer sinks during transport.<br/>The focus of this work is to identify the transport behaviour of the SiDNAMag tracer in terms of breakthrough<br/>curves (BTC) and hydrodynamic dispersion as well as to study the interactions with the natural environment,<br/>specifically water quality and sediments. This was investigated by comparing SiDNAMag particles to NaCl,<br/>a widely used solute tracer, and silica microparticles. To do so, open channel injection experiments using<br/>SiDNAMag particles were performed in the laboratory in different river water types and with the presence of<br/>sediments at the channel bottom. The resulting BTCs were interpreted with a 1D advection and dispersion<br/>model with transient storage (OTIS), to determine the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient. Mass recovery<br/>was calculated by integrating the BTC.<br/>The results show that SiDNAMag particles have a reproducible but different transport behaviour than<br/>NaCl solutes. The SiDNAMag particles arrive, peak and return to background concentrations earlier than NaCl<br/>solutes. Furthermore, the interpretation of the data with a 1D advection and dispersionmodel showed that the<br/>dispersion coefficient for SiDNAMag was lower (0.34E-3m2/s – 0.88E-3m2/s) than that of NaCl (0.81E-3m2/s<br/>– 2.31E-3m2/s). Literature on solutes and colloids in the aquatic environment supports the possible difference<br/>in the transport behaviour of solutes and colloids. No relation between the transport behaviour and presence<br/>of bottom-sediments was found. The mass recoveries for SiDNAMag experiments were between 36% and<br/>131%, which could be partly explained by the bottom-sediments which detained between 0.16% and 16.94% of<br/>the SiDNAMag mass during the experiments. No relationship was found between the three natural water types<br/>and the observed mass losses. Additionally, the silica microparticle injection experiment showed the same BTC<br/>characteristics for silica microparticles as SiDNAMag though without mass loss, indicating mass loss occurred<br/>in the lab analysis. Due to the uncertainties in the lab analysis, no accuratemass recovery for the SiDNAMag<br/>tracer could be calculated. Furthermore, the observed scatter in the measurement data could be explained<br/>by the uncertainties in lab analysis as well as possible differences in transport behaviour of solutes and colloids.<br/>In conclusion, the results of the laboratory experiments with the SiDNAMag particle show that it is a<br/>promising hydrological tracer in surface water tracing experiments to trace colloids. Thereby it can be a<br/>valuable tool to gain information on the movement ofmicroparticles, like microplastics and pathogens, in the<br/>natural environment. The next step towards achieving this goal is performing a field experiment, for which<br/>upscaling of the SiDNAMag tracer production is required.","Tracer; surface water; microparticles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-09","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); van den Hoven, Jorg (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Orange Branding is a Dutch Brand Strategy and Design agency based in Amsterdam and operating in China (Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) since 2005. They have clients of various sizes in various industries, but in this project, we focused on companies interested in Cross-border e-commerce. When these businesses want to operate abroad, they will need a well-built brand. However, the value of branding has not yet been widely understood in China. Therefore, we ought to design a method to improve this understanding. Furthermore, research has shown that clients and brand designers need to work together to achieve the most optimal result. Accordingly, the research question answered in this thesis reads:<br/>How can we improve co-creation in the brand development process between Dutch designers and Chinese clients?<br/><br/>To answer the research question, we have analyzed existing branding methods: Cultural Branding, Co-creating Brand Meaning, and OB’s usual methods. Furthermore, we researched Chinese culture in general and, regarding branding, to determine how a European designer should collaborate with a Chinese client. Lastly, we examined different Artificial Intelligence (AI) types to use in a new Branding Method.<br/>What makes Cultural Branding unique is its story-based approach. Douglas Holt believes a brand has to offer a story, or myth, to its consumers. Consumers must want to use a brand’s products in order to live that story and build identity.<br/>Co-creating Brand meaning tells us that the company behind a brand is the source of inspiration for the Brand Identity. Knowing this, a designer should not exclude the client from the brand development process but involve him in. However, the client must not acquire too much creative freedom, so it is the designer’s job to balance involvement and creation. We argue that AI can provide tools with which a designer can achieve this balance. <br/>We conducted a pilot experiment to test the value of AI as a tool in brand development. Since the client inspires the Brand Identity, we wanted to see if we can use Machine Learning (a type of AI) to determine brand personalities. Therefore, we collected approximately 3500 images, labeled with one of Aaker’s Five Dimensions of Brand Personality: Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness. Therefore, we created the Orange Branding ‘Aaker Personality Prediction Algorithm’ or ‘OB-APPA’. APPA is an ML algorithm that was trained using these images and is able to predict the personality of an image. <br/>The OB team in China posed as imaginary clients and supplied new images for six fictional brands. Then, with the predictions from APPA, we manifested these predictions into visual brand styles. Next, the OB China team provided feedback on whether the created styles fit their intended fictional brand’s identity.<br/>After examining the feedback, we conclude that the use of APPA could be very beneficial for a design agency like OB. OB can benefit from using APPA as their clients often supply a design brief which leaves almost complete creative freedom. APPA could efficiently deduce the desired brand personality, which will narrow the design brief. Consequently, an additional step in APPA could also predict the associated Brand Archetype. Combining the improved APPA with generative branding tools like Tailor Brands, IDEO’s font map, Front brief, and Colour Thief can generate branding elements in a short amount of time and make the system usable from anywhere.","Branding; China; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Co-creation; Method design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These different users often have a designated section of the road to operate on. Road management, e.g., by municipalities, needs to take this sectioning into account, preferably in an efficient way. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds provide accurate and dense three-dimensional (3D) measurements of road scenes, showing strong mapping capabilities, although their massive data volume and lack of structure still bring difficulties in automatic processing. Methods for the automatic classification of road surface types are still largely lacking, and the existing methodology did not consider the potential of MLS point clouds yet. In recent years, point cloud understanding through deep neural networks has achieved breakthroughs. However, perceiving large-scale point clouds by deep learning depends on aggregating local features and progressive downsampling, to extract rich contextual information. As a consequence, low-level features that reveal details in point clouds may not be well preserved, possibly resulting in ambiguous delineation in point cloud classification. For road mapping, inaccurate classification of points on road boundaries hinders the generation of high-quality map products. Some existing deep learning methods propose to mitigate the fuzzy classification near boundaries, either by utilizing refinement for network predictions, or by indirectly modifying neighboring weights when summarizing local information. Approaches to achieving a satisfying overall performance, while maintaining accurate delineation, still need investigation. In this study, we propose a novel approach for road type classification of MLS point clouds in dense urban areas based on a deep neural network. We follow the main architecture of RandLA-Net, a point-wise neural network designed for large-scale point cloud processing. To alleviate the ambiguous delineation of point cloud classification, we propose two strategies. The first is to refine predictions of RandLA-Net by conditional random field. In the second strategy, we incorporate boundary constraints in the network by introducing a novel distance label for each road surface point to represent the distance to its closest boundary. The distance prediction task is combined with road type classification by adding another branch in RandLA-Net to formulate multi-task learning. Through experiments, we show that 3D point cloud semantic segmentation by deep learning is applicable for road type classification. Also, the multi-task learning strategy is verified to be more effective in improving the delineation performance. Using MLS point clouds acquired from 5 German cities (Hamburg, Delmenhorst, Bremerhaven, Hannover, and Oldenburg), we classify road points separately into different usages (sidewalk, cycling path, rail track, parking area, motorway, green area, and island without traffic) and materials (cobblestone, asphalt, plates, unpaved, and railway). When adopting Hannover and Oldenburg for testing, and the other three cities for training, we obtain a mean intersection over union of 46.1% for usage type and 52.0% for material type with the multi-task learning strategy and input features (x, y, z, R, G, B, intensity), outperforming the original RandLA-Net by approximately 4%. Moreover, from the point cloud classification results, we achieve lightweight polygon representations of road objects in different types through post-processing, which is demonstrated to perform better than an image semantic segmentation-based solution quantitatively and qualitatively.","Mobile Laser Scanning; Point Clouds; Road Type Classification; Deep Learning; Semantic Segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Radiotherapy is among the most popular modalities used for cancer treatment. Proton therapy is a promising kind of radiotherapy, which uses protons characteristic maximum dose deposition to a specific tissue depth, for precise tumor irradiation. However, in comparison to conventional photon radiotherapy, proton therapy is sensitive to more treatment uncertainties, like errors in proton range and geometrical errors. To account for these uncertainties robust optimization and robustness evaluation have been developed, to obtain and guarantee the robustness of the treatment plans against potential error. Robust optimization uses a fixed number of scenarios, for which the plan is optimized using the worst-case scenario. However, a proper weighting of the sampled scenarios, with the corresponding probabilities is missing using this approach. Probabilistic treatment planning can resolve this limitation, but it requires significant time resources. To evaluate the quality of a treatment plan, one must quantify the effect of errors in dose distributions. However, dose distributions calculations are time-consuming, therefore in this work, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used, as a dose meta-model, for fast and advanced dose analysis. This model uses a series of expansion in terms of polynomials, to evaluate the dose distribution when different errors occur. The first aim of this work was to improve the PCE construction speed and accuracy. To build the model a fixed number of dose scenarios from a dose engine are required. Currently, PCE dose meta-model is constructed using dose distributions with a 1% Monte Carlo (MC) noise level. The trade-off between the noise level (larger noise level allows a faster model) and the model's accuracy, was investigated. The accuracy for models built with larger noise levels (2 &amp; 3%) was compared, to conclude that the default value is the most efficient choice. Additionally, PCE built using the dose differences (between a scenario with no errors and a shifted scenario), was used to improve models' accuracy for complex anatomies. However, probably due to the larger impact of MC noise when dose differences (smaller dose input value) are considered, the PCE accuracy was not high as expected. The second aim of this work is to evaluate robustness and trade-offs made in treatment planning in a clinically robust neuro-oncological patient, and a clinically complex patient case. As mentioned, robust optimization does not consider the occurrence probability of uncertainties. Therefore the treatment plans might be over-conservative. Using PCE robustness evaluations, we compare treatment plans with different robustness settings. From the results, we concluded that a further reduction of the settings was possible for the clinically robust patient. Third, for five robust skull base patients, we investigated the trade-off between homogeneity of target dose, robustness, and dose to healthy tissue. PCE robustness evaluations were used for comparison of inhomogeneous (120% maximum target dose) and homogeneous (107% maximum target dose) treatment plans, for different robustness settings. From these planning approaches, no intrinsic difference in the degree of robustness was observed. However, the inhomogenous treatment plan resulted in more healthy tissue sparing overall, at the expense of homogeneity of the target dose. The final aim of this project is to use PCE robustness evaluations towards a clinically feasible iterative probabilistic treatment planning. We attempted to find a linear relationship between the optimal robustness settings which meet a probabilistic goal, and a scaling factor, using iterations of PCE robustness evaluations. For our method, the overall scaling factor ""α"" was used, which is based on the assumptions that the actual margin recipe is approximately linear, and that the real underlying robustness recipe is a scaled version of the photon therapy margin recipe (van Herk's formula). The conclusion was that for one iteration an overall linear scale factor allows for a substantial gain. However, linear modeling and one iteration do not suffice to find the overall robustness settings optimum.","PCE,; IMPT; protons; probabilistic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are characterized by their quantum limited ability to accurately detect single photons, with low jitter, high detection efficiency and low dark count rate. To achieve this, the detector is cooled to 2-3K, bringing the device in a superconductive state, and is then biased with a direct current (DC) close to its critical current. When a photon impinges the detector, the depairing of Cooper-pairs by the photon leads to local destruction of the superconductivity. The growth of this non-superconducting area, first across and then along the nanowire, leads to the development of a measurable resistance and hence the production of detection pulses. Increasing system detection efficiency (SDE) of detectors has been a long-term goal in the community. Recently ultrahigh efficiency detectors (SDE&gt;98%) have been demonstrated. It has also been shown that the wavelengths dependence of SDE, typically defined by a quarter wavelength cavity, is modulated by fiber-detector airgap (Fabry–Pérot). Measuring such modulations and finding the optimal operation wavelength manually is a time consuming and tedious process. In this thesis a setup for automatic measurement of SDE versus wavelength was developed and benchmarked. For the tested detector, efficiencies were found ranging between 22% and 95% in the wavelengths range between 1260nm and 1650nm. For the optical circuit using Single Mode (SM) fibers only, the automated SDE measurements were unreliable due to shifts in polarisation during measurements. Using PM fibers led to efficiencies very similar to the values measured manually.","SNSPD; Efficiency; Automatisation; Python; Quantum optics; Optics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Wind turbines are typically designed for an operational life of 20-25 years. The operation of the assets can be extended beyond their design life if structural components have sufficient reserves left. One approach is to monitor fatigue loads and compare these with design assumptions to determine the remaining useful lifetime of the assets. A major challenge is that sensors for measuring the stress history, such as strain gauges, only deliver local information. Monitoring of every hot spot is technically and financially not feasible due to cost and access restrictions. In addition, strain gauges only have a limited lifetime when compared to accelerometers. Several response estimation or extrapolation methods have been proposed in literature to tackle this problem. All of them are Kalman filter based methods, with the exception of the Modal Decomposition and Expansion Method. A new Kalman filter based method has been recently proposed in literature called Gaussian Process Latent Force Model. The aim of this work is to assess this new method with respect to existing ones both theoretically and numerically. Theoretically, the Kalman filter based methods always rely on white gaussian noise assumptions for the unknown loads, and the modal decomposition and expansion method disregard measurement imperfections. The new method improves upon these assumptions by providing a flexible stochastic definition for the unknown load, and by taking into account measurement imperfections. The numerical analysis is restricted to a comparison with respect to the modal decomposition and expansion method given the different theoretical backgrounds. The comparison is realised upon a simulation which illustrates and validates the methods, and upon a real-life onshore wind turbine equipped with accelerometers and strain gauges. Measured strains are compared with estimated strains. The accuracy of each method is quantified using the mean absolute error and by the correlation between measurement and estimation. The higher accuracy obtained shows that the new method is an improvement upon existing methods. This is further extended in the calculation of Damage Equivalent Loads. The result shows a relative error that, depending on operational conditions, ranges within 20-40[%] for the modal decomposition and expansion method and less than 10[%] for the new method. These results show that the novel Gaussian Process Latent Force Model method should be taken into account for response estimation when accuracy is relevant. Future works should aim on developing a mechanical model that better capture the real behaviour of the wind turbine, as the accuracy of the response estimation methods is mainly controlled by the validity of the underlying assumptions of the mechanical model. Furthermore, the strain estimations should be sought in the whole frequency range, this can be realised by including measurements that deliver this information: GPS sensors or inclinometers for example.","Wind Turbine; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Virtual sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In this thesis, a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial user study (n = 376) investigating the effect of biased Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) on UE in users with strong opinions on the topic is presented. Different search result ranking biases were used: a search result ranking biased to agree with the topic, one that disagrees with the topic and one that is indifferent towards the topic. One of two different topics is assigned to the user. The bias in the SERP is determined by the condition assigned to the user (i.e., mitigate, control or reinforce) and the viewpoint of the user towards the topic (i.e., agree or disagree). Furthermore, one out of three queries is presented at the top of the SERP (i.e., a query that agrees, disagrees or is impartial with the topic). It was found that neither mitigating nor reinforcing bias through the SERP affected UE. The exploratory analysis suggests that confirmation bias did not guide the results clicked by the users. Users were not refrained from clicking search results that do not align with their viewpoint on the topic. Instead, the exploratory analysis suggests that results are clicked based on their position (position bias), regardless of whether bias of the user is mitigated or reinforced.","web search; search engine; bias; User engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The value of renewable energy systems is their ability to generate electricity with reduced environmental impacts, most crucially being the Global Warming Potential. In this project, it is assessed what the impacts of a potential Multi-Megawatt AWE system would be. Firstly to determine where its impact hot-spots are located and secondly to assess how this new technology would compare to conventional wind energy systems operating in the same farm. The location of the farm is included as a sensitivity parameter to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both systems for operation in various locations under different environmental conditions. The technologies were assessed and compared using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The LCA is used to assess the systems for their Global Warming Potentials (GWP) and their Cumulative Energy Demands (CED). The CED is subsequently also used to determine the Energy Payback Time (EPBT) and the Energy Return of Investment (EROI) of both systems. The assessment of the impacts was performed on models that first had to be designed. The many unknowns and variables in both designs meant that modelling accounted for a large fraction of the project. The AWE system is modelled as a Ground-Gen, Rigid-Wing system based on the design of Ampyx Power. The HAWT system is designed to represent an accurate comparison model for the AWE system. It is fully based on various literature sources, primarily on optimisations of the NREL 5MW. It was found that the impacts of the HAWT system greatly depends on environmental conditions at the location for which it is designed. The AWE system does however only minimally depend on the environmental conditions. Thereby, it can be evaluated where AWE would have the largest advantage over HAWT technology and where HAWT technology may be better. The project is carried out in collaboration with Airborne Wind Europe and Ampyx Power. Data was intended to come from Ampyx Power. However, the project started too early into delayed feasibility studies which limited the availability of design data and even concept plans. The report therefore presents the impacts of a potential future 5 MW system. Modelled to the best ability at this time, with an hydraulic drivetrain and a hub-less drum design. Additional focus is placed on the availability of improvement potentials and assessment of design variables. Thereby aiming to further improve general sustainable knowledge within the AWE sector. The AWE system is found to use significantly less materials and to produce electricity at notably lower impacts compared to the HAWT system. AWE is found to be most advantageous for operation at unfavourable environmental conditions, where the wind speed is low, and the HAWT system requires a large hub-height. The Land and Launch Apparatus (LLA) and the Power Generation Apparatus (PGA) subsystems are found to be the largest impact contributors within the AWE system. The largest impact component is found to be the hydraulic accumulator system in the PGA, primarily due to its large mass. Its high impacts are closely followed by the light weight tether and aircraft subsystems that require materials with high specific impacts.","Airborne Wind Energy; Life cycle assessment; Sustainabilty; global warming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Today Beirut relies heavily on its port, which has been conceived from the sea like its neighbouring landfills as the commodification of nature, as the city performs futile grasps to stabilise the recessive economy. Such complexity of issues drives the key thematic of this research; an architectural manifesto to inhabit these ruins, the pollution our own making, in the context of the climate crisis. <br/><br/>In my theory paper, the commodification of nature has shown the theoretical need for post-industrial landscape re-use. The research has taken my project through the need for circularity within port cities as a way to create a post-growth economy. This research looks at tangible sources of pollution in cities as well as the socio-economic context of Beirut. My position is that the pollution of Beirut is a symptom of the socio-economic failings which occur along the timeline shown in this research. <br/><br/>The findings show there is a need to re-conceptualise its position in areas like Beirut Port District of which architects have a role in playing. The statement of intent embraces this need to harness the waste we ourselves have created, most importantly to frame an alternative interface between pollution and inhabitation, between waste and city, in symbiosis. <br/><br/>The resulting project encompasses both a landscape approach and a small built proposal that sits in the polluted landscape of the Bourj Hammound landfill in Beirut. The proposal acts as a symbiotic response between waste and city, to form a new settlement principle and a catalyst that aims to breathe new life into the forgotten and contested land and history upon which it sits. <br","landfill; pollution; circularity; sustainability; beirut; borders and territories","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

It resigns to reality and instead attempts to imagine another. <br/><br/>Cottonopolis gives form to the insidious and pervasive nature of China’s monopoly within the context of the global cotton industry and conceptualises the process in a single narrative told through architecture.

However, all the elements of the narrative presented in the project to some degree exist in the context of Xinjiang. The ridiculousness and darkness of the project exists simply because it is an exaggerated reflection of reality. In short, it illustrates the duality of discourse which currently surrounds the cotton industry in Xinjiang.

(mentor); Hendriks, B.H.W. (graduation committee); de Vries, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Glioblastoma multiforme tumors (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive brain tumor type and have a very low survival rate. In order to improve the patient’s outcome for a patient suffering from GBM the production of brain phantoms can be of great help. A brain phantom can be used for multiple purposes, such as neurological planning, training and for testing new medical devices. Nevertheless, no brain phantom has been created with realistic stiffness yet. Investigating the stiffness of the brain is challenging, due to the complexity of the brain and for not being able to touch it in person. However, through a relatively new technology called magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), it is possible to examine the stiffness of the brain. Hence, the<br/>objective for this thesis was to develop a brain phantom with a GBM tumor with similar stiffness compared to the biological human brain and tumor tissue.<br/><br/>In the literatureMRE data can be found on the complex shear modulus of the brain and tumors, which can be converted to an indicative Young’s modulus (E*). The indicative Young’s modulus will be used as a guideline for the desired stiffness needed for the production of a brain phantom. First various polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) samples were made and a compression test was carried out to derive the Young’s modulus (E). By comparing E with E* , it can be seen which PVA sample most resembles the brain and tumor tissue. Thereafter, the head phantom is created, which consists of 3 different production processes; production of the mould, production of the skull and production of the brain phantom. Firstly, the moulds for the brain phantom and tumor are 3D printed using polylactic acid (PLA). The skull phantom is derived from a patient specific CT scan, and is 3D printed with PLA. The brain phantom itself is made of 4,8 wt% PVA and 2 freeze-thaw (FT) cycles, and the tumor phantom is made of 5,2 wt% PVA and 1 FT cycle. The mass fractions and FT cycles have the closest stiffness compared to real brain and tumor tissue and were therefore selected. Within the brain phantom a hollow space is created where the tumor can be placed in. For a parallel project of the TU Delft and Utrecht University a brain phantom was required. For this specific case a brain phantom was produced with barium sulfate (BaSO4), which functions as a contrast additive for CT and MRI. Therefore, the second brain phantom<br/>was made of 4,8 wt% PVA, 1 wt% BaSO4 and 2 FT cycles. The tumor phantom with BaSO4 failed and therefore the first tumor without BaSO4 was used for this use case. An experiment was carried out where a HoMS substance was injected into the tumor phantom. During the experiment 9 CT scans and 2 MRI scans were carried out. Due to the MRI and CT scans it could be investigated whether the tumor was in place and<br/>whether the brain phantom was visible in the CT and MRI. After the use case one more mechanical test was carried out consisting of PVA samples with BaSO4 to examine whether BaSO4 has an effect on the stiffness of the phantom.<br/><br/>The results of the mechanical test led to a desired mass fraction and FT cycle that can represent the brain and tumor phantom. These were immediately used for the production of the brain and tumor phantom. The Young’s modulus of the brain phantom (E = 8,9 kPa) is a little stiffer compared to the actual brain tissue (E* =<br/>9,57 kPa). The Young’s modulus of the tumor phantom (E = 5,8 kPa) is softer compared to the GBM tissue (E* = 4,93 kPa). However, adding BaSO4 to the PVA solution changed the stiffness of the PVA samples, has had an effect on the compactness of the samples, and the BaSO4 did not dissolve properly. In the results of the CT and MRI scans it was found that the BaSO4 was only visible in the inferior part of the brain. In addition, the brain and tumor phantom were clearly visible in theMRI and CT scans. It is therefore not recommended to use BaSO4 for future research. Furthermore, the CT scan showed that the tumor phantom was well surrounded<br/>by the brain phantom and stayed in place even when the tumor was inserted by a cannula. The results show that a brain phantom with a tumor phantom can be produced. However, some improvements to the design of the mould are needed, because the mould was leaking, which subsequently led to an anatomically incorrect brain phantom.<br/><br/>This thesis project leads to the following conclusion; it is possible to produce a brain phantom with a GBM tumor phantom with comparable stiffness to the actual brain and GBM tissue. However, it can not be concluded that the various stiffness’s are exactly the same as the actual brain and GBM tissue, but it is close to the values found in the literature.","Brain; Tumor; Phantom; Glioblastoma Multiforme; stiffness; MRE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-08","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","L-AFP is able to place composite tapes in very precise directions, thereby allowing tailored stiffness designs. The laser is used to heat the thermoplastic matrix material to temperatures above its melting point. CF/PEEK is a popular choice for aerospace grade structures due to the high structural performance and high glass transition and melting temperatures. Current L-AFP research is driven by the desire to produce OOA laminates with a performance comparable to autoclave level. This will remove manual, labor intensive, and energy consuming steps, leaving a repeatable and automated process that is more predictable. A key phase for the performance of a laminate during L-AFP is the development of intimate contact. Recent research showed the effects of thermal deconsolidation due to rapid laser heating and questioned the current practice of characterizing the surface of the composite tape material for the intimate contact development models: instead of characterizing the pristine tape surface, the laser deconsolidated surface should be characterized. Additionally, another dominant physical mechanism, driving the intimate contact development was proposed based on the observations of thermal deconsolidation. These ideas are novel and require more extensive understanding of what thermal deconsolidation due to rapid laser heating is, how it affects intimate contact development. The effects of rapid laser deconsolidation were studied by performing (1) a rapid laser deconsolidation experiment where CF/PEEK samples were prepared and (2) an intimate contact development experiment where the specimens were compressed under constant pressure while being subjected to a temperature profile. Three degrees of deconsolidation were manufactured with the laser set-up: (1) zero deconsolidation by using the as-received tape directly as specimens, (2) slightly laser deconsolidated tapes which experienced maximum temperatures between the glass transition and melting region, and (3) highly laser deconsolidated tapes that experienced temperatures above the melting point. All samples were characterized on void content, roughness, and waviness; all of which significantly increased which showed that the state of the tape right before the nip-point during L-AFP is significantly different than the pristine state of the CF/PEEK tape. The intimate contact development experiment was carried out with pressure levels of 10, 50, 100, and 300 kPa reaching maximum temperatures of 363°C. Decreasing the degree of deconsolidation or increasing the pressure resulted in better consolidation. At 10 kPa, most of the characterization showed very little difference from a pristine tape, but a significant amount of DEIC was developed with 36% for the highly laser deconsolidated tape to 46% for the as-received degree of deconsolidation. At the highest pressure of 300 kPa, no significant difference between the degrees of deconsolidation was observed as the average DEIC values are between 85 to 87%. Additional intimate contact development temperature settings below melt showed that no intimate contact was developed below the melting temperature. During the glass transition, a significant compaction occurred which eliminated most of the void content. Between the glass transition and melting temperature, however, void content, thickness, and roughness all remained constant. At the melting point, a second thickness compaction occurred together with the development of DEIC and decrease of roughness which appeared to also relates with resin percolation.","Composite Material; peek; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic; VCSEL; L-AFP; Intimate contact development; degree of effective intimate contact; rapid laser deconsolidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As part of the Deltaplan, municipalities have been asked to perform a heat risk assessment through standardised outdoor thermal comfort maps, formulated in terms of the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). The heat risk assessment has increased awareness of urban heat related issues amongst municipalities, and sparked interest in heat-proof (re)development of urban areas. However, appropriate tools for outdoor thermal comfort assessment in the early stage of urban design are currently not available, as established PET simulation tools come at large computational cost. In response to the absence of appropriate outdoor thermal comfort design tools, this thesis proposes a Grasshopper-based PET simulation tool with an adequate balance between time-efficiency and sufficient accuracy for the early design stage. Additionally, a study into the heat mitigation efficiency of varying Height-to-Width ratio (H/W ratio), street orientation and facade albedo for extreme heat events in the Netherlands provides global rules of thumb for heat-proof urban design.<br/><br/>Through literature review, conditions for appropriate determination of four meteorological input parameters for PET calculation (urban air temperature, mean radiant temperature, urban relative humidity and urban wind speed) have been determined, which have been used to construct the PET simulation model. The PET model has been validated to be sufficiently accurate through both literature and sense-checks and shows a considerable improved time-efficiency in comparison with established simulation tools such as ENVI-met. The model is thus considered suitable for application in the early design stage. Application of the model is limited to (1) cities in Western-Europe, (2) situations of low wind speed and (3) the months of April to September.<br/><br/>Because of its rather quick computation time, the Grasshopper PET simulation model has been used to formulate basic rules-of-thumb for heat proof design through a study into the effects of varying H/W ratio, street orientation and facade albedo. The study has been performed for a representative urban canyon in the Netherlands for an analysis period from 12.00 – 18.00 on an above average warm summer day. Study results show decreased spatially and temporally averaged PET in the urban canyon for increasing H/W ratio. Considering street orientation, highest average PET occurs for streets oriented towards the South-East (SE) and lowest average PET occurs for streets oriented towards the North-East (NE). Varying H/W appears to be the most effective strategy for heat mitigation with a heat mitigation potential of up to 5.6 \degree C, closely followed by varying street orientation with a heat mitigation potential of up to 4.7 \degree C. Default settings for street orientation affect the effectiveness of varying H/W ratio and vice versa: Varying H/W ratio is considered most effective for SE street orientations (heat mitigation potential of up to 5.6 \degree C) and least effective for NE street orientations (heat mitigation potential of up to 3.9 \degree C). Varying street orientation is considered most effective for larger H/W ratios (heat mitigation potential of up to 4.7 \degree C for H/W ratio 1.0) and least effective for smaller H/W ratios (heat mitigation potential of up to 3.0 \degree C for H/W ratio 0.5). From the study results, no firm conclusions can be drawn with regards to the effectiveness of varying between low albedo facades (albedo = 0.3, untreated facades) and high albedo facades (albedo = 0.8, white-painted facades): The results appear to be highly dependent on the number of ambient bounces (ab) of reflected shortwave radiation considered in mean radiant temperature calculation. Depending on the considered number of bounces, either low albedo facades (ab = 2) or high albedo facades (ab = 4) result in lower average PET in the urban canyon. At the time of writing, it is uncertain which number of ambient bounces should be considered realistic for calculation. For both considered number of ambient bounces, however, study results show that the heat mitigation potential of facade albedo is significantly lower than that of H/W ratio and street orientation.<br/><br/>For the considered urban canyon, a combination of H/W ratio 1.0 and SE street orientation results in the lowest average PET (approximately 38 \degree C), whereas a combination of H/W ratio 0.5 and NE street orientation results in highest average PET (approximately 47 \degree C). Dependent on the number of ambient bounces considered, either low- or high albedo facades result in highest average PET. However, the contribution of façade albedo on the mentioned PET values is limited (up to $\pm$ 1 \degree C). An exploration into the effects of ground- and façade material on the obtained average PET results suggests that varying ground- and façade material moderately affects average PET results. Further research is needed to quantify the exact effect of varying ground- and facade material on PET.<br/><br/>For future research, it is additionally recommended to perform a more elaborated validation with field measurements. The focus of a validation study should be on calculation of mean radiant temperature, as the calculation method implemented in the PET model is currently a draft version. Other interesting topics for future research are the implementation of vegetation in the PET model, and improvement of the wind speed calculation for more accurate wind speed modelling.","PET; Outdoor thermal comfort; Heat mitigation; Grasshopper; Parametric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The result will be a trade market for low-carbon hydrogen where the trade routes will be determined by natural, technical, cost and geopolitical factors. However, to transport or store hydrogen, it must be compressed, liquefied or attached to a carrier due to its low energy density per unit volume. The challenge of this is that the transport of hydrogen is expensive and still at an exploratory stage. More research is needed into the most cost-effective opportunities for the emerging hydrogen transport supply chains. The main objective of this research is to develop a method that provides insight into the effects of hydrogen supply chain configurations on the cost price of hydrogen at the end-use location. The method should provide a better understanding of the influence of different distances and required volumes on the supply chain structure and on the type of hydrogen transport. In addition, by connecting supply chains, it should become clear how the interaction of supply chains affects the cost and throughput. Eventually, it is concluded that if the overseas distance is made variable, DBT will be the most economical option for shorter oversea distances and that for longer oversea distances MCH and ammonia will be the most cost-effective options. This tipping point is around 3500 - 4500 nm (6500 - 8400 km), depending on the volume of the supply chain, the distance to the end user and whether the supply chain configuration is centralized or decentralized. The centralized option will be more cost effective than the decentralized option for all the carriers. It can also be concluded that the cost price of each carrier will approach a some what constant value at large supply chain volumes. From the sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that the eventual cost price is very sensitive to the WACC and to the price at which the hydrogen is purchased in the export country.

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This master thesis report is the result of a six-month-long graduation project for the Design for Interaction master track at the TU Delft. The goal of this project is to improve the interaction between teenage girls and sexualisation on social media. It does so by generating awareness and empowering them to avoid negative influences that affect them on a personal level.<br/><br/>Teenagers grow up surrounded by technology. They live by social media, an environment in which they are constantly exposed to sexualised content and behaviours. Sexualisation occurs when a person’s value comes only from their sexual appeal or behaviour, to the exclusion of other characteristics. Exposure to big amounts of sexualised content and reactions online influences teenagers. They reproduce such behaviours, unconsciously post content that can be sexualised, and learn to believe sexualising is the norm. They are also not capable nor experienced to deal with the consequences of their content being sexualised. <br/>Therefore, I identified an opportunity to design an intervention that proposes a solution to those issues. <br/><br/>The Sexualisation Dialogue is a program consisting of an educational plan, the Learning Journey, and two tools to educate and empower teenage girls in their interactions with sexualisation on social media. The Learning Journey proposes weekly and monthly sessions for secondary school students, where they reflect and discuss sexualisation, sexualised contents and reactions, posting content, feeling empowered, and other topics. Through exercises teenagers learn to be aware and reflective when interacting with social media content. The two tools, the Awareness Sticker and Power-App, help the teens apply the learned lessons in practice. The Awareness Sticker, placed on the back of their phones, prompts a reflection moment at the time of sharing content, to think about one’s reasons for posting and how people could react. The Power-App promotes the use of stickers and hashtags to feel empowered by communicating how they feel about themselves and the content they post. <br/>The design was field tested with twelve teenage girls, and evaluated with two educators. The Sexualisation Dialogue shows promise to generate awareness about sexualisation among teens, to inspire a reflective attitude in their interactions with social media and to help them feel empowered and in control. Although further testing is required to evaluate and completely detail all aspects of the design, it shows potential to fulfil the design goal. The Learning Journey should be evaluated in its entirety and the two tools fully developed and tested to assess their effect over an extended period of time.<br/><br/>This project followed a human- and society-focus. I arrived at the final design after multiple rounds of field research and design activities including a field study with the target group, contextmapping sessions and evaluations with experts. The domain of this project is complex, and involving multiple stakeholders has made the process richer and the insights more comprehensive. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the knowledge gained throughout the project, and the results obtained from the field test indicate that The Sexualisation Dialogue is a good intervention to tackle the issues of social media sexualisation. After following the final recommendations and evaluating the remaining elements of the design, The Sexualisation Dialogue should be ready to be implemented into the context successfully.<br/><br","sexualisation; social media; teenagers; Empower teenagers; Awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aircraft efficiency has over the last decades increasingly improved by a large-scale usage of lightweight composite materials in high aspect ratio airframes. A tedious property of this advancement is that the increased structural flexibility produces unfavourable interactions between aerodynamics and structural dynamics. Existing literature has already shown the advantages of active feedback control to alleviate these adverse coupling effects. However, limited attention has been paid to the practical implementation of these flight control systems. This thesis, therefore, presents a robust control synthesis method for obtaining a real-time implementable flight control system for a high aspect ratio and flexible aircraft.<br/><br/>The presented controller synthesis method combines techniques from Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) with linear H∞-norm minimization to achieve simultaneous reference tracking performance and structural motion alleviation. With focusing on acquiring a real-time implementable flight controller, this work emphasizes the importance of taking hardware events such as sensor noise and time delays into account. The goal of this thesis is, therefore, threefold. Firstly, the limitation of INDI control regarding its applicability to flexible aircraft is addressed. Secondly, the INDI-H∞ synthesis formulation is derived and verified using simulations performed on a full-scale SB-10 glider model. Thirdly, the INDI controller is implemented on a real 1:3 scaled Diana-2 demonstrator to compare it against a similarly tuned PID controller in flight. Tracking accuracy and structural motion alleviation are tested on a doublet reference signal for pitch angle. The simulations show that the INDI-H∞ controller outperforms the conventional INDI both in responsiveness and robustness performance. While not affecting tracking accuracy, the INDI-H∞ controller can reduce the oscillations in pitch angle by 6.4% and the elevator control input by 5,9%. Furthermore, the INDI controller’s real-time capability is verified in a developed hardware-in-the-loop simulation and validated through conducted ground tests.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This paper studies a variation of the pickup and delivery formulation with time windows which is applied to air cargo export operations. The formulation is extended using three factors. 1) Pickup nodes are positioned at freight forwarders. Delivery nodes are located at ground handlers. Trucks can only visit one freight forwarder. 2) Dock capacity of the ground handlers is implemented in the model. Each dock can only be occupied by one truck at a time. 3) A multi stack loading approach is introduced for the trucks. To be consistent with practice, a Last-in First-out (LIFO) approach is considered when delivering shipments. Three model variants are introduced in this paper with respect to the LIFO strategy with different nuances. i) All LIFO constraints are relaxed. This is also referred to as the ‘no-LIFO’ (NL) model variant. ii) Only direct accessibility in the stacks is allowed. This is also referred to as the ‘strict-LIFO’ (SL) model variant. iii) Side-accessible unloading from an adjacent stack is also allowed. This is also referred to as the ‘side-accessible’ (SA) model variant. For each model variant, an exact model is presented and solved with the branch-and-bound approach. In addition to that, a meta-heuristic is developed that is based on a large neighborhood search to solve large data instances. Two objective functions are used. First of all, a cost-based objective function where a fixed penalty per truck is introduced. The second objective function is time-based, where only the total time duration of the routes of all trucks is minimized. It is concluded that the meta-heuristic model gives good results in terms of solution quality, computational time and stableness. It is also concluded that the SA model variant benefits over the SL model variant. The relative benefit depends on the data instance, capacity of a stack and the used objective function. For small data instances, a maximum benefit of 15.0% was observed for the SA model variant using the exact and meta-heuristic model. For larger data instances, a maximum benefit of 14.1% was observed using the meta-heuristic model. Given the current trends towards more shipment standardization in logistics and more collaboration among stakeholders, we believe many supply chains can potentially benefit from this scheduling model that incorporates both paradigms.","Ground handler; Freight forwarder; Dock assignment; Side-Access; ULD Packing; Pickup and Delivery problem; Vehicle routing and scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Previous literature has hinted at a relation between AI and Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, the latter being a textbook controller. AI and LQG are, however, defined with different settings in mind: LQG has access to inputs, whereas AI estimates these; LQG is optimal for White Gaussian Noise, whereas noise needs to be coloured for AI, in order to make derivatives. Therefore, a comparison is provided on two bases: the setting of LQG control; and the setting of AI. The optimal LQG controller is obtained for both settings, and AI is applied to both settings as well. When AI is reduced to the setting of LQG, an equivalent expression can be obtained by a proper choice of tuning parameters. This entails choosing a matrix such that the closed-loop is stable, which contrasts LQG control, which is always a stabilizing controller. When LQG is extended closer to the normal AI setting, we find that tuning of AI becomes harder for more complex systems, but that AI is mostly able to show optimal behaviour.","Active Inference; LQG control; Free Energy Principle; LTI State Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Systems and Control and Mechanical Engineering","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (graduation committee); Ferranti, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The concept of motion planning for a path following task is highly relevant. Having a comfortable reference motion is an advantage for automated vehicles, since this leads to more higher comfort for the passengers, in turn leading to higher adoption of ADAS. Defining a speed profile can be done in three different ways. First is a heuristics based methods, such as seen in IPG CarMaker's driver model. Secondly, line-of-sight based methods use the knowledge that blind corners can contain potential moving obstacles, leading to slower speeds to compensate for the braking distance. Finally, optimization based methods, such as laptime optimization, can be used by defining dynamics, constraints and a cost function to find the optimal motion for the given scenario. Comfort is primarily a function of acceleration and jerk. The RMS of the acceleration should be as low as possible for more comfort, while jerk lower than a determined value can be ignored from a comfort point of view. Finally, the scope and the contributions to the state of the art have been brought forward. A curvilinear approach in combination with a distance domain approach is utilized, since this allows for only the curvature of the road to be used as a reference. To generate a speed profile longitudinal point mass dynamics are utilized with the jerk as an input to the optimization. The maximum speed is determined beforehand using the curvature of the road and assuming steady-state cornering. For each point along the road a speed is now determined that should not be exceeded. Generating a speed profile using a linear optimization can not be done accurately. However, an assumption can be made that the vehicle takes the same time for each distance step, leading to an approximate solution. The non-linear optimization is able to overcome the shortcomings of the linear optimization, by including the time as a state in the solution. By incorporating the lateral dynamics in the EOM the predetermined maximum speed is no longer needed. The lateral dynamics are simplified by assuming the vehicle is always aligned with the reference, therefore ignoring yaw dynamics. Leading to a complete description of the longitudinal and lateral motion that can be solved using a non-linear optimization method. ACADO is used for the non-linear optimization. A benchmark is performed against a state of the art literature example based on a non-linear optimization method that is able to minimize motion sickness based on vibrations experienced by the passengers. The speed profile generation based on linear optimization is not able to reproduce the resulting speed profile as seen in the example. For the non-linear optimization method the speed profile obtained for the time optimal cost function is very close, however for the comfortable motion, the speed through the corners was still too high to be considered comfortable. By minimizing the acceleration and jerk the motion planning system including the lateral motion is able to accurately reproduce similar speed profiles for the three different cost functions of the example. In Simcenter Prescan a complex 10 degrees of freedom vehicle model containing both sprung and unsprung mass has been presented. A driver model, based on two PD controllers for longitudinal control and the Prescan built-in path follower for lateral control, has been introduced. The motion planning containing both lateral and longitudinal motion has been used to define a comfortable reference speed and trajectory. The simulation results show that the reference motion is comparable to the resulting motion, both in the longitudinal and the lateral direction. Indicating that the motion planning system produces accurate results. On the other hand it is also observed that the longitudinal control of the vehicle needs a more complex control scheme. For the lateral control a predictive control scheme is needed to be able to follow the road with low lateral offset.","Motion Planning; Optimization Algorithm; Automated Driving; Jerk Based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate impact from non-CO2 effects (NOx-emission, H2O-emission and contrails) depends on location and time of emission. Due to different design altitudes of the Flying-V and the A350, the impact from all effects have been assessed. At design conditions, the difference in climate impact is 1% in favor of the A350. The benefits of lower CO2- and NOx-emissions are trumped by increased impact from contrails. At identical conditions however, the Flying-V outperforms the A350 in both climate impact and fuel consumption. Also, lower altitudes showed substantially lower climate impact for both aircraft.

This thesis is devoted to conducting research on control strategies that optimally manage passive energy sources, e.g., natural ventilation and solar irradiance, in combination with an active energy source. The main objective is to develop a control strategy that is both on-line applicable and maximizes the performance of the building energy management system in terms of passive fraction of energy while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. Energy-saving model predictive control (MPC) structures have been extensively researched in the literature on building energy management systems. These studies usually focus on the energy distribution in multi-zoned buildings and rarely consider optimal control of a single or multiple passive energy sources. In addition, most studied building models are based on general buildings and are established by means of simulation software tools. A more experimental study has not yet been conducted on optimal energy management systems for a building that is maximized in harvesting passive energy. This work investigates five MPC strategies as a way to optimize the operations of four solar blinds, a thermal chimney, and an active energy source. In these strategies, linear and nonlinear MPC are considered in the forms of centralized and hierarchical architectures. White-box modeling and linearization methods are adopted to develop the required linear and nonlinear building models. Thereafter, the proposed modeling methodology is validated by using experimental data. The hierarchical MPC architecture that considers a hybrid structure with a linear MPC agent for solar blind operations, a nonlinear MPC tracker for ventilation, a linear Kalman filter, and separated state-update loops appears to be the best-performing strategy. This control structure is also applied in a case study, in which it is tested on experimental data from the real-case office building, which is controlled by a rule-based control structure. The results show that the developed control structure is able to outperform the rule-based controller in terms of minimizing energy consumption and maintaining thermal comfort.","White-box building modeling; MPC architectures; Passive energy sources; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto front; Linear MPC; Nonlinear MPC; Thermal chimney","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","The CONVERGE project","51.996646881654996, 4.377661330685225"

This instrument delivers near-daily 'snapshots' of the $\text{NO}_2$ concentration over the whole Earth. In this report, first, the spread of $\text{NO}_2$ pollution is modelled using a so called convection-diffusion equation. This equation is constructed from a convection term, which contributes to how much the wind transports matter, and a diffusion term which described the natural mixing of gases. Next, $\text{NO}_2$ pollution sources were reconstructed using the inverse of the time propagation of the model. Thus, known $\text{NO}_2$ concentrations are used to reconstruct temporal information. By finding out what is missing between data snapshots, sources can be reconstructed. The verification of the algorithm was first performed on artificial data, after which it was applied to experimental data. <br/><br/>The convection-diffusion equation that was used is a two dimensional equation, using longitude and latitude as Cartesian coordinates. The equation was solved by the method of lines, i.e. first a spatial discretisation was made using the Finite Volume Method, after which time integration methods were used to propagate the problem in time. In this report two time integration methods formed the basis for the time propagation and two source reconstruction algorithms. The algorithms take two $\text{NO}_2$ snapshots $\textbf{y}_n$ and $\textbf{y}_{n+m}$, with $m$ time steps in between. First the inverse form of Forward Euler is used, which performed well on artificial data on a small time scale. Afterwards the Backward Euler method is used to define the inverse problem of finding the source function. This algorithm performed well on artificial data with 24 hours between snapshots. The algorithms were found to be sensitive to noise and to be influenced greatly by the second $\text{NO}_2$ snapshot. After applying the algorithm to experimental data it was found that the algorithm is able to localise extended sources of emissions, but is not capable of pin-pointing individual point sources. In addition, sources with low emission rates were left undetected due to information being lost in the noise. Emission rates were not reconstructed accurately either, although it was able to find the main sources of emissions. The performance of the algorithm will take advantage from more frequent data. With this improvement, this method is a viable option for finding not only $\text{NO}_2$ sources, but can also be applied to other tropospheric gases.","NO2; convection-diffusion; source reconstruction; TROPOMI","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); ten Veldhuis, Marie-claire (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Torrential rain from tropical cyclones can have a devastating impact, causing loss of life and billions in damages. To better understand the risk faced by coastal communities, it is important to estimate how often a tropical cyclone could occur and how much rainfall it will produce. One way to do this is by analyzing past storms and building parametric models of rainfall rates during tropical cyclone events. While many parametric precipitation models –such as the Bader model– exist, their accuracy remains limited and many challenges still need to be overcome. The most important challenges are output overestimation and a poor representation of rainfall over land. Therefore, this thesis aims to reduce<br/>these biases by answering the following research question:<br/><br/>""How can the bias in the radial rainfall distributions of a tropical cyclone in Bader’s<br/>parametrized model be reduced and be used for reliable rainfall estimates both above land and the ocean?""<br/><br/>To answer this question, several new data sources were introduced from the TRMM/GPM satellites and Stage IV to improve the Bader model. While this original model only predicted precipitation based on maximum wind speed (vmax), the updated model also considers pressure deficit ΔP. The results suggest that ΔP can be a useful parameter to reduce bias and improve accuracy. However, it also<br/>leads to larger uncertainty ranges. Next, four precipitation profiles were proposed. A profile where precipitation is constant for low maximum precipitation values based on the predicted total rainfall (area under the graph) was selected for further exploration.<br/><br/>The new models are explored during a case study of Hurricane Florence. Both the ΔP and vmax based models produced satisfactory results, compared to the benchmark IPET model. Moreover, an alternative fit above land has been proposed, where the highest precipitation is simulated at the eye. The proposed land fit improved the median of the predictions based on both vmax and ΔP. The ΔP<br/>based model performed the best in the case study, however, no definitive conclusion could be reached upon which model is most suitable overall as more case studies would be required.<br/><br/>Finally the updated model has been compared to the original Bader model. The new data ensured better representation over land, the overestimation of precipitation was reduced, and the model was applied with more confidence outside of the training data set. Consequently, results showed an improvement<br/>on its prediction capabilities. As a concluding remark, this research project highlights the importance of having insightful data to enhance the decision-making and risk management of natural hazards: a model that accurately quantifies uncertainty and the risks associated with a TC, representing a valuable tool for better understanding flood risk. Nonetheless, there are still several ways to further improve the modeled profiles (e.g., by including more data, introducing asymmetry or adding temporal autocorrelation).","Tropical Cyclone; Parametric model; Precipitation; Data blending; Risk analysis; Hurricane Florence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34, -78"

In this research, we quantitatively compared the realised position of craniofacial PSIs with the planned position and we calculated the difference between the realised osteotomy and the planned osteotomy if a resection preceded the reconstruction. Methods: We retrospectively included patients who received a craniofacial polyetheretherketone (PEEK) PSI in the LUMC between February 2019 and January 2021 and had a postoperative CT scan available. Postoperative CT scans were aligned with preoperative CT scans, followed by segmentation of the postoperative PSI position and skull, on which the realised osteotomy was defined by an inner and outer curve. Translation and rotation between the realised PSI position and planned PSI position were calculated as well as the surface distance between the realised osteotomy curves and the planned osteotomy. Results: 19 patients were included, regarding cranial (n = 11) and orbital (n = 8) implants. The translation vector length ranged from 0.5 mm to 6.7 mm and rotational deviation ranged from 0.9° to 17.4°, both being higher for orbital implants than for cranial implants (U = 3.00, p = .000, U = 15.0, p = .016). 12 patients were included in the osteotomy analysis. Mean distance between realised and planned osteotomy was 1.4 mm (SD 1.6) for outer curves and 0.5 mm (SD 1.7) for inner curves. Absolute mean distances over the two curves ranged from 0.6 mm (SD 0.5) to 4.1 mm (SD 2.6), accurately reproducing the planned osteotomy in most cases. Conclusion: In this study, there was a large variation in positioning accuracy for craniofacial PSIs. Cranial implants, being in good agreement with the planned PSI positions, were positioned with higher accuracy than orbital implants. In general, realised osteotomies were larger than planned. Better use and positioning of surgical guides could increase the PSI positioning accuracy. Clinical and aesthetical outcomes need to be included in future studies.","Craniofacial; Patient-specific implant; Surgical guide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

Three main differential equations are investigated: the mass-spring equation, the heat equation and the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the continuity equation. Each of these equations are approached differently with the current methods, therefore these equations test the applicability of the newly proposed method on a general differential equation. The results of various experiments performed in this work show that the method is able to approximate to great precision the mass-spring equation as well as the heat equation. However, the method does not perform well on the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the continuity equation. The main advantage of this method is that meshes used by this method can often be very small compared to other approximation algorithms. When a slight decrease in performance is allowed, the method can be made completely mesh free. A huge drawback of the method is that there is no guarantee that the method will generate a reasonable approximation, for a given neural network configuration. This makes it necessary to look for a good configuration of the neural network. At this moment, this can only be done using trial and error and is therefore very time-consuming. Sometimes no good configuration is found at all. Another drawback is that the generated approximation does not satisfy the boundary and initial conditions. Multiple ways are proposed in this work to tackle this problem, but they introduce much more complexity and a performance decrease. The neural networks used in this work are generated using software called PyTorch, which comes with an automatic analytic differentiation tool. This part of PyTorch makes it possible to approximate differential equations using neural networks.","Neural networks; Differential equations; numerical method","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depending on what vertebrae segment the injury occurs, the patient will develop paraplegia or tetraplegia and have a complete or incomplete spinal cord injury. After sustaining a spinal cord injury, the patient must undergo rehabilitation. <br/><br/>For incomplete SCI patients, part of their rehabilitation is improving their mobility skills through gait training. To assess gait, the methods of the clinical eye and laboratory gait assessment are used. The starting goal of the project was to combine the quickness and easiness of conducting a gait assessment with the clinical eye with the objective data from a laboratory gait assessment into one system. This system consists of Xsens Awinda wireless motion trackers to collect the kinematic data and a user interface to view it. <br/><br/>User research was conducted in the form of questionnaires and focus groups. The research aimed to learn more about how physiotherapists and physicians within Rijndam Revalidatie currently assess gait, what features and parameters they would like in the user interface, and how they would prefer the selected parameters to be visualized (in numbers, graphs, or animations). Three physiotherapists and physicians were also interviewed to better understand the process incomplete SCI patients go through in gait rehabilitation and who is involved in each step. <br/><br/>From the results, a design direction and vision was created: “To develop an easy to use user interface that aids physicians and physiotherapists in selecting interventions for patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries in an objective and time efficient manner through intuitive data visualizations.” <br/><br/>Using design methods and tools, ideas for the data visualizations and the interface layout were formed, selected, and then made into concepts. The layout and visualizations concepts were evaluated through concept test sessions with physiotherapists and physicians. In the sessions, the interface layout was assessed in terms of usability and functionality. The data visualizations were evaluated based on if the participants, who had minimal pre-existing knowledge on gait analysis, could understand them. From the evaluation results, the final design of Gait Vision was created. <br/><br/>Gait Vision is an easy-to-use interface that allows physiotherapists and physicians to assess gait objectively and time-efficiently. It provides more accurate and objective information than can be obtained with the clinical eye, in a way that is more intuitive and comprehensible for clinicians with minimal gait assessment experience than laboratory gait assessment. <br/><br/>An interactive prototype of the final design was developed using Adobe XD. The interface prototype and the visualization concepts were evaluated through conducting individual user tests with seven physicians and physiotherapists. The interface and visualizations were tested with regard to usability, functionality, intuitiveness, and aesthetics. Overall positive feedback was received regarding the interface and visualizations. Testing was also conducted to compare gait assessment with the clinical eye versus with the interface. The interface was found to more objective than the clinical eye. <br/><br/>An implementation plan was developed to ensure Gait Vision survives in the long term. Future recommendations were also made to aid in the continuation of the development of Gait Vision.","Spinal Cord Injury; User interface design; Rehabilitation; Gait Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Biert, L. (graduation committee); Zwaginga, J.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The current path the marine industry is following, the goals of the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions, will not be met. The marine industry is mainly sailing on HFO and emits 2.2% of the global greenhouse gasses (GHG) by doing so, as well as 18-30% of NOx, 5-8% SOx and 11% particulate matter (PM). The IMO has even predicted that the emissions of GHG will increase between 50 and 250% if the shipping industry continues on this path. In order to reduce emissions, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has implemented ambitious goals for the next decades. However, the current policy measures sparks low ambition to meet this IMO GHG strategy. To be able to meet this goals, four options with different potential of reducing emissions are available, viz. efficient ship hull designs (20%), energy efficient engines (10-15%), more efficient propulsion (5-20%), clean technologies such as fuel cells and the use of alternative fuels (100%). Since the alternative fuel option has the largest potential in reducing emissions, a number of researched have looked into possible options for alternative fuel, such as LNG, LPG, methanol, biofuel, hydrogen and ammonia. This thesis looks into the potential of ammonia as an alternative fuel in the marine sector by 2030 by looking into the critical success factor for the fuel.<br/>This research takes all the aspects of the marine industry into account and researches the mutual interaction and relation between the aspects. The main aspects are the power generation options, the fuel availability including the port logistics, price of the fuel, operations (OPEX), impact on the vessel (CAPEX) and legislation and rules. These aspects have a number of inter-dependencies.<br/>The barrier related to the power generation option is the lack of availability of an engine that can run on ammonia. This engine needs to comply with legislation, which is not implemented yet. The barrier related to the fuel itself is the availability of the fuel in both volume and location. The production capacity is not yet at a level to fuel a significant part of the marine sector. The barrier related to the port are the logistics of the supplier and storage and handling of ammonia. Ammonia is a toxic substance and requires safety measures. These rules have not been implemented either. Closely related to the availability of the fuel is the price of the fuel. This is dependent on the demand of ammonia, which is currently zero for the marine sector. For the operational aspect is the lower energy density compared to conventional fuel an important barrier. For the same energy output, a greater volume of fuel is needed. This requires either extra stop overs during the voyage or a larger fuel tank, which could lead to loss of cargo space. The larger fuel tank has an impact on the design of the vessel, as well as the different storage and handling of ammonia compared to conventional fuels. Together with the legislation, this is an important barrier for the CAPEX of the vessel. This is a very important decision factor for the ship owner. Finally, most important barriers is the legislation. This aspect has the largest influence on all the other aspect and can promote other aspects to invest in ammonia and take steps in implementation. The regulation for sailing on ammonia are not yet in place. The IMO is responsible for the IGC and IGF code that regulate fluids as cargo and as fuel. The IMO has not started working on implementing ammonia as a fuel yet, since the demand of the fuel is currently low. This is however due to the regulations not yet being in place. Ship owners are reluctant to switch to another fuel when the risk of implementing the rules incorrectly are too large. The design requirements are not yet clear and it would be too costly to refit a vessel to the correct requirements for the early adaptors. Another aspect the regulations have large impact on are the engine options. Ammonia has a narrow flammability and is more difficult to ignite compared to conventional fuels. The design of the engine needs to comply with the regulations for safe ignition.","Ammonia; Alternative fuels; Marine industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Gelling, J.L. (mentor); de Leeuw, Vincent (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Crew transportation executed by vessels started as a result of the development of offshore platforms close to land. Due to the growing oil demand in combination with limited space for new installations in shallow water areas, these platforms have expanded to deepwater locations. To transport crew over these longer distances, helicopters are used nowadays. <br/><br/>Offshore crew transportation is driven by cost, safety, comfort, speed, workability, logistical solution, integrated solution, resilient solution and reputation. An assessment of these concludes that vessels can compete with helicopters for crew supply in the offshore market. Subsequently, an analysis to understand the performances of existing Crew Transfer Vessels competing with helicopters, results in the identification of a market gap: vessels that can operate in mild sea conditions and sail long distances at high speed.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a concept design for a Fast Crew Supplier (FCS) that fits the market gap while scoring better relative to helicopters on the combination of cost, safety, comfort, and speed.<br/><br/>The selection of the vessel design requirements is based on detailed characteristics of West Africa, the Mexican Gulf of Mexico and the Middle-East. Main design requirements for the concept design are the significant wave height between 1.5 and 2 meters, speed between 35 and 40 knots, personnel capacity between 80 and 150 and a range of 1200nm. Since the vessel has to transfer and transport personnel, it should perform well at zero and at high speed.<br/><br/>In addition to the above described criteria, the hull design and its dimensions have the most influence on the goal of the concept design, according to the elaborated House of Quality (HoQ). Hull-types considered for the design are the mono-hull, catamaran, trimaran, SWATH, hydrofoil, WIG and ACV. With the use of literature research, the seakeeping analysis program (SHIPMO) and costs calculated, the most attractive hull design relative to the boundary conditions has been defined the mono-hull. This was possible by processing the results into unitless measures using elements of the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)<br/><br/>Optimal dimensions are determined after an iterative process of the arrangements of the vessel in combination with stability characteristics. In this, the calculation and evaluation of the longitudinal centre of gravity (LCG) and the metacentric height (GM) have played a major role. The final length is 51m, and the final beam is 8.2m, which results in the concept design FCS 5108. According to the results of speed, range, significant wave height and cost, the FCS 5108 fits the market gap. <br/><br/>Comparing the FCS 5108 to a helicopter as crew transportation to an offshore field with three platforms in West Africa, the concept design is considered significantly more cost-effective, safer, more comfortable, and fast enough. To conclude, the FCS 5108 fits the market gap and scores better on the combination of the four design drivers relative to helicopters. For the further development of this concept design, it is recommended for Damen to continue in the Systems Engineering Approach and Design Spiral.","Ship Design; Fast Crew Supplier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The final product is a handbook that functions as a tool to create a dock for SeaBubbles, and it is developed for the company Advier. <br/>The process started with exploring the scope. The scope can be split up in three directions: the business direction in which the company Advier and its stakeholders is analysed. It becomes clear that Advier will give the handbook to a design agency that will create the actual dock design. The second direction is the analysis of the location. The network is situated in the area of Dordrecht, also known as Drechtsteden. The effect of the weather and tide on this area is analysed and the conclusion is drawn that the design of the dock must deal with changing water levels. The third direction focuses on the SeaBubble, in which the SeaBubble for seven passengers and twelve passengers are presented. The reservation system is mapped out and shows that the SeaBubble will define its route on the demand, in between it is possible that the SeaBubble will change its route. This has a large impact on the passenger journey. <br/>In the passenger journey, two types of passengers are presented: a prepared and an unprepared passenger. The prepared passenger has bought a ticket at home, while the unprepared passenger must buy a ticket at the dock. From this point in the process, the focus will be on the experience of the passenger. By creating a building that fulfils the needs of the passenger when the passenger is being guided, is waiting, and is boarding, the experience of the passenger will be good. <br/>The next part that is being analysed is the elements that is needed for guiding, waiting and boarding. For guiding, first the crowd flow is analysed. Based on this crowd flow, a general layout of the building is created for the location of ticket vending machines, waiting areas and potential one-way systems. Secondly, the needed information is analysed and tested in an online 3D environment. The location and the initial way of communication for several information elements is determined. <br/>For waiting, literature is analysed, and people are interviewed and observed. The passengers will find distraction on a smartphone or while enjoying the view, having a seat is preferred. <br/>For creating a comfortable boarding experience, two supports are needed in an area with even floor and no gaps. By getting inspired from the results, different configurations of docks were created. <br/>By determining the principles behind the configurations, the design choices are mapped out. These design choices are structured with a morphological map and explained in the handbook, which is the final product of this master thesis. After finalising the handbook, interviews were held with the client and an architect to evaluate the final product.","Seabubble; Integrated Product Design; Dock; Passengers; Experience; Information system; Guiding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Bachynski-Polic, E. (mentor); van der Male, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) (degree granting institution)","2021","The goal of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of optimizing the mooring line characteristics of a semi-taut (chain – polyester – chain) mooring system in combination with drag embedded anchors for a 12 MW wind turbine supported by a semi-submersible in deep water, based on static analysis of the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) condition. The optimization objective is mooring system material cost. The hypothesis is that the ULS condition is design-driving. It is expected that static analysis optimization reduces optimization time and cost significantly in comparison to a full dynamic optimization. Additionally, a framework for a 6 wind turbine shared mooring farm concept is presented and challenges encountered are discussed. A gradient-based sequential quadratic programming optimization algorithm is implemented. Using static analysis results for optimization requires a relation between dynamic and mean mooring line tension. The initially implemented relation was found to be incorrect and showed that the relation is design- and condition-dependent. The optimizer reduces the mooring system costs by reducing the diameter of the mooring line segments, while the lengths of the polyester segment, bottom chain segment and anchor radius are increased to satisfy the constraints. The bottom chain segment is governing in material line material costs. The Minimum Breaking Load (MBL), pretension and anchor uplift constraints are the most critical constraints. The top chain segment reaches the lower limit as it does not significantly affect the properties of the mooring system and other constraints. A total cost reduction of 48% with respect to the initial design and an estimated simulation time reduction of 40% with respect to a dynamic simulation were achieved. Fatigue Limit State (FLS) analysis of the optimized system showed that FLS is design driving, as failure in the chain segments would occur within 1 year. To implement optimization based on static analysis a FLS constraint is required. A full dynamic FLS analysis is time consuming and a single degree of freedom model to estimate fatigue damage in the frequency domain based on surge motion and separation in frequency was implemented. The model was tested on two mooring system designs and compared to the simulated dynamic FLS simulation results. The model underestimates the accumulated damage consistently across the two designs and the segments. It significantly underestimates the damage accumulated in conditions with a long wave periods, which excite the natural frequency in heave, and showed that heave and pitch motion must be included for a more accurate damage accumulation estimate. The shared mooring farm concept design is challenging due to the eccentric placement of the wind turbine. Additionally, the reduction in the number of anchor lines requires increased anchor line strength, causing a vertical force imbalance at the fairleads of the semi-submersible. This force imbalance requires a very robust finite element solution for use in optimization, which was not achieved. Adjustments of the positioning of each turbine, distribution of ballast or dynamic ballasting in the semi-submersible may be required to investigate the feasibility of the designed concept.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The work was carried out in two main streams: (A) supporting the FAS Public Policy team to redesign their involvement with policy-making matters; (B) disseminating designerly thinking and methods among the FAS workforce.<br/>The first stream started with several experiments that supported the redefinition of the problem. Then the focus turned to developing and testing methods to co-create an advocacy vision for the organisation. The second stream comprehends the development of workshops to introduce basic design ideas and give a hands-on experience on the design process. Both streams inspired interest in how design, especially its human-centredness nature, enhances FAS internal processes and supports delivering better services to the communities.<br/>This thesis presents the design practices that enhance the organisation’s work and the challenges of conducting a project remotely. Finally, the project gives recommendations to enable the adoption of design practices among the organisation workforce, such as making the departments boundaries more permeable, having management level support, and setting the environment and resources.<br/>In conclusion, the project contributed to the Public Policy team to view their work from a more integrated perspective with other departments. In addition, design practices such as creating artefacts and interactive meetings contributed to a positive work experience and collaboration. Following a non-linear process revealed to be more adaptable than traditional FAS project planning and the design human-centred nature was the most relatable to the organisation.<br/>Design practice involves, more than methods, tools and processes, finding ways to engage and propose action-oriented meetings that provoke critical questions. Finally, designers do not hold the solution to complex problems, such as sustainable development in the Amazon, but rather act as enablers in bringing diverse experts and people with lived experiences to build a more inclusive future.","Strategic Design; Design Practices; Design Thinking; Design for Non-profit organisations; Design for Organisational Change; Design for Policy-making; Design for Policy; Advocacy Vision; Brazilian Amazon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is believed that incorporating these data will contribute to more inclusive products and services as well as stimulate designers' creativity. As a result of the General Data Protection Regulation, users can now access their data and take the control of its usage. Under such circumstances, one can freely donate personal data for research purposes. Moreover, users have the opportunity to utilize their data more efficiently and to be aware of the importance of their privacy. <br/>This project is about exploring how an effective public data visualization could be designed to encourage more people to donate personal data at the very beginning of the data collection process, with a limit on the amount of data that may be manipulated. Students who are not experts in data visualization are the target audience. And the brightspace platform is chosen since it is the simplest and most convenient way for students to receive faculty notifications. As data visualization outcomes and people's willingness to donate data vary depending on the type of data, according to the research insights, this project focuses exclusively on public photo visualizations. A series of two design iterations was conducted in order to leverage the intrinsic motivation of students to donate photos of their home working environment to be used for research purposes. This project explores motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory, and proposes criteria and design directions for designing photo visualizations for behavior change purpose. <br/>In this study, the author identified five fundamental needs, including autonomy, competence, connectedness, purpose, and stimulation in order to evaluate data visualization's effects on the intimate data donation experience. Autonomy: Donors should feel free to choose the type of photos they want to donate. Their photos can also be used to express themselves creatively. Competence: Users should feel their photos are needed for the visualization. Relatedness: Users could feel connected with the visualization platform as they explored or interacted with it. Additionally, they believe they could build relationships by donating photos. Purpose: Users believe that donating their photos is meaningful to themselves or to researchers who require them. Stimulation: The way to ask for their donation is novel. And the entire experience with this visualization platform is enjoyable and interesting.<br/>Through the study of three types of photo visualization, it was discovered that whether the visualization is explanation dominant or exploration dominant has an impact on users' willingness and results in varying types of photo donations. Further, design directions for effective self-determined public photo visualization in terms of information, function, and visual form were synthesized as a starting point for more future data visualization projects to motivate autonomous data donation behavior.","Data donation; public photo visualization; self-determination theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The architecture of the incision is of great im-portance to the closure of the wound after the procedure and through that the risk for complications like hypotony and endophthalmitis. Current studies suggest that tri-planar incisions provide better sealing, however for a surgeon it is challenging to pro-duce the desired architecture easily and consistently.

The way people experience spaces determines the thickness of borders, and the thickness is the space of threshold. This architectural concept is inspired by the architectural elements – door which involves a character of connection and separation. The duality of interface challenges the usages and the status of surroundings at different moments. Thus, the research is about how do the thresholds as an architectural concept mediate the spatial properties and people’s movement? <br/><br/>In contemporary cities, there is a way that the constructed buildings allow possibilities to renovate and re-use instead of building a new one in an empty plot. The courtyards are surrounded by the standard apartments which were the results of economic-oriented policy in Russia. They represent self-built lifestyles in the center of the blocks. However, the city is bound to face the issue of demolition because of planning. The site of the project is one of the common blocks in Yekaterinburg which is a grid city with some generic spatial types. The pedestrian streets and the driveways follow the regular grids and affect the way of movement of people.<br/><br/>The manifesto of the city is called The Door City, it conveys the future city will be a city with some small territories which are closer to the living and walking dimension. The project aims to use a topological way, providing a relation of transformation which can be applied to the grids, the courtyards, and the apartments, in Yekaterinburg. Based on the relation, the small territories can be explored into various spatial programs. Thus, the walking routes are generated by the links of the distributed territories, and all involve the ambiance of a dual property. These spaces of the levels of publicness promote diversity, displaying the behaviors without a clear boundary; also function as a blank for the inhabitants to arrange their courtyard. The project concludes with a reflection and a new insight, giving the city another walking culture and transformation on the community scale.<br","Border; Courtyard; Movement of people; Threshold; Transformation; Route; Small Territory; urban block","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","","56.834915, 60.596428"

The historic city center of Amsterdam poses a challenge in this ambition, as it is home to numerous monumental buildings. Conservation is the starting point for the renovation of monumental buildings and consequently additional regulations are in place. Furthermore, each building is unique, thus renovation of monuments requires customization, making it more expensive and unattractive. Research has shown that due to restricted renovation possibilities, the indoor comfort and energy performance of monumental buildings are often below standard.<br/>This research aims to create an energy-neutral renovation for a monumental building in the oldest neighborhood of Amsterdam: the Burgwallen-Oude Zijde. Resulting in the following research question: “How can monumental buildings be renovated to become energy neutral and comfortable for the users, whilst preserving the monumental status?” A renovation design is made for a mixed-use monumental building and elaborated into a generic approach.<br/>Through careful analysis of the Oudezijds Voorburgwal 30, the chosen case study building, it was determined that a significant part of the building is not monumental. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the energy usage of the building is relatively high, and that the indoor comfort is currently not up to standard. To improve the energy performance and indoor comfort, a design is proposed in which different design measures are suggested. The design makes use of the potential of the neighborhood as it uses aquathermal heat (LT) from the canal in combination with heat pumps as basis for the heating of the building. The building is insulated using a combination of exterior and interior insulation, crack &amp; seam filling, and double-glazed windows. For the monumental parts of the building a wall heating system is proposed, in which the walls are slightly heated to minimize energy losses to the exterior (‘WarmBouwen’ concept’). Energy is produced on site using PV roof tiles on the South facing roofs and several other small design interventions are proposed. Evaluation of the proposed design reveals that none of the identified monumental elements are altered, the energy demand of the building is lowered by 73% and that the indoor comfort increases significantly.<br/>By following the proposed generic approach of (1) identifying the heritage values, (2) assessing the current performance of the building, (3) creating concept designs, (4) finalizing the design, and (5) evaluating the design, the remaining energy demand of the proposed design for the Oudezijds Voorburgwal 30 has not been reduced to zero and is thus not energy neutral. This is mostly due to restricted renovation possibilities and limited roof area for on-site energy production. The proposed design does make the Oudezijds Voorburgwal 30 BENG compliant: a step in the right direction, but for monumental buildings to become energy neutral a fairer middle ground between conservation and sustainability should be found. We should ask ourselves: how far should one go to preserve the past if it limits or damages our future?","Energy renovation; Indoor comfort; Monumental buildings; Green Light District; Burgwallen-Oude Zijde; Aquathermal energy; WarmBouwen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.37527084350586, 4.899653911590576"

Resilience-thinking has become a global popular perspective for the governance of urban systems, concerning the ability of communities to deal with urban challenges, that requires the development of the self-organizing capacity of informal actors such as residents. <br/>This study aims to determine how the extent to which formal and informal actors are resilient in interaction with one another can be determined. Therefore, a literature study was conducted that led to the development of the Institutional Resilience Analysis and Development (IRAD) framework, that is a modification of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework that is complemented with variables influencing decision-making processes that are extracted from the literature on social resilience and adaptive governance.<br/>The IRAD framework is applied to an exploratory case study with the Resilient Bospolder Tussendijken 2028 programme in the neighbourhood Bospolder-Tussendijken in Rotterdam as the research context. Hereby, desk research and semi-structured interviews were held with formal and informal actors to study interactions resulting from a conflict concerning the management of societal real estate in the neighborhood. <br/>The application of the developed IRAD framework thereby identified both enablers and barriers for resilient interactions between formal and informal actors. Access to social networks has been identified as an enabler for resilient actions, whereas the lack of trust of residents in the municipality, lack of communication between formal and informal actors and a lack of a political base for new insights have been identified as barriers to resilient actions.<br","Social resilience; Rotterdam; Adaptive governance; Resilient Botu2028; IAD framework; Resilient governance; Bospolder-Tussendijken; IRAD framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","","51.91390609741211,4.439889430999756"

The nature present in the estuary suffered a great impact due to urbanization, as a natural delta transformed into an industrialized river, mainly due to port activities. Various parties decided to collaborate in order to return the tidal nature in the Rhine Meuse estuary through constructing tidal parks. Although the idea of reintroducing tidal nature into an industrialized estuary seems promising, problems arise when the projects are being executed. Human interventions necessary to complete the design of the tidal parks often lead to undesired morphological changes. These either consisted of an excessive amount of cohesive sediment import, or hardly any import. Consequently, maintenance in form of dredging or nourishing activities is required. When introducing tidal nature, little maintenance is desired, both from a financial perspective and from an ecological perspective. The undesired morphological changes result from limited knowledge on the impact of human interventions on the hydro and morphodynamics in tidal parks. This research therefore primarily focuses on gaining new knowledge on the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics inside tidal parks and assessing the effect of different elements such as groynes and longitudinal walls on the latter. This is done through a case study, the Groene Poort, a collective name for the tidal parks located in the Nieuwe Waterweg.<br/><br/>A depth-averaged (2DH) Delft3D model is used to research the hydro and morphodynamics of the tidal park. A constant tidal forcing and a constant fresh water discharge are used as boundary conditions. The effects of wind, waves and density driven currents are neglected. The effects of changes in hydrodynamic forcing, including a morphological tide, a spring tide and a spring tide in combination with a surge on the morphodynamics are determined. This research showed that the tidal flow results in relatively small velocities inside the studied tidal park with mean velocities around 5 cm/s. The critical velocities for transport of noncohesive sediment transport are only reached at the west entrance of the studied tidal park. At this location the sediment deposits, further transport towards the river bank is not possible resulting from the magnitude of velocities. A spring tide is responsible for an increased import of noncohesive sediment at the river bank area.<br/><br/>This research provides a guide on the effect of relatively small adaptations in geometry which will enhance or decrease the natural processes of sedimentation and erosion in the tidal parks. Tables are included providing the important parameters both with respect to the hydro and morphodynamics of various adaptations in geometry. These tables can be used in future design and adaptations of already constructed tidal parks. However, the effect of the surrounding area including the location in the river greatly impact the hydrodynamics and morphological development of the tidal parks.<br","Tidal Park; Estuary; sediment transport; Groene Poort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Groene Poort","51.918204, 4.228469"

Migrations from the countryside and Afghanistan to Mashhad, and housing crisis have pushed many to settle in the literal margins of the city. However, their life is everything but settled: their existence can instead be characterized as a nomadic condition in which they are always on the go. Flexibility, informality and trajectories are essential to their survival within the precarious and marginal settlements. The marginal settlers have to manoeuvre between scarcities such as employment, food, water and sanitation. Those scarcities are constantly changing and thus the daily trajectories of the marginal settlers do so too. Moreover, marginal settlers live this way in areas that are marginalized in a multitude of senses: geographically, economically, politically, socially, architecturally and environmentally. Natural hazards, low employment, administrative borders, little education, poor quality housing, and an environment of waste and lack of waste management all contribute to the daily conditions of the marginal settler.<br/><br/>Very often, when similar poor conditions are faced by design, attention goes to the betterment of housing or creation of community centers. They are however striated or approaches, thinking from a city-point of view: to try to fit the<br/>marginal settlements within the organizations of the city. This project seeks for the opposite approach: <br/><br/>The project intents to improve the marginal state of Mashhad's marginal settlements whilst being focused on life in transit. The project addresses trajectories and intersections and intents to embrace, amplify and take inspiration from the nomadic lifestyle. Its use is intended to be of democratic and public nature, ready to be taken over and adapted by the marginal settlers themselves.<br/><br/>This approach can be more feasible than changing the lifestyle of a third of the city’s people. The design task is first to create social facilities that provide basic needs that are absent in the marginal settlements along the daily trajectories of marginal settlers and secondly an integration of those social facilities in a new waste management network, which creates employment and cleans the environment from waste upon which trajectories move. This integration draws people towards the site where they are made aware of the importance and benefits of waste recycling, and in return for waste receive services along their daily trajectories.","Trajectories; Marginal settlements; Mashhad; Recycling; Social facilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","36.31863318501295,59.63991785912958"

One of its predecessors, FlexiMold, consists of pins which the user moves manually after reading their position from the digital model of a surface (Asut and Meijer, 2016). The system, however innovative, lacks accuracy, to be realized as a design tool for freeform surfaces. The automation will provide with the precision and accuracy needed for a freeform surface to be produced, as well as reduce the time needed for the digital freeform to be casted onto the physical freeform. The designer is freed from the obligation to place the mold pins each time a minor change in the digital model occurs (Asut, Eigenraam and Christidi, 2018). The validity of the method is tested through the design of a timber gridshell example and its panel fabrication. This includes form finding, structural and cross-sectional study and freeform panelization. A 3x3pin small scale model of Re-De- Form that deforms according to the respective freeform digital model, has been built. Additionally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) associated with the manipulation of the surface ensures the clarity and intuitiveness of the method to the user. The final product combines physical and digital modelling into a fast, accurate, intuitive and reciprocal freeform design tool.","Flexible mold; FlexiMold; ReFlex; Adaptive mold; Gridshell; Panelization; Formwork; Computational Design; Parametric Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first do this on a sphere, using two tensor operators: the exterior derivative and the Hodge-star. We then extend these functions to vector functions in 3-dimensional Euclidian space and define a last type of vector function to form a complete basis for vector fields. We do this in such a manner that the vector spherical harmonics inherit some of the nice properties of the spherical harmonic functions with respect to rotations and rotational symmetric operators.","Coordinate free; Spherical harmonics; vector spherical harmonics; rotational symmetries","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

We will also give two application of representation theory of these two groups in physics: the spin and quark models. We begin with first discussing representation theory for finite groups to create intuition for representations. We will explain notions such as intertwining maps and complete reducibility and we will mention some application of representation theory of finite groups inquantum mechanics. Hereafter, we begin with representation theory for Lie groups and Lie algebras, especially the groups SO(3) and SU(2), as these groups will play an important role in the description of spin. One of the main results is that SU(2) is the universal cover of SO(3). Furthermore, we give a description of spin by means of representation theory of SO(3) and its Lie algebra so(3). We will show that half integer representations of the Lie algebra so(3) cannot be exponentiated to representations of the Lie group SO(3), but it can be exponentiated to its universal cover SU(2). Moreover, we study the irreducible representations of SO(3) inside the Hilbert space L<sub>2</sub>(R<sup>3</sup>). We will argue that one of the simplest quantum Hilbert spaces of a particle L<sub>2</sub>(R<sup>3</sup>), can be modified to the completion of the tensor product L<sub>2</sub>(R<sup>3</sup>) ⊗V, where, V is a finite dimensional Hilbert space that incorporates the internal degrees of freedom: spin. V carries an irreducible projective representation of SO(3). We will also discuss the addition of angular momentum of two particles in quantum mechanics. For this, we show how the tensor product of irreducible representations V and W of so(3) decomposes into SO(3) invariant subspaces of L2(R3). Hereafter, we will turn to representation theory of the Lie group SU(3) for setting up the mathematical framework for analysing the quark model. We will proof that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible representations of sl(3;C)and SU(3). We will also proof the theorem of the highest weight by which we can classify all the irreducible representations of SU(3) and sl(3;C) by their highest weight. We will also introduce the notion of the Weyl group and show that the Weyl group is a symmetry of weights of the finite dimensional representation of sl(3;C). Other properties of these representation, such as the dimension of the irreducible representations of sl(3;C) will be provided. Lastly, the quark model is discussed by means of representation theory of SU(3). We will show how this model can be used to classify two type of particles which also interact by means of the strong force: baryons and mesons. We show that we can classify the lightest mesons and baryons in so-called multiplets by the irreducible representations of SU(3). However, we will also introduce a modification of the strong force which further refines this model. A topic for further study would be how the symmetry group SU(3) describing Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) can be used for the description of mesons and baryons.","Representation Theory; Lie Algebra; Lie groups; Spin; Baryon; Quark","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

The urban population of Ethiopia is predicted to nearly triple in 25 years. The swiftness of urbanisation is resulting in extreme challenges. It causes, reinforced by climate change, that Addis Ababa is increasingly affected by flooding. The urban poor are forced to settle in the least desirable areas, such as areas around rivers which are most vulnerable to flooding. The rivers of Addis Ababa are polluted with all kinds of waste because of inadequate services. Around half the population has no water supply, forcing people to purchase water in shops. The urban poor cannot afford this and use the unsafe water from the rivers as a consequent. The Ethiopian government launched in 2019 the Addis Ababa Riverside project, or the Sheger beautifying project. It follows a series of ongoing beautification projects in the Global South. The project aims to clean the rivers and create public spaces, bicycle paths and walkways along the rivers. The project is criticised because it is no certainty that the rivers will not continue flooding and there is no proposition for all the waste that is currently discharged into the rivers. Rapid urbanisation in combination with poverty and the inability of the state and the market to provide affordable housing, cause that over 1 billion people reside in informal settlements. Addis Ababa can be seen as an example of this inability. Historical grown, informal neighbourhoods called sefers are located in the city centre. Over the last decade, sefers are challenged by the swift urbanisation of Addis Ababa with a resettlement program aiming to replace these low-income neighbourhoods into denser urban schemes affecting the social, economic and political tissue. This program, the Integrated Housing Development Programme (IHDP), was introduced by the government in 2005. The inhabitants of former kebele houses claim their houses get demolished without any compensation or alternative accommodation. Piassa is chosen as a project site, being currently challenged by demolition of the existing kebele housing. Having researched the location and its inhabitants, a housing system is designed with a combination of tenure systems for different income groups. These groups will live together in an inclusive, mixed-income environment in the inner-city of Addis Ababa.","Global Housing; Addis Ababa Living Lab; Inner-city redevelopment; Densification; Affordable housing; Dwelling; Inclusive; Mixed-income housing; Flooding; River conservation; Urban river corridor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","","9.032713, 38.757464"

Compared to classical parallel robots, such as the Delta robot, CDPRs have a lower inertia due to low cable masses. Therefore, they can perform high speed motions with a low power consumption. Additionally, the workspace of a CDPR is easily scalable as the cable lengths are hardly limited. Consequently, the CDPRs can potentially improve efficiency and reduce the cost of high speed pick and place operations, which are now often carried out by Delta robots. However, CDPRs have not yet been applied in the high speed pick and place industry. One of the reasons that CDPRs are not yet attractive for this industry is their limited orientation range. In pick and place applications it is often required to not only translate a product, but also reorient it about one axis for proper packaging. This motion is also known as a Schönflies motion. For full product reorientation, a rotation of 180 degrees is required, which can only be achieved with an additional axis on the moving platform. Several solutions for large rotations of CDPRs exist in literature, but none of them are designed, compared, modelled or tested for dynamic purposes. Therefore, this thesis proposes three concept designs of CDPRs that can perform a Schönflies motion, including a rotation of 180 degrees. These concept designs are compared with each other and on a state of the art Delta robot, based on their dynamic workspace. The dynamic workspace volume of each concept is optimized for their geometric parameters by the particle swarm algorithm, which showed that the concept that uses a cable loop to perform the rotation has the largest workspace for the smallest cable forces. Additionally, a prototype of this concept has been evaluated on a typical pick and place motion, which shows the feasibility of this concept. Nonetheless, stiffness should improve to reach the state of the art repeatability in future designs.","Cable driven parallel robot; Schönflies motion generation; Pick and Place task; Dynamic workspace optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Hence, the output will not be<br/>a single solution, but a Pareto front with multiple non-dominated solutions that range in duration and propellant consumption, such that the user can easily identify the one that better suits his/her particular mission requirements.<br/>The tool considers three types of arcs: direct transfers, manifold trajectories and flyby arcs which can be combined in any way to connect the departure and destination orbits. These can be defined as Keplerian orbits or CR3BP periodic solutions, including Lyapunov, Halo orbits or NRHOs. This is done in a very intuitive way thanks to the careful selection of design variables. Therefore the developed tool can be used by designers that do not have a large amount of experience solving trajectory optimization problems in the CR3BP.<br/>In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the tool, two specific transfers were optimized. In both cases, the Pareto front is obtained with the combination of optimal solutions that include direct transfers, and manifold and flyby arcs. First, a LEO to L2 Halo orbit with Az = 2000 km was selected to compare the results obtained by the software with those from literature. The tool not only obtained more results than the previous research, but the solutions found were also improved in terms of ΔV and time of flight. The second transfer was a GTO to lunar Gateway NRHO trajectory, which was chosen to show the applications of this study to problems of high scientific and industrial interest in present times, as well as to prove the versatility of the algorithm. Again, the results are better than the ones found in literature, if only by the number of different solutions that are obtained.

The Tensor Train (TT) decomposition provides an approach to representing data in highly compressed formats without loss of accuracy. By converting vectors and matrices in the TT format, the storage and computational requirements can be greatly reduced. In this thesis, we develop a Bayesian learning method in the TT format to solve large-scale LS-SVM problems, which involves the computation of a matrix inverse. This method allows us to include the information we know about the model parameters in the prior distribution. As a result, we are able to obtain a probability distribution of the parameters, which enables us to construct confidence levels of the predictions.

Although these methods show strong results on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons: abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al. Secondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations, in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets with no camera rotation.

For the purpose of this study, an ecological interface for the rerouting task, developed in a previous study, was visually augmented with the constraints guiding the behavior of an experimental path-planning algorithm. This was done in two different ways: a top-down and bottom-up approach. The top-down approach starts at the goal of the system and subsequently adds information related to the physical implications, while the bottom-up approach has the reversed order. The design was tested in a human-in-the-loop experiment with ten participants. Results show that higher levels of transparency significantly increased actual and perceived understanding of the agent’s decisions. Furthermore, the top-down approach performed significantly better in questions related to the strategy of automation, while the bottom-up approach was found more useful for making predictions about the agent’s rationale for making certain decisions. Future research should investigate how agent and domain transparency could be combined and should test situation awareness in addition to understanding of automation.

However when a buckling instability is present the structure contains a form of negative stiffness. Due to the observed tendency of I-beams subject to LTB to twist about their longitudinal axis it is suspected that such I-beams contain a form of negative rotational stiffness about their longitudinal axis. Rather than considering LTB as a failure mode for structures, this work aims to investigate the potential of cantilever I-beams subject to LTB having a reduced rotational stiffness about their longitudinal axis with minimal lateral deflection on demand by subjecting the beam to LTB. By minimising the lateral deflection the longitudinal twisting behaviour approaches the behaviour of a compliant rotational joint. The occurrence of negative rotational stiffness in the buckled state is verified and a parameter study is executed to evaluate the stiffness reduction and co-occurring lateral deflection by means of 1-dimensional finite element modelling. Finally an optimisation is performed to obtain a beam with minimal lateral deflection and a significant reduction in longitudinal rotational stiffness. The simulated behaviour is experimentally validated. The simulation and experiment showed that rotational stiffness can be significantly reduced through LTB. Additionally the experiment verified the significant reduction of lateral deflection for the optimised beam. Overall this work forms an initial step towards the use of reduced rotational stiffness of beams by exploiting lateral torsional buckling.","Lateral torsional buckling; variable stiffness; compliant beams; beam optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Without adequate treatment, vertebral fractures are often followed by subsequent fractures, leading to further invalidation and deterioration of health. Therefore, early detection of vertebral fractures is important so preventative treatment can be initiated.<br/><br/>Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) equipment is an imaging technique in which a lateral image of the spine is made. With vertebral morphometry, vertebral heights are measured and fractures are identified when vertebral height is lower than expected. However, vertebral morphometry is time and labor-intensive, and is subject to inter-operator variability. Automating VFA using Artificial Intelligence (AI) could help to overcome these limitations. We employed a co-development approach, aiming to create an AI-based tool to automatically perform vertebral morphometry on VFA images to identify vertebral fractures.<br/><br/>Firstly, we conducted a literature review to investigate the current use of AI in quantitative DXA imaging in a broad sense (Chapter 2). Besides VFA, other quantitative parameters describing bone macrogeometry and microgeometry can be extracted from DXA images. Incorporating these risk factors into multivariate prediction models could improve the identification of those at risk of fracture and help in clinical decision making. Although still in development, AI has been successfully applied in aid of fracture risk assessment, showing promising results.<br/><br/>In Chapter 3, the results of our reader study are described, evaluating VFA with manual vertebral morphometry as it is currently performed. This study served as a baseline measurement to quantify the effort needed to perform manual VFA and assess the potential value of automating VFA. The average annotation time per VFA image was 259 seconds. Although the intraclass correlation for vertebral height measurements between different readers was high, inter-observer agreement for fracture classification was only poor to moderate.<br/><br/>Together with our industry partner, we developed an AI-based software tool to perform vertebral morphometry. This tool is still in development, and we evaluated its current performance and potential impact in the study described in Chapter 4. Although its current standalone performance is suboptimal and shows room for improvement, this initial investigation showed that automated VFA has the potential to significantly reduce the required reader time.<br/><br/>Finally, in Chapter 5 we reflect on our user-centered co-development process and the next steps to bring our AI tool to market. We believe that collaboration between academic healthcare institutions and industry are essential for successful development of AI products.

Its final ends are places where allocated amenities considered as burdens can no longer be pushed further outwards. However, simultaneously, it is where Londoners take advantage of this negligence and escape the city to answer their own alternative needs and desires themselves. Together these actions result in an edge condition where we no longer recognize the city, but yet, it is the only place that confronts us with what the city really is. It is a place of both belonging and estrangement. This project explores an alternative approach to the current undirected piecemeal development that is taking place, by objectifying the conflict with London’s ambiguous edges. Thereby, the architecture of the edge becomes the physical encounter of the psycho- geographic condition, and aims to activate the heterogeneous zone through a more responsible way of building. It does not question the condition, nor takes a position in the ongoing debate about the future of it, but addresses its articulation through a series of fragmented interventions as part of an open-ended strategy.","Edge; Edge City; Urban Sprawl; Heterogeneous City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.618347"

The movie would be about culture - city life - and the people who are in it will be its social actors. the different identities of the social actors makes the film heterogeneous by nature.<br/>But there is an unbalance in this discourse and it is almost opaque due to the acceptance of it. The decorations, the forms and the infills of the urban texture are not in sync with the many communities that are present in the city. London is one of the most diverse cities in the world looking at its people and their backgrounds. Not even half of its users is British by origin. This number will probably become even less in the future due to the trend of urbanisation. If we look at the architecture and the urban texture of the city it doesn’t show an accurate representation of its users inhabiting the city.<br/>At the same time social cohesion of neighbourhoods are depriving due to segmentation and isolation of everyday life. The gap between rich and poor is increasing, activities become more and more digitized and short term population is rising.<br/>The determinative architecture stems mainly from the history of England and is part of its culture. that is a natural course of events and there is nothing wrong with that. However to obtain a better understanding of each other, both on an individual as an group level, it is important that people can relate oneself with someone else.

Through literature reviews, interviews with actors from the homeless sector, and observations and conversations conducted during voluntary shifts at a homeless shelter; this thesis analyses the pathways into and out of homelessness in Rotterdam, identifying the groups experiencing similar prejudice or treatment, and evaluating the means necessary to end their homelessness. This is compared against the existing services available across Rotterdam to understand the social support system as a whole, and the role architecture has and should have in helping the homeless. This thesis then identifies two groups: EU labour migrants and sofa-sleepers, as potentials for non-care based support as part of a symbiotic community structure, centred around a temporary, demountable, transitional housing scheme. A detailed building programme ensures activation of the ex-homeless and integration of the public through third spaces on the active ground floor plinth. The first floor houses the ex-homeless units which are derived through a process of self-build technologies and open building principles. The temporary city represents a reformed, more humanistic image of homelessness; one that challenges the ‘us’ versus ‘them’ dichotomy, because it illustrates the great lengths we’d all go through to create a home.","Socially Inclusive Design; Sofa-sleepers; EU Labour Migrants; Homeless; Rotterdam; Transitional Housing; Self-build; Design for Disassembly; Circularity; Modular assembly; Open Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.90249843026991, 4.502340265743175"

The role that abdominal wall tension plays in this is incontrovertible: most repair techniques in herniorrhaphy aim to reduce tension at the aponeurotic edge, as excess tension is directly related with local ischemia and recurrence of the hernia. Currently, fascial tension is subjectively observed by the surgeon and rarely quantified intra­-operatively. The choice of procedure is based on pre­operative characteristics of the defect, surgeon experience and preference, which can be highly variable. Research shows that an objective assessment of fascial tension can be a feasible adjunct to surgical decision making. Therefore, this thesis provides a proof of principle for MINT: minimally invasive tensiometry. MINT is an add­on tool for existing laparoscopic instruments, which enables an objective assessment of abdominal wall tension by the use of a linear spring. Universal applicability has been evaluated and confirmed in this research. MINT is fabricated using carbon fibre reinforced PA­12 (”Onyx”) at the TU Delft. The device’s safety and effectivity have been validated using several experiments and sterilisation test runs. MINT provides accurate and consistent results in Newton without further calibration. Forces up to 60N can be quantified, with an accuracy of 5.5+/­2%, expressed in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Results show that ”Onyx” and the silicon used can be sterilised using an autoclave at least five times. Moreover, its ease of use and functionality have been assessed in a clinical setting using an embalmed cadaver. Further testing will have to be done to substantiate the results from this research through a larger study. In addition, redesign will have to take place to decrease part count and further improve assembly of the device. The findings of this thesis provide a first step in the implementation of fascial tension measurements for intra­-operative decision making during laparoscopic surgery.","Herniorrhaphy; tensiometry; hernia repair; fascial tension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-06","","","","","",""

Every component plays an important part in building an energy efficient building. This thesis looks at P.V. integrated shading devices.<br/><br/>Shading devices are designed to block the excess solar radiation coming into the building to reduce the energy load of a building. This surface can be utilized to generate electricity by adding P.V. panels. P.V. panels are more efficient if they track the sun’s movement to increase the amount of solar radiation falling on the surface. The existing solar tracking devices fail due to multiple gears and the load of the panel on the rotational device.<br/><br/>To tackle this problem heliotropic plants were studied. Heliotropic plants follow the sun’s movement to receive more solar radiation for photosynthesis. The internal mechanisms and forces of a sunflower (heliotropic plant) that cause this movement was analysed through an experiment and digital image correlation. The analysis showed that the sunflower’s stem utilizes water to expand and contract the sides of the stem in a diurnal pattern so that the stem can track the sun. This expansion and contraction curves the stem to move it 14 degrees which is sufficient to increase the solar radiation on the plant. <br/><br/>This property of expansion and contraction was taken forward to design a sun tracking P.V. integrated shading to produce more energy. The expansion and contraction of the device were enabled by utilizing segments that were moved by piezo electric actuators. The Piezo electric actuator uses the energy generated from the P.V. panel and converts it to mechanical energy which enables the rotation of the device.<br/><br/>To find the angle for rotation a simulation was made to find the angle at which the P.V. panel produces the most energy and the angle at which the shading device reduces the load on the heating or cooling device. The device is designed to track the change in the sun's altitude as this rotation produces the most energy for a P.V. panel and a shading device. The device responds to the change in altitude four times a year as this corresponds to the seasons to which the shading device rotates. <br/><br/>There were two simulations made for the energy saved by the P.V. integrated shading device. The first simulation was for the Netherlands, factoring the energy saved by the shading device and the energy losses by the mechanical parts the device produces 196kW/ year and reduces the heating and cooling load by 16%. In Abu Dhabi, the same device produces 777kW/ year which reduces the cooling load by 15%.<br","P.V. integrated shading device; heliotropic plants; solar tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study uses the knowledge gained from ‘Coming to terms with superdiversity’ to understand how spatial diversity forms in the built environment, explicitly questioning ‘How can understanding the temporality of spatial diversity inform the way we design new spatial interventions?’. The question is tackled by creating a catalogue of maps based on the lessons learnt and new parameters to investigate the most spatially diverse area within the Western Archipelago site (WA). Thus, the series of maps create a visual narrative of the existing spatial diversity and enables the user to generate a design framework by highlighting critical areas for development and design potentials.","Diversity; Spatial Diversity; Superdiversity; Rotterdam; Nieuwe Binnenweg; Delfshaven; Middelland; Theatre; Performance; Public Square; Heemraadsingel; Culture Mapping; Temporal Spatial Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Nieuwe Binnenweg Forum | Hotel New York","51.912828, 4.454553"

Power, ownership, and mass tourism are taking over the city, exacerbating the housing shortage and making the housing prices rise to an unprecedented height. As a result, inhabitants are being pushed out of the city, while the discussion of housing as a human right is being ignored and wellbeing and equality are undermined. Alongside this housing crisis, tourism has developed into an economy with negative impacts on the city. Being a product for the almost 17 million visitors has been very overwhelming for the only 830.000 inhabitants of Amsterdam, which becomes visible through anti-hotel protests. This raises the question of the right to the city. The main objective of this project is to design a hotel that does not see tourism as a thread for the locals, but instead, as a resource. Considering different ways in which tourism can still take place in harmony with the wellbeing of Amsterdam’s inhabitants, I started to think of an architectural model in which tourists and residents live in the same building, benefitting from each other. The idea is a model where residents have a guest room in their home. The money that the guest room generates enables them to live in the city. The City Hotel will consist of multiple of these units, all housing a guest room. Together, they will form a collective house, sharing multiple facilities like gardens, a big kitchen, a dining room, working spaces and a laundry space. Thereby shifting the almost parasitic relationship between tourists and residents into a symbiotic one.<br/><br","City Hotel; Amsterdam; Co-Living; Guest Room; Interiors Buildings Cities; Right to the city; Jordaan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.3825132"

In order to produce methanol, hydrogen is required which is produced from the captured water by electrolysis in a zero gap design, high pressure alkaline water electrolyser. The pressure in the electrolysis setup is regulated at a desired operating pressure of 50 bar by a pressure control system, designed by ZEF.<br/><br/>Insight is required in how the flow of electrolyte and bubbles behaves in the electrolysis setup and the electrolyser cells, in order to implement design or operation condition changes to allow for an efficient operation in the eventual micro-plant.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the experimental characterization of the flow and bubble phenomena in the ZEF electrolyser design, during operation at a desired pressure of 50 bar, with the use of visualization by video footage inside the electrolyser cells. Camera equipment used for the visualization consists of a microscope camera and a GoPro camera. An ultrasound Doppler velocimetry device (UDV) was used to measure the electrolyte flow velocity and direction in different parts of the electrolysis setup, in order to substantiate findings made by the camera equipment. <br/><br/>Experiments were conducted with an electrolysis setup based on the current electrolyser design made by ZEF, with the addition of a transparent add-on to allow for visualization of the flow and bubbles inside an electrolyser cell on the oxygen side. First the operation of the electrolyser was characterized by means of IV curves and temperatures, followed by visualization experiments for varying operating pressures and current densities at different parts of the electrolyser cell. <br/><br/>One of the main observations made during the visualization experiments is the periodic occurrence of stagnation of electrolyte and gas flow out of the electrolyser. Stagnation of the flow occurs inside the electrolyser cells on the oxygen side, at the top channels leading the flow out of the electrolyser cells, to eventually a flash tank. Different multiphase flow regimes were observed during active flow through the top channels, which vary based on the operating current density, pressure and temperature. <br/>Bubble behavior was observed at different positions on the electrode in the electrolyser cell and possible enhancement of gas crossover was detected in the electrolysis setup and investigated. <br/><br/>The effect of the pressure control system on the operation of the electrolyser was also investigated and showed to affect the electrolyte flow direction in the electrolysis system. <br/>Models were made to validate and explain the findings from the visualization video footage and characterization of the electrolyser.

In particular, a walk that moves across the Fock states of a quantum harmonic oscillator by a Jaynes-Cummings model is investigated, which is difficult to implement because of different Rabi frequencies for different Fock states. Theoretically, the lower boundary vacuum state of the harmonic oscillator causes a reflection of the probability amplitudes in the distribution. A walk that moves across a grid of coherent states |nα+imα〉 in phase space is then investigated. A setup for a 1D and 2D quantum random walk is suggested, using controlled displacements of a resonator dispersively coupled to one or two superconducting transmon qubits in circuit-QED, followed by Hadamard gates. From numerical simulations it was observed that the 2D walk commutes for α·β = 0 mod π/2 for which the variance is proportional to the number of steps t squared. For other values of α·β the horizontal and vertical displacements do not commute, resulting in extra phase factors. The numerical simulations showed that for most values of α· β with a larger distance to 0 mod π/2 than 0.01, the probability distribution of the<br/>walk collapses to a distribution centered around origin within t = 100 steps, similar to a classical random walk.

In the Netherlands the Dutch industry accounts for 40% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and therefore decarbonisation of this sector is highly relevant. The Port of Rotterdam is home to a large variety of power plants and chemical companies producing all sorts of essential products, such as fuels, platform chemicals and polymers. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is one of the polymers produced in the Port and on average 100 ktonne of CO<sub>2 </sub>is emitted every year during the manufacturing. PVC manufacturing companies have a significant responsibility to reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and explore more environmental-friendly production methods. This research aims to aid in the transition by exploring decarbonisation pathways through which PVC manufacturers in the Netherlands can reduce their direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <br/>This study will answer the main research question: <i>How can selected hydrogen and biomass decarbonisation configurations reduce direct CO2emissions in the Dutch PVC industry and how do these perform in a grey-box techno-economicanalysis?</i><br/>To answer the main research question, secondary research questions were formulated, which are systematically answered throughout this study:• What are the main steps of the production of PVC in the Netherlands and which step is the primary source of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions?• Which three selected hydrogen and biomass decarbonisation configurations are promising for decarbonisation of the Dutch PVC industry and where do they fit in the PVC production process?• How do the selected hydrogen an biomass decarbonisation configurations compare in a grey-box techno-economic analysis? <br/>This was done by carrying out a literature study on the current PVC production process ofShin-Etsu in the Port of Rotterdam, followed by a Mass Flow (MFA) and Energy Flow Analysis (EFA) which identified the thermal cracking of ethylene dichloride (EDC) to vinylchloride monomer (VCM) as the main source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the production process. Next, three decarbonisation configurations were proposed that make use of several renewable energy technologies, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC), electric furnaces (EF) and hydrogen furnaces (HF):• Configuration A: A hydrogen-fed SOFC system with an electric furnace.• Configuration B: A biomass-fed SOFC system with an electric furnace.• Configuration C: A electricity-fed SOEC system with a hydrogen furnace.<br/><br/>These configurations were modelled using grey-box modelling and compared in a techno-economic analysis using the following parameters: Net Present Value (NPV), Payback Period (PBP), Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Energy Efficiency (EE). The main results and conclusions of the study are as follows:<br/>• PVC production in the Netherlands can be split in two main production steps: VCM production and PVC polymerisation. It was found that thermal cracking of EDC to VCM during VCM production is the main source of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.• Under the assumption that indirect heating technology will continue to be developedand pilot tested, electric furnaces with a supporting SOFC system could see implementation in the future. The energy efficiency of this configuration was estimated at 51%. This setup has the potential to negate direct CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions from the traditional cracking furnaces. However, the economic viability of hydrogen fed SOFC systems will be highly dependent on lower hydrogen market prices. In order to avoid shifting CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions from inside the gate to outside the gate an infrastructure where affordable, green hydrogen is available is key. Close collaboration between all the stakeholders in this supply chain will be important.• Biomass-fed SOFC systems combined with an electric furnace showed a positive NPV due to the lower price of biomass compared to hydrogen. The energy efficiency of this configuration was estimated at 45%. Sufficient availability of biomass in the Netherlands would benefit the potential of biomass-fed SOFC systems in the future, but this is not certain. Furthermore, the debate whether or not the use of biomass is carbon neutral continues as scientists call for caution since burning biomass is instant, while depending on the type of biomass it might take decades before the same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is drawn from the air. Biomass should therefore be used carefully. The future price of electric furnaces are subject to uncertainty and the economic viability of configurations using this technology should be reaccessed once the technology is closer to maturity.• A SOEC system supporting a hydrogen cracking furnace showed the highest NPV and the shortest pay back period of all three configurations. The energy efficiency was estimated at 61% which is the highest of all three configurations. SOEC is reaching high TRL and it is expected that by 2030 1+ MW systems are commercially available. If hydrogen cracking furnaces will also continue to strongly develop in the future, this configuration could be successful. Availability of renewable electricity and storage methods to deal with the intermittent nature of wind and solar are important enablers that could help SOEC systems gain momentum. Access to renewable electricity will also avoid displacement of direct CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions from the PVC industry to indirect CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions sources.","MIDDEN; Decarbonisation; Sustainable Energy Technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

We end up in nursing homes out of sight from our communities, we are viewed as valueless and stripped away from our own desires and standards. During a stay in a care home these observations led to the confronting conclusion that almost all old people in the care home felt like they had no sense of purpose in life. This is critical as sensing a purpose in life is essential for human flourishing, psychological functioning and our mental well-being. <br/>This project responds to people in late life who have lost their reason to wake up everyday and who have lost their spark as they feel like they have no purpose in life. The project stimulates people in their last phase of life to hold on to their sense of purpose in life by guiding several gradients derived via literature studies, interviews, case studies and an analysis of the site of design. The gradients essential in maintaining a sense of purpose in late life are the community gradient (from private to collective to public), the home and nature gradient (from indoors to outdoors), and the village and forest gradient (from village to forest). The main reason preventing older people from transitioning themselves between these several places, and thus from doing meaningful things, is the lack of the feelings of trust and safety. Therefore the project is based on the veranda which functions as the main intermediate space for guiding all the gradients. Surrounding this veranda is a community which functions as a way to create trust, safety and purpose for the people in late life, encouraging them to get out of bed. The community consists of several households which ensures that no one lives alone, that everyone is in connection with someone and in which everyone can contribute to a community according to their own possibilities. Where the community forms the mental backbone of sensing a purpose in life, the veranda is the physical space that smoothly brings together the indoors and the outdoors, the private, the collective and the public, and the village and the forest. The home and landscape for a sense of purpose in late life enables each inhabitant to contribute to society, to seek adventure in the forest, to talk to their neighbours, to invite grandchildren over, to drink coffee, and most of all to know that tomorrow you have a reason to wake up.","purpose; a sense of purpose; meaningful life; late life; community; care; inclusive living; elderly; dwelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.062900975482215"

Most people aged 55 years and older do not want to move or cannot find a house that meets their demand. This<br/>is expected to block the housing flow and increase the already existing mismatch on the housing market, which will lead to difficulties on the housing market for other household types. To give the other household types more<br/>opportunities on the housing market, houses for people aged 55 years and older need to be built. However, policy makers and housing developers often do not exactly know how to attract these households. In this thesis, the qualitative housing demand of people aged 55 years and older is researched. The main research question was What kind of new housing is needed to best accommodate the different 55 years or older groups in the Netherlands?. With a combination of literature research, traditional surveys and a conjoint analysis an answer is given to this question. The focus lay not only on the independent housing preferences, but also on the relative importance of the different preferences. A distinction between households based on age, mobility, future household composition and preferred owner-occupied housing type is made. The research showed that most household groups have equal preferences but the importance of certain housing qualities in their housing choice differs. The price and suitability for elderly people<br/>were important in the housing choice of most groups. But for groups that want to move to apartments (older people, less mobile people) for example, the housing type is more important and the tenure is less important compared to groups that want to move to one-family houses. This becomes especially clear when comparing the trade-offs different age groups make. To accomodate the different 55 years and older groups, it is best to focus on the housing preferenes of people aged 65 years and older, as these people are pickier than people aged 55-64 and housing preferences less often change after this age.","People aged 55 years and older; owner-occupied; private rental sector; housing preferences; housing qualities; vicinity qualities; conjoint analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This is reflected in the upcoming ‘Omgevingswet’ (spatial planning law) due for 2022, that will require participation to be an (significant) element (in the early phases) of the urban development project. Existing research focuses mainly on the effects of participation on the residents, linking it to social sustainability. However, there is a lack of research into the effects of participation on urban redevelopment projects for the developer. Currently, the (positive) effects and implementation of participation within processes of developers are mainly based on ‘gut feelings’. Therefore, the main research question answered in this thesis is: What are the effects of participation on Dutch urban (re)development projects for the developer? The aim of this thesis is to provide insight, based on theoretical and empirical research, into the effects of the voice and influence (participation) of residents on urban (re)development projects, for the developer. The research has two key components: a case study and an inductive analysis, on the effects of participation on urban development projects. In the case study two cases from the Dutch developer ERA-Contour are analysed, on how the participation process affected the GOTIK aspects and the change in social cohesion of the neighbourhood. The inductive analysis of the findings is used to determine and present practical advice to urban developers on participation in urban redevelopment projects. The case study shows that participation enhances the quality and social cohesion of urban (re)development projects, it also contributes to the certainty about decisions made during the project and the level of support by residents for the project. To achieve these effects, participation requires the investment of time and money and a change in the approach to the organisation and information aspects of an urban (re)development project. Practical advice for the implementation of participation is provided. The lessons learned from this research can be applied to future urban development projects. This knowledge can help developers, to effectively use participation with residents and create more social sustainable neighbourhoods.","(Re)development projects; Effects of participation; GOTIK; Resident participation; Urban redevelopment; Voice and influence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Propellers were the first means of powered propulsion for aircraft. However the development of propellers stalled due to the growing interest in jet propulsion. Due to the growing interest in more fuel efficient and environmentally responsible aviation, propeller research is currently seeing a resurgence. <br/><br/>Wingtip-mounted propellers are seen as an attractive option for increasing the efficiency of aircraft. Indeed, due to the favorable interaction between the propeller slipstream and wingtip vortex, the performance of the integrated propeller-wing system is improved compared to the same elements in isolation. <br/><br/>Propellers installed at the wingtip have a considerable moment arm. When a thrust imbalance occurs, a fairly large moment about the aircraft yaw axis can negatively affect the aircraft trim. As a result, the aircraft directional static stability requirements are more stringent compared to the conventional layout. It is known, that a propeller at an angle with regards to the flow direction develops a considerable side force. The change in thrust and the side force that develops in this case could potentially be used to aid in the aircraft stability, instead of adversely affecting it, if the tip-mounted propeller were installed at a so-called ""toe-out"" angle. This configuration would take advantage of the benefits of the Wingtip-mounted propeller configuration, while also potentially enhancing the aircraft directional stability as well, thus reducing the adverse effects on aircraft trim of the wingtip propeller configuration.<br/><br/>With the aim of understanding the possible impacts of modifying the propeller installation angle, RANS CFD simulations were used to compute the flowfields of various configurations. First an isolated NACA-series wing and small diameter propeller were simulated at steady-state, in order to validate the methods used in this investigation. Following this, an isolated wing based on the experimental NASA aircraft X-57 was simulated, as this aircraft uses wingtip-mounted propellers. Then, the previously simulated propeller was scaled up to the operational size of the X-57, and simulated in transient conditions at zero and a non-zero sideslip angle of 10 degrees, since the inflow angle is non-uniform for this case, leading to unsteady blade loading. Finally the propeller was installed on the wing and power-off and power-on transient simulations were performed at installation angles of -10, 0 and +10 degrees. For each of the computational domains, grid convergence studies were performed to assess the numerical error associated with the chosen element sizes. The domain used for the isolated wing was calculated to have an uncertainty of 2% and 6% respectively when it comes to C<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>D</sub>. The domain used for the propeller simulations was calculated to have an uncertainty in C<sub>T</sub> and C<sub>P</sub> of almost 4% and 6%, respectively. These domains were combined for the investigation of the installed propeller cases and, to reduce computational costs, no grid convergence study was performed.<br/><br/>The results obtained from the simulation of the wing installed with the nacelle and spinner only, showed that there is a significant blockage effect due to the presence of the nacelle, which reduced lift over the wing, and increased drag. The presence of the propeller in power-on cases were observed to reduce the negative effects of the nacelle. <br/><br/>It was observed for the -10 degrees installed propeller, that the lift and drag performance of the wing was increased in this configuration compared to the 0 degree case, while the +10 degrees installed propeller showed decreased wing lift and drag performance. This was due to the orientation of the propellers. At $\epsilon_{TMP} = -10^\circ$, a larger portion of the wing is washed by the propeller slipstream, and thus affected by the interaction. This effect reduces with increasing toe-out angle as less of the wing is washed by the propeller slipstream. Additionally, due to the toe-out angle, the loading over the propeller disc is not distributed uniformly. Because of this, also the propeller slipstream is not uniform and thus the trailing wing is affected differently by the interaction for varying toe-out angles. The +10 degrees installed propeller was estimated to have an efficiency $.2%$ lower than its counterpart and $1.3%$ lower than the 0 degree installed case. <br/><br/>The generated side force of the installed propellers varied in sign, which depended on the sign of the installation angle. The side force for non-zero installation angle was estimated to be at least 13% of the zero installation angle thrust, for a representative cruise thrust setting and flight conditions. The side force imbalance for an aircraft experiencing sideslip, with non-zero angle wingtip-installed propellers with an aft center of gravity (CG), was investigated with regards to the directional stability. The thrust imbalance was estimated to be a slightly stabilizing factor when the propellers are installed at +10 degrees and, when combined with the destabilizing nature of the resulting side force imbalance, a slight improvement to the aircraft directional stability was found, though not sufficient to greatly affect the aircraft. At 10 degrees of sideslip, the resulting stabilizing moment due to the force imbalance in this case was found to constitute 1% of the magnitude of the aircraft restoring yawing moment caused by the vertical tailplane. This effect was a destabilizing factor when installed at -10 degrees, with the resulting destabilizing moment due to the force imbalance at 10 degrees of sideslip found to constitute 13% of the magnitude of the aircraft restoring yawing moment caused by the vertical tailplane. Since these calculations were done for a configuration where the propeller forces act ahead of the aircraft CG, it was noted, that the side force imbalance would be stabilizing in both cases for a forward CG. The contribution to the moment is largely determined by the location of the propellers, and the moment contribution of the thrust imbalance of the non-zero installed wingtip mounted propellers is estimated to be 20% larger than that of the side force imbalance, on the X-57. <br/><br/>The present study has contributed towards a better understanding of the interaction effects and performance of wingtip-mounted propellers installed at a nonzero toe-out/toe-in angle. The results indicate that both inboard- and outboard-directed propellers have benefits and drawbacks with respect to the zero installation angle configuration. Nevertheless, future studies should still be performed on this topic. At higher Mach numbers, actively controlled propeller installation angles or tailplane-mounted propellers at an incidence angle could take advantage of the unique characteristics of this configuration.","Propeller; Wingtip-mounted propellers; CFD; Aerodynamic performance; Aerodynamics; directional stability and control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

An electrostatic motor for the watch application looks promising due to the more efficient scaling of force compared to magnetic, and since the current design consists of an intricate and, relative to the rest of the movement, bulky coil of wires. Various designs were devised and then analysed. The concepts were selected based on ease of manufacture and potential losses, resulting in the two best designs. In the investigation, various mechanisms for losses in the concepts are calculated, and the concepts are compared to each other. The most promising concepts to replace a Lavet type motor are a ratchet comb design and a top drive. A quartz motor designer can choose different parameter sets to get a high efficiency or a low surface area of the actuator. The ratchet comb and top drive design have approximately the same efficiency or better as the current Lavet motor, and the size is approximated to be between 3−20 mm2 where the Lavet motor uses a surface of around 80 mm2.","Electrostatics; motor design; quartz watch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-07-06","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Accurate short-term forecasts, also known as nowcasts, of heavy precipitation are desirable for creating early warning systems for extreme weather and its consequences, e.g. urban flooding. In this research, we explore the use of machine learning for short-term prediction of heavy summer rainfall showers in the Netherlands. We explore the use of a recurrent, convolutional neural network (TrajGRU, Shi et al., 2017) with lead times of up to 100 minutes. We aim to train the model to predict the formation and dissipation of dynamic, heavy, localized rain events, a task for which traditional Lagrangian extrapolation based nowcasting methods still come up short. The network is trained, validated and tested on a 13-year archive of radar images with 5-min temporal and 1-km spatial resolution from the precipitation radars of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). We report on different ways to optimize predictive performance for heavy precipitation events through two experiments. In the first experiment different training dataset compositions are explored. The large dataset available provides many possible configurations for training. To focus on heavy rainfall intensities, we use different subsets of the radar dataset through using different conditions for event selection and varying the ratio of light and heavy precipitation events present in the training data set. In the second experiment we change the loss function used to train the model. To assess the performance of the model, we compare our method to a current state-of-the-art deterministic Lagrangian extrapolation-based nowcasting system from the pySTEPS library, S-PROG (Seed et al, 2003). The results of the experiments are used to discuss the pros and cons of machine-learning based methods for precipitation nowcasting and possible ways to further increase performance. Model behaviour was found to be significantly influenced by the formulation of the loss function. It was concluded that there is always a trade-off between performance at low rainfall intensities and performance at high rainfall intensities: (1) If a model makes smaller errors at low rainfall intensities this results in a low total error, but also in the failure to detect high rainfall intensities. (2) If model performance is improved at detecting high rainfall intensities, this results in a decreased performance at low rainfall rates and increases the total error.","deep learning; nowcasting; precipitation; weather radar","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The same idealized eddy-resolving numerical model is used as Georgiou et al. (2019) which has proven to be capable of capturing the key dynamics of the Labrador Sea, like the annual cycle of convection, the process and timescales of restratification, and properties of the mesoscale eddy field. Model simulations are set-up with different scenarios of the density structure of the boundary current at inflow location (i.e. southern tip of Greenland). The variations result in respectively a 5% strengthening and 5% weakening of the boundary current, which corresponds to interannual variability of observed surface velocities. The model output demonstrates that boundary current variations start a chain of reactions, significantly changing the dynamics of the Labrador Sea. This has implications for deep convection processes in the interior of the basin and thus the export product. With a passive tracer analysis it is shown that convected water masses formed in the convection area are laterally steered along isopycnals by an eddy-induced shear flow from the interior towards the boundary current at the West-Greenland coast in deeper layers. A strengthening (weakening) of the boundary current yields a lighter (denser) water mass to be exported at shallower (deeper) layers out of the interior. The most intense entrainment into the boundary current occurs where both the density and depth of the convected water masses match the local water mass properties of the boundary current, and where eddies detach from the boundary current. The associated export timescales can be linked to the location where eddies detach, and to the strength of the eddy-induced shear flow. This study further highlights the implications for linking variability in the LSW production and export to AMOC variability as the total export of convected waters in the Labrador Sea is a mixture of multiyear convected waters. Based on density alone, measurements of water masses at the exit do not directly reveal the past-year dynamical state of the Labrador Sea. This emphasizes that a proper representation of mesoscale eddies in models is necessary for representing the export timescales and water mass properties of the LSW, and their response to changing forcing.","Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; AMOC; Labrador Sea; Convection; Pathways; boundary-interior exchanges; passive tracer analysis; LSW; Labrador Sea Water export","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vanderlande gained its number one market position from constant innovation and making great quality products, meeting the question of the customer and coming from a technology-driven perspective. However, to stimulate their innovation, bridge existing knowledge silos, and be ready for VUCA Worlds, Vanderlande wants to have the right creative response. Through a series of collaborative workshops, a group of Vanderlande employees from different departments is guided through the process of Design Roadmapping called The Long Now. The scope of this project is Traveling in Europe process will focus on centralizing the passenger, instead of the airport as a driver for innovation and value. Furthermore, there is a plan to use the workshops also for other domains, e.g. parcels and warehousing. This led to the initial research question: “How to create a digital process of Design Roadmapping in which the passenger is central for Vanderlande and that could be transmitted to different domains?”<br/><br/>Through a theoretical background, the design of The Long Now can be separated into three different levels: Firstly, The Long Now Process design, on this level all design choices regarding the process and outline of the workshops are defined, including the involvement of senior management. Secondly, the strategic workshop design, on this level is the design of the strategic workshops necessary to build the design roadmap. And lastly, the knowledge design. The workshops are for non-designers, so the needed design research was done beforehand and served as input for the different strategic workshops. On all three levels, guidelines were created as a foundation to design for these layers. <br/>Secondly, because of the existing knowledge silos within Vanderlande and the externally created design knowledge that needs to be adopted by the participants, knowledge barriers within the group can occur. Knowledge boundaries happen when ideas are so novel that a new language, interpretation, or interest is needed. Therefore, the right design frames and tools for knowledge crossing are necessary. All these different insights are transformed in a design goal:<br/>“Design the process, strategic workshops, and content for “The Long Now” that is transmittable to different domains following the created guidelines and that helps in crossing any existing knowledge boundaries by designing the tools/ frames/ methods for this.”<br/><br/>Through continuous iteration loops, the workshops and the necessary design frames were first tested and redesigned, to make sure that the flow of the workshop and the knowledge crossing elements were optimal. The final design of the Long Now is a set of Design Roadmapping workshops that is ready to be transmitted to the next domain of airports. Based on this first version of the workshop, a set of recommendations is written for the next Long Now, which will take place in other domains.<br/><br/>In addition to this research, the strategic workshops also produced outcomes regarding the scope of Traveling in Europe, which resulted in a future vision statement for Vanderlande: In 2050, Vanderlande orchestrates seamless, sustainable connections for every journey.<br","Design Roadmapping; Strategic Workshop; Boundary knowledge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In this thesis, a proof of concept to generate hardware-executable quantum circuits for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices that follow the paradigm of approximate computing is presented.<br/> <br/>We adopt a multi-level optimization approach and consider the placement of native quantum gates that can be physically implemented on one of the existing quantum systems (IBM, Rigetti) as a circuit topology optimization problem and the adjustment of parameters of these native quantum gates as a continuous design optimization problem. The outer topology problem is solved with the aid of a genetic algorithm, whereas the gradient-descent method is used for the inner design optimization.<br/><br/>Our approach starts from the reference circuit and transforms it into an executable circuit with tunable parameters by replacing the high-level quantum operations with a set of approximate decompositions, e.g., single qubit rotation quantum gates or a combination of single qubit rotation gates (matrix multiplication). Later, the inner design optimization ensures that the circuit created is tuned to be executed to achieve an expectation value close to that of the reference circuit. This is complemented by compiler-based optimizations to further reduce or aggregate the quantum gates of the optimized circuit. This three-step pipeline is embedded into an outer genetic algorithm framework that inspects many different circuit designs (the approximate-decomposition replacements are by no means unique) and returns a set of unique approximate quantum circuits that can be executed on hardware.<br/><br/>We have tested our circuit generation approach for superconducting quantum systems such as IBM and Rigetti hardware for many different benchmark circuits such as Quantum Fourier Transform, Toffoli, quantum adder, multi-controlled operations and three oracle-based algorithms, namely, Grover's search algorithm, Deutsch and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. In nearly all cases, our approach outperforms the quantum compiler frameworks by IBM and Rigetti even on their highest optimization level and produces significantly smaller circuits, up to 2x reduction in the number of gates. In addition, the circuits generated using the proposed approach provide better (a) performance (on average, improved by 24.25%) and (b) reliability (on average, improved by 23.50%) compared to the IBM generated circuits when executed on the ibmq_5_yorktown physical quantum device.","Quantum computing; Quantum circuit optimization; Approximate computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Balochistan is the most precarious province of the country, bordering both with Iran - at the West - and Afghanistan - on the North. The region has been the homeland of the Balochi people, whose territory has once been divided by the Iran-Pakistan frontier. Balochs have been engaged in cross-border smuggling for years, as a result of the province’s economic negligence, lack of developed job market and investments, as well as an effect of massive resource extraction, led by the Pakistani state and China that pursues their New Silk Road. Despite being an extremely dangerous activity, smuggling has become one of few ways to survive in the economic misery of this desertic land and effectively, has created the region’s standalone economy. The Balochs smuggle oil and diesel food, building materials, drugs, and people mainly using their tuned blue pick-ups. However, the most characteristic commodity smuggled in Balochistan that maintains a core of the local economy is oil and diesel. <br/><br/>The research positions itself in a multi-disciplinary scope, deriving not only from spatial domains such as architecture or urbanism but also, even more importantly, from various social sciences such as ethnography, sociology, anthropology, and politics. Hence, the used sources comprise trans-disciplinary works, often operating on the edge of the above disciplines as well as include diverse media types such as books, official reports, online articles, Instagram posts, or YouTube videos. <br/><br/>The crucial part of the research constituted analyzing the physical aspects of the existing Iran-Pakistan border. Having traced the course of the border on satellite images, several places where the border fortifications are disrupted were observed. Most of these disruptions were naturally created by the periodic penetrating the border fortifications. Eventually, the collection of the areas around the border gaps has become a starting set of sites for the design concept. Basing on the locations around the gaps in the border fortifications, the concept envisions model spatial premises, that would enable smugglers to maintain their occupation and reside in their independent cross-border settlements built along the riverbeds. Adapting to the changing perimeter of the periodic river, the design maintains constant self-transformation. Most importantly, however, the complex, labyrinthic structure of these premises, thanks to its quality of obscurity and confusion, is expected to help smugglers avoiding law enforcement forces pursuits, that currently deter them from trading. The project, therefore, spatializes the condition of the ‘hide and seek’ game that is being repeatedly played out by smugglers from both sides of the border and law enforcement forces. The design takes advantage of a great variety of resources available locally - such as mining minerals, bamboo, or clay, mixed with reused left-overs of smuggled commodities such as car particles, solar panels, or oil barrels. Eventually, to accommodate the spatial strategy to the site-specific conditions, the grasshopper script generating instances of labyrinths adapted to the specific gap indicated in the course of the border was created.","Balochistan; smuggling; informal trade; Balochi; Balochs; Iran-Pakistan border; oil smuggling; diesel smuggling; parametric architecture; border conditions; border wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","Emerging Border Conditions in Eurasia","27.828643, 62.999781"

This distance should be reduced because it could lead to social isolation and/or loneliness among the vulnerable elderly. Thereby, as a result of the baby boom generation, a large part of the Dutch population will be older than 65 years old in the upcoming years. That is why the question of a pleasant and personal living environment for this generation is even more urgent. According to my empirical and literature studies this segregation between the elderly and their surroundings is caused by several things:<br/><br/>•Firstly, the growth of this segregation is through the (physical and mental) barriers which make it increasingly difficult to meet others in their direct surrounding (due to age-related disabilities and illness)<br/>•Secondly, most of the housing types for the elderly is now arranged so that they mainly live together with their age group and they continue living in their bubble. <br/>•Thirdly, their “own” social network is getting smaller and the elderly becoming more dependent on help in the immediate vicinity.<br/>These causes can be seen as a chain reaction that keeps getting bigger and therefore the distance gets bigger as well. The issue of this report is to what extent architectural design can contribute to reducing the growing gap between the elderly and their living environment and thus make a positive contribution to breaking through social isolation. Therefore, my research question for this thesis is: <br/><br/>''To what extent does the architectural design play a role in reducing the distance between the elderly and their neighbourhood to encourage the social inclusiveness of them in their living environment?''<br/><br/>The design of the Social Courtyards is the translation of the results of the research question. My graduation project aimed to ensure that the elderly continue to interact passively and actively with their environment in a pleasant way. This is to increase a sense of belonging in the neighbourhood, despite the mental and physical limitations associated with their old age. Reducing the distance of the elderly towards their living environment improves the elderly’s mental and physical health. The design is located in Driebergen and the design is named Social Courtyards. <br","the elderly; reducing distance; inclusive environment; healthcare architecture; social distance; social interaction; natural living environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.06242, 5.29164"

Flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC), present in feed and condensate systems, is a well known corrosion mechanism, eroding and dissolving the protective magnetite layers. Fouling of the boiler, by suspended magnetite particles, is partly controlled by forces arising due to surface charging. Film forming amines (FFA) are gaining acceptance as means to control FAC. However, its performance in low pH regions is unknown. In addition, despite FFA being a surfactant, its effect on the colloidal magnetite surface charge and point of zero charge (pzc) are unknown. This research set out to determine the effect<br/>of FFAs on the formation of a protective magnetite layer and its resistance against acidic FAC, and to determine the effect of FFAs on the surface charge of colloidal magnetite. This study focused on two FFAs, Octadecylamine (ODA) and Oleyl Propylenediamine (OLDA). In 48h 230-250 ºC immersion corrosion tests magnetite layers were formed on C1010 coupons, inside a high pressure high temperature autoclave under different treatments: untreated (blank), 2ppm ODA and 2ppm Ammonia, 2ppm OLDA and 2ppm Ammonia, and only 2ppm Ammonia. 48h 150 ºC re-immersion corrosion tests were performed to test the magnetite layer performance under acidic (acetate 0.08ppm) FAC. After the corrosion tests, the layers were verified using XRD, EDS + SEM and Weigh-loss measurements. Potentiometric titrations were employed to measure the proton induced surface charge of magnetite particles (10g/L) at an ionic strength of 0.01, and 0.1 mol/kg (KNO3) in the presence or absence of ODA, or OLDA (2ppm) over a wide pH range, at 25, and 150 ºC. This gave the magnetite surface charge density curves. The pzc was determined using the inflection point of titrations (pHinfl) and common intersection point (pHcip). XRD confirmed the presence of magnetite layers on all coupons after the immersion and re-immersion tests. The SEM measured magnetite layer decrease after the re-immersion tests was: 19.1%, 14.5%, 8.6%, and 23.3% for blank, ODA, OLDA, and ammonia treatment respectively. Weight loss determined corrosion rates taken over both immersion and re-immersion tests were: 0.070, 0.057, 0.060, and 0.073 mm/y for blank, ODA, OLDA, and ammonia treatment respectively. All magnetite surface charge density curves were unaffected by the presence of ODA, and OLDA, except for ODA at 0.1 mol/kg KNO3 and 25 ºC, which resulted in a raised/neutralized surface charge density curve in the alkaline pH region. Magnetite layers formed under ODA, and OLDA additions were smoother, thinner, and more uniform compared to layers formed under an ammonia only chemistry, and blank chemistry. Layers formed under the ODA, and OLDA chemistries were better resistant against acidic FAC and offered better protection, in terms of corrosion rate. At the applied concentration ratio, and ionic strength of 0.01M, ODA, and OLDA did not affect the magnetite colloid surface charge over pH. However, both caused magnetite particles to agglomerate. At higher ionic strengths of 0.1M, ODA neutralized the magnetite surface charge in the alkaline region.","magnetite; corrosion inhibitor; corrosion; water-steam cycle; surface complexation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-06","","","","","ISPT Condensate Quality",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The goal of this study is to test out the accuracy of the upscaling approach (Jinyu Tang, 2021) for a geothermal doublet. This approach tries to simulate the physical thermal dispersion. When modeling in a geothermal reservoir it would be easy if a lot of layers can be upscaled. However, when doing upscaling one can not just take an average of the layer properties. This results in a very inaccurate representation of reality. That is where the upscaling comes in. First, some other points need to be considered. The reservoir is simulated in DARTS (Wang, Voskov, Khait, &amp; Bruhn, 2020). This simulator uses numerical methods to model the reservoir. Before starting on modeling geothermal reservoirs first a 1D case is evaluated to check for numerical dispersion that comes into play. With that evaluation done the 2D cases were simulated. The full reservoir has 91 layers, these can be upscaled into 9 layers eventually. To start building up to that scenario first 2 other scenarios are evaluated. First, an upscaled section of the first block of upscaled layers is evaluated. This was originally 10 layers and now upscaled to one layer. This one layer was first simulated in a one grid simulation and then a single grid simulation. These results are compared to a simulation of the original layer properties and a simulation of an arithmetic average of the reservoir properties.

(mentor); Cannatella, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Coastal areas and riverine cities accommodate the great majority of the world’s population, but they are extremely vulnerable to flooding risks. In the cities next to the Medway River estuary, the capacity to adapt to flood risks had been weakened by urban development and intense industrial usage. This degrading led to the loss of flood buffers and the recreational value of the coastal landscape. Moreover, climate change threatens large areas of nationally important habitats in the estuary. Coastal habitats are likely to be submerged by the rising sea. The rise in sea level can also accelerate the natural erosion of coastal cliffs. To address these problems, a more resilient landscape approach is needed to increase the coastal resilience. Therefore, this design-related research regarded resilience as the theoretical backbone, embraced landscape-based design approaches, including layer approach, scenario study, and mapping as research strategies. The project developed and applied design strategies in three lower-scale sites. First, the site on the Isle of Sheppey focused on coastline protection. A nature-based offshore island structure is proposed to diminish the surf, create space for tidal habitats, and provide recreational use. Next, on the Rainham coastline, to respond to intertidal habitat loss, managed realignment and growing marshes are the key strategies to restore the dynamics of the ecosystem. Last, the study proposed a transformation scheme for the Medway city estate site to relocate flood defence, provide space for tidal rivers, and accommodate mixed-use development. Each proposal could grow with time, increase ecological benefits, and create multifunctional programs. In the end, the study framed a vision on regional development, aiming to increase the socio-ecological resilience of the Medway river landscape.","Adaptive Planning and Design; Medway River; Estuary; Resilience; river landscape; coastal landscape; Landscape-based Approach; Urbanism; urban development; Isle of Sheppey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Master in Urbanism (EMU)","","51.38048482683836, 0.6039200729034663"

In large-scale industrial applications, the largest share of energy consumption goes into overcoming the friction drag produced by turbulent boundary layers formed on the outside wall. Estimates assess that over 50% of the total fuel burn is due to overcoming friction drag, highlighting how reducing it would result in large environment and economic savings. In this work, an active technique for friction drag reduction in a turbulent boundary layer is studied in TU Delfts windtunnel laboratory. The flow over a stationary wall is modified by the steady rotation of flush-mounted discs - aiming to mimic a motion of wall-oscillation perpendicular to the flow, a well-documented turbulent drag reduction technique. The effect of the disc motion on turbulent drag is investigated at friction Reynolds numbers of 912 and 1483. The chosen rotational velocity of the discs, the disc diameter and disc spacing represent the optima defined in literature, and a further parameter exploration was conducted around these optima. To assess the performance of the disc array, high resolution planar PIV is employed to measure skin-friction drag reductions at the wall, as well as to quantify second order statistics and other phenomena within the turbulent boundary layer. The results reveal drag reductions in the order of 50%, with Reynolds stresses and peaks of turbulent kinetic energy production decreasing by similar amounts. Analysis of turbulent velocity fluctuations reveals that the prevalence of turbulence producing events is significantly decreased close to the wall, and two-point correlations of vorticity contours show that vortical events are remarkably hindered by the disc rotation. Further analysis of a wall-parallel plane reveals that the mean velocity increases over the discs and decreases in between. This suggest that the detrimental effects of such a disc array occur at spanwise locations between each disc row, in accordance with literature. By using an assumption of outer flow similarity, the performance of the array is then quantified as being 10% less than the local optimum in the disc center.","Turbulent Drag Reduction; PIV; Aerodynamics; Skin Friction; Flow Control; Experimental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-05","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Since then, the development has been gradually shifted to land-based. The dispersed roads and highways stimulated the urban sprawl where suburban gated communities are built in the outskirts, inaccessible by public transportation, and encourage private motorization. To cope with the congestion, the government is developing public rail transport throughout the metropolitan area. However, the current market-driven development triggers the proliferation of urban gated communities around the emerging stations, resulting in transit-induced gentrification and leaving insufficient spaces for the public.

Cities are required to redeﬁne their public participation strategies by adopting modern tools to increase their citizen’s satisfaction regarding the spatial planning process. This challenge has made geographic information system (GIS) technologies invaluable to enhance the place-making process by allowing citizens to express their needs and preferences. On the other hand, developing GIS technology with design or hierarchy left unchecked, could cause usability problem to the user. GIS technology would end up running into an unnavigable ocean of buttons and maps, resulting in users can easily get lost and become frustrated. Therefore, User Experience (UX) can become integral for engaging users with spatial planning products and effectively meeting their aspirations. This thesis aims to develop a User Experience (UX) design guideline together with a mockup design and apply it as a web-based GIS prototype. The focus of the study will be on spatial planning practice in Indonesia. The User Experience (UX) design guideline named ’4PHASE toolkit’ was made with several design phases: Phase 1: Deﬁne, Phase 2: Design, Phase 3: Build, Phase 4: Test. The ﬁrst phase is related to top-down studies about participation in spatial planning process both in general and case study, resulting with the Actor-Network (ANT) diagram for conceptualizing user roles, participation tasks, and space-time setting during the participation. The second phase is related to the design process of the UX starting from building persona, creating user ﬂow, sketching wireframes, and designing interfaces - resulting with the proposed mockup of 4D Musrenbang. The third phase is the development of the prototype based on the mockup design using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to add functionalities to the web. At last, Phase 4 is testing the prototype with real actors who share similar traits with the Persona. Based on the user tests, the prototype itself is considered as good, with usability score of 71%. Overall, this thesis project has successfully created three main products: The 4PHASE toolkit, a mockup, and a geo-web prototype.","User Experience; Spatial planning; Public Participation; GIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

A common assumption in the Bayesian system identification literature is that the discrepancy between model predictions and measurements can be described as independent, identically distributed realizations from a univariate Gaussian distribution. However, the decreasing cost of sensors and monitoring systems leads to more frequent structural measurements in close proximity to each other (e.g. fiber optics and strain gauges). In such cases, dependency in modeling uncertainty could be significant, both in space and time, and the assumption of uncorrelated Gaussian error may lead to inaccurate parameter estimation.</p><p style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">The aim of this thesis is to explore how Bayesian system identification can be feasibly performed using large datasets when spatial and/or temporal dependence might be present and to assess the impact of considering this dependence. A pool of models, each assuming a different correlation structure, is defined and Bayesian inference is performed. In particular, stress measurements obtained on a steel road bridge are used to update the parameters of the corresponding FE model and the parameters of the correlation structure. The results are compared to a reference model where only measurements of the response peaks are used under the assumption of independence. Nested sampling is utilized to compute the evidence under each model and Bayesian model selection is applied. The question of efficiently performing system identification for large datasets (N &gt; 10<sup>2</sup> for temporal dependencies and N &gt; 10<sup>3</sup> for combined spatial and temporal dependencies) is investigated, and a novel approach for efficiently calculating the exact log-likelihood is derived.

Additionally, it is shown that using large datasets and considering dependence makes it possible to perform system identification for a larger number of parameters compared to the reference model. The results of the case study indicate that using measurements from multiple sensors under combined spatial and temporal dependence and additive model prediction error yields reduced uncertainty in the posterior and up to 29% reduction of the posterior predictive credible interval range compared to the reference case. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed likelihood evaluation method is assessed. Using this method, exact calculation of the log-likelihood can be performed for &gt;10<sup>6</sup> points in under a second in the case of correlation in one dimension.

(mentor); Karmpadakis, Ioannis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Imperial College London (degree granting institution)","2021","Recent studies have shown that flood risk contributes to a major part of the total risk caused by natural hazards in Western Europe. Especially in the United Kingdom, flood risk has been identified as a substantial threat, which is likely to continue to grow due to (coastal) urbanisation, sea level rise and climate change. A separate study has shown that common analysis practice may underestimate flood risk due to the exclusion of compound flood events. These are flood events with multiple flood causes, such as a combined coastal and pluvial flood event. Floods are often caused by a complex system of multiple dependent flood driving mechanisms, which vary and interact as time progresses. Various fundamentally different methodologies have been developed to estimate the susceptibility of an area to floods. There is no singular best methodology which can be applied to every problem. Due to the complex nature of flood events, it is vital to understand these methodologies and their characteristics to represent the susceptibility to flooding correctly. Misrepresentation of flood susceptibility can lead to inefficient decision making, or worse, insufficient flood safety. The goal of this research is to compare several flood susceptibility estimation methodologies (including coastal, pluvial, and compound flooding), to observe the results and clarify notable differences in outcomes. A case study is conducted on the coastal town of Eastbourne, which has various common, but non-trivial characteristics. The flood susceptibility of Eastbourne is estimated using various estimation techniques, such as statistical analysis and numerical modelling. Not only did this give insight into the flood susceptibility of Eastbourne, but it also illustrated the capabilities of the selected methodologies. Eastbourne has a history of coastal and pluvial/fluvial flooding. In order to include the physical mechanisms of these flood types, it was decided to use relatively computationally expensive flood susceptibility estimation methodologies. Hence, use was made of sensibly chosen storm scenarios, based on extreme value analysis. The statistical analysis started with a general exploratory data analysis in order to find notable dependence structures between variables. Afterwards, two variants of extreme value analysis on reanalysed historical data were used to create ""smart"" scenarios. First of all, the peak over threshold approach (POT) was used to create scenarios in which a singular flood type was dominating. Secondly, the conditional approach was applied to create compound storm scenarios. In total, 8 different scenarios were created. These scenarios gave the input conditions for the models. At the coastal boundary, a spectral action balance resolving wave model SWAN was used to estimate close shore conditions based on offshore scenario input. These nearshore conditions where then used to estimate overtopping rates into the inundation domain via three different overtopping methodologies. First of all, a empirical equation (the ""new"" overtopping formula of the EuroTop manual) has been applied. Secondly, a Gaussian process emulator (Bayonet GPE), an approach similar to a neural network, has been applied. And lastly, use was made of a numerical hydrodynamic model SWASH to simulate wave transformation and overtopping. This last approach is especially interesting since numerical models have the ability to improve upon spectral action balance resolving wave models. Numerical models can implicitly account for infra gravity waves, a physical mechanism that is known to impact overtopping rates, something that spectral action balance resolving models struggle with. The numerical hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS, is used for the simulation of inundation caused by the storm scenarios. All 8 scenarios are calculated twice, in order to compare simulations made with two sets of governing equations: The diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equations (DSW) and the full shallow water equations (SWE), also known as the Saint Venant equations. The DSW approach has the advantage of being relatively computationally efficient, whilst SWE approach has the benefit of including a more accurate representation of physics. Since the DSW approach is more computationally efficient, it allows for solving on a higher spatial resolution. The model was applied to the part of Eastbourne, which is deemed to have the highest flood risk. It was then fed with overtopping discharges at the coastal flood defences and used precipitation events as defined by the respective scenarios. After the simulation, flood maps have been generated to compare the inundation patterns. Inundation curves have been made as well, for a more objective and apprehensible comparison of the severity of the flood events. The overtopping results showed that all three approaches agreed reasonably well, and were able to estimate plausible overtopping rates. There were no overtopping measurements for validation purposes, but the overtopping magnitude does agree with the coastal flood history of Eastbourne. The numerical method is more advanced than the empirical formula and the GPE. However, the results also showed a large sensitivity with regards to the (vertical) discretisation. Furthermore, the numerical approach, as applied in this research, did require explicit inclusion of refraction and fitting of breaking behaviour based on computationally expensive simulations, in order to give reasonable estimations. The numerical approach is promising and has the potential to become more accurate than the other methods considered. However, in its current state the method does seem as uncertain as the other considered approaches, whilst being more complex to implement. Lastly, regarding the comparison of governing equations for the estimation of inundation, it was found that the low spatial resolution SWE approach systematically underestimated inundation severity with regards to the high spatial resolution DSW approach. In addition to this, it was found that the times between the storm peaks and the inundation peaks was systematically lower for the SWE simulations than for the DSW simulations. Both these phenomena can be explained as a consequence of using a different spatial discretisation. When using the same spatial discretisation these effects disappear and the inundation curves agree well. There are, however, still some smaller local differences between simulations visible on the inundation maps. In the case of Eastbourne, modelled as described in this report, it is thus more important to accurately include topological features than to accurately represent the flow physics. This could, however, be different when considering higher spatial resolutions.","Compound flooding; Flood Risk; Hydrodynamic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double track degree in hydraulic engineering and watermanagement at Delft University of Technology https://github.com/IansGithubAcc/Thesis/ Github page with code used made for the research","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","50.7680, 0.2905"

Application of optimization methods in the ship maintenance, repair, and conversion industry have been so far frequently overlooked, due to the former lack of need for extensive engineering.<br/>Compared to new-build ships, in ship conversion, a leading part of the project, pipe routing, becomes particularly challenging. Existing construction of the ship and retained equipment result in a more crowded environment while existing lines are frequently extended to connect new equipment, which requires finding the optimal branching point. Operational aspects of the vessel can have an effect on both engineering of piping and defining the production areas. A clear example is that tanks may be filled during ship conversion whereby routing through tanks requires consideration of the emptying costs per m3 of the fuel and the cleaning costs of the tank per m2. All these constraints extend the pipe routing problem to more than a shortest path problem. It is a best path problem with the cost being the variable.<br/>The present study looks into the process of pipe routing within ship conversion with goal to create a model/tool for pipe routing in a cost-effective way. <br/>During the first steps, an investigation is performed on relevant studies, which yields that such a tool for the case of ship conversion is not yet available. Therefore, it is decided that a model is developed from scratch as a baseline cost estimation model. A thorough study of the algorithms applied in the literature study is performed to find the appropriate algorithm. It was concluded to implement the A* Algorithm on a grid. <br/>The baseline model is created as a quasi-3D environment, where routing through multiple 2D decks is achieved with switching points. The main goal of the model is to route a single pipe from A to B within the particular pipe routing constraints and the extra factors applicable to ship conversion. The pipe routing constraints are straight pipe, flange, bends, and clamp/support costs while optimizing for the least amount of bends. The extra factors of ship conversion addressed are as follows:<br/>• Penetration costs through existing decks and bulkheads<br/>• Tank opening costs which are possibly filled<br/>• Avoiding inaccessible obstacles or untouchable areas of the ship<br/>• Routing close to wall and tank edges for the ease of installation (production constraints) within the limited space of conversion. <br/>The verification of the model is carried out with the following tests: the verification of intermediate solution, continuity test, degeneracy test, fault injection, and the consistency check. Finally, a potential analysis is performed on the verified model to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the model. The cases of multiple end points, multiple pipes and bundling as well as bending optimization are examined and bring a solid picture of the baseline model capabilities and opportunities for further development.<br","Ship conversion; pipe routing optimization; life cycle engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

The separation of gases takes via a solution diffusion mechanism where the gases are separated based on their<br/>selectivity. Krytox oil is a high performance perfluoropolyether polymeric lubricant, originally aimed for its application to supersonic transport aircraft. The lubricant is known for its chemical and thermal stability leading to a longer usable life. The oil has shown an affinity for carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, a weak Lewis acid, owing to the fluorine and oxygen atoms in the polymeric oil which act as Lewis base and is thus envisioned for use in supported liquid membranes for gas separation.<br/>Molecular dynamics simulations serve as a powerful tool of study, overcoming the shortcomings of experimental methods such as the difficulty of measurements at elevated temperatures, pressures or handling dangerous chemicals. This project covers the study of transport properties of Krytox oil namely the oil viscosity and diffusivity of CO2 in the oil for varying conditions of temperature, pressure and polymer chain length using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The suitability of various atomistic force field models for this particular study has been tested, proceeding with the Universal force field (UFF) as the model of choice for studying the oil properties.

(mentor); Herdt, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This project addresses the many inhuman-scale superblocks that have resulted from the rapid urbanization of China over the past decades. These superblocks suffer from problems such as poor accessibility and a monotonous urban landscape. This project begins with a review of the development of superblocks in the West and in China, where superblocks have inherited the ancient Chinese urban paradigm while also being influenced by modernist urban planning. At the same time, China's land finance policy has created a reliance on superblocks as an urban development model for both government and developers. The need for urban regeneration and urban densification is both a challenge and an opportunity for the transformation of superblocks. Using Shenzhen as an example, two superblocks are selected for analysis and design based on the extent of the need for urban regeneration. By analyzing the network and functional distribution of these two superblocks, the problems of superblocks can be attributed to the abuse of closed neighborhoods and the mismatch between networks and activities. In addition, the current urban regeneration model in Shenzhen does not effectively improve the problems of superblocks. Thus, the project proposes that the regeneration units of superblocks should be integrated at the district scale and the degree of integration of the superblock network should be improved. At the same time, existing closed settlements should be replaced by more open block types to produce smaller blocks and more frequent streets and to match the functions corresponding to the road hierarchy. In addition, supporting block management policies need to be developed. Ultimately these strategies will be shown as an urban design scheme that will enable the transformation of superblocks to more livable blocks.","Superblock; Urban design; Urban regeneration; Chinese city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The city is targeted at the risk that fast-tracked urbanization will cause loss of existing habitats and socioeconomic qualities (Tesfaye, 2012).

This highly influences the quality of life in the urban context of Addis Ababa. The objective of this design project is to redress this mismatch and reflect on striking findings of the research that have been made throughout Ethiopia. By following the striking needs of Ethiopians, the goal of this design project is to realize a well-integrated design, which allows Ethiopian variety and differences of their lifestyle, aspirations, and needs. The report will communicate my vision for this project. A combination of sketches, short writings, flashes of Ethiopian inspiration and common interests argue the choices that have been made.

The design game resembles a board game in conjunction with Lego and functions on a more abstract level in relation to the built environment. The game is intended for use in a collaborative design that allows end users to collectively configure their space based on their spatial requirements and priorities which otherwise may not be met by standard conventional design in the top-down approach. The development of the design game abstracts the working spatial and social qualities of slum settlements within Ababa’s inner city (specifically kebele compound houses) and embeds them into a system of configurational elements and rules for configuring a low-rise courtyard-based incremental housing. This system of design flows a modular co-ordination system based upon a tartan grid. The end users use the game elements (boards, modules, activity cards &amp; tokens) to configure their space based on the defined game rules. In the game play process, the stakeholders (players) will identify and weigh different domestic and commercial spaces, functions and sizes based upon their priority to form their configuration of hierarchic spatial framework and shared spaces. The method of developing the game can be replicated to create design games for different contexts. The game serves as a simulation of a design problem that facilitates trade-offs, design ideation, projection of stakeholder needs, preferences, and co-creation. At the basic level, the game can be used to collect information about end-user preferences regarding spatial configuration, the use of tokens creates a trade-off where players have to prioritize their immediate spatial needs. At a higher level, the game can be used in a bottom-up planning strategy for ideating new housing solutions and upgrading existing ones.","Participation; Design game; Addis Ababa; Slum redevelopment; Meta game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Delta 21 is a hydraulic engineering structure located at the Haringvliet mouth, creating an energy lake and a tidal lake sea inwards. The system of Delta 21 ensures flood protection, increases the use of renewable energy, produces food and creates precious natural habitats and corridors.<br/>The Haringvliet region has a long history of living with water. People build dikes, dams and sluices. As a result, the land is safe from floods, creating opportunities for agriculture and industry to expand. The downside is that<br/>the damming caused strict land/water separations. The soft gradients of wet and dry, which once dominated the landscape, disappeared. Over the past decades, the landscape has become more monotone. The disappearance<br/>of the dynamic interface and the corresponding natural processes resulted in a landscape that lost the identity of the delta.<br/>This design exploration aims to create a sustainable estuarine landscape in harmony with ongoing natural processes that restores the gradual land-water transitions and brings back the dynamics of this delta landscape for ecology and experience. The proposed design layout is based on morphological processes along the coastline, the expansion and preservation of valuable habitats like the Hinderplaat and the re-opening of the sea -Haringvliet connection.<br/>The design exploration shows that incorporating Delta 21 into the new estuarine landscape can restore the estuarine dynamics and experience. The new estuarine landscape creates the opportunity to add a lot of nature, such as intertidal areas, marshland, creeks and dunes and restores the brackish corridors. The circumstances in the energy lake are suitable for the production of aquaculture. Furthermore, many recreational routes through the new landscape are introduced, connecting the new cultural zones, including holiday housing, shops, restaurants, and a visitor centre.","Estuary; delta; natural processes; landscape architecture; regional; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

(mentor); van der Meer, F.P. (graduation committee); Christoforidou, A. (graduation committee); Boeters, Ton (graduation committee); Tromp, Liesbeth (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) has increased rapidly in popularity in the past few decades. The material's advantageous properties, such as a high strength-to-weight ratio and low required maintenance, gave rise to its popularity in multiple major engineering branches. Buckling behaviour develops due to the notably low stiffness-to-strength ratio and the usual high slenderness of FRP plates. The occurrence of initial imperfections increases the tendency of the material to buckle. The load-carrying capacity of structures with post-buckling behaviour can be determined with progressive failure analysis, which requires a damage model that characterises the onset and evolution of damage. In Abaqus, the Hashin damage model is implemented by default, which considers the four failure modes of the material. Numerical analysis of strain-softening materials with local damage leads to deformation localisation in a single element: a finer mesh will decrease the amount of energy dissipated. To prevent this localisation into arbitrarily small regions, the stress is related to the deformation of a finite volume. The damage evolution is described with a stress-displacement response instead of a stress-strain response. The energy needed to open a unit area of the crack, the fracture energy, is defined as a material parameter and depends on the mesh size of the model. The assessment of fracture energy properties in composite materials is challenging due to specimen geometry and fibre lay-up, and accurate data of GFRP fracture energy is largely unknown. When no actual post-failure behaviour is acquired, the lower bound fracture energy can be determined from the material properties. Numerical analysis of uni-directional coupon experiments is performed to determine the input values and response of the lower bound fracture energy. The lower bound fracture energy implementation results in an abrupt drop in stress when the material strength is reached. Increasing the lower bound fracture energy by a minimum of 2% prevented numerical inconsistencies. Progressive failure analysis of multi-directional coupon experiments validated an increase of 10% for the lower bound values. The use of lower bound fracture energy for non-linear buckling analysis is verified with progressive failure analysis of the buckling experiments. The lower bound fracture energy, increased by 10%, approximates the ultimate strength of six tests with an average difference of 7.7%. To analyse the non-linear buckling behaviour of a GFRP plate, a buckling curve is created by varying the plate thickness. The influence of geometric imperfections on a plate's buckling strength is studied by applying different initial imperfections. Two types of boundary conditions are used to analyse if they result in a different buckling curve. A difference in the buckling strength reduction factor of 0.1 is found. Initial imperfections reduce the buckling strength of the material, which is most apparent for plate slenderness around 1.0.

This is the basis for our first research question “How can we incorporate the IMI into technology to care for PwDs?"". We answer this by dividing the guidelines for IMI into functional components with their own responsibilities. This allows for more independent development of these components. We also research one of the components, a playlist generator. This leads us to our second research question ""Assuming knowledge of a list of preferred music for a user, can we generate playlists which better regulate emotions than a random shuffle?"". Our generator is based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and allows for a target to be set in the 2D valence-arousal space. This was tested in an online experiment with 22 participants. The control group listened to a random shuffle of their preferred music. The experimental group listened to a playlist generated by the MDP. The target was set to a valence &gt; 0.75 (valence ranging from 0 to 1). A significantly higher final valence for the experimental group was observed, showing a clear improvement over the control group when the goal is to positively influence the valence.

(mentor); Barnhoorn, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Argillaceous (clay-rich) host formations for radioactive waste geological repositories are extensively researched for their capability to decrease the hydraulic conductivity of fractures over time (i.e. self-sealing). This self-sealing behavior is beneficial in the context of radioactive repositories as the excavation of these spaces unavoidably induce fractures in a region called the excavation damaged zone (EDZ), allowing for radioactive particles to leak into the surrounding environment and groundwater. Despite knowing the mechanisms for self-sealing (e.g. swelling of clay minerals), more research is needed into the complexities of self-sealing to fully understand and effectively utilize it widely. To facilitate research of swelling in induced fractures, a quantified method of fracture characterization using morphological descriptors is developed to provide insight into the morphological state of the fracture surface and its influence on the self-sealing capacities of argillaceous rocks. This was carried out by identifying morphological descriptors of a rough surface and their relation to roughness, as it pertains to macroscopic and microscopic roughness. A dynamic script was developed capable of: analyzing and quantifying morphological descriptors of roughness in 2 and 3-dimensions, calculating the surface area of a rough surface, and calculating hydraulic conductivities (kx and ky) of a discrete fracture. This method was tested using two samples of Opalinus Clay (OPA) from the Mont Terri underground research laboratory (URL) in Switzerland. Furthermore, derived data of heterogeneous morphology, along with surface area and hydraulic conductivity, is used to discuss the limitations and constraints of the developed method and compare 2-dimensional versus 3-dimensional morphological analysis to determine what combination of analysis fully captures the breadth of morphological information. It was determined that the morphological descriptors of amplitude, amplitude density, and the bearing area curve (BAC) are suitable descriptors to define the microscopic and macroscopic roughness of a rough surface, where both forms of roughness are defined in the context of influence from local maximums (asperities) and local minimums (valleys) of the surface. Comparison of the 2 and 3-dimensional analyses of these morphological descriptors shows that a combination of the 2D BAC, 3D amplitude, and 2D amplitude densities both fully capture the breadth of morphological information and provide an easier means of interpretation. Using Delaunay triangulation on the surfaces of both OPA samples, the calculated upper and lower bounds of surface area for sample 1 is: 2267.37mm2 and 942.09mm2 and is: 2377.64mm2 and 959.73mm2 for sample 2. Compared to the planar surface area of each OPA sample analyzed, this corresponds to an 847 - 2039% increase for OPA sample 1 and a 998 - 2399% increase in surface area for OPA sample 2. The calculated hydraulic conductivities kx and ky for sample 1 is: 1.78×10−7 m/s and 7.75×10−7 m/s and is: 8.01×10−9 m/s and 2.1×10−7 m/s for sample 2. This is compared to the hydraulic conductivity of the Opalinus clay material, which is 2×10−13 m/s. Future research into discrete fracture characterization using morphological descriptors should focus on increasing the computational efficiency of the existing code, improving the surface area calculations, and transforming the matrices of data into one points of data for easier comparison of discrete fractures across multiple samples. In doing so, it is hoped that this small contribution will aid in understanding morphology influence on swelling development in induced fractures in argillaceous geomaterial.","Argillaceous; Quantified Characterization; Discrete Fracture; Swelling; Opalinus Clay; Fracture Descriptors","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Understanding what needs to be built in quality in addition to quantity is key to a sustainable housing market. Hence, this thesis researched whether and how housing preferences of (aspiring) owner occupiers in the Dutch housing market have changed due to the Corona crisis. The change in housing preferences was researched through a survey inquiring expressed stated preferences for dwelling attributes. Quantitative and qualitative data of 1458 useful respondents combined showed that due to Corona, for 17.8% their housing preferences changed for one or more housing attributes, and thus their preferred dwelling had changed. Per attribute, an average of 3.4% of the respondents changed their preference. Most changes relate to working from home, which severed the link between the home and the workplace, enabling as well as causing people to move further away, and which necessitates space in and outside the dwelling. Accordingly, the crisis has had the biggest effect on the preferred number of rooms in a dwelling. The number of rooms is imperative, not the size. The apartment decreased in popularity, and the preference for dwelling types with a garden increased. The functionality which respondents seek of their outdoor space are enabling social possibilities, providing entertainment and supporting mental health. The living environment for which people are willing to move further away should provide greenery, nature nearby, space, tranquility and privacy. It appears that due to the crisis the willingness to pay has increased as housing has increased in importance. The Corona crisis has had more effect on the housing preferences of multi person households with children than on other households. The crisis has had an excessive effect on households living in highly urban places. Four out of five respondents expect their changed preferences to be permanent, in particular regarding the number of rooms, the dwelling size and the preferred outdoor space. The preferred price range is expected to change again as the micro and macro level financial circumstances change. It needs to be kept in mind that this regards expectancy of respondents and thus regard uncertainties. The results need to be interpreted with caution as the data suggests a discrepancy in the level of ideality or reality which respondents have conjugated in their expressed preferences. Lastly, the effect of Corona on housing preferences might be bigger than currently observed, since identifying Corona as the cause for changing preferences seemed to be difficult when the preferences concerned diffuse attributes. Additionally, the current extremely high macro level constraints constrain respondents to the point where their new preferences might not be able to manifest.","Stated Housing preferences; Corona Crisis; Owner-occupied Housing market; Socio-economic circumstances; Housing attributes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Ports also enhance the import of marine sediment by channel and basin deepening. This results in the need for extensive maintenance and sediment management. Finding an effective and efficient sediment man­agement strategy is difficult. This research dives into the current sediment management approaches and innovations to develop a decision-­making approach to find the most suitable and sustainable sed­iment management strategy for a port.<br/><br/>There are several ways to optimize the sediment management in a port. With the principle to con­ sider sediment as a value resource to the port and the coastal system, rather than a waste, the sediment management hierarchy is obtained. This hierarchy consists of Prevent and Reduce, Recycle and Reuse and Disposal to find a sustainable sediment management strategy. Various Prevent and Reduce and Recycle and Reuse examples and methods are analysed in this research to identify their potential for sustainable sediment management. Furthermore, based on literature study, expert interviews and a workshop at Arcadis input is generated to propose a decision­-making approach. This research devel­ops an approach and a tool considering all the aspects of sediment management and for assessing potential strategies for sediment management in a port.<br/><br/>The decision­-making approach considers four steps to find a sediment management strategy. The first step, sediment management objectives, defines the objectives of the stakeholders for the strategy. In the second step, fit to case, all the sediment management methods are considered and the potential strategies are defined. The third step, assessment of potential strategies, assesses the performance of each strategy with performance indicators in the decision­-making tool. The performance indicators are selected based on the assessment categories and objectives. In the final step, meeting the objectives, the most suitable strategy is proposed and described for the long-­term sediment management in the port. This approach supports the process to optimize sediment management in a port.<br/><br/>The proposed decision-­making approach is applied and further developed with a case study on Porto Amboim. Porto Amboim is a port on the west coast of Angola. The port operates for the offshore industry and is currently experiencing sedimentation problems. The northward directed natural long­ shore sediment transport is interrupted by the port’s breakwater, resulting in sedimentation around the breakwater and at the lee side of the breakwater. This interruption disturbs the sediment balance in the region causing erosion problems at the down drift side of the port. The decision­making approach and tool are used to find a potential sediment management strategy for Porto Amboim. This potential strat­egy for Porto Amboim uses a sediment trap to manage the sediment in the region, ensuring sufficient port operations and restoring the sediment balance along the coast.<br/><br/>In order to use the approach in a generic way the results are reflected upon and a validation on the approach is performed. The reflection showed some uncertainties and limitations to the approach and tool because of the available information on the case. However, still two suitable strategies have been obtained for Porto Amboim. In the validation the approach has been applied on a second case study. This validation showed the potential for generic use of the decision-making approach and tool for sediment management. From the reflection and validation can be concluded that the available information determines the level of detail of the assessment of the potential strategies.<br/><br/>The main objective of this study was to explore the potential dredging and sediment management strategies to optimize sediment management in the port towards more sustainable methods, develop a decision-­making tool and apply the tool in a specific case study. From this research the following can be concluded, the decision­-making approach is considered a suitable approach to find a sediment management strategy for a port. All aspects of sediment management are considered and assessed. Therefore, further development of the tool and innovations in more aspects of sediment management are recommend. Yet, this research, the approach, and the innovative methods for sediment manage­ ment show a great potential for more sustainable maintenance strategies in the future.<br","Sediment management; Decision-making; Ports; sustainable development; Sedimentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The main contaminants present in groundwater are iron, ammonium and manganese, which are sequentially removed in rapid sand filters by a combination of biological and chemical processes. Currently, limited knowledge of the removal mechanisms challenges the design of new drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). As a result, different treatment schemes are used to treat groundwater with a similar composition. We hypothesize that the difference in plant configuration does not affect the stratification of removal processes. In the present work, the spatial distribution of taxonomic and functional microbiological profiles and physical-chemical removal mechanisms were investigated in two DWTPs with similar incoming water but different treatment schemes. One plant employs a dual bed filter, while the other uses two sequential filters. Concentration profiles and composition of the coating on the sand showed sequential removal of iron and manganese, while ammonium removal was ubiquitous. Activity batch tests revealed section-specific manganese removal mechanisms: adsorption in the first section and oxidation in the second section. The latter is the dominant process in full-scale filters. Manganese oxidation capacity remained constant over the height of the second section. Contrarily, ammonia removal was highly stratified in there. The highest ammonium removal rates were observed at the top section of the filter. Furthermore, ammonium removal rates were higher in the second section compared to the first one. In accordance, metagenomic analysis revealed higher abundances of nitrifying organisms in the second sections. Besides, co-existence of nitrifiers and iron-oxidizers was observed in the top layer, in contrast to the common opinion that iron removal has to be complete before nitrification can start. We (i) conclude that similar distributions in removal mechanisms and genomic profiles were observed in both DWTPs, regardless of plant configuration, (ii) provide the first holistic quantitative analysis of the biological and chemical reactions in full-scale rapid sand filters and, (iii) to our knowledge, prove for the very first time that iron hydroxides on the sand grains adsorb manganese under aerobic conditions, using both adsorption and desorption tests.","Rapid sand filters; drinking water treatment; metagenomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

(mentor); Eral, H.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Nephrolithiasis is a disease of the urinary tract system, caused by accumulating waste products which form small stones. It is known to affect people all over the world, with a prevalence in populations as high as 16.7 % in North East Thailand and 18.5 % in uranium workers in Eastern Tennessee, USA. The most found stones are Calcium (&#x1d436;&#x1d44e;)Oxalate (&#x1d442;&#x1d465;)based crystals, which form when their concentrations are supersaturated in the kidney, thus exceeding their solubility limit. The most common forms of CaOxcrystals in urine are the stable Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (COM) and the metastable Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD). If they grow too large and get stuck, medical surgery is necessary to prevent kidney failure. It is therefore necessary to understand this form of biomineralization within the human body to ensure proper treatment and prevention. This study focuses on mimicking the situation in the collecting duct of the kidney. This is done in a 295&#x1d465;45 &#x1d707;&#x1d45a;T-shaped microchannel, wherin a &#x1d436;&#x1d44e;solution enters through one inlet and an &#x1d442;&#x1d465;solution through a second, such that the combined fluid flowing through the main channel is supersaturated. &#x1d436;&#x1d44e; and &#x1d442;&#x1d465; are dissolved in either water or artificial urine based on the works of Streit et al. In this manner, the following effects are studied: the effect of varying average velocity, the effect of adding an amount of the natural inhibitor Osteopontin in the &#x1d442;&#x1d465;-inlet, and the effect of changing the &#x1d436;&#x1d44e; to &#x1d442;&#x1d465; ratio in urine conditions. Besides the microfluidic experiments, three models are applied to understand the ongoing phenomena: the Surface Reaction Model (SRM)as an analytical model of the transport-reaction kinetics at the crystal surface, the Analytical Microchannel Model (AMM) as an analytical model of the momentum and mass transport through the microchannel, and the COMSOL model as a numerical model of the microchannel made in the Matlab program COMSOL. With the latter momentum and mass transport through the channel are calculated and the mass transport results are combined with Jess Urine Expert to calculate supersaturation profiles at the channel bottom, where the crystals grow. The number for the transport reaction kinetics of the crystal surface points out that the surface reaction limits the growth, not the mass transport. LowDamköhler numbers for the transport-reaction kinetics in the entire microchannel also point this out.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-03","","","","Applied Physics","kidney stone project",""

However, architects face several challenges due to high levels of urbanization, lower financials for projects and the emergence of new professionals and contracts, that lessen the scopes of architects. Architects in developing nations face additional problems due to lower financial capacity, weak governance, and political instability. The vulnerable nature of the construction industry along with additional problems faced by developing countries paralyze the development of architecture practices in the Philippines. There is a need to adjust traditional professional practices to create more opportunities for Architecture Engineering and Construction professionals. This research focuses on how architecture professional practices in the Philippines create future-proof business models by integrating corporate real-estate management services.<br/>The study creates a framework for Philippine architects to expand their business opportunities through adapting practices and techniques used by Dutch architects. Through a qualitative multiple case-study approach, the business model transitions between purely architectural firms to architecture-CREM practices of three Dutch architecture firms are analyzed using the Business Model Canvas by Osterwalder et al. (2010). After which, archetypes based on these three companies are created and then tested in the Philippine context through Expert Interviews. Feedback on the adaptability of each archetype’s business model and profile are discussed. The results indicate that the most adaptable architecture-CREM business models for the Philippines are those that focus on CREM activities within the Construction and Maintenance quadrants within the Project Lifecycle (Emmitt, 1999).

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis constitutes a part of the ""IMPRESS"" project which is aiming at the production of bio-plastics by utilizing hemicellulosic hydrolysates. The hydrolysate stream, after following the steps of acid hydrolysis and neutralization, consists of monosaccharides (C5/C6 sugars), salt and sugar degradation products. The C5/C6 sugars need to be concentrated by a factor of 10 to be purified afterwards in downstream processes. Evaporation has been the most dominant technology in the sugar treatment sector, however the current study aimed to investigate tubular nanofiltration (NF) and vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) units for concentrating the C5/C6 sugars, as more sustainable alternatives. Synthetic solutions with C5/C6 sugars and salt were used to assess the performance of the NF and MD membranes in terms of sugar and salt rejection before the experiments with the real hydrolysate solution. Among the different NF and MD membranes, the one that met the C5/C6 sugar rejection requirements (&gt;90 %) during the synthetic solution experiments was tested for concentrating the C5/C6 sugars. The most suitable technology for concentrating the C5/C6 sugars was also assessed for its energy consumption. Additionally, single filtration tests were conducted to characterize the NF membranes, while surface tension and contact angle measurements were performed to predict the membrane wetting phenomena during the VMD operation. Based on the C5/C6 sugar rejection values (range of 22-81 %) obtained with ceramic and polymeric NF membranes, it was deduced that the tubular NF membranes were not capable of meeting the C5/C6 sugar concentration goals. The polymeric membranes performed better than the ceramic ones in terms of C5/C6 sugar rejection, with a maximum sugar rejection of 81 %. However, the polymeric membranes were found to be more prone to fouling, showing a maximum decrease of 34 % in the water permeability after 4 hours of operation with the hydrolysate solution. Additionally, the characterization of the NF membranes based on the Donnan Steric Pore Model (DSPM) revealed membrane pore sizes larger than those provided by the manufacturer. On the contrary, the 0.2 μm MD membrane showed &gt;99 % of C5/C6 sugar rejection and was used for the sugar concentration tests. The maximum C5/C6 sugar concentration factor (CF) achieved with the VMD was 8 with a negligible sugar loss (&lt;1 %) in the permeate, indicating that concentrating the C5/C6 sugars by a factor of 10 is feasible with this technology. Surface tension and contact angle measurements disclosed inconsistencies in the hydrophobicity of the MD membrane, which can be linked to the membrane wetting phenomena occurred during the VMD operation. The fouling of the MD membrane (50 % of flux decrease after 39 hours of operation) was found to be reversible with complete flux recovery after chemical cleaning and drying of the membrane. The energy assessment of the VMD technology showed that the main energy consumer was the cooler, contributing to 96 % of the total consumed energy. Based on the cooler's efficiency, the energy consumption of the VMD unit was calculated to be in the range of 207-736 KWh/m<sup>3</sup> of distillate. When compared with multi-effect evaporators with up to three effects, the VMD was found to be more energy efficient. Investigating less energy-intensive alternatives for concentrating the C5/C6 sugars, experiments with electrodialysis (ED) showed 90 % removal of both acid and salt from the raw and neutralized hydrolysate water, respectively, making it feasible for reverse osmosis (RO) membranes to be further tested for concentrating the C5/C6 sugars. Therefore, a treatment scheme of ED and tubular RO membranes is proposed for further research on concentrating the C5/C6 sugars. Overall, a pre-treatment step with the most permeable ceramic NF membrane is suggested, as evinced by the high color removal achieved (elimination of big foulants) and the high permeation of the C5/C6 sugars and salt.","C5/C6 sugars; dewatering hydrolysates; lignocellulosic biomass; tubular nanofiltration; vacuum membrane distillation; energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-03","","","","","",""

In the Netherlands itself there is a need of constructing 1 million affordable new homes by 2030. Such a massive demand for new buildings has given rise to a need for a solution for mass customization of architectural configurations. Simple repetition or a badly configured building is not ideal and can lead to a lot of social and environmental problems. Generative Design can offer a digital solution for this mass customization problem. It can utilize the power of Artificial intelligence in design to generate a system where users can create custom solutions rapidly. The second part of the customization problem is the user participation in determining the customization goals. More often than not the end users of the built space do not get an opinion in the configuration process and this leads to unsatisfactory and undemocratic design solutions producing urban inequality. <br/>In this thesis a comprehensive digital solution by means of a digital platform is provided in an attempt to solve the 3D layout problem in a participatory manner. The platform built in the thesis is intended for designing Open buildings at a scale of support structures. The concept of Open buildings calls for separation of the structure and the infill layer making the buildings open for modification and customization. <br/>The 3D-Layout configuration problem in its full sophistication is a classical example of a wicked problem. So, in this thesis the problem is methodically broken down into a group of nested smaller problems with local goals to achieve the global spatial planning goals and various computational methods are tested for solving the problems. The nature of the smaller problems is often iterative hence a robust decision support system is also designed for stakeholder participation and control over the problem-solving method. The computational methods used in the thesis are inspired from various other disciplines like Computer science, Industrial engineering, Operations research, etc. where they are used to solve similar problems in their respective domains. Techniques like Multi-agent systems, Multi-criteria decision analysis, Techniques for solving the clustering and packing problems in operations research are explored to solve the various nested smaller problems in the 3D-Layout problem.<br/>Finally, all the methods developed in the project are used to solve a test case for the design of a mixed used Open building consisting of Housing and Commercial spaces in the Buiksloterham region which is one of the first circular neighbourhoods in Amsterdam to showcase the potential of the platform and the feed forward design process developed in the thesis.<br","Generative Design; mass customization; 3D Layout problem; Agent based modelling; Participatory Design; Gamification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","52.39776394266775, 4.90079324307301"

In the Netherlands, 95% of building products used in thisindustry are recycled, usually into a product with a lower value (Rijkswaterstaat &amp; RIVM, 2015).However, if products would be reused in their original function, this could save resources, CO2emissions and financial costs (Arora et al., 2020; Hosseini et al., 2015; Iacovidou &amp; Purnell,2016; Mulder et al., 2007). Value Retention Processes (VRPs) that focus on bringing a usedproduct back into a useable state, are necessary for building product reuse to occur. Whileresearch into VRPs, in general, is emerging, research on the scale of building products islacking. As a result, it is unclear how individual building products could be reused and whichvalue-retaining activities need to occur to enable reuse. Construction companies could benefitfrom a typology system that helps them to identify which VRP can be applied to used buildingproducts so they can make better-informed decisions on how to reuse these products. In thisthesis, existing knowledge on the factors influencing the Reuse Potential of used buildingproducts is combined with the experiences of practitioners in the field and connected topotentially applicable VRPs.

Also in architecture and urban planning fields, the effect of climate on buildings and cities has always had a role in the design process, nowadays especially when it comes to sustainability related topics. An interesting element within climate is the microclimate, which is a small area where climate circumstances are different then in the surrounding area. For example in an urban area the temperature difference between an area in a big city and the rural area around it can be up to 10°C, due to influences of surrounding buildings and materials. In the design process often more general weather data is used in calculation, this while they can differ a lot from reality. Modern tools make it possible to simulate the microclimate. One of these tools is ENVI-met. However, inputting 3D models into this software is mostly a manual process. This while a lot of information that is necessary is already available in existing architectural and urban design models. There is just no way to input this information into the software.<br/><br/>In this research a method is developed for combining detailed information from BIM models (IFC), with information about the surroundings from 3D City models (CityGML), and translating them to the ENVI-met format, so that these models can be used as input models for microclimate simulation in ENVI-met. This is done by creating a command line tool that extracts the necessary data from both input files, combining and converting it, and then writing it to a file in the ENVI-met format. Also guidelines and requirements for the input files will be established.<br/><br/>This is done by first establishing what information is necessary for microclimate simulation in ENVI-met and how this information needs to be represented, and then finding out where this information can be found in the intended input files, and how it is represented in there. From this can be concluded what information can be taken from which input file and the characteristics that are necessary for their correct use in the process can be established. Then the conversion tool itself can be developed, where the data is transformed to the same coordinate system and format, so that it can be combined and written to the ENVI-met format. In the last step the results are checked by doing a small case study and running the microclimate simulation.<br/><br/>This way, IFC and CityGML models can be used as input for microclimate simulation software ENVI-met, by using the conversion tool developed for this research and the provided guidelines.","IFC; CityGML; ENVI-met; Microclimate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Peters, R.Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The volume and density of geospatial data is constantly increasing as newer acquisition techniques are developed to create higher-resolution datasets and more countries are creating country-wide datasets such as point clouds. However, methods to deal with this increase in the amount of data are lagging behind and the developments in computer hardware are no longer moving fast enough to compensate. Especially the ability to load and process datasets into the main memory of a computer is becoming more difficult. Therefore, to work with these massive datasets more modern techniques need to be used. In this thesis on one such method for dealing with these massive datasets is explored; streaming simplification of geometries.<br/><br/>Streaming of geometries relies on processing small portions of a geometric dataset at a time, only keeping as much information in memory as is necessary, instead of the whole dataset. This method ensures that memory bottlenecks are prevented and ever-increasingly large datasets can be processed. Processing done on a LIDAR dataset can range from creating rasterized surface or terrain models, to creating a triangulation. Triangulations are an imporant starting point for other analysis techniques such as watershed calculations, line of sight, or noise propagation. However, large datasets of high density lead to large triangulations which are still too complex for these techniques to work with.<br/><br/>To create more manageable triangulations it is necessary to simplify them, which means finding a subset of the vertices that best approximates the original surface. This can be done randomly, or feature-aware by taking into account the shape of the dataset that is being simplified and ensuring data is kept where it is relevant. The AHN3 dataset is so large that simplification cannot be done using traditional techniques. Therefore, to achieve simplification of the AHN3 dataset, this thesis focuses on the modification of an existing methodology for creating streaming triangulations by incorporating a simplification step.<br/><br/>The methodology implemented in this thesis consists of determining where a simplification algorithm can be introduced within the existing streaming pipeline, as well as determining which existing simplification techniques are applicable. After defining possible locations for a simplification module within the streaming pipeline, various methods are created and tested on different sizes of dataset. These methods are: random simplification, decimation, refinement, and a novel medial axis transform based approach. For the refinement method a number of different implementations are investigated.<br/><br/>After the initial results are analyzed, the decimation and medial axis transform algorithms are rejected due to extremely long processing times or a lack of accurate results, respectively. The refinement implementations are able to produce accurate simplified triangulations in a reasonable amount of time, where the best performing method hardly introduces a slowdown in processing at all. Using the fastest algorithm (FCFS) 4 billion points are processed in less than 11 hours, against 13 hours without simplification. Compared to other methods the accuracy of the methodology is similar for all of the approaches. However, the number of points that can be processed per second is less when compared to existing research. The best performing algorithm is a novel method defined as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), as it has the best ratio between vertex error and computation time.<br/><br/>The results of this research show that creation and simplification of a massive Delaunay TIN is possible and produces acceptable results, achieving RMSE's below 0.2m consistently. Despite simplification, the size of the resulting datasets is still often too large to fit within the main memory of a computer and will still require streaming processing to perform further calculations on larger areas. This suggests that with the current ever-growing datasets it is relevant to explore how all different types of calculations can be performed in a streaming pipeline, possibly allowing these to be chained one after another.<br/><br/>All methods created for this thesis are found here: \url{https://github.com/mdjong1/simpliPy}","tin simplification; streaming geometries; ahn3; drop-heuristic decimation; refinement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

And so, by understanding wind flow behaviour within the urban environment, we can use the increasingly available open data to contribute to the design of healthy cities. This Master’s thesis presents a methodology to compute urban morphological parameters and its effect on potential wind velocity. The proposed method may serve as an complementary method to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation or scaled wind tunnel tests. The research question in this thesis is: Can we use urban morphology to automatically calculate potential increase in wind velocity? To answer this, first an introduction to wind flows in the urban environment<br/>is presented. Then, several methodologies are presented to compute the urban morphological parameters, such as the Urban Canyon, wind- or leeward facade, Angle of Attack and terrain roughness length. The method relies on the use of a Voronoidiagram, with cells describing the morphology. After, the urban morphological parameters are related to potential wind velocity through a scoring method. Using two meteorological stations inside the area of interest, the mean wind velocity is compared to the scores. The result show that both stations show a higher mean wind velocity for higher scores. However, more research is necessary to validate this outcome and a recommendation is given to compare the result of this thesis to a CFD simulation.","Urban Morphology; Voronoi; Wind Velocity; Wind potential; Open Data; Urban Canyon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The main topic of this paper is the performance of Attention LSTM and LSTM models in the stock price prediction of single companies. To evaluate the performance of Attention LSTM in stock price prediction, the researcher designed several tests with different input lengths and two ways of splitting data: sliding window and feed-forward input. Based on the comparison, the result could be seen clearly that Attention LSTM could have better performance than LSTM with suitable test procedure 'sliding window'. LSTM could performed better with 'feed-forward input' approach. However, Attention LSTM could still run faster in this approach so it could help in tasks with large sequence length required high speed.","Attention; LSTM; Stock prediction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For that purpose, a standardised method to assess the spatial influence of surfaces on the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was developed. This study aims to reshape this model into a statistical dependence model which is more flexible regarding missing data. To this end, we used a Non-Parametric Bayesian Network (NBPN). We created a model driven by both data and expert knowledge, that is capable of dealing with input data layers with a grid resolution up to 20 m. Results show that training the model with only 20 sample points did not affect the performance considerably, compared to using 2,000 data points. Inclusion of a layer with sky view factor mainly improves the estimation of observations in the tails of the distribution. The model predicts the PET with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1 to 2 ºC, dealing adequately with missing data layers. With this limited amount of necessary input, the NPBN in our study helps in standardising the assessment of heat stress outside the borders of the Netherlands. Also, our model offers a framework to make a first assessment regarding the effect of NBSs on heat stress.","Dependence modelling; non-parametric Bayesian Networks; Statistical Analysis; Heat stress; Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET); NPBN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Cities without green alienate people from nature, deteriorate ecological systems and directly harm personal well-being. Limited open areas and many sealed surfaces in today’s cities raise the need for a renewed green space approach that fits in an increasingly dense and compact urban landscape; an approach in which green space is not limited to large open spaces at ground level, but one where greenery is truly integrated with built structures. The concept of compact urban green space (CUGS) is introduced in this study to refer to green space compatible with this approach. Too often, current CUGS on buildings and in small spaces solely serves aesthetic purposes and is treated as mere (architectural) decoration. This attitude results in pragmatic but disconnected interventions with little added value to ecology and well-being. <br/>This study puts forward that urban planners and landscape architects should embrace these new and unconventional green spaces, because, when planned and designed from a larger social-ecological perspective, compact urban green space can functionally solve several urban challenges simultaneously while also improving ecological quality and human well-being. This graduation project explores the qualitative aspects of small green spaces that result in major improvements in ecological resilience and personal well-being. It is concluded that CUGS can provide quality for people and nature. E.g. by encouraging stewardship of local communities and allocating space for natural processes.<br/>A pattern language approach is used to better understand the relations between a variety of CUGS patterns across different scales. Novel CUGS patterns, such as rooftop landscapes, bioreceptive building envelopes and topographic building blocks are tested in the spatial and ecological context of Rotterdam. The resulting spatial framework for the city centre guides the development of future CUGS. A design experiment performed in the neighbourhood of the Wijnhaven Eiland shows that multidimensional green structures and networks can improve well-being and ecological resilience in Rotterdam when they add value at different scale levels and are fundamentally integrated into the design of the city.","Compact urban green space; Ecological resilience; Well-being; Rotterdam; Urban ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.916508400340525, 4.487010112264623"

But does this have to be the case for future urbanization as well? In the Dutch approach to flood safety, a dilemma appears to exist between (sectoral) flood safety on the one hand and biodiversity and flood resilience on the other. Where pursuit of flood safety, especially in a context of extreme climate scenario’s, might continue at the cost of biodiversity and resilience.<br/><br/>The thesis is on the reconciliation of the anthropogenic and natural systems of the Dutch Delta. It proposes a re-positioning of the relationship between peopel and nature. The concept and understanding of landscape identity is an expression of this relationship. In the case of the Dutch delta, landscape and flood safety are inevitably intertwined, and a certain relationship of human mastery over nature becomes apparent of this intertwining. The Dutch landscape is historically shaped through hydrology, geology, air and climate, however, contemporary landscapes represent severe anthropogenic intervening, enclosing and directing the dynamics of hydrology, geology, air and climate.<br/>This thesis aims to understand the relationship between people and nature, through landscape Identity, the mutual relationship between people and landscape, shaped by and shaping landscape characteristics and individual and collective identity. Subsequently, proposing and testing a method for altering this relationship, based on the following hypothesis: Shifting the technocratic understanding of flood safety to align [again] with the trajectories of hydrology, geology, air and climate, which are both fundamentally shaping the landscape, allows the transition towards a biodiverse and flood resilient delta. Rethinking the relationship between people and nature, through landscape, is therefore essential. The concept of Building with Nature is tested as an approach to align the understanding of flood safety with the dynamics of air, water and soil. Proposing this re-alignment as the new critical condition for delta urbanization in transition towards a biodiverse and resilient delta. Ultimately, proving this apparent dilemma between flood safety on the one hand and biodiversity and resilience on the other, to be void.","Landscape Identity; Flood Safety; Building with Nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

In the last few decades, the city has grown immensely and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. Therefore, it looks across the IJ-river to redevelop its northern city part. The former harbour, industry and labour-class neighbourhoods need revitalisation after years of neglect. However, current development is predominantly focused on the waterfront and does little to integrate the low-density areas beyond. After years of neglect and isolation, the existing population fear the new developments that attract people with different lifestyles to Amsterdam-Noord. As the pressure to urbanise Amsterdam-Noord increases, it is required to consider how it can be adapted to manage the densification and urbanisation. The gap between new and old (development and people) is striking and needs to be bridged. This thesis explores how by increasing urban vitality, this gap can be bridged.<br/>Urban vitality can be experienced in the public realm. It is precisely there where people can meet and mingle. Urban vitality is a quality of cities that stimulates liveliness and liveability. It requires diversity, concentration of people and accessible and inclusive public life and functions. How to achieve urban vitality is researched in literature and by using reference cases. This is then translated into a system of patterns, and these are applied at two strategic locations on 3 sites. <br/>The three design explorations have different approaches for increasing urban vitality. Beemsterstraat I strives to fit in the existing urban fabric and activate the nodes to stimulate urban life. Beemsterstraat II uses additions to make a residential neighbourhood more active. Finally, the kampferfoelieweg is more drastic as it incorporates many new buildings to patch up and define left-over space and forms a dynamic link between many neighbourhoods. Although these three approaches vary on the implementation, the intention is similar: to provide meeting places and link communities through public life and awareness of others at strategic locations in a regional network. Operating stakeholder relations, continuous adaptation and maintenance of the built environment, engaging and empowering the local community is crucial to preserve urban vitality.","Urban Vitality; public space; liveliness; Amsterdam-Noord","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.395556, 4.950389"

This project therefore generates a spatial approach for the acceptance of urban shrinkage in Schouwen-Duiveland, making use of the local qualities in order to show that shrinkage can also offer opportunities. The local qualities in the case of Schouwen-Duiveland are heritage to guarantee the quality of life and the increasing target groups, holidaymakers and the elderly, to maintain a certain degree of liveliness. Since shrinkage is a nuanced phenomenon and a zoom was needed to illustrate the interventions, three different types of interdependent settlements were examined. The shrinking and highly regarded Brouwershaven has the most complex and extensive approach. In the event that Brouwershaven shrinks extremely, the pre-war buildings can be used as an elderly or holiday home, the expansion neighborhoods can be demolished, freeing up space to restore the historic fortifications. In this way, shrinkage does not have to be a disastrous development and added value can even be created. Shrinkage thus certainly does not have to be imposed, but it is useful to take such a possible future into account now and to have flexible interventions ready.","Urban shrinkage; Potentials; Local qualities; Schouwen-Duiveland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.725591, 3.912556"

These territories are identified as territories somewhere in-between the urban and rural. Typical land uses in the TiB are warehouses, sport complexes, allotment gardens and small-scale industrial activities. The TiB are often considered to be underused, lack spatial quality (sense of place) and are under mounting pressure of urban densification. However, the rich diversity of land uses and abundance of semi open spaces in the TiB provides unique habitats and social-ecological opportunities, different from exclusively urban and rural landscapes. Therefore we, as urban planners and designers, should reconsider conventional planning and design approaches towards these territories and acknowledge the social and ecological potentials of these territories.<br/> <br/>The thesis project proposes an unconventional design perspective that makes space for the territory in-between and embraces its true unorganized and multi-functional nature. The design strategy that was developed through a research by design process is called: the recovering membrane and describes the vision for the territory around the urban fringes of the city that resembles the functioning of a membrane at landscape scale. This design strategy was developed in particular for the city of Rotterdam. The recovering membrane is defined as a spatial layer of interaction between two distinctive living environments –urban and rural- and various human and non-human actors in them. The membrane aims to bridge the urban-rural divide, enhance biodiversity and sense of place in the in-between territories at the urban fringes of the city. The proposed strategy is supported by landscape ecology theories on ecological edges and boundaries and a theory on sense of place experience emphasizing the importance of human-nature interactions.<br/><br/>By using these theories, the vision for the recovering membrane is elaborated at local scale for an in-between territory near Hoek van Holland. The research shows that nature-inclusive spatial design elements can mutually benefit the ecological quality of the in-between territory as well as the sense of place experience at local scale. This integrated design approach is described as nature-based placemaking. The spatial transformation of the in-between territory into a membrane landscape can be organized into three development stages at respectively: short, medium and long time period. (1) Engagement and activation of the local community through a nature-based placemaking process. (2) Connectivity and integration of the in-between territory within its surroundings through social-ecological corridors. (3) Re-distribution of clustered land-uses in order to strengthen the heterogeneous nature of the in-between territory. The latter is of specific importance as it seems that greater landscape heterogeneity does not only cause for greater ecosystem resilience and biodiversity, but also greater sense of place experience. To enable this new approach a new governing body is proposed: the Membrane Management Group.","Territories in-between; Social-ecological development; Urban fringe; Sense of place; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.9244,4.4777"

Existing short-sighted trends in urban development processes that are fragmented pose a threat towards a just city, as seen evidently in Amsterdam Zuidoost district which consistently ranks poorly in social, economic and spatial dimensions of well being. The city is currently in the process of building a large stock of new housing within the existing city(densification), while also transitioning to a different socio-technical regime in terms of energy, economic logic (circular economy) and climate adaptation.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is crucial to adopt an integrated approach towards urban development at this juncture taking into consideration the socio-economic and ecological urgencies of Amsterdam Zuidoost. One that enables vulnerable populations to be a part of the process leading to a just distribution of its resultant benefits and burdens.<br/><br/>The aim of this research project is three fold. First is to understand the historicity of urban development processes that led to the current socio-economic, ecological and spatial realities of Amsterdam Zuidoost from a complex systems perspective towards creating a strategic spatial framework.<br/><br/>Second is to evolve a set of patterns that lead to livable communities and sustainable neighborhoods that are spatially just. Third is to evolve an integrated approach towards urban development by operationalising the patterns amongst the complex interrelations between socio-economic, ecological and spatial dimensions of Amsterdam Zuidoost that is co produced by local stakeholders.","Amsterdam; Sustainability; Livability; Spatial Justice; Pattern Language; Integrated Approach; Urban Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.308349, 4.956610"

(mentor); Cannatella, D. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The proximity of rivers stimulated the development of the economy and culture of civilizations throughout the ages. Consequently, the advancements in technology allowed people to influence the riverine systems. In riparian areas, such as the Vistula River Delta, the river was regulated and the land was reclaimed to accommodate agriculture, urbanization and industries. Besides the spatial changes, the anthropogenic alterations have also environmental consequences, namely increased risk of flooding and limited water and sediment retention capacity of the delta. Lowered ecological performance of the riverine edges lead to a higher amount of contaminants being discharged to the Vistula River and subsequently to the Baltic Sea. The pollution caused by human activities as well as severe changes in the climate profoundly affect the state of ecosystems and human health.<br/><br/>Designing for regeneration of socio-ecological systems along the Vistula River is based on understanding the relationships between the pollution flows, flooding and the performance of the riverine edges. The project suggests a systemic transition towards more regenerative riverine landscapes with a focus on the redefinition of the edge space by remodeling landscape topography and the use of specific vegetation. The landscape design provides ecosystem services, including improvement of water quality, flood management, biodiversity and recreation. <br/>The proposal illustrates possible changes in the three exemplary riverine edges, namely an agricultural edge and an underutilized and post-industrial edge in the city of Gdansk. The choice of these types of edges was based on the fact that agriculture is the biggest factor that contributes to the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea (HELCOM, 2015), while the post-industrial edges in Gdansk face environmental and spatial challenges that might become potentialities for future changes.<br/>The design and its possible expansion intend to enhance the ecological, social and economic performance of the Vistula River edges. Higher ecological performance is achieved through the implementation of remediation practices and creating space for flood accommodation. Whereas, social and economic performance is enhanced by new functions and an increase of accessibility and connectedness of the edges. The proposal might act as a model for transitions of the Vistula river tributaries as well as other riverine systems facing similar issues. That is thanks to the set of design principles established in the project. The ambition of the thesis is to contribute to the promotion of ecological awareness and advocacy in Poland.","regeneration; socio-ecological systems; landscape urbanism; water pollution; edge design; remediation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","54.364239, 18.652933"

This erosion causes the soil to be washed away until no soil remains (Dornbush et al, 2006). Ecology, society and urban environments are at risk in coastal cities due to environmental risks. Protection measures, such as sea walls and embankments, are the primary solutions to today’s erosion risks. These protection measures are often expensive, short-term and can have negative influences on other sections of the coastline. The measures influence the processes along the coastline by interruption of longshore sediment transport (Cooper and McKenna, 2007). Currently, cities and their residents are unable to adapt to this increasing erosion and are often exposed to unforeseen and abrupt events that impact their habitat and, therefore, have an influence on the human livability. In the English context, a regional strategy is needed to find a balance between coastal social justice and the continuing risks of Coastal Erosion (Apine, 2011; Alexander et al, 2012; Cooper and McKenna, 2007), which are further investigated and explained in the thesis. This project investigates possible strategies for urban environments to adapt to the increasing erosion rates which is the result of climate change and sea level rise. With the use of mixed methods research, a regional strategy is formulated and implemented in local urban designs. The research method used to achieve the formulation of a strategy is the Data, Opportunities, Challenges &amp; Anecdote (DOCA) method developed by FABRIC (Vafa, 2018). This method uses opportunities and challenges that can be found on a regional scale, but also on the local scale for different coastal cities in the project area. In the thesis this method is used to find local innovation opportunities that can be integrated within a regional urban strategy. This approach considers interdisciplinary and layered approaches with the use of domains that involve defence-resilience, networks, tourism and economy. Within the DOCA method, the six-step approach by Hooimeijer et al (2020) is applied to create a multi-scalar and adaptive planning system. With the use of both these methods, thesis aims to create an urban design as a response to ecological, societal and urban environmental challenges relating to Coastal Erosion effects and spatial planning strategies. The project’s developed regional strategy aims for Regional Resiliency in southeast England with the design of local Sustainable Urban Environments in Bexhill-on-Sea and Hastings.","spatial planning strategies; coastal erosion; coastal management; policy planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","50.854259, 0.573453"

Linear glass elements such as panes have limited freedom of shape. On the other hand, cast glass can be produced into any shape possible. When glass is used in large quantities with large cross-sections, the annealing process can take a long time and require a significant amount of energy. The annealing time must be kept to a minimum to make cast glass a viable option. This is where topology optimisation can play its part. During topology optimisation, the layout of an element is optimised on the given constraints for the specified design domain. A compliance-based optimisation is found to be the most suitable objective function. The software package Ansys and various plugins for McNeel Rhinoceros/Grasshopper are compared on their topology optimisation tool. During this comparison, Ansys is found to be the most suitable software. This is mainly because of the possibility of implementing a cross-sectional constraint during the optimisation, which is needed for implementing a maximum annealing time. The most suitable production method for topology optimised cast glass elements is found to be kiln casting with a 3D printed sand mould. Glass is a brittle material with a low tensile strength compared to its compressive strength. The only type of bridge that can be made entirely in compression, without pre-tensioning, is an arch bridge. This bridge type is used for the final design. The loads considered during structural analysis are the vertical traffic load (distributed and point) and the vertical wind load. The bridge is made from borosilicate glass. This type of glass is used to reduce the effect of temperature on the cast structure of the bridge. Additionally, the supports and connections are designed so that they do not restrain deformation from temperature. Furthermore, the shape and place of the connections and supports ensure the possibility of unequal settlement without the formation of unacceptable stresses. Multiple variant studies are carried out. In the first variant study, optimisation is done on several 2D models to determine the best shape for the bridge's final design. The second variant study focuses on the 3D shape of the bridge and how the bridge is split into manageable segments. The final bridge comprises four cast outer elements, one cast keystone, and a float glass bridge deck. The bridge is simply supported on both sides of the canal. The connections and supports are based on compression and friction and use a polyurethane interlayer. The weight of the final optimised bridge is reduced from 32t to 11.2t with a maximum cross-sectional thickness of 210 mm to get an annealing time of approximately one month. Due to symmetry in the design, only one-fourth of the bridge is optimised. During the optimisation, seven different distributed load scenarios are implemented. For the point load, a region is excluded from optimisation. After optimisation, finite element analysis and manual verifications are performed. <br","Topology Optimisation; Cast Glass; Additive Manufacturing; Pedestrian Bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Decision trees are popular for solving classification or regression problems in machine learning. Heuristic methods are used to build decision tree algorithms that produce models of high accuracy within a short amount of time. An important limitation is that these heuristics locally optimize the decisions of the tree model. Consequently, in recent years, optimal classification tree algorithms have been introduced to strive for global optimality when learning decision trees. Unfortunately, the runtimes for constructing optimal decision trees are quite larger in comparison with the runtimes obtained from heuristic solutions. The study provides a mitigation for this by parallelizing the work of a recently invented optimal decision tree algorithm on multiple cores. There exist different parallel techniques to divide and schedule the work among processors. Our strategy follows the parallel approach that computes optimal decision trees using threads as processing elements in a shared memory space. In the end, we provide the experimental study to show that impressive runtime results of the optimal decision tree algorithm are successfully obtained with the help of the parallelization strategy.<br","multi-threading; classification; decision trees; optimality; parallelization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

We find that the performance drop due to domain shift is related to the shift in pixel values between source and target domain. Colour space transformations seemed to notably impact the network’s performance, opposed to geometric transformations. For the last domain shift we find that the network manages to beat a baseline, from which we can conclude the domain shift is not too severe.

The effect of this concept on the effective Swirl number and flashback propensity was investigated for a radial- and axial swirl generator by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and cold flow Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments on a custom-designed combustor model. Acquired results indicate that with increasing amount of AAI the Swirl number reduces due to both inertial and viscous effects. The flashback propensity also reduces as the axial velocity on the centre-line increases by AAI. For equal Swirl numbers the axial swirl generator was found to have a lower flashback propensity compared to the radial swirl generator, suggesting safer operation.","Swirling flow; Combustor; Lean premixed hydrogen combustion; PIV; CFD; Vortex breakdown; Axial swirl generator; Radial swirl generator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Advanced Propulsion and Power Unit (APPU)","51.988610, 4.376159"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands is facing pressure on the housing market and the prices are increasing drastically. The accessibility to the housing market decreases and moving becomes harder. With the flexibilization of the labour market, more households face income uncertainty, which can affect their possibilities on the housing market. Flexworkers, labourers with a temporary contract and zzpers together are labelled ‘’flexhouseholds’’. The accessibility of flexhouseholds to housing, are dependant of three markets which are connected to one another. These markets are: the housing market, the labour market and the financial market. To understand how the flexhouseholds are affected in their accessibility to the housing market, this thesis aims to answer the question ‘’What are the effects of the flexibilization of the labour market on the accessibility of flexhouseholds on the housing market?’’. The research methods which will be used in order to answer the main question, are divided into two categories. First, a qualitative study will be conducted, this will be done through the use of literature study, source study and the use of interviews. After this is done the quantitative study will be conducted with the DNB households survey. The statistical study will be focused on researching the differences between the permanent households and the flexhouseholds on the housing market. The goal of this research is to give valuable insights on the position of flexhouseholds on the housing, labour and financial market and in understanding how these markets influence one another. The outcomes of this research show that zzp households have the highest accessibility to the housing market of the three flexhousehold groups. Because of their labour agreement additional restrictions on obtaining a mortgage are imposed, such as getting a research forecast, and a lower percentage of the mortgage if the NHG is not used. However, their older age and high incomes makes the effects of their labour agreements minimal, making them equal or sometimes even in a better position than permanent households. For the temporary households, the theory points out that they have the least restrictions in obtaining a owner occupied or rental dwelling. However, in practice they are second in obtaining in a dwelling. This has to do with the young age and therefore lower savings than the zzp households and general lower incomes. The flexworker households have the lowest accessibility because of the restricting factos based on their labour agreements, their financial situation and also their future work perspectives. Financial institutions need to make use of more tailor made mortgages lending, in which the circumstances and characteristics of the flexhouseholds are taken into account.","flexworkers; housing market; labour agreements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eutrophication, decline of fish resources, climate crisis, and sea-level rise are the effect of irreversible anthropogenic actions in the region, which demand to rethink how the sea and territories around it are used now and can be adapted to ensure sustainable development and healthy marine and coastal ecosystems in the future. Besides the environmental challenges in the region, coastal territories along the Gulf of Riga are also experiencing socio-economic restructuring due to a decades-long population decline that is projected to continue in the future. However, in the existing planning documents and development projects the notion of shrinkage and climate adaptation is underrepresented, questioning the acceptance of these irreversible, yet unpredictable processes. Considering these specific local conditions, the adaptation of the existing habitation patterns on the coastline of the Gulf of Riga asks for a specific approach that not only considers the long-term impacts on the natural processes and ecosystems, but also takes into account the depopulation, possible challenges of long-term maintenance and use of these spaces, and the strong cultural connection with nature. The thesis proposes an approach on how to address the climate crisis and shrinkage on the coastline of the Gulf of Riga by using the acceptance of the physical and socio-economic erasure of the coastline as spatial planning and design tool. This approach allows reconceptualizing the notion of sedimentation, discovering and using local material and non-material anthropogenic sediments as the main design elements in the transition of the coastal surface. The multi-scalar design projection envisions the possible transformation towards sustainable degrowth in the region of the Western coast of the Gulf of Riga and shows this transition on an urban scale in the coastal village of Roja. By reinventing the economic activities in the port towards more localized resource use, it is possible to maintain the port infrastructure and provide economic possibilities for the remaining inhabitants. However, the erosion along Krasta street and population decline will continue in the future. As the erasure is happening in a long period of time, the local inhabitants need time to adapt, therefore the project composition along Krasta street in Roja proposes infrastructure and landscape elements to be finite, deteriorate in the landscape, and have a significant cultural meaning. By not intervening in this process and transforming previously inhabited spaces along the coast it is possible to transition towards a more natural coastal landscape with specific anthropogenic material sediments that perform as a reminder of human actions in past. <br","Acceptance; Erosion; Shrinkage; Gulf of Riga","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","57.500243, 22.822618"

To ensure the safe and efficient handling of these goods and protect the hinterland from floods, seaports often construct and maintain a large array of hydraulic structures. Revetments and quay walls are a critical part of this infrastructure. Unfortunately, climate change poses a threat to their structural reliability as extreme sea conditions are expected to become more severe and frequent in the near future. Phenomena such as sea level rise, rising storm surges and wave heights can each result in a decreasing structural reliability for revetments and quay walls along seaports. This thesis describes how a reliability based analysis has been developed to adapt port infrastructure against the impact of climate change in an effective manner. With the creation of computational reliability models, reliability assessments of embankments and quay walls along the Port of Merak and Port of Houston have been performed. Based on findings from these reliability assessments, structural adaptations have been conceptualized and a method has been developed to trial them on cost and efficacy. Next, as to enable the evaluation of structural adaptation on various criteria such as cost – efficacy – and value, adaptation pathway maps and scorecards have been developed. These are consecutively used to set up investment guidelines aimed at providing guidance on which adaptation pathway is advised.","Climate change; Adaptation; Port Infrastructure; Structural Reliability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

When utilizing power naps to combat the negative effects of night shift work, shift workers take a brief nap during their shift. Power napping during night shifts has been proven to be an effective method for reducing many of the common problems caused by working night shifts. In this graduation project, a new power napping solution, called Asper, has been developed for the company NEWAS B.V.. Asper is the result of an extensive design process with multiple iterations. The process started with an analysis phase, followed by ideation and concept development. During the last phase, product development, the Asper was optimized for manufacturing and assembly. The main goal of the design process was to develop a lay-down power nap solution that enabled night shift workers to take an optimal power nap. Through the integration of multiple design aspects, such as ergonomics, aesthetics, usability and manufacturability, this goal was achieved. The final result is a well-developed design that is ready for its 0th production series.","Design; Power nap; Sleep; Night shift; Night shift workers; Nap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The goal of this thesis is to study the effects and advantages of applying constraint programming (CP) to EM. To the best of my knowledge, no previous study has explicitly combined EM and CP. On the topic of applying CP to EM, this thesis explains where it can be applied, as well as its requirements and advantages. Furthermore, it explains a possible approach where a neural network, trained on a simulation model that represents an enterprise model, is embedded into a constraint program. This approach is supported with experiments, that show typical business objectives can be embedded in a constraint program and find solutions to it in a multi-objective context. The main conclusion is that due to CP being a declarative programming technique, business constraints and goals can be effectively modelled into a constraint program, making the approach understandable and intuitive for business analysts to use. This thesis argues alternative approaches to apply CP to EM can also be realised. Some of these, as well as improvements over the proposed method, are also discussed.","Enterprise Modelling; Constraint Programming (CP); machine learning; simulation; Optimisation; socio-technical systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/SytzeAndr/EM_to_CP Repository link GitHub repository with supplementary code","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This has led to taller turbine towers, subjected to larger loads. As a result, Lagerwey turbines experience lateral tower vibrations at different resonance frequencies. These vibrations result in rotor speed measurement disturbances due to tower top roll motion. Such disturbances affect controller performance and induce undesired generator torque variations. Generator torque excites the tower, thus, a closed-loop interaction between the tower and the torque controller exists. A tower model including two resonance frequencies has been obtained through model identification in a simulation environment, which includes tower top rotational velocity as an output. A Kalman filter based on this model is able to provide an accurate estimate of tower signals using the tower top acceleration measurement and the generator torque set point. The tower top rotational velocity estimate is used to filter the rotor speed measurement. In high-fidelity simulation, it is found that in above-rated conditions (where tower vibrations are most severe) tower loads are reduced by 5.85%. In order to obtain a further load reduction, a state-feedback tower damping controller has been developed. Vibration modes are damped individually with user-defined damping ratios. For the designed controller, an average load reduction of 32.5% is achieved at the cost of a 0.8% increase in standard deviation of electric power.","Wind Turbine; Tower; Vibrations; Damping; Kalman Filter; State Estimation; Identification; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Manual analysis of more than 500 queries shows that our tool is able to detect semantic bugs in SQL queries with an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, out of all 191,994 collected queries, we identified a total of 36,818 queries which contain at least one semantic bug, meaning that 19.17% of queries contained some semantic problem in their formulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset of SQL queries extracted from StackOverflow and could later be used for subsequent studies as well.","SQL; Static analysis; Semantic bugs; SQL queries; Detection; Software Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This project was executed in collaboration with MV Design and Matching Futures. These design consultancies initiated an intervention in 2019 to stimulate the energy transition in the neighbourhood Reyeroord in the south of Rotterdam. This intervention used the frame of the night and was therefore called ‘De Nacht Club’ (The Night Club). During this intervention, the perceived safety in the neighbourhood came forward as an issue. In 2021, the design consultancies wanted to proceed with this concept with the new motive of improving the perceived safety in neighbourhoods in the Netherlands.<br/>First, research was needed to identify why or how De Nacht Club could improve the perceived safety in neighbourhoods. Systems thinking is applied to describe how perceived safety in neighbourhoods originates. This research includes a theoretical study as to what perceived safety is, as well as field research with the neighbourhood Reyeroord as a case study. The combination of the desk and field research leads to the insights needed to create a systems map of perceived safety in neighbourhoods. Based on this system, possibility space is identified to intervene in the system, incorporating the existing knowledge and resources of the initial intervention. The research phase indicates that the perceived environment of people affects the perceived safety. By broadening people’s (social/physical) environment, people affect their expectations and perceptions of the environment. This can be done by broadening the public familiarity or strengthen the collective efficacy. The following field of tension comes forward. To increase one’s perceived environment, one must encounter or discover new environments. But discovering new environments is often unsafe and defiant in itself. This describes the frame of De Nacht Club: to offer a safe way to discover new – social and physical - environments. De Nacht Club uses the power of genuine encounters to do so. This way, De Nacht Club affects people’s perceived environment and therefore their perceived safety. In this report, a (re)design of the product (De Nacht Club) is presented with a coherent strategy to improve the perceived safety in neighbourhoods. The strategy consists of the substantiation of the design frame, a brand vision, mission and DNA and a three-piece method. Furthermore, the strategy includes a generic approach to applying the product to different neighbourhoods. This approach is presented in the shape of a set of design criteria for De Nacht Club. These criteria consist of six categories to ensure the value of an edition of De Nacht Club. Lastly, the set of criteria is refined based on expert validation. The product and coherent strategy designed in this project, translate the initial intervention into a coherent product to improve the perceived safety in neighbourhoods. The set of design criteria offers a generic approach to applying De Nacht Club to other neighbourhoods while ensuring the value of the intervention.","Perceived safety; Neighbourhoods; Subjective safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A solution would be tacit knowledge. Machine learning needs this type of knowledge to improve. An example of such knowledge that can help make the system draw better logical conclusions would be: if presented with an open fridge, then it could deduct that the food will go bad. Tacit knowledge or common-sense knowledge refers to the type of knowledge which is acquired through experience, the kind only humans can create. GWAPs (game with a purpose) have shown quite promising results for acquiring such knowledge. Unfortunately, it could still contain errors due to users who only want to harm the game data, etc. and there is no method for validating such knowledge without involving humans somehow. Therefore, from the previously stated problem, our goal has emerged - develop a method for validating an existing data set and for later training machine learning models using a GWAP. There has been work done before using GWAPs to elicit such information, yet they are limited in the sense that their main focus is set on data collection, not validation. Since very few projects looked into it, we decided to investigate a new GWAP which has as main purpose tacit knowledge validation. The main question which we aim to answer is ""How can we elicit and validate tacit knowledge using a game with the following settings: single-player, textual concepts, goal: associate words with their concepts."" The game presents hints to the users and they have to guess, as fast as possible and with the least amount of tries as possible, which answer is correct from the 6 options that are provided. The evaluation of the game will be made using standard metrics such as games played, time spent playing, number of users, etc. The conclusion is that the GWAP, even with the lack of data, was quite capable of analyzing the quality of the data set and reached a conclusion that is easily confirmed by a mere look over the initial data set.","Tacit knowledge; Machine Learning; GWAP; games with a purpose","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This is due to the promise of higher overall efficiency and lower costs. However, these AI-powered tools may create an inaccurate conception of the applicant's suitability to the vacancy by numerically quantifying context-dependent variables. If only this inaccurate conception is used to judge an applicant, this is a violation of the applicant's autonomy over their self-representation. This paper argues that such a problem could be solved by adopting a broader design scope - Socio-Technical Systems Design (STSD). STSD approaches have not been widely applied to AI or hiring practices yet. Therefore the main contribution of this paper is to bridge this gap by exploring possible STSD approaches which can be applied to ensure the applicants' autonomy over self-representation. This paper suggests combining methodologies and design principles from two STSD approaches - Design for Values and Systemic Design. The findings from Design for Values suggest that key stakeholders should be involved in the design process. Therefore, the designers should conduct a stakeholder analysis to identify the key stakeholders, followed by an investigation to explore the stakeholders' needs, and the values which the proposed system could implicate. Systemic Design offers design principles that should be utilized during the design process. These principles consist of: expanding the problem space; focus on the relationship between the key stakeholders; and follow an iterative, experimental, and evolutionary design approach throughout the design process. This nuanced, stakeholder-centric approach results in an inclusive, transparent, multi-discipline, and socially aware process which is necessary to understand the complex social context, and its socio-ethical issues.","Artificial intelligence; Socio-technical systems design; Design for values; Systemic design; Autonomy; Hiring practices","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

A need to tune hyperparameters is required to have a robust CNN that can more accurately do its task. In this study, the batch size, being one of the most important hyperparameters, is our main concern. The batch size is the number of samples that will be propagated through the network before updating the weights. Moreover, we show how the batch affects the performance of Regression CNNs to the following regression tasks: the mean, median, standard deviation (std) and variance of the pixel intensities of a grey-scale MNIST [2] input image. This will be analyzed by how well regression CNNs converge, given different batch sizes and a fixed learning rate. Additionally, we will also be comparing the final mean squared error given by all different batch sizes. At the end of the research, our findings concluded that a higher batch size leads to a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a slower convergence. Additionally, the best performance obtained was for batch sizes of size 8 to 32, with slight differences between the four different regressions tasks.","Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Network, Re-gression, Sensitivity Analysis, Batch Size","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Accurate state models of system behaviour might help software developers build such an understanding. There exist several techniques for automatically inferring models on system behaviour using log analysis, but these do not scale well for systems that produce large amounts of logs.<br/>In this study, we present an approach for inferring concise state models of system behaviour using log analysis, called MASM (Markov Algorithm for inferring concise State Models), which implements a Markov chain. We argue this approach has the potential for higher scalability than existing techniques, as it attempts to approximate a state model by exploiting the properties of Markov chains. This is achieved by considering a sequence of log statements as a stochastic process, which enables MASM to infer a naive state model from a set of log statements, which is then minimized using the properties of Markov chains.<br/>We evaluated MASM in an empirical study on the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. In this empirical study, MASM was evaluated on accuracy at different compression rates, and scalability. The results indicate that MASM shows several knee points in terms of accuracy, suggesting several optimal compression rates. We also found that the run-time of MASM scales linearly with the size of the dataset. Finally, we discovered that MASM is unable to outperform a random compression algorithm, which compresses the model by randomly merging states, in terms of accuracy. However, further research is required on measuring the readability of the produced models to derive definitive conclusions on the performance of MASM compared to a random compression algorithm.","System Modelling; Log Analysis; Markov Chains","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In this paper, we propose a novel Gold Asymmetric Loss Correction with Single-Label Regulators (GALC-SLR) that operates robust against noisy labels. GALC-SLR estimates the noise confusion matrix using single-label samples, then constructs an asymmetric loss correction via estimated confusion matrix to avoid overfitting to the noisy labels. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art original asymmetric loss multi-label classifier under all corruption levels, showing mean average precision improvement up to 28.67\% on a real-world dataset of MS-COCO, yielding a better generalization of the unseen data and increased prediction performance.","Multi-label classification; Label Noise; Robust learning; Deep Neural Networks; Noise estimation; Asymmetric Loss","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This scanner does not make use of switchable gradient coils, but instead relies solely on the natural inhomogeneity of the field and on translations of the sample over this field for its spatial encoding. Specifically, an attempt is made to answer the question of how we can reconstruct a phantom using this kind of scanner. This is done by deriving a signal model, discretising it and writing it as a linear least squares problem. Then, we can make use of the techniques of Cojugate Gradient for Least Squares (CGLS) wih `2-regularization and Generalized Conjugate Gradient Minimal Error (GCGME) with `1-regularization for the difference between neighbouring pixels in order to solve this inverse problem. Firstly, we theoretically consider combinations for magnetic field geometry and measurement strategy for their usability for image reconstruction. After this, the obtained strategies are tested in three experiments, with two magnets and two samples. We start by doing this numerically, using a simulated phantom in combination with a measured magnetic field and the translation strategy. By doing this, we can determine if reconstruction is possible using that combination of field and strategy. Finally, the strategy is tested on real samples. Using numerical phantoms in combination with the magnetic field and translation strategy used in the measurements, we were able to correctly reconstruct the phantoms. However, the reconstruction broke down when data from real samples was considered. A variety of possible improvements is discussed. The improvement that would have the most impact would be to design a magnet that has a less uniform gradient in the z-direction, and instead has some locations in the xy-plane where the field falls slowly as function of z, but quickly in other locations.","MRI; low field; Model based approach; Imaging","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Multiple modalities allow for analysis of dependencies between complex biological processes and downstream tasks, such as drug response and/or expected survival rate. To this end, it is important to gain an understanding of the relationships between modalities in tumor cells. Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoders (MVAEs) are a combination of generative models trained on different sets of data modalities. In this research, the ability of MVAEs to capture common information between different data views from the same tumor cells is assessed. MVAE models discussed here are a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and a Product-of-Experts (PoE) approach to combining the generative model posterior distributions into a single common latent space. The performance assessment is done by: i) comparing the loss of information when reconstructing the training data to MOFA+, a linear method for combining multimodal data, and ii) measuring if one modality of a tumor cell can generate another modality, based on characteristics of the latent space learned by the MVAE. Biological data modalities considered are RNA-seq, gene-level copy number and DNA methylation (DNAme), gathered by The Cancer Genome Atlas. It is found that PoE reconstructs data from all data types with a higher accuracy compared to MoE and MOFA+. The mean squared error of PoE's average reconstruction loss is about a quarter of MOFA+'s, and less than a seventh of the MoE's average reconstruction loss. In terms of predicting modalities from other modalities, the PoE again outperforms MoE on all cross-modal predictions. Additionally, it can be concluded that both models have higher losses in their prediction of DNAme from other modalities, indicating a lesser correlation between this data type and the others.","Deep Learning; Variational Autoencoder; Data integration; The Cancer Genome Atlas","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Unfortunately, accurate and concise models are not always available during development, due to the rapid changes in the structure and scale systems may undergo during this phase. Finite State Machines (FSM) are a natural and prevalent template for modeling system behaviour, and inferring such models through profiling, source code analysis, and log analysis has been an active area of research over the last decades. However, the applicability of existing techniques is restricted by different factors: profiling introduces significant overhead, which is infeasible for many real-time systems; the source code of a system may not always be available for analysis; and current log analysis approaches do not scale well with the number of logs produced by the system. In this paper, four meta-heuristic search approaches are used to create FSM models for the XRP Ledger consensus algorithm from its logs, addressing the scalability problem by approximating a FSM while only exploring a small portion of the search space. Random Selection Stochastic Hill Climber (RSSHC), Tournament Selection Stochastic Hill Climber (TSSHC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Pareto Simulated Annealing (PSA) are considered. The performance of the model produced by each algorithm is quantified using an accuracy-based evaluation technique, and the accuracy, conciseness, and runtime of the approaches are compared. The results indicate that PSA produces the most accurate and least concise models with a consistent accuracy of over 92%. RSSHC and TSSHC obtain solutions with a slightly lower accuracy, but significantly better conciseness, while SA produces the most compact and least accurate models. All four algorithms produce results within minutes and scale linearly with the size of the problem.","meta-heuristic search; system modeling; finite state machine","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In this paper, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are used to assist in this process. VAEs are a type of neural network seeking to encode data into a smaller dimension called latent space. These latent features are then used to do downstream task analysis such as cancer types, survival time and cancer stages, with the help of a MLP classifier. Furthermore, the training process itself is also analyzed with the usage of UMaps. The purpose of this paper is to compare different VAE models on their effectiveness in providing training data used for the predictions. The predictions mostly consist of guessing when using any of the latent spaces, constructed by the VAE models, as input data for the MLP classifier. The NoVAE model is the only model with slightly better performance when it comes to mean accuracy and standard deviation. The guessing issue is further analyzed with the help of UMaps. The VAEs are able to classify the input data during the training process, but when faced with new data, this end up not being the case. Both the learning rate and β term yield interesting results regarding the modification of the input data and variational property respectively. A lower learning rate leads to better classification, but this is due it deviation less from the original input data. When using a small β term with the β-VAE, the output is similar to that of the VanillaVAE.

This paper investigates one of these challenges, music identification of movies, in a systematic way using the open-source fingerprinting framework called Panako. First, clips containing music were extracted from movies and queried using the default settings for Panako. Then, movie soundtracks were modified by layering noise over them, or by time-stretching and pitch-shifting them, and the performance of Panako on these modified audio signals was evaluated using a benchmark. Finally, the best configurations from the previous step were again queried using actual movie clips. These tests showed that both the default configuration and the configurations that performed best on the synthesised data perform poorly in movie music identification. Less than 10\% of the clips were identified correctly.

However, dependencies have the potential to suffer from vulnerabilities, thereby potentially putting depending projects at risk. Dependency analysis software can be used to manage vulnerable dependencies, such as Dependabot. Yet, such programs are generally inaccurate as a result of false positives, due to the limitations of package-level analysis. In the case of a false positive vulnerability recommendation, a software project imports a vulnerable dependency, but does not use any of its vulnerable functions. While most developers already do not pay enough attention to using vulnerable dependencies, false positives can only make this worse. Instead, function-level vulnerability analysis has the capability to eliminate package-level false positives. In this paper, research is performed to gain quantitative insight in the improvement of function-level over package-level analysis in terms of recommendation correctness. A package-level analysis simulation in combination with a function-level analysis was performed, built with the FASTEN framework. The latter uses RTA call graph generation and method tracing to remove package-level false positives. In total, 4071 open-source repositories were analyzed with 393 open-source vulnerabilities, of which 259 projects had positive recommendations. Comparison shows that 85\% of package-level recommendations are false positives, which are removed by performing function-level analysis instead.

In order to have an assembly representative of the population, personal data is necessary to perform the sortition, making participant privacy a matter of concern when guaranteeing fairness of the process. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)makes it possible to perform calculations on encrypted data from multiple sources without revealing it to the other processing parties or data contributors. This paper outlines two sortition designs that use MPC to guarantee participant privacy during the sortition process. Design 1 allows participants to hide their personal details to the citizens’ assembly organisers. Design 2 makes it possible for involved local government to contribute citizen data to the sortition. Different domain experts were interviewed as a means to survey the needs of the sortition community and to provide feedback on the designs. We found that little research has yet been conducted on the effects of increased privacy on sign-up rates for deliberative events, creating a potential avenue for future research.","MPC; Multiparty computation; Sortition; citizens' assembly; deliberative democracy; privacy; security","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

It is imperative that smart contract developers stay up to date on the current most damaging vulnerabilities and countermeasures to ensure the security of users' funds, and to collectively ensure the future of Ethereum as a financial settlement layer. This research focuses on two smart contract vulnerabilities: transaction-ordering dependency and oracle manipulation. Combined, these two vulnerabilities have been exploited to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from smart contracts in the past year (2020-2021). For each vulnerability, this research presents: (1) a literary survey from recent (as of 2021) formal and informal sources; (2) a reproducible experiment as code demonstrating the vulnerability and, where applicable, countermeasures to mitigate the vulnerability; and (3) analysis and discussion of proposed countermeasures.

As team members communicate to coordinate the team through the task, the question arises as to what information the human should share to be predictable to an agent. To experiment with measuring the predictability, defined as to what extent the agent can anticipate the actions of the human, we used the Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) task. The two information types shared are intentions and world knowledge. The predictability is evaluated in the background by the agent logging, with automatic help from the human agent, a sequence containing the human performed actions. The agent can assign 2 probabilities to a human performed action. The first indicates with what probability the agent could say the human chose this action. The second indicates with what probability the agent could say this action led to this outcome. These probabilities then vary based on whether the information sent beforehand implied this action. The experiment has 4 different cases: sharing no information, sharing intentions, sharing world knowledge, and sharing both types. It is shown that sharing intentions contributes the most to higher predictability, due to these messages being the most effective at implying the future action of the human. World knowledge and sharing both types have less effect on predictability. We speculate that this is because of the larger amount of messages to share as well as when to share them, which overloads the human.","predictability; human-agent interaction,; human-agent trust; human-agent team; Information sharing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This makes it unfeasible to share plain transaction data between financial institutions internationally. Secure multiparty computation is a cryptographic technique that enables a set of parties to interact and compute a joint function of their private inputs while revealing nothing but the output. Thus, MPC has the potential to facilitate greater collaboration between financial institutions and governmental organisations internationally and upscale anti-money laundering efforts securely. In this paper we aim to explore how MPC could be used to improve current anti-money laundering detection techniques. This is done by providing an overview of existing work in the field and proposing a new architecture that could be used to flag suspicious transaction. This architecture presents accounts and transactions as a social network and uses betweenness centrality to identify high-risk accounts.

One of the discovered attacks on RPL is the rank attack, which opens up possibilities for attackers to control traffic in the RPL network by spoofing their priority. Many solutions have been proposed to mitigate this attack over the past few years. There is no perfect solution yet, partly because the success of a mitigation is dependent on the network configuration in which it is implemented. In some network configurations,as this paper will show, common mitigation solutions are less effective. By selecting and analyzing four well-cited mitigation and detection solutions, the effectiveness of these proposals is reviewed when the network is configured to use nonlinear objective functions (NOFs). After this, a proposal is given to defend against a rank attack when using NOFs. TRAIL was proposed as a solution for preventing decreased rank attacks and uses a challenge-response mechanism to verify the path from a node to the root. This paper proposes T-TRAIL; an extended version of TRAIL that allows the measurement of downwards-trip-time to detect outliers in the network. By doing this, the rank attack can be prevented when the network uses a NOF. Finally, an estimation of the performance impact of T-TRAIL on the network is given based on the performance measurements of TRAIL.","RPL; IoT; Rank Attack; Mitigation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Despite these concerns, security is not only deficient for RPL, but proposed mitigations appear untouched as well. This paper therefore contributes a lightweight cryptosystem. It questions and justifies its virtue in a twofold. First, we illustrate the importance of this mitigation with an impactful Sybil attack that enables malicious routing on root level. Second, we construct an attack pattern model and life-cycle to demonstrate the operational capabilities and objectives of the adversary for Internet of Things (IoT) generic attack patterns. The cryptosystem divides IEEE 802.15.4 networks into isolated clusters with key derivation functions. Because the key derivation function adopts spectrum resource measurements, the proposal includes a cooperative defence to validate these measurements of joining nodes. To avoid overhead, the mitigation operates on symmetric-key cryptography, piggybacked cluster identifiers, and Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) requests to the trusted party that stores encrypted identity keys of member nodes. This mitigation, when combined with the efficient routing of RPL, enables a broad application for smart low-power constrained devices in a scalable IoT network while it protects against Sybil attacks and eavesdropping.","RPL; IoT; RPL Attacks; IoT Security; Routing Attacks; Security Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Unfortunately, the construction of decision trees is a hard problem which usually implies having to rely on imperfect heuristic methods. Advancements in algorithmics and hardware processing power have rendered globally optimal trees accessible, but even state-of-the-art techniques remain limited in certain aspects. One such limitation is the use of simple, univariate predicates within the decision tree. This paper explores the practicality of further expanding the already exponentially large search space navigated by existing optimal tree algorithms in order to add support for more complex, multivariate predicates. While such an approach comes with profound negative implications on the algorithm's time complexity, it has the potential to create decision trees whose boundaries are closer to ground truth. The results of this work support such a hypothesis, but they also make it clear that further optimisation techniques are critical for multivariate optimal decision tree algorithms, especially as the variety of considered multivariate splits increases.","Machine Learning; Optimal Decision Tree; Multivariate Decision Tree","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Here, each instance belongs to multiple class labels simultaneously. There are numerous methods for Multi-label classification, however all of them make the assumption that either the training images are completely labelled or that label correlations are given. Since Active Learning is frequently used when not much data is available, it could be used to determine the missing labels by querying an oracle. This paper proposes a novel solution that combines the current state-of-the-art for Multi-label classification with Active Learning to infer the missing labels. This is done with sampling strategies that try to select the most informative sample from the dataset by exploring the amount of missing labels. With these strategies, we try to minimize the relabeling cost for all samples, while maximizing the information gained. The chosen method called Hard sampling with entropy then looks to select those samples that both the model and we find informative. The chosen measure along with the other measure are then explored and evaluated on a subset of the MSCOCO dataset on 20%, 40% and 60% noise. Hard sampling with entropy then outperforms the state-of-the-art by more then 30%, as well as the baseline sampling method by 2% for 60% noise.","Multi-label classification; Active Learning; Missing Labels","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

BigFuzz, a new method which was proposed by a recent study, solves these problems and shows promising results. One of the BigFuzz contributions are high-level mutations, which are error type guided and schema aware mutations. This paper is answering the question: How does stacking high-level fuzz mutations affect the test performance for big data applications? It does so by creating different stacking strategies and evaluating the effect compared to the BigFuzz method. As evaluation metrics the research looks at the amount of unique failures per trial and the distribution of unique failures found. The three stacking strategies that have been developed for this project are: Random Stack, Smart Stack and Single Stack. This research has shown that there appear to be benefits to stacking high-level mutations. The results show that stacking algorithms find on average more unique failures in less trials than a non-stacking approach. Furthermore, is Smart Stack able to find unique failures more frequently. Empirical results suggest that stacking high-level mutations can provide an advantage over only mutating once.","Fuzz testing; Big Data; High-Level mutation; Stacking mutation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The analysis concludes by discussing the effects of dynamic nodes on larger scale networks, DODAG's with multiple roots and networks with mobile roots. Afterward, DIS flooding is considered as an example of how attacks and their mitigations can be impacted by mobility, showing that more work is needed to secure RPL in these situations.

This means that generated sequences respect the relationship between variables across time as in the original data. While new types of GANs have been used to generate time-series data, they, like previous GAN<br/>implementations, are time consuming to train. A novel federated framework is proposed, which generates realistic time-series data, by combining supervised and unsupervised training. The framework is based on the work in TimeGAN and Federated GAN (FeGAN). Using an embedded learning space, TimeGAN<br/>encourages the network to mimic the structure of the training data. FeGAN allows the results of TimeGAN to be combined at a central server, which has benefits for both throughput, and potential to improve data privacy. This also introduces the possibility of using cross domain data. The challenge with creating applying federated learning to TimeGAN, and timeseries data in general is whether the learned temporal dynamics can be combined. This is accomplished by the combination of the weighting and sampling scheme used. This paper demonstrates, by qualitative and quantitative analysis, the ability novel framework proposed, to produce equivalent quality synthetic timeseries data compared to the original TimeGAN, without sharing local data between nodes in the network. This is based on the predictive and discriminative scores described, as well as PCA and t-SNE analysis.

The performance of the method is then evaluated on noisy versions of MS-COCO to show the lack of overfitting and the performance improvement over the non-robust multi-label ASL.","Multi-label classification; Robust learning; Weak labels; Deep learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

A logical consequence is that vulnerabilities from such sources can be propagated to applications making use of those. Tools like Dependabot can alert developers about packages they use, which entail vulnerabilities. Such alerts oftentimes turn out to be false positives because the vulnerable functionality of the package is not used. Current research by the FASTEN Project revolves around analysing dependency networks using a finer granularity; moving from package-level to method-level analysis with the help of call graphs. Such analysis can theoretically be used to gain better insights into how vulnerable a dependency for an application is. This report aims to display the practical effectiveness of using call graphs to detect propagated vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness, results generated through method-level analysis were studied with regards to whether a vulnerability in the corresponding project is reproducible. Furthermore, possible improvements to call graphs to detect vulnerabilities more accurately are described in this study. An experiment, based on call graph analysis, was conducted to detect propagated vulnerabilities in a set of public software repositories. The used data about the repositories and vulnerabilities was provided by the FASTEN Project. Each vulnerability detection was manually verified and studied on its impact based on public information about the corresponding vulnerability. The results of this experiment show that none of the potential propagated vulnerabilities could be reproduced. This implies that a greater set of repositories needs to be analysed to draw meaningful conclusions for the effectiveness of call graphs to detect propagated vulnerabilities. The proposed improvements to call graphs display a fraction of the great potential of the precision that could be reached through such fine-grained analysis.","Call graph; Dependency Analysis; Vulnerability detection","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/jakub014/CG-dependency-analyzer The codebase for the experiment conducted in this study.","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Such IoT networks often consist of incredibly resource-constrained devices, and are known as Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) aims to provide a routing standard for such networks. Due to the tough performance constraints, RPL is unable to provide strong security guarantees. Many researchers are posing attacks against RPL-based networks, and with the increasing number of implementing devices, it is important that research is done to ensure message integrity and network reliability. In this paper we concern ourselves specifically with collusion attacks. We propose Hop-Count Reachability (HCR), a mitigating method against the coordinated blackhole attack. In HCR, leaf nodes periodically ping the root node with DAO messages. If the root node is reachable, it will reply with a DAO-ACK, upon which the leaf node sleeps for a period of time. When the number of missed ACKs in a certain time frame exceeds a certain threshold, the affected node may identify the attack and mitigate it by selecting a new parent. HCR may increase control packet overhead anywhere between 1.6 and 25\% depending on the chosen parameters, and successfully mitigates the coordinated blackhole attack in all scenarios where affected nodes can choose an (eventually) unaffected parent.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In the downstream process of a text classifier, embeddings convert words and sentences into meaningful vectors. Pre-trained on large corpora, they can be fine-tuned, and domain adapted. This study proposes a refinement model, starting from the available dataset, that learns to capture moral information in Sentence-BERT embeddings by applying a state-of-the-art supervised method (triplet loss). We further demonstrate how the refined embeddings improve the accuracy of moral classifiers. Finally, with an improvement of 5% F1-score over models that use pre-trained embeddings, we pave the way towards a generalisable and transferable set of moral embeddings.","Natural Language Processing; Text Classification; Moral Foundations Theory; Sentence-BERT; Triplet Loss","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

With the help of seven Twitter datasets corresponding to different domains, we train state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models in predicting moral values. An interesting limitation of the models is that they all suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting is the degree to which models worsen their performance on older data after being trained on new data. We conclude that catastrophic forgetting occurs irrespective of the models being trained and can be mitigated by not only training on new data but by training on a combination of old and new data. This is all possible under one assumption: old data is available. We deliver an evaluation of catastrophic forgetting for each model, explain the differences between the models, and suggest possible future work that can be built upon this research.","Natural Language Processing; Moral Values; Moral Foundation Theory; Catastrophic Forgetting","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

External disruptions, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, created a significant shift in business operations. This disruption accentuated the importance of resilience as a fundamental operational factor against uncertainties. Corporate real estate (CRE) industries need to be resilient in their processes to respond to the inevitable disruptions and anticipate future opportunities. Nevertheless, in recent years, resilience is becoming a rather broad and ambiguous concept that has been used repeatedly in different contexts. This research was aimed to address and advance resilience in various CRE asset classes to overcome external problems and increase preparedness during uncertainties. This study attempted to re-conceptualise resilience, by exploring the current definitions of resilience. The redefined concept of resilience was then reflected to different asset classes of CRE. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to provide the contextual definition and features of resilience, as well as to assess the value of resilient CRE to an organisation. Subsequently, a resilience framework was composed based on the findings from both theoretical and empirical studies. The framework was then utilised to assess resilience in within-class and across-class analyses. The within-class analysis evaluated the extent of resilient approaches in an asset class, whereas cross-class analysis attempted to explore how resilience can be achieved and optimised in a particular asset class. Furthermore, additional synthesis between theoretical and empirical findings was conducted to further maintain resilience in a longer time span. Here, continuous improvement was identified as a determining factor for the sustenance of resilience. The output of this research provided a theoretical basis for resilient CRE and applicable suggestions to improve and maintain resilience capability in an organisational CRE.","Corporate real estate; Corporate real estate management; Resilience; Resilience framework; Asset classes; Office; Retail; Industrial; Logistics; Persistence; Adaptability; Transformability; Continuous improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Such aspects will be individual for almost any city since their formation takes place over long periods. A similar activator of social life in London is the beer culture – a complex ritual chain that has lost one of the most important constituent element – the brewery as a typology. As a result, the brewery lost its architectural identity and its place of honor in the city. The central issue addressed in this study is the search for the reasons why the brewery typology has lost its architectural identity in recent years and whether it is possible to rethink the identity of the typology as an approach to design.<br/>The number of new London breweries is growing inexorably. Over the past ten years, it has increased more than ten times, which indicates that the beer culture has experienced a new understanding, and broader demand for the consumption of this product has formed in society. However, due to the comparative youth of the new format and approach to beer culture and its economic uncertainty, it has not yet been architecturally formed. Hence, it exists in a format of technological adaptation rather than an independent typology.<br/>The primary method in the study is the analysis of historical and cultural analogs, and as a result, their comparison with the brewery in different qualities, such as typology, program, function, urban fabric, etc. Using this induction method, we get the necessary conclusions, which are subsequently transformed into specific architectural approaches and rules required to create a new identity of the brewery typology and a new fragment of the urban fabric in heterogeneous London.","Brewery; London; Heterogeneity; Identity; Patchwork","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.521884,-0.088764"

Such Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA, see Figure 2.2) are increasingly treated by endovascular surgery, during which stent grafts are placed in the ballooned vessel through access sites such as the femoral (thigh) arteries, a procedure called Endo Vascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). 10% of patients has an aneurysm near significant arteries (Mayo Clinic, 2019), called a complex AAA, requiring stent grafts fitted with fenestrations (FEVAR, see Figure 2.1) or side branches (BEVAR).   After puncture of the femoral artery, an introducer sheath is placed in the vessel, functioning as a re-usable access point to the arterial system. The sheath prevents blood from flowing out of the artery and enables entrance of tools such as guide wires, catheters and smaller sheaths into the arteries. However, treatment of complex AAA requires introduction of multiple tools (up to 5) through the sheath simultaneously, compared to just one or two during EVAR. With every additional tool being introduced, the valve’s capability of adequate closure is reduced even more. This results in leakage that can lead to significant blood loss for the patient.   The Pentaport is a new, safe gateway for complex endovascular aortic repair (Figure 2.3). It functions as an add-on for commonly used sheath models. A leakproof ‘plug &amp; screw’ connection facilitates safe and easy fastening to large-bore introducer sheaths. The Pentaport minimises blood leakage. Preventing severe blood losses of 2L or even more during one surgery, spares a heavy attack on the patient’s condition and eliminates the need for costly consequences, such as cell-saving or blood transfusion. In addition, it prevents the need for lengthy recatheterisation efforts (up to 60 minutes) and possible harm to the patient’s arteries. The design was evaluated and proof of concept was achieved, through functionality tests in simulated environments and usability tests with medical specialists.  ","Medisign; Surgical instruments; Sheath; Valves; Endovascular; Locking mechanism; Add-on","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Dawood, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Biomedical researchers and clinicians are interested in (ab)normal foetal development because it can aid in better understanding human anatomy. To capture this foetal development non-destructive three dimensional (3D) imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) are used. Visualising foetuses remains a challenge however, as foetuses consist mostly of soft-tissue. Visualisation of soft-tissue with CT scans is difficult because X-rays easily pass through. This consequently results into images with low contrast. Therefore, improving contrast is artificially gained by using chemical compounds called stains. The most effective stain is considered to be Lugol’s solution. A downside of using Lugol’s solution is that the staining process causes extensive soft-tissue shrinkage which is detrimental for morphological analysis. The mechanism of Lugol-induced shrinkage is largely unknown. Some research suggest it is due to an osmotic imbalance between tissue and solution, while others point towards acidification of Lugol’s solution. The goal of this study is to develop an optimum (buffered) Lugol’s solution staining protocol for post-mortem human foetal CT imaging to diminish soft-tissue shrinkage and achieve homogeneous staining. Several variables in the protocol are taken into account such as staining solution concentration, staining time and specimen size. To develop this protocol, multiple tests and measurements (pH, osmolarity, optical density, weight and CT scans) were performed on pork liver samples and two post-mortem human foetuses to monitor acidification of the staining solution, staining progress and staining intensity, while applying two distinct methods: the AMC- and Arthurs method. The main difference between these methods is that the AMC method fixates tissue well before staining (conventional method), while Arthurs method uses a mixture of a fixative and stain simultaneously on fresh tissue. The research suggests that Arthurs method seems best. Even though, both methods led to a homogeneous staining, the AMC method resulted in an average shrinkage of 4.82%, while Arthurs method resulted in a shrinkage of only 1.08%. In addition, Arthurs method leads to a shorter staining protocol.","3D medical imaging; anatomy; computed tomography; ethics; foetal imaging; foetus; Lugol’s solution; soft-tissue staining; staining protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A comprehensive study is performed through advanced optical and electrical simulations to understand the tandem’s characteristics and operative behavior. We use GenPro4 and Sentaurus TCAD to perform the optical and electrical simulations, respectively. From the previous research, the developed J-V simulations revealed an indication of extra current collection from the tandem’s supporting layers. This extra current density makes the tandem’s short circuit current density J_SC higher than the current-matched J_ph of each perovskite and c-Si absorber layer. Because only J-V curves that could be simulated and not the EQE curves, it remained a mystery of which supporting layers in the tandem that contribute to the extra current collection. In this thesis project, a new EQE simulation methodology was developed to help to solve this mystery of extra current collection from the supporting layers. By performing the EQE simulation, we find that SnO2, TiO2, and Spiro-OMeTAD layers contribute to a total potential extra current collection of 2.50 mA/cm2 to 2.79 mA/cm2. A further study of the extra current collection is also conducted by modifying the simulation method that considers the absorbed photons’ energy in respect to the material’s energy bandgap. Under this further study, only absorbed photons with energy higher than the material’s energy bandgap can generate electron-hole pairs. After considering the absorbed photons’ energy in the simulation, only SnO2 and TiO2 layers that contribute to the significantly lower extra current collection of 0.07 mA/cm2.","Perovskite/c-Si tandem solar cells; Sentaurus TCAD; GenPro4; opto-electrical modelling framework; EQE; Extra current collection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Because of this, websites have started to resort to blacklisting the IP addresses that are used by the VPNs, thus blocking both genuine and malicious users. This forces users to sacrifice privacy for accessibility. This paper provides a method on how to measure the amount of blocking that VPN users experience and to be able to determine what type of blocking is occuring. This method is then used in an experiment using a web crawler where nodes from ProtonVPN are used to measure the amount of blocking that occurs while browsing the internet’s most popular websites. This experiment shows that on average 1.12% of the domains perform some type of blocking directed towards the VPN user and that the majority of this blocking consists of a total block, which means that the user is entirely excluded from any use of the website. Next to this it is shown that not all VPN nodes show the same amount of blocking and that there was no large difference in blocking found between days while using the same VPN node. It also shows that the categories which perform the most blocking are Business, Online Shopping and News.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

However, when a global reference frame is not shared among agents, a relative navigation approach is required. <br/>Distributed filtering for relative localization in formation control systems is a relatively unexplored field. <br/>The absence of absolute positioning means motivates the need for a distributed filter that operates on the edges of the sensing graph of the multi-agent system.<br/>In this thesis, a data model for relative formation control problems and two edge-based Kalman filters are proposed. The first filter is designed for an individual edge. The second is a filter designed via decoupling of the optimal global filter which allows for the joint estimation of adjacent edges. It is shown that the joint filter is optimal under the decoupling constraints.<br/>Monte Carlo results show that when random environmental disturbances are correlated among agents, the joint filter outperforms the local edge filter in a mean square error sense.<br/>Lastly, systems are considered where inter-agent communications are unavailable, leading to biased prediction steps of the Kalman filters.

We extend the existing simulation framework to allow for midpoint asymmetry. By simulating asymmetry in elementary links, we show that the performance of an elementary link executing quantum key distribution decreases with an increasing degree of asymmetry. This effect can be mitigated by individual optimisation of photon sources at both ends of the elementary link. We present a way how to reduce the search space of such optimisations by developing a heuristic.

However, there is a lack of web services in which users can directly and effectively access the city objects contained in the 3D city models on the web. Another problem with web services related to 3D city models is that the size of 3D city models can become very large. As a consequence, the browser will not respond immediately until all city objects in the requested 3D city model have arrived. Addi-tionally, although ﬁle-based systems are the easiest way of data storage, they have deﬁciencies in web services that require scalability, efﬁciency, and ﬂexibility in data access. To ﬁx these is-sues, the goal of this research is to develop the an efﬁcient way of disseminating 3D city models on the web, to discover the method of enabling 3D city models to be parsed incrementally and efﬁciently by the browser, and to explore a proper database solution for storing 3D city models to support the fast data access.<br/><br/>CityJSON has advantages in web applications over the CityGML data format, thus being chosen as the main datasets used in this research. Inspired by OGC API – Feature, a RESTful API for fast access to geospatial features in CityJSON has been developed. The second part of my research is related to the data streaming. CityJSONFeature has been proposed to enable CityJSON to be parsed incrementally on the web. To improve the overall data streaming perfor-mance, I proposed two methods to stream the data from the database to the RESTful API so that the RESTful API can immediately start constructing the ﬁrst CityJSONFeature and sending it to the user. The third part of my research is to explore a proper database solution for CityJSON datasets to best support the fast data access in the RESTful API. In addition, some auxiliary data is added into the database to improve the RESTful API’s capabilities with efﬁcient data ﬁltering and streaming.<br/><br/>To evaluate the efﬁciency of the implemented methodology, a systematic benchmarking has been performed on three aspects: 1) the database schema, 2) the two streaming methods, and 3) the performance difference between the DBMS and the ﬁle system. The results show that in most use cases the DBMS can better support the RESTful API than the ﬁle system with the help of the built-in query and index mechanism. In addition, the overall streaming performance is largely improved when adding data streaming from the DBMS to the RESTful API. Lastly, based on the benchmarks, an optimal database schema has been chosen to support the RESTful API with fast data access, efﬁcient data ﬁltering and streaming.","3D city model; RESTful API; Database; Streaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

However, waterfront redevelopment sites are amongst the most complex to develop (Daamen, 2007). That is why it is important to understand why we choose for redevelopment to new or other uses.<br/>This research examines the intrinsic land value creation for two cases in the port of Rotterdam and how the intrinsic land value was created as a result of the actor arena and the involvement and perspectives therein. Through literature is first sought how we can explain intrinsic land value and what it comprises. Thereafter, two cases: the M4H and RDM sites in Rotterdam, are examined. These two related cases are particularly interesting as they resulted in a different outcome than a complete transformation from port to city, implying that different value creation and actor arena dynamics.<br/>It appeared that intrinsic land value can either be affected by context changes or actively be created through development. The intrinsic value of a location or land can be described through location factors. These can be categorized in factors from a classical, behavioral, institutional or evolutional approach.<br/>The different actor arena in the two cases has led to different area developments. For the RDM case, the Port of Rotterdam dominant involvement has resulted in a innovative and manufacturing cluster focused on maritime use and collaboration with educational partners. The M4H case, with the municipality as equal partner and the involvement of developers, includes a lot of residential and commercial uses too. The innovative making cluster in the M4H emerged from a mutual innovation agenda (digitalization and energy transition) and the need to enhance and diversify the economy for the port and city.<br/>It can be concluded that intrinsic land value is created through the interplay of involvement, power, actor perspectives and the C-strategies employed to impact those in one's favor. This thesis identified 10C's. This deserves more research in the future, to understand how we come to our redevelopment outcomes in the port-city interface, as well as other inner-city redevelopment projects.","Intrinsic land value; Port area development; actor arena; Actor involvement; Actor perspectives; Port-city interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The acoustic studies took place in the city centre of Nijmegen. The design project consists of two phases: research on urban scale aimed to understand sonic relations in the city applying varied methodology: interviews with blind and visually impaired, developing sound notational language, conducting sound studies and identifying acoustic typologies found in space.

(mentor); Bet, E.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Gender is a highly context-specific social construct. It explores the social relationships between men and women, a relationship in which women have been systematically subordinated (Oakley 1972). The way gender relations are defined broadly influence the conceptualisation of space and place. In a patriarchy like India, where gender inequality is deeply rooted in its culture and history, this disparity lends itself to the realm of space-making as well. Even though women account for almost half of India’s population, they are still considered vulnerable and marginalised. They still have difficulty fostering an amicable relationship with the public realm which was predominantly created by and served for men. They are met with hostility, cultural taboos, violence and an exclusionary environment that doesn’t account for or recognise their complex needs.<br/><br/>The graduation project, ‘Loiter city’ explores the spatial dimension of gender inequalities that result in the economic marginalisation and socio-spatial segregation of women. It examines socially constructed behaviour patterns, relationships between women and the built environment. It deals with the inequalities between gender and focuses on the spatial dimension of this inequality trying to locate socio-spatial justice through an Indian perspective.<br/> <br/>The framework of the project is constructed using Peter Marcuse’s Critical planning theory. By reviewing an extensive volume of academic research and literature on gender studies, the foundation of the project is developed. The project analyses the notions of gendered exclusions and citizenship and what it means for women to have the same legitimacy as men in the public realm. A transdisciplinary methodology is formulated which can tackle the complex issue both from the spatial and policy perspective in a multiscalar approach. By using ‘Loitering’ as the concept, the project envisions an operational framework that aims to change mindsets and provide more visibility to women in public spaces. The project facilitates uninhibited agency, ownership, accessibility for women and creates platforms for active participation in the co-creation of a city.<br/> <br/>The vision of achieving legitimacy is a long, tedious and complex process that requires mobilisation of institutional capacities. For this, Gender mainstreaming is envisioned as an integral process achieved by formulating various strategies that can guide sustained change. An organisation called the Gender Lab is proposed to mainstream gender into planning and bridging the knowledge gap. This body helps in tackling opposing interests at different stages while sustaining social change. It monitors the bridging of knowledge and incentive gaps by developing alternative collaborative governance models. Women-led grassroots movements would be formalised within policymaking to boost women’s participation in planning processes and influence important decisions that affect their lives. This model emphasises operational frameworks and policy initiatives that prioritise safer and accessible spaces for women. The project paves the pathway to achieve spatial justice through gender-sensitive city planning and by giving agency and ownership to women towards the cities they inhabit.","Right to Gendered City; Gender Mainstreaming; Agency for women; Gender Sensitive Urban Planning; Collaborative Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12.9716, 77.5946"

This project’s main objective is to analyse how ArcGIS Indoors can be used with location awareness methods to elaborate and develop space management tools for COVID­-19 restrictions in order to reopen the workspace for TU Delft Campus.

The data stored on the AIIM is then accessed using the app on the user’s Android device using REST Application Programming Interface (API) where a kNN based matching algorithm then identifies the location of the user. The results show that the localisation is not consistent for rooms that are directly above each other or share common access points. However, when functioning to locate different tables inside a room, the system proved to uniquely distinguish between the specific tables. As a result, we can conclude that based on the size of the rooms, more Arduino devices should be installed to achieve an ideal accuracy.

Gas turbines, steam turbines and fuel cell applications are investigated thoroughly for small scale energy systems throughout the years. Fewer research is conducted about the integration of these three energy technologies and specially sparse research has been conducted in the area of pure hydrogen oxygen combustion for these energy systems, resulting in opportunities for development. This report introduces an alternative small scale power system suited for the newest inland shipping vessels. It proposes a basic design for a 3 MW SOFC integrated hydrogen oxygen fired combined power cycle, feasible within 10 to 20 years of research and development. First, the theoretical background for the research is elaborated covering the thermodynamics of traditional power cycles, exergy analysis theory and zero emission cycles such as hydrogen oxygen fuelled power cycles. The electrochemical research containing the fuel cell operating specifics and the advantages of integrating fuel cell stacks in power cycles is introduced next. The theoretical background ends with an elaboration on the preliminary design steps for power cycle components regarding turbomachinery and heat exchange equipment. After the relevant subjects regarding power cycles and fuel cells are elaborated, a basic cycle was designed. From literature, several starting points such as the maximum turbine inlet temperature and inlet temperatures of the SOFC were defined. With a few determining thermodynamic states known on beforehand, a pressure and temperature analysis was carried out to determine the limiting operating conditions and the remaining thermodynamic states in the cycle. The cycle was eventually designed as a SOFC integrated Brayton Rankine cycle coupled via a single pressure heat recovery steam generator, where the SOFC is situated upstream of the combustor in the Brayton part of the cycle. All components in the cycle are evaluated using an exergy analysis, from which the final exergetic efficiency was determined as 73.09%. From the exergy analysis of the proposed basic cycle became clear that there was potential for improvement regarding the HRSG design. The improved cycle is therefore designed with a dual pressure HRSG, while the rest of the combined cycle remains equal compared to the basic cycle. With the extra high pressure regime, a high pressure turbine is added, thus creating an extra point in the system from which useful power is extracted from the medium. The exergetic efficiency increase of the HRSG alone amounts to 0.74%, but due to extra compressor and pump work and losses, the improved cycle results in a total efficiency of 73.47%, implying an increase of 0.38% compared to the basic cycle. To give a first practical indication about the size and specifics of the proposed cycles, a preliminary design of the components is made. The turbomachinery is sized according to the appropriate non dimensional numbers, the specific speed and diameter. An indication about the SOFC stack size and its operating specifics are given, together with the preliminary designs of the sensible and latent heat exchangers. A total preliminary size estimation of the cycle predicted a system with the size of approximately 4.5 shipping containers.","Hydrogen; SOFC-GT; Exergy analysis method; Turbomachinery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

However, the agglomeration of the nightlife industry in Amsterdam's city center results in a rise in noise, crime, and antisocial behavior, which triggers a backlash from residents. As a current countermeasure adopted by the municipality, state-led gentrification has mitigated the night-time economy's negative externalities to an extent, but caused massive closures of nightlife venues.<br/><br/>This research aims to solve the dilemma of Amsterdam's night-time economy through planning instruments that optimize the urban polycentricity.

The municipality wants to transform this park to a lively mixed use area by adding new buildings and transforming existing ones. One of the buildings that has the potential to be transformed is the monofunctional office building De Knip. I choose this building for my graduation project, because it addresses two important current issues, namely transformation and high rises. In my graduation project these problems are addressed by transforming the building De Knip to function as a neighbourhood connected within the city. This was done by creating Collective Private Commisioning groups that live in corridors that function like streets. These streets have a high permeability and adaptability in the high rise and a strong focus on nature inclusiveness in the low rise. Its overall strong dwelling atmosphere created the perfect setting for a lively multifunctional building where people can feel at home, express their identity, connect to their neighbours and where future transformations can be carried out easily due to the prefabricated and adaptive design. This design can stimulate the future transformation of Sloterdijk centrum with the liveliness and dwelling atmosphere that it brings and can be an example to similar office areas.","Collective Private Commissioning; Adaptability; Nature inclusive; Permeability; Transformation; High Rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.3876929,4.8428788"

Whereas urban forestry will need more space in our future cities, because of its positive influence on social, environmental and ecological aspects, the form and function of infrastructure are changing and this calls the need for a more integral way of designing it. <br/><br/>Aesthetic perception and experience are a new approach to look at this problem. It is hypothesised that combing these concepts will make it more feasible to create urban forestry and will make sure that future infrastructure will be more than just functional. <br/><br/>The site specific design is done on and along the Prinses Beatrixlaan in Delft, a road that currently creates a barrier between the neighbourhoods surrounding it.<br/><br/>By transforming some aspects of the private, car-oriented, infrastructure and creating a new east-west public transport connection along the Prinses Beatrixlaan, the road can be downgraded and lanes can be removed. This opens up a lot of space along the road, that can be used for urban forestry and better connections between surrounding neighbourhoods. Using four aesthetic categories – the sublime, beautiful, interesting and plain – this urban forest has been shaped to create an aesthetic experience for the users of different modes of transport that move along the road. <br/><br/>The design mainly consists out of three scales, those of the Prinses Beatrixlaan itself, of several location along the road and some details that elaborate on the aesthetic categories. Also a toolbox has been created that gives insight in how to work with these aesthetic categories on different themes. <br/><br/>Finally, a conclusion could be drawn that combining these three concepts – urban forestry, infrastructure and aesthetics - has a lot of potential, for both designers, visitors and nature itself. It gives more space for nature to develop freely, it makes infrastructure more integrated in the urban fabric and creates aesthetically pleasing spaces for people to enjoy their city.<br","experience; sublime; beautiful; movement; infratecture; green infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.0051383972168,4.345880031585693"

(mentor); Piccinini, D. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis builds on the proposition that the ocean is both an urban and social space. Therefore, marine planning needs to consider socio-cultural risks and opportunities to be deemed sustainable. This reconceptualisation is especially relevant for the Barents Sea, where retreating sea ice leaves the ocean more accessible to marine traffic and resource extraction every year. However, the current practice of marine spatial planning (MSP) responds predominantly to geopolitical and economic demands for resources like gas and oil - only the monetary value of the ocean is considered. It fails to provide an understanding of the ocean as a space of cultural values, memory, and meaning. As a result, the socio-cultural impacts of offshore development remain alarmingly unmapped and unknown. As an interplay between research and design, urbanism can understand human-sea relations and employ this understanding in spatial interventions, where MSP cannot. <br/> Following this hypothesis, I aim to approach the Barents Sea as an urban and local project. What does it mean to be at sea, to be changed by the sea, and to change it in return? How is the local economy of life dependent on conditions of marine space? And how can urban designers use this knowledge to affect change. In the first place, this is a theoretical work. I hypothesize what offshore urbanism should entail, propose entrances of design, and compose design principles in the Barents Sea.<br/> <br/>The theory is tested in a case study: the coastal community of Hammerfest. The current network composition of the Hammerfest maritory shows a system that is overdependent on petroleum activity. The project proposes two pathways of change towards a future where Hammerfest depends on a variety of alternative marine industries. As such, the community becomes more resilient to changes in offshore petroleum. Particularly after 2035, when the current production fields are depleted and extraction moves seaward, away from Hammerfest.<br/> <br/>Network analysis forms a key point of entrance for the maritorial design. The project regards ships as islands that are inhabited, occupied, and built by humans. They are urban nodes at sea. The maritory can thus be read as an interdependent network of nodes (islands, platforms, pipelines, ships) connected by the movement of goods and people. I use marine traffic density data to analyze the nodal patterns of movement. From it, we can read the organization of marine uses and their spatial relation to Hammerfest.<br/> I then select one node from the current network, the island Melkøya, to redevelop as the root of the proposed transition. The prospected departure of the gas industry established on Melkøya provides an opportunity to repurpose the island. Through the act of deconstruction and rehabilitation, the gas processing island is repurposed as a public port, harbouring local marine industry and recreation. From the island Melkøya, a new economy of life is allowed to grow seawards.<br/> <br/>Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to actuate academics and urbanists to use design as a means to inform and inspire MSP, and to open the discourse on offshore urbanism.<br/><br","Urban Planning; Marine Spatial Planning; Socio-cultural; Network Analysis; Coastal urbanization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","70.6893246993741, 23.593902897252764"

Through research by design, site specific problems are offered solutions. Later on, by linking the specific sites to the general theory, more general solutions are formed based on the design. This approach is chosen, because, by combining deductive and inductive research more general solutions can be found in a design on a small scale. This is necessary for this research because the problem is too big and very site specific to be solved from deductive research only. Lessons learnt are needed from practical examples to take steps towards answering the research question as a whole. <br/>The project location for the research by design is the Abtswoudse polder in Delft.

LN is also designed to be more anonymous, since less information has to be shared with the entire network. This should, in theory, improve privacy as well. However, recent works have shown that this is not quite true: due to the deterministic nature of contemporary routing protocols, an adversarial node on a payment path is able to uniquely identify at least one sender or recipient for about 70% of observed transactions. To combat this breach of anonymity, we propose a new routing algorithm that makes use of multiple path segments. By splitting the routing problem into multiple routing sub-problems and forming the final route by joining these sub-routes together, we introduce a degree of randomness which nullifies this kind of adversarial attack. Even when designing a counterattack, we still get a substantial improvement in anonymity, roughly tripling the number of source/destination pairs per attack. However, the protocol is also very costly, doubling the average fee and increasing the average hop count by more than 60%. This shows that the proposed protocol is not strictly superior to the current implementation, meaning that other (less drastic) protocol proposals are likely to give better cost/anonymity trade-offs.","bitcoin; lightning network; anonymity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But full safety and comfort guarantees cannot still be given to the drivers. In this project, research has been done to ensure driver safety and comfort for the driver on the decision logic module of a semi-automated vehicle. Research focuses on just one specific use-case which is driver fatigue. The main goal is to ensure driver safety and comfort in the case where the user is sleepy during manual driving. Markov Decision Process is used to create a model to successfully represent this case. Evaluation has been done using already existing Reinforcement Learning algorithms and comparing their performances with the decision-tree based baseline policy. In conclusion, a successful Markov Decision Process model is created. While evaluating, some models performed better than expected and some are worse. In the end, a successful model is proposed, it can still be developed further to provide more safety and comfort for the driver.","Markov Decision Process; Reinforcement Learning; semi-autonomous vehicles; Safety; Fatigue","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Production increased as a result of new technologies, growing amounts of pesticides, and government policies. Although these changes were fruitful, it is currently provoking environmental concerns. This is causing pressure for farmers to be more sustainable in the last few years. Therefore, farmers are embracing technology to produce more efficiently and sustainably. To increase sustainability, farmers need other organizations who help them with achieving more sustainable production. To make the biggest sustainable impact, all stakeholders of the supply chain need to collaborate to make the sector more sustainable. Therefore, it’s needed to create an ecosystem for continual innovation, to eventually be a more sustainable sector. IoT can be applied to automate the horticultural processes, which leads to reduced usage of resources, such as water, electricity, and pesticides, to increase the sustainability potential. Monitoring Service is developed to automatically fulfill the need of the crops. To be able to develop this solution, an ecosystem is needed to realize the Monitoring Service. The most important partner is a current horticultural technology supplier. This partnership has the benefits to easily enter the horticultural market, create more market knowledge, and makes it easy to contact the first prospects. Within the ecosystem, KPN provides the connectivity to connect all technologies with the platform. Besides the connectivity, KPN also sells its service as data safe. This data safe is a service that guaranteed the safety of the data, which keeps the data collected within the ecosystem.","Implementation; internet of things; Agricultural development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Even though this contextual pressure is being recognized by Dutch real estate developers, it is often not translated to practice. This is remarkable because studies over time have proven that sustainability has the potential lead to an enhanced competitiveness. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of what is withholding Dutch real estate developers to implement a sustainable corporate strategy, and what the impact is of sustainable development activities is on the competitiveness of such a party. To test this, a literature study was performed to provide insight on the barriers that are present for real estate developers to become more sustainable, how the competitiveness of a Dutch real estate developer can be measured, and which alternatives Dutch real estate developers can implement to become more sustainable. A survey was distributed amongst Dutch real estate developers to determine to what extent certain barriers are withholding them from becoming more sustainable and determine the current position in regards to sustainability. The results show that Dutch real estate developers, amongst some individual barriers from other categories, are mostly being kept from becoming more sustainable due to financial barriers. This is causing Dutch real estate developers to find themselves in a reactive position towards the sustainability laws and regulations set by the government and not proactively operating to become more sustainable. By giving insight towards how sustainability can improve the competitiveness, this problem can be alleviated. Through semi-structured interviews the impact of sustainable development activities on the competitiveness of Dutch real estate developers was measured. The results in general show that sustainability does contribute to the competitiveness of Dutch real estate developers. The order of impact of the sustainable development activities that were found is (1) green product development, (2) green profiling and marketing strategy, (3) green supply chain management, (4) green human resource management, and (5) green facility management. The last phase of this research provides a preliminary design of a corporate decision tool to act as a stepping stone for further research to eventually allow Dutch real estate developers to effectively prioritize between sustainable alternatives.","Competitiveness; Dutch real estate developers; sustainable development; key competitiveness indicators; corporate strategy; corporate social responsibility; corporate sustainability; corporate decision tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context 70s and 80s heritage, Bijlmerplein demonstrates ideological interplay between different ideas and ways of design of built environment in the one neighborhood. It was designed as a remediation and a response to failed modernist utopia - “City of the future” of Bijlmer together with other residential blocks such as Heesterveld, Hoptille and Haardstee. The final goal intended to create new identity for an area which would be relevant to Amsterdam city and could give sense of belonging to society in contrast of alienated and futuristic Bijlmer urban setting. Bijlmerplein boundaries had been shaped by the infrastructure (elevated streets, parking lots and separated traffic) which was the consequence of CIAM ideas. The area has also an anthroposophical concept which are embedded into NMB head office in by Alberts &amp; Van Huut. Cluster 2, designed by Atelier Pro architects had nature inclusive notion. Cluster 4 was designed by BroekBakema architects who were searching for national Dutch identity in the architecture and developed the “total” space concept inspired by ideas of neo-plasticism The design by research the focus was given for cluster 4 within the Bijlmerplein, because of its complex spatial composition, relation with public squares, accentuated front façade, architectural language, and the postmodern archetypes. The main idea of the design was to open the cluster by introducing the “green alley” feature and by densifying the block by careful extensions. The green alley becomes the key element for circulation and the center of the new residential spaces. It helps to reactivate the plinth and introduce urban greenery. At the same time, the research explored different ways of purifying and revitalizing postmodern archetypes such as: “gate”, “bridge”, “tower”, “street”, “courtyard” and “colonnade”. These features were seen as an attribute regarding historical value of the block. Cluster 4 is primary a social housing residential block, which also causes many social issues such as: lack of ownership, segregation, poverty, exclusiveness, drug dealing, homelessness. These issues were tackled by introducing different types of housing which intend to attract people from different social layers and diversify the block. This was done by introducing penthouses for young families, lofty studios for young professionals and three residential blocks for residents with medium income.","Bijlmerplein; Amsterdam-Zuidoost; Revitalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.31437457958749, 4.95229902584647"

The measurements using echo sounding and LiDAR leave data gaps because vessels cannot reach nearshore waters or the green laser unable to penetrate specific areas. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is an alternative to extract shallow water depths that is able to overcome these problems using multispectral imagery. There are two approaches of SDB: analytical and empirical. The analytical method requires several water properties, which might not be known. The empirical method relies on the linear relationship between reflectances and depths, but the relationship may not be entirely linear due to bottom types variation, water column, and noise. Machine learning approaches have been used to address nonlinearity, but it treats pixels independently, whereas there is a spatial correlation that influences SDB computations since adjacent pixels are correlated to depth. This characteristic of the local connectivity can be captured by Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). Therefore, this thesis conducts a study of SDB using CNN.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the following questions: (i) what kind of preprocessing is needed for the data sets; (ii) what kind of CNN architecture can be used; (iii) what is the accuracy of the method; and (iv) to what extent the pretrained model in certain areas can be reused in other areas. In order to represent a variety of depth, bottom type, turbidity, and water column properties, this study chooses six areas of interest in three different coastal regions: Puerto Rico, Key West, and Hawaii.<br/><br/>With several CNN configurations, the optimum accuracy is obtained using three convolutional layers, a window size of 9x9, and the RGBNSS bands. Based on the experiment and comparison to the previous studies, the accuracy of SDB using the CNN approach outperforms the linear transform, the ratio transform, Random Forest, and the radiative transfer model. The results show that the accuracy decreases as the depth increases and in more turbid water. Comparison between different image preprocessing indicates another benefit of CNN: removing the need to preprocess images since suitable corrections can be automatically performed by CNN given adequate training.<br/><br/>The use of multi-temporal images enhances the variety of training data and thus improves SDB accuracy. However, data variation should be equally distributed to avoid abnormality in the result. Transfer model analysis indicates several limitations of SDB results at particular depths or when implemented to a different water condition, making the coastal water characteristics considered when reusing a pretrained model from one area to another.<br/><br/>In summary, CNN does not require additional image preprocessing and features specifications for training. CNN can produce better SDB accuracy than several other methods. The accuracy improves by increasing the variety of training data. However, SDB using the transfer model still need to be further investigated. A thorough identification of the proportion of sample data is needed to obtain balanced training data. In this way, it is more likely to produce a more reliable and more stable CNN model for extracting shallow water depths in the new data.","Satellite Derived Bathymetry; Shallow water; CNN; Sentinel-2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Rutten, M.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Global economic losses due to flooding have increased over the last 50 years, with damages estimated in the billions of dollar each year. Governmental institutions face great challenges to reduce flood risk under the influence of population increase, urbanization and climate change. Interdisciplinary urban planning becomes more important to mitigate flood risk with a multidisciplinary approach and insights in conceptual designs is important to support interdisciplinary cooperation. An example of a country facing great challenges is Albania, where on average 23 flooding events occur each year and at least 54% of the regions have been affected. In addition, the country faces challenges in the disciplines of urban planning, transport and water quality. The capital city Tirana and surroundings were highly affected by flooding events in 2017. The city is prone to flash floods and, especially in the winter months, river flooding. It is crucial to identify areas susceptible to flooding and to quantify the impact on flood risk reduction of potential measures. Data availability imposes a major constraint to quantify flood risk in urban areas with currently available assessment methods. Therefore a flood risk assessment method needs to be identified that is applicable in areas with poor or scarce data. Once the method is identified it can be applied in the Tirana region to identify flood risk and to quantify the impact of measures. Potential measures were developed in an interdisciplinary workshop with students from the TU Delft and Tirana and focussed on the Tirana region, including the Lana river area. The proposed measures for the Lana river are quantified in the risk assessment in this thesis. The identified method defines flood risk as the product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability expressed in Expected Annual Damage (EAD) in Euro. European depth-damage functions for four land use classes are used, in combination with maximum damage values, to express the exposure and vulnerability component. The hazard is described by inundation maps and the development forms the core of this thesis. With the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) a Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) map is developed. A Synthetic Rating Curve (SRC) was constructed based on the application of the Manning equation with reach-averaged geometries derived from the HAND map. With a time series analysis of measured discharges, inundation maps could be constructed linked to a return period. The identified method was applicable in the Tirana region. Major benefits are the low computational requirements, easy applicable GIS operations and low data requirements, which make the method easily transferable to other regions. Constraints were found in the use of the coarse DEM with 25 meter resolution, which did not cover river geometries and local measures with high enough accuracy. This was solved by the manual inclusion of river geometries and verification of the developed inundation maps. The Lana catchment is identified as the area most susceptible to flooding with an EAD of approximately one million Euro. One of the proposed measures, a multifunctional cross-section, proved to be most effective with a reduction of 65%. An urbanization scenario, in which the risk increased with 84%, demonstrated the need of the measures. Finally, the assessment revealed potential adverse effects of upstream measures on other areas and proved to add beneficial insights.","Flood Risk; Albania; GIS; Scarce Data; Interdisciplinary","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This trend has only accelerated during the corona pandemic of 2020. Right now, the online grocery sector is the fastest-growing e-commerce sector in the world. At the same time, there is a trend in shorter food chains. The past few years have been particularly good for small alternatives of locally produced food. Companies like Boerschappen' and 'Support Your Locals' have been growing explosively in 2020. These companies try to sell products directly from the farmers to the customers.<br/>Local Heroes (LH) is a start-up located in Amsterdam that intends to exploit this growing market of locally produced food to the advantage of local speciality stores. By providing small stores with an online platform to sell their products they want to make them more resistant to the growing online supermarkets. And by including initiatives of shorter food chains they try to keep the customers close to where the food comes from. To achieve this goal, LH uses an app and a mobile distribution centre (DC). This DC is located on the outskirt of a local daily food market. Customer order food from various vendors located in the neighbourhood via the app. LH then collects all the products at the DC and distributes them to the customer. The DC also functions as a pick-up point for people in the neighbourhood. LH wants to expand its business to other markets in Amsterdam, and possibly the Netherlands. For this to happen they need a DC which they can put anywhere to start operations. This graduation project describes the design process of this mobile DC. Firstly, the analysis of the current DC is described. From this research came several focus areas regarding product flow, customer contact and ergonomics. By incorporating the wishes of the employees and by working at the DC myself improvements were made to the existing DC. Thanks to close relations with the production company (InnovaN) it was possible to build and test ideas in the real world. This ensured a well thought out design was possible for the final product. The final product is the result of an evolutionary design approach. By learning about the pros and cons of certain ideas in real-world operations, designs were altered and improved. The final design improves product flow within the operations and increases efficiency by removing unnecessary steps in the process. The entire DC has also been decreased in size to increase the placement options for LH. These design choices ensure LH can continue to grow to other markets. Enabling them to help local speciality stores in their struggle against online competitors.","Logistics; Food hub; food chain; hub; Distribution centre; Local Sustainable Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These issues are alleviated by decentralized FL (DFL), where the peers communicate model updates with each other instead of with a single server.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, DFL is challenging since (1) the training data possessed by different peers is often non-i.i.d.

The result is many physical stores, including my site-famous Dutch retail company V&amp;D, closed down and left many empty holes in Dutch city centers. These vacant buildings, which used to have close interactions with Dutch citizens’ urban life, are not accessible anymore and are gradually segregated from the vibrant urban life.

The building was used as an interior gathering space for almost one century and became part of the urban routing. In addition, the building is located in the prime area inside the historical city center and surrounded by the typical urban fabric consists of canal&amp;bridge.

One way to do this, is by extending the use cycle of a product, by making the product more repairable. This thesis has studied existing use cycle extension strategies to propose a new smartphone ProductService System that stimulates consumers to choose for repair over replacement. The developed Product-Service System is a smartphone application. This application is provided to the user for free, and helps him to perform failure diagnosis, failure solution and failure prevention of the smartphone. The main objective of this research has been to develop a smartphone ProductService System that stimulates consumers to choose for repair over replacement. I have developed the app based on a literature review, consumer interviews, expert interviews, design iterations, and user tests. Literature review, consumer interviews, and expert interviews have provided insight into a way to assess the repairability of smartphones, as well as existing strategies that increase repairability. Based on the provided insights, I developed several directions for a possible Product-Service System to take shape. Based on consumer input, the most promising direction was chosen, after which the final concept has been developed in two main iterations, including a user test. Finally, I have shown that the app does not only seem to contribute to use cycle extension, but that it also fulfils consumers’ needs and preferences, is economically sustainable, and is feasible for any business to achieve. This thesis has two main contributions. First of all, the developed repairability scoring system can be applied in both academia and businesses to rate a product’s repairability. In this thesis, the framework has only been applied to smartphones, but its theoretical background allows it to be applied to any other electronic product as well. Secondly, I have shown that the developed app poses an interesting business opportunity, and that it can be applied in practice by anyone who is willing to take up the development of the app.","repairability; smartphone; obsolescence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This document reports the exploration of the development of a context-specific strip reader for an innovative lateral flow test detecting schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a common poverty-related parasitic disease in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Transmission happens in infested water, putting especially children at risk. Schistosomiasis can be effectively treated. In order to do that, accurate diagnostics are needed at the point of care to target communities at risk. Leiden University Medical Center is developing a lateral flow test that detects the antigen CAA with high accuracy, using upconverting particles. The test has great potential in terms of accuracy, but a dedicated reader is needed to interpret the test result. A reader typically limits the accessibility of a test in low-resource settings, because of its size, high costs, and limited user-friendliness and robustness. On the other hand, one could benefit from the opportunities that come with such a device, such as reducing human error, quantifying results, and real-time data collection. The starting point was to explore the possibilities of developing a context-specific strip reader dedicated to the new test. The approach of this project was based on systemic design methodologies. It deals with complexity by creating interventions that move the system to a more desired state in incremental steps. Transitions towards desired states were described on four different levels of abstraction. On a global level, we aim towards leaving no one behind, making healthcare accessible for everyone. Big forces, like climate change and COVID-19, and smaller forces, like stigmas and technological challenges, are risk factors that could steer change away from the desired direction Meanwhile, opportunities arise, such as the rapid digitization of Sub-Saharan Africa. From a systemic viewpoint, it became clear that new frames are needed to create a strong and attractive narrative for the role of strip readers in diagnostics. Based on the insights, an intervention strategy was proposed to accelerate the development of a context-specific strip reader by early involvement of stakeholders. The strategy consists of two elements. 1) Three new narratives are proposed as an alternative to the current, negative frame of the use of readers in low-resource settings. These narratives were used to formulate multiple development paths of different technical concepts. 2) The Block Reader was developed to support the narrative with evidence and as a means for collaborative prototyping. It enables to gain and share insights, and to communicate with stakeholders. The device is fully modular, allowing the user (developers) to iterate on the technology and user-interaction quickly. Lastly, an outline of the next steps is discussed.","schistosomiasis; global health; smart diagnostics; healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Wintershall has assigned wireline facies associations directly on cored and un-cored wells in the Carboniferous of the Sothern North Sea. Conducting facies prediction using these wireline facies associations as an input can help with tapping into the remaining exploration and development potential of the area. However, the accuracy of this input must be evaluated using core data before machine learning algorithms are applied. This was quantified as 71% for 9 cored wells, where the background floodplain and braided channel facies had the highest accuracies of 88% and 81% respectively, and the mouth bars and marine shales facies could not be adequately validated due to their insufficient core sampling. Consequently, when using wireline facies associations for training facies prediction algorithms, this input’s intrinsic uncertainty should be accounted for while examining the outputs, especially for facies that are not sufficiently validated by cores. Applying facies prediction with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), showed that RNN can achieve the highest overall accuracy of 80.9%, due to the highest F1 scores for braided channel (0.88), point bars (0.60) and coal (0.53). The class imbalance problem is apparent for this dataset where the majority classes of background floodplain, braided channel, point bar and coal, are more predicted than the minority classes of crevasse splay sands, mouth bars, and marine shale. Applying RNN on the Westphalian A, B and C separately served as a form of imbalance correcting technique that increased the F1 scores of underrepresented facies. Future work can further refine the results by exploring imbalance correcting techniques through under-sampling the background floodplain and over-sampling the crevasse splay, mouth bar and marine shale facies.","machine learning; Facies Prediction; North Sea; Lithofacies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Still little is known for these types of gates for this specific forcing type. The semi-analytical model is still in its development phase and must be validated on its performance. This thesis aims for validation of the modal calculations performed by the Semi-Analytical model for submerged gates, which include fluid structure interaction. Several experiments were executed in the wave flume at the faculty of Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Delft. Dry hammer tests, wet hammer tests and wave tests were executed for different water levels. Different plates were investigated in the experiments: Solid Plate and Reinforced Plate. A measurement plan was designed to obtain reliable results from the measurement devices (strain gauges and accelerometers). The experimental data was subjected to an Experimental Modal Analysis algorithm. The Frequency Domain Decomposition turned out to be most suitable for this situation. The mode shapes that were found were subjected to a Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC), in order to compare them with the semi-analytical prediction. The results from the wet modal analysis showed that the Solid Plate had good correspondence with the prediction of the semi-analytical model. The mode shapes turned out to have a high MAC values, while the natural frequencies showed small relative errors for the modes under consideration. The Reinforced Plate was less accurate. In the wave experiments the first three modes were found, which were also believed to have the highest energy input. Considerable high MAC values assured that the identified modes were indeed the same as the modes of the semi-analytical prediction. The natural frequencies showed larger errors for especially the first mode (approx. 30%). It was observed that several measurement errors might have influenced the results of the Reinforced Plate. After finalizing the experiments for this plate, I discovered that the stiffeners and front plates came loose from the U-frame. The dynamic quantities of the Reinforced Plate were therefore adjusted during the experiments. The datasets of the experiments that were most trustworthy were selected for the different analyses. The Regular Wave Impact experiments showed good correspondence and where therefore assumed to be correct. The Solid Plate was concluded to behave as predicted by the semi-analytical model. High correlation between the predicted and identified modes and small errors in the natural frequencies were observed. The data from the Reinforced Plate showed that the high energy modes were identified for the wave experiments. Modal shapes had high correlation between predicted and identified ones, while the natural frequencies had somewhat large errors. It was observed that small natural frequency errors for the input modes resulted in relatively small errors for the calculated modes. Further validation of the model should focus on the prediction of maxima and time series of the response. The step from modal analysis to a time series is a final step in the semi-analytical model.","Dynamics; Experimental modal analysis; Modal experiments; Semi-analytical model; Wave experiments; Validation; Slender flexible submerged gates with overhang; Standing waves; Fluid Structure Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Dikes protect people and lands all around the globe. With rising sea levels, the importance of well-designed dikes has never been more essential. One of the main factors that can compromise the stability of dikes are macro-instabilities. Macro-instabilities can cause dikes to lose their water bearing potential, leading to floods. Methods are developed to as accurately as possible determine the probability that a macro-instability takes place in order to prevent it. Therefore, recent advancements include the remaining strength after macro-instability, which may be able to prevent flooding. The foremost methods to determine this remaining strength after macro-instability use D-Stability or the Material Point Method (MPM). Both D-Stability and MPM have advantages and disadvantages. D-Stability can quickly determine the probability that a macro-instability takes place, but cannot model the process of failure, and must therefore simplify this process to estimate the remaining strength. MPM on the other hand can accurately model what happens after a macro-instability, but has a much larger computational cost, especially for probabilistic computations. By supplementing D-Stability and MPM, this thesis proposes a method that exploits the advantages of both methods and mitigates the disadvantages. For a dike with a single clay layer, a connection was made between D-Stability and MPM, allowing dike profiles to be transferred back and forth. In order to make this connection, the SHANSEP undrained shear strength model was successfully implemented in MPM. By using the quick probabilistic D-Stability calculation and the post-failure modeling option of MPM, the probability of failure and the effect of failure can be quickly determined. By taking into account the effect of failure, the method can determine the probability of flooding, without simplifying the failure process. The method can also be used to determine if flooding via retrogressive failure or a larger single instability is more likely. The method was tested via a case study and verified via a RMPM Monte Carlo analysis. For the case study, the probability of flooding was 5.189*10-3 compared to an initial probability of failure of 7.22*10-1, a reduction in the order of 139. This probability of flooding compared well to the probability of flooding of 5.308*10-3computed using the more accurate and computationally expensive RMPM. Based on these first results, the proposed method is a viable method to assess the probability of flooding after macro-instability for clay dikes.","MPM; SHANSEP; D-Stability; Probabilistic; dike design; clay","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The grillage model has some benefits (i.e.: shorter calculation time and easier to apply pre-stressing) compared to the orthotropic plate model. However, during the Blankenburgverbinding project Ballast Nedam experienced that the transverse load-spread of the grillage model can be lower compared to the orthotropic plate model. This potentially results into a less economical reinforcement design. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in transverse load-spread of the grillage and orthotropic plate model and to make a judgement on the practical usability of the grillage model based upon the differences in reinforcement design. To test the hypothesis that the grillage model has less transverse load-spread compared to the orthotropic plate model and to quantify the impact on the reinforcement design, a case study on the bridge decks of the Blankenburgverbinding is carried out. The results of a grillage model are compared to an orthotropic plate model. In order to be able to judge whether to orthotropic plate model describes the correct behaviour of the bridge, this model is verified using a 3D plate model. In total, 3 different single-span, simply supported bridge deck layouts were modelled (straight, curved and curved with a skew angle). The results of the 3D plate model are almost equal to the results of the orthotropic plate model. Both these models show the same transverse load-spread. The grillage model shows less transverse load-spread compared to the orthotropic plate model and the 3D plate model. This difference in load-spread increases with increasing eccentricity of the applied load. The torsional and transverse shear stiffness has the biggest impact on the transverse-load spread. When these stiffnesses are higher, the transverse load-spread increases. Lowering the stiffnesses results into less load-spread. In case of the curved bridge deck, the grillage model results in about 7.3% more reinforcement compared to the orthotropic plate model. For the curved and skewed deck the grillage model results into up to 4.7% more reinforcement compared to the orthotropic plate model. The differences in design bending moments (Wood-Armer moments) are relatively small. Although the theoretical difference in amount of reinforcement is significant, the practical difference in reinforcement design between both models can be small. For example, the structural engineer is limited by the available space, detailing requirements and the available bar diameters. These limitations and rounding differences make that for some bridges it is possible to reduce for example 5% reinforcement and for some bridges such a reduction can be very hard to realise. In that case, the theoretical difference between the amount of reinforcement becomes very small or completely vanishes in practice. Eventually, it depends on the situation whether the benefits of the grillage model outweigh the theoretically less economical reinforcement design. When there are a lot of repetitive bridge decks it can be beneficial to use an orthotropic plate model. In that case, the orthotropic plate model has to be created only once and a small reduction in the amount of reinforcement of one deck can add-up to a significant reduction for the whole project. When there is only one bridge deck to model, or all spans are unique, the benefits of the grillage model most likely outweigh the practical difference in the amount of reinforcement.","Concrete Bridge; Grillage modelling; Orthotropic plate model; Transverse load-spread; Reinforcement design; Orthotropic deck; Voided deck; Finite Element modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

A specialized medical team consisting of multiple stakeholders works closely with Philips's newest technological devices and systems during these interventions. These complex procedures are followed and guided via real-time, on-screen imaging modalities. This way, technology-enabled, optimal care can be provided for many different interventions. Clinical demands, challenges and complexities can be very specific and patient-dependent. Often bottlenecks in IGT procedures come down to limitations like sterility and hands-busy situations. However, touchless interaction technologies provide solutions in many ways. Technologies like eye-gaze, voice control and gesture sensing are expected to minimize the number of mistakes made and time lost because of inefficiencies. The future context of IGT is explored by doing creative trend research to get an idea of the technologies, trends, and developments in the future healthcare landscape. A future vision of IGT is established to give an expression of a desired future. It provides a strategic reference point for actionable innovations. Through qualitative research, ideation and conceptualization, several design implications are provided. Synthesizing these concepts into an implementation strategy that aligns with the future vision is essential. Since the result of this thesis will be a roadmap, a division is made into three separate horizons leading towards the future vision. These horizons address a particular aim, alignment with the developing healthcare landscape and related implementation of the concepts into the roadmap. Through validation and assessment, the roadmap is optimized and aligned with the business. An estimated improvement target is established as a reference point. Additionally, the expected value of the clinical and operational performance of the concept propositions are estimated and substantiated. This results in a strategic roadmap that can deliver concrete insights and provide guidance in the implementation possibilities of these touchless UI innovations in this healthcare domain.","Image-guided Therapy; Touchless Interaction; Roadmap; Workflow; Strategic Design; Interaction technologies; Sterility; Cath lab; Minimally-invasive Surgery; hands-busy; Experience; UX Design; UI Design; Future of healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

Though this has brought numerous new inventions used every day, like social media, e-commerce, and video conferencing, it also opens up new opportunities for cyber criminals. As the intrusion detection systems used to identify malicious behavior in a computer network can generate large amounts of alerts, methods have been developed to aid security analysts in gaining insights into what is happening on the network. Of course, there is always room to improve these methods, which is the topic of this thesis. Currently, one of the state-of-the-art methods uses state machines to model the alert sequences. State machines are a good fit as they can extract the context of different alerts, but they cannot extract information like parallelism between different alerts. That is where field process mining comes in, with process mining algorithms being able to extract parallelism from sequential data. In this thesis, state-of-the-art algorithms from process mining are evaluated for modeling alert datasets from intrusion detection systems with the aim of improving the current methods. As a comparison, different methods for learning state machines also tested for the same data. The results of the evaluation and comparison show that the state machines perform better in modeling the alert datasets with respect to explaining the data. On the other hand, thee process mining algorithms were not able to construct sound models for the datasets, and a fourth mining algorithm gave false implications about the data. Furthermore, the possibility of combining state machines with process mining was also tested, with the idea that the combination can use the state machines to extract context and the process miner to extract parallelism. This method did not yield any improvements for the alert datasets tested, but that does not mean it is not viable in other cases.","Process Mining; State Machines; IDS alerts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, Amazon rivers are spaces that allow for shared occupation. By considering water as the meditative space, forms of shared occupation are proposed which can enable a reconfiguration for coexistence and forms of life in the Xingu River according to varied worldviews. This sensitive approach towards local existences looks for a type of urbanization different from that of the modern project.

More and more health-related data is being generated everyday and as will be shown later, its primary as well as its secondary usage brings many benefits to the healthcare system. However, medical data systems are not fail proof and are often the target of cyber-attacks, compromising the privacy of patients and the availability of the system. In fact, there are several security and privacy parameters which a medical data sharing system should ideally adhere to. These include strong authentication and unforgeability, integrity and confidentiality of data, proper consent management and access control mechanisms, availability of data and services, identity anonymity, data anonymity and unlinkability. With the emergence of blockchain technology a new possibility has emerged to realize a secure and trusted medical data sharing system across different institutes, where patients are in control of their data. Through fundamental features of blockchain, like digital signatures, a peer-to-peer network, a distributed and immutable data structure, decentralized consensus, off-chain storage and smart contracts the various security and privacy goals of a medical data sharing system can be met. Primarily these features do a successful job in addressing the security related requirements of a medical data sharing system. Authentication and unforgeability are provided through digital signatures, integrity and confidentiality are met through digital signatures and the immutable ledger, consent management and access control can be implemented with smart contracts and finally availability is achieved through the peer-to-peer nature of the blockchain. Privacy requirements are not handled well through these inherent features and require additional techniques to be met. Identity mixers protocols, relying on zero-knowledge proofs, can be used to achieve identity anonymity and unlinkability.","Medical data; blockchain; security; privacy","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This paper focuses on reading activities during remote learning. An important part of learning is keeping sustained attention on the learning materials, as a shift from sustained attention to internal thought or mind-wandering oftentimes decreases the learning performance. Yet this shift is very common during daily activities. It is therefore important for a remote E-learning system to be aware of these attention shifts and allow it to intervene when necessary. Prior research indicates that facial emotion detection and participant's body temperature are generally missing as data modalities. Especially facial emotion recognition may contribute to this area of research, as facial emotions may indicate a learner's affective state during the learning process, and detection of this can be done using a simple consumer laptop web camera. Therefore this paper aims to investigate the feasibility of using a standard laptop web camera to detect facial emotions and a cheap Infrared Temperature Sensor (IR-sensor) to detect the loss of sustained attention. Two experiments were conducted to gather attentive and inattentive data. From this data, features were extracted which were used in multiple machine learning models. The created Machine Learning (ML) models worked well on synthetic test and validation data, but they performed poorly in practice. Our main hypothesis for this is overfitting of the ML models on the data, as due to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) no more than three participants partook in the user studies. Overall, the conclusion is that both emotional facial detection and participant body temperature show great potential to detect sustained attention, but further research needs to be done with a larger group of participants to confirm this.","sustained attention; multimodal learning analytics; machine learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/MultimodalLearningAnalytics Software and datasets","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The resulting detection model performs well on validation data with a F1-score of 0.889. The model does not perform well on testing data however, showing that it is not usable in practice. We give several possible explanations for this behavior, most of them originating from an overfitted model due to the small size of the user study.

The rise of the Internet of Things, often resource-constrained devices such as embedded sensors, has leveraged these services.

This paper discusses the integration of blockchain and IoT while expanding upon existing studies in a smart home environment where privacy needs immediate attention. Furthermore, different privacy-preserving mechanisms used in blockchain-based IoT solutions were classified and analyzed. The evaluation reflects that cryptographic solutions enhance overall privacy in terms of data confidentiality and untraceability but are low utility solutions for resource-constrained IoT.

The main question that we aim to answer is: How can access control techniques (ACT) be incorporated into a BC-based medical data sharing system (MDSS)? To answer this question, we created an access control system (ACS), based on HyperLedger Fabric, after evaluating existing techniques, with the use of a set of questions, that were chosen specifically for this purpose. Our ACS uses a smart contract, called the Access Contract to restrict access, based on access levels and permission queries, which are stored in the state ledgers of HyperLedger Fabric's world state. The Access Contract defines the necessary transactions for an ACS, in which these variables are used. Our ACS satisfies more metric questions than the related works's average and is thus optimal. We found that AC can be incorporated into a BC-based MDSS, by utilizing smart contracts to define the needed transactions that use access levels and permission queries to restrict the access of users.","Blockchain; Access control; Hyperledger Fabric; Smart contracts","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

No existing machine learning algorithms have been developed to create comic illustrations based on descriptions of illustrations, or the dialogue in comics. Moreover, it is not known if a generative adversarial network (GAN) can generate original comics that correspond to the dialogue and/or descriptions. GANs are successful in producing photo-realistic images, but this technology does not necessarily translate to generation of flawless comics. What is more, comic evaluation is a prominent challenge as common metrics such as Inception Score will not perform comparably, as they are designed to work on photos. In this paper, we: 1. Extend state of the art GANs to enable a comics-focused GAN architecture; 2) We implement DescriptionGAN, a novel text-to-comic pipeline based on a text-to-image GAN that synthesizes comics according to text descriptions. 3. We describe an in-depth empirical study of the technical difficulties of comic generation using GAN’s.

However, despite a large number of comic strips published online, very few datasets of annotated comic illustrations are available. This forms a bottleneck for further advancements in the field. The source of the data scarcity is the manual labor required for annotation — one has to download the comic strips, separate each strip into panels (individual illustrations), and transcribe the text. Automating the process is needed, but it poses several challenges. Panel detection in comic strips is non-trivial, due to varying layouts and styles of comics. Automated transcription is also challenging, as the out-of-the-box optical character recognition (OCR) models struggle with diverse fonts, hand-writing styles, and backgrounds. We design an automatic comic text-image dataset construction pipeline, termed DCP, consisting of three components: (i) web scraping, (ii) panel extraction, and (iii) text extraction. A multi-threaded comic scraper is created to download all the comics. A panel extraction algorithm based on panel frame detection is developed to divide the comic strips into individual illustrations. Lastly, to effectively extract the text using OCR, we propose additional pre-processing and post-processing steps, namely, up-scaling and binarizing images, clustering-based text ordering, and dictionary-based autocorrect. We extensively evaluate the prototype of DCP on three comic series: PHD Comics, Dilbert, and Garfield. Web scraping is used to downloading over 25000 comic strips at an average pace of 149ms per image. Panel extraction results on 1118 panels show success rates of 100%, 97%, and 71% for Dilbert, PHD Comics and Garfield respectively, outperforming the baseline in terms of accuracy and speed. The text extraction algorithm, tested on 1100 comics, achieves a 7x error reduction compared to the out-of-the-box OCR.","comics; ocr; dataset creation; scraping","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In this study, two variants of the traditional PD game are proposed in the context of spatial and evolutionary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma; each variant features the inclusion of trust as a variable that affects the rewards of the two-player game. The goal of this paper is to study the impact that trust has on the efficacy of traditional Prisoner’s Dilemma strategies played by agents in simulated environments. The results obtained over different experiments confirm that trust indeed fosters cooperating behaviours among agents, and allows them to more easily populate worlds that feature harsh living conditions.","iterated Prisoner's Dilemma; Trust; Cooperation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

However, the technological approach misses, and the apps are mainly for PK-12 pupils. Thus, the current paper aimed to create a framework for (learning) apps for higher education, including their pedagogical and technological approaches. Overall, eleven different app types were identified and categorized into four main categories: practice, organization, social, and creation. Then the apps were further classified using their pedagogical design and instructional approach. The applications can be identified as skill-, content- or function-based applications with overlap in the different categories. Finally, the mobile platform and the features used were analyzed and included in the framework here it was found that most of the apps were hybrid applications which allow for a diverse set of features for the apps.

To be able to answer the research question, several approaches and strategies are implemented in the environment and their success is compared. This has led to the conclusion that, in this particular environment, defensive actions like slide tackling cannot be performed and thus cannot be used to defend. Therefore, other solutions are necessary, as a result, a combination of approaches is the most important way of making the dispossession strategy as successful as possible.

The evaluations for the positioning techniques consist of 250 shots shot by an attacker from random distances and angles. The evaluations indicate that both goalkeepers have an improvement in performance over the basic goalkeeper, used by the other teams.

A large part of having a competent goalkeeper, is having a well-anticipating goalkeeper. This research will improve the goalkeeper’s level of anticipation by finding its own weak spots. By training an attacker against this goalkeeper, the weak spots can be determined. Based on this data the goalkeeper can estimate in which region of the goal a real opponent is likely to score and decrease that scoring chance by making a move. Heuristics and a deep neural network are used to estimate how likely the attacker is to make a goal. The results show that the attacker that uses the deep neural network has a chance of scoring a goal which is about 10 to 15 percentage points higher than a random shooting attacker. The deep neural network attacker is however outperformed by the heuristic based player by about 15 to 20 percentage points. Taking that into account, embedding the heuristic based attacker into the goalkeeper gives the goalkeeper a good sense of what areas of the goal it should cover to decrease the likelihood of conceding a goal.","AI World Cup; Football; Deep Learning; Neural Network; Goalkeeper","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This leads to the main privacy concern, namely ensuring the privacy of proprietary information, since access to this information can mean a competitive advantage in the market. Several techniques which enable collaboration while preserving privacy have been developed over time, including secure transformation, which is a non-cryptographic approach. The main focus of this paper is studying this technique and its recent developments, along with the feasibility of using it to preserve privacy in supply chains, through a literature review. Secure transformation is still somewhat in its infancy, with much theoretical research being conducted, yet the technique still not being employed in practice. Therefore, reviewing the research done is the most suitable approach to answering the question of how secure transformation applications can preserve privacy in collaborative supply chains.

As a testbed, we use a camera trap animal dataset with a rare deer class, which is augmented with synthetic deer samples. We adapt existing domain adaptation methods to two new methods for the single rare class setting: DeerDANN, based on the Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN), and DeerCORAL, based on deep correlation alignment (Deep CORAL) architectures. Experiments show that DeerDANN has the highest improvement in deer classification accuracy of 24.0% versus 22.4% improvement of DeerCORAL when compared to the baseline. Further, both methods require fewer than 10k synthetic samples, as used by the baseline, to achieve these higher accuracies. DeerCORAL requires the least number of synthetic samples (2k deer), followed by DeerDANN (8k deer).","Domain Adaptation; Synthetic Data; Data Augmentation; Camera Trap Dataset","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Despite this popularity, the generation of fabric patterns remains somewhat unexplored. A possible reason for this could be that there is no publicly shared dataset large enough to train models. However, research into this topic could be relevant because designers can take up to multiple weeks for a single design, but a trained GAN could generate thousands of designs per day. Next to this fabric patterns have characteristics that make them different from the datasets commonly used right now, which means an investigation could yield new insights into the capabilities of GANs. This research investigated the performance of several GAN models on the task of fabric pattern generation and compared these to another popular method of image generation: variational autoencoders. By using open-source implementations of GAN models, and a dataset of fabric patterns provided by Vlisco, a Dutch fabric company, the performance of GANs has been evaluated. To protect the interests of Vlisco, this dataset cannot be shared. The results show clear promise in the capabilities of GANs to replicate these complex patterns, but these results are not yet of the same quality that GANs have been able to achieve in other domains. However, these results are an improvement from those of previous research. The results achieved by variational autoencoders are similar to those of GANs, but state-of-the-art GANs perform better. Due to limited time and resources, only low-resolution samples have been generated for evaluation. In the future, higher-resolution images could be generated which could yield additional insights into the current capabilities of GANs in this domain.","Generative Adversarial Network; Fabric Pattern Generation; Image Generation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

It relies on cryptographic techniques that enforce integrity on transaction records. The records (blocks) stored are limited in size and frequency. One well-known issue regarding blockchain technology is the lack of scalability. In order to mitigate this problem, payment channels were introduced. These are considered an ""off-chain"" solution as communication with the blockchain is not required for executing transactions. Nonetheless, payment channels are debit-based, thus each channel that contributes to forwarding the payment is required to have a sufficient amount of coins to route the money. If this is not the case, the transaction may not succeed. For solving this matter, the node may decide to split the payment and forward it through multiple intermediaries until the destination is reached. This paper studies how fee models can be integrated into splitting protocols. An overview of the current state of the technology is provided, followed by a proposed solution for integrating fees into splitting protocols. It has been observed that splitting the payments and charging lower fees leads to a higher number of successful transactions, an outcome that was expected. The proposed fee model relies on the payment value and a statistic about the distribution of coins owned by the involved parties. The highest success ratio was achieved when combining the proposed design with the SplitIfNecessary splitting protocol. Nonetheless, when using the same fee model, there does not seem to be any pattern between the splitting protocol and the transaction value.<br","Blockchain; Payment Channel Networks; Splitting Payments; Lightning Protocol","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This research is linked to a new film-making technology where, instead of using a green screen, the background of a scene is displayed on a screen in real time using a computer generated background. This provides real time lighting in the studio; however, due to the limited dynamic range of the screen, it can not fully replicate the brightness of light sources. Overcoming this problem involves capturing and synchronize frames that each display a small section of the wider dynamic range, defined as illumination maps. The method uses a pipeline in which the illumination maps are displayed on a monitor in a grouped order, which are then captured with a camera. The recording is processed by labeling the frames and selecting key frames. The key frames are then additively combined with compatible illumination maps, which result in a video of the full dynamic range.<br/>A program was developed as a proof of concept, providing expected results. For various recording inputs, It was also found that the implemented program discarded a lot of the frames of the recordings. A variation of the proposed method also yielded a slight speed-up, for practically the same results.<br/>The proposed method provides a good starting point tackling the problem of artificially extending the dynamic range.

The most popular clustering algorithm is k-means clustering. K-means clustering clusters the data into k clusters where a cluster is represented by the mean of the data points called a centroid. Instead of using the mean as a centroid, a data point (medoid) can be used instead. This algorithm is called k-medoids algorithm. Both the algorithms work in an offline setting where all the data is known beforehand and usually use Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between any two points. SeqClu is another clustering algorithm for sequential data that works in an online setting and uses Dynamic Time Warping as its distance measure. It is based on k-medoids where it uses p sequences called prototypes, to represent a cluster. It assigns an incoming sequence to the cluster that has the lowest average distance between its prototypes and the incoming sequence. The issue in this approach is that many Dynamic Time Warping distance calculations need to be made which affects the clustering speed and using the average distance affects the clustering accuracy due to outliers being assigned as prototypes. This paper proposes an alternative algorithm with three variants for the cluster assignment process. This algorithm iterates through the prototypes in search for the closest prototype while excluding clusters that are deemed too far. It assigns the incoming sequence to the cluster of the closest prototype that it has found. Experiments on the UJI Pen Characters and UCR Synthetic Control datasets show an improvement in clustering speed and accuracy.","machine learning; clustering; Sequence Clustering; online clustering algorithms; k-medoids","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This framework misses two vital features, a screen capture feature and a dashboard for statistical data analysis and visualization for use in web-based experiments.Here we have implemented this dashboard and screen capture feature as an addition to LogUI. We cover tools for screen recording and methods to limit bandwidth usage when sending these recordings between client and server. For the dashboard, we worked in cooperation with interactive information retrieval (IIR) researchers working with the open-source collaborative search system SearchX. Using their input, we determined metrics, visuals, and features to be included in the dashboard.<br/>Our results demonstrate that recording a single browser tab as opposed to the entire screen or a browser window is more bandwidth-efficient when sending recordings from client to server. Using the H.264 video format results in much better compression compared to other formats available. A low bitrate setting also results in low bandwidth usage, but this setting should be set with care. The dashboard intends to prevent researchers from having to implement their own scripts for data analysis. Its main focus is comparing aggregations of sessions, but it does allow the analysis of single sessions. Including metrics like dwell time, time between queries, session duration, and event occurrences, as well as visuals like box plots, time series plots, and an event timeline is highly beneficial for IIR researchers using LogUI. Being able to relate logs to their occurrence in a screen recording is also advantageous. In an evaluation session, the researchers were able to complete a series of tasks with little difficulty on average. Some features, like filtering specific sessions, or metrics for the visuals, are not fully comprehensible. However, in its evaluation, five out of five researchers noted that they would use the dashboard in their future research. This shows that the included metrics, visuals, and features have been correctly selected.","logging; screen capture; dashboard; data analysis; data visualization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This paper presents a systematic user interactive process to abstract a generic photograph and to produce suitable content for vectorization. The goal of abstraction is to simplify the content of the photograph while retaining important information, creating a stylized and artistic image as a result. The system offers the user to create an importance map, by selecting regions with high importance or salience. Then, two different methods, bilateral filtering with k-means clustering and mean-shift segmentation, can be used as abstraction methods. Various parameters for different parts of the image and for each method, are exposed to the user to extend the spectrum of variety for the end result, and to tune the final image as desired. Canny's edge detection process is used to create a line drawing from the original image. The user can adjust thresholds, delete edges, and change the thickness and smoothness of edges to alter the line drawing. The resulting images are greatly diverse in terms of the number of colors and the amount of edges they can potentially have. In the end, this method proposes a new interactive way to create images suitable for vectorization, by combining and altering previous abstraction techniques.","image abstraction; vectorization; photograph abstraction; photograph vectorization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In SSI applications, the user will be in control over their identity when an issuer attests to it.

This research first focuses on building a claim portability framework, which means these verifiable claims and attestations can be communicated between the Super App and other applications. This framework is designed using a public key infrastructure, as that is already present in the Super App. Before sending a claim or attestation, it is signed by the sender and encrypted with the public key of the intended receiver for security purposes. The Super App currently lacks infrastructure to assign issuers of attestations, so a Trusted Issuer registry will have to be stored somewhere in the network. To contest the adoption problem that currently exists in many SSI solutions, the usability has been evaluated as it plays a significant part in adoption.

This paper looks at a newer novelty to neural networks for image counting, which is based on single-pixel center localization instead of the traditional bounding boxes. This neural network’s loss function is the weighted average Hausdorff distance, which does not only take into account the number of misclassified points but also the distance between predicted points and ground truth values. The paper aims to compare the accuracy of the single-pixel center neural network on original training images of wheat heads as compared to filtered images. The filtered images have had a band pass filter applied to them, that is constructed by looking at the average frequency of wheat heads. It filters out certain lower and higher frequencies up to a threshold, and its aim is to reduce background noise and accentuate the wheat heads. Results showed that there was no significant and attributable improvement in the performance of the object counter when trained on images with filtered frequency information. A discussion of the unexpected results then carries out, with the aim of rationalizing the insignificant improvement in performance of the neural network on filtered images. As part of the discussion and conclusion, a recommendation is also made, giving insights into determining if this single-pixel center neural network is appropriate for a given dataset of images.","fft; neural network; object locator; image processing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The main reason for their privacy concern is that the party does not want to lose their competitive advantage by giving away company secrets. Collaborative optimization algorithms can be applied to problems in the supply chain, and secure multiparty computation is incorporated as part of the algorithm to preserve the privacy of the parties. This paper aims to create an overview of privacy-preserving applications in the collaborative supply chain by conducting a literary study that focuses on secure collaborative optimization research and its limitations.<br/><br/>Research findings showed that secure multiparty computation can be applied to the following supply chain collaboration problems: capacity sharing, price-masking, distributed scheduling, collaborative production and transport, vehicle routing, and resource allocation. These algorithms use multiparty computation that is secure under the semi-honest adversarial model, because a malicious model is generally too inefficient for practical use. This choice comes with a cost in privacy, as the semi-honest model assumes parties collaborating will not break the protocol. This is a weak assumption that results in an impractical protocol, as real life applications of semi-honest multiparty computation would not be protected against a party that benefits from cheating. Furthermore, secure multiparty computation has a limitation that it cannot prevent a party from lying in its private input.<br/><br/>This paper recommends for future secure collaborative optimization research to combine multiparty computation with game theory. Achieving incentive compatibility in a protocol proves that it is in the best interest for a party to not cheat, as it either leads to a loss in benefits or they are caught. This allows for the MPC protocol to keep its efficiency by being secure under just a semi-honest adversarial model, as well as offer greater protection for honest parties from a rational malicious party.","Secure Multi-Party Computation; Incentive Compatibility; Supply Chain Collaboration","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

To improve the accuracy, we investigated the influence ofthe frequency domain, by pre-processing the training data two different times using acustom filter, based on frequencies found in wheat heads, and a high pass filter.The approach is evaluated on the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset[11]. To compare the accuracy the generated segmentations were mapped to boundingboxes based. The proposed method did not show to be able to generate competing de-tection compared to the baseline method associated with the GWHD dataset, but theGWHD dataset has a different measurement of truth, consisting out bounding boxesinstead of segments which is in the disadvantage for the W-Net.Pre-processing the dataset using the high pass filter did increase the intersection overunion with 1,4% and the deviation of the reconstruction loss was smaller when fre-quency filtering was applied.Although the object detection has a low accuracy, this study showed that some ba-sic wheat head detection can be achieved by using the unsupervised segmentationmethod W-Net and the accuracy can be increased if a high pass filter is applied aspre-processing step.","W-Net; wheat head detection; Unsupervised; Frequency domain","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Supervised models especially suffer from this problem as they need informative labels to learn from. As a result, upon evaluation, supervised models appear to perform worse than unsupervised models. This inspired our research on whether action localization can aid the video summarization process. To investigate this issue, this paper will answer the question of how well VASNet, a supervised video summarization model, can predict summaries for videos in an action localization dataset. This involves investigating whether action localization can produce well-correlated human-generated summaries and how it affects the quality of predicted summaries. Our findings reveal that there is a positive indication that action localization can aid in producing more well-correlated human summaries.

This article explore different sequence length amounts as well as different positions from where to extract the packets from. The findings indicate that the current default sequence length of 20 is too high, leading in many cases to no clusters being found. 8 has been determined to be the optimal length for both performance and efficiency. Additionally, it has been established that using a windowed approach whereby a connection is being sliced into multiple, smaller connections could make MalPaCa more usable in situations where connection lengths are unequally distributed. Furthermore, MalPaCas usability as a tool has been improved by automating the clustering error metric determination, thereby providing the user with a valuable, visual measure as to how well MalPaCa has fared in creating the clusters.

There is a strong connection between the work needed to construct a mirror anamorphosis, and the computations done in raytracing. Raytracing has been a major topic of research with applications in high-quality image rendering. We propose an algorithm which combines raytracing for mirror anamorphosis with texture mapping. We first generate a set of points based on the desired quality, and triangulate them to a two-dimensional triangle mesh using Delaunay triangulation. Using raytracing, the mesh is projected onto the surface bouncing off the mirror. Surface intersections are recorded in a mapping with its respective texture coordinates. Based on this mesh, we do not have to execute our raytracing algorithm again if the projected image is changed, thus providing us with a significant speedup.","anamorphoses; ray tracing; texture; Algorithms; engineering; computer graphics; Triangle mesh","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","Reflection Art",""

DeFi aims to remove centralized intermediaries such as Market Makers. An Automated Market Maker (AMM), implemented in a smart contract, is a decentralized version of these. Kyber's Dynamic Market Maker (DMM) is a next-generation AMM which solves two issues: Capital Inefficiency (CI) and Impermanent Loss (IL). CI is decreased by an amplification factor which a Liquidity Provider sets upon creaton of a liquidity pool, whereas IL is decreased by dynamic fees. A DMM features two reserves: one real reserve that reflects the true amounts of the two tokens in the pool and one virtual reserve that reflects the amounts after the amplification factor is applied. The vulnerability to a sandwich attack exists because the virtual reserve ratio can be unbalanced by an attacker. This results in slippage for the victim when their transaction gets executed. Finally, the attacker can perform a swap using the incorrect ratio. The research question of this paper is: How can one mitigate sandwich attacks in Kyber DMM? Kyber's current mitigation features slippage protection to protect users from sandwich attacks. The slippage protection is implemented by adding two parameters to the function used when adding liquidity: one for specifying the lower bound for the virtual reserve ratio and one for specifying the upper bound. However, this mitigation is only present in the router. Therefore, users interacting with the pool contract directly remain vulnerable. To show that this is true, we modify Kyber's test case for sandwich attacks to encompass the mint function in the pool contract. The existing mitigation can be broadened by implementing a code correction in the mint function like the one present in the function used when adding liquidity.","Decentralized Finance; Kyber; Sandwich attack; Blockchain; Cyber Security","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The participants of the Chainlink system are incentivized by a coordination game, which poses game theoretic risks. While some game theoretic analyses of blockchain based systems exist, no formal study has been done on the incentives securing the Chainlink system.

We show that users can not detect whether incentives are aligned such that honest node behaviour is a strictly dominant strategy, making it impossible for users to assess the security of the system.

In case there is no direct channel between the sender and receiver, the routing algorithm uses source routing and a shortest path algorithm to determine the hops in a transaction. However, the lack of randomness in the routing decision allows an attacker to de-anonymize either sender or receiver, if they happen to be one of the nodes in the transmission path. The guarantees offered by the onion routing style algorithm are not enough to ensure anonymity when little to no randomness is used when choosing the path. Here we show how it is possible to modify the path finding algorithm keeping backward compatibility. It increases anonymity between the sender and receiver adding random hops to the already computed shortest path. Anonymity and efficiency metrics are then analysed with respect to an adversary that is aware of the full protocol implementation. Furthermore, assuming a protocol-aware adversary, an attack is designed, and it is concluded to be successful at most 53\% of the time and singularly de-anonymizing both parties in 1\% of the cases. The average number of hop counts increases by approximately two and the average fee paid by the sender increases by 4.77 times. Our results suggest a possible increase in the anonymity offered without a significant impact on the complexity of the lightning protocol implementation.

The latter are complex networks that learn information about objects from images and are then able to predict the location of these objects in new, unseen images. There are, however, certain datasets that are hard to learn on, partly because the environment in which images are taken is diverse and complex, and also because the objects to detect can appear in fairly different shapes. The dataset considered in this paper is called the Global Wheat Head Dataset (GWHD, provided by a Kaggle competition). An object detector is run on the original GWHD images and then the performance is compared to running the detector on a frequency filtered version of the images. A mathematical transform called Fourier Transform is used to map images from their spatial (pixel) domain to a new domain called the frequency domain, where certain non-informative frequencies are filtered out and then the images are mapped back to their spatial domain. Two experiments were conducted and results show that with this specific filtering methodology, no improvement is found on the GWHD dataset using an object detector called YoloV5. A pipeline was developed which allows for custom filtering strategy implementations and customs datasets. Similar work has shown that images in their frequency domain can speed up computational time and also increase the accuracy of an object detector, so this paper also gives the opportunity for further experiments with the created pipeline.","FFT; Fourier Transform; Object detection; YOLO; YOLOv5; computer vision; Machine learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

We analysed these three architectures for the support of availability, access control, data integrity, nonrepudiation, data authentication, anonymity, data confidentiality, and unlinkability. The analysis carried out by the in-depth review of relevant literature shows that NDN and PURSUIT support all eight security and privacy features while NetInf is missing nonrepudiation and does not fully support data authentication.

Allowing to split a payment into smaller payments and forwarding them through different intermediaries is a way to solve this issue, but a party only knows the capacities of the channels it is connected to. Therefore, it is possible for a payment to be sent to an intermediary which would not have sufficient funds to forward it to another node, closer to the receiver. Making redundant transactions in order to further improve the payment success ratio is a way to handle this drawback.

However, autonomous driving technology has significant weaknesses and is not safe in unexpected conditions. As a result, automobile manufacturers insist that the driver remains in the driver's seat even while the vehicle is in autonomous mode. Semi-autonomous driving helps in this situation. Semi-autonomous vehicles require minimum human intervention and cooperate with human drivers. It provides multiple levels of automation to the driver to give the optimal decision about who should be in charge in a particular scenario. However, it has limitations and does not work perfectly in all complex scenarios. This paper focuses on this limitation and provides a reinforcement learning strategy to solve an existing complex scenario. In this specific scenario, Mediator initiates a shift of control to a different automation level when uncomfortable driving situations are detected. Markov Decision Process strategy used to formulate the decision problem, and the reinforcement learning strategy compared with a decision-tree based baseline strategy for the evaluation. The outcome was collected using driver safety and comfort metrics. The outcome supports the hypothesis, demonstrating that a learned reinforcement learning strategy can be used to solve complex decision-making scenarios in semi-autonomous driving.","semi-autonomous vehicles; Reinforcement Learning; Markov Decision Process","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The problem that arises with many camera traps is that they can collect more images than a human can realistically go trough all by themselves. To help classify these images computer vision is proposed as an alternative to manual classification. Many modern computer vision applications use neural networks. A hard part for the neural networks is that to train them well a large data set is needed, and sometimes it is almost impossible to build this dataset. This is where synthetic samples can be used instead of real samples. These samples are created by using computer graphics software to create realistic looking images to enlarge the dataset, or even be the whole dataset. This work evaluates how well a segmentation network was trained on only synthetic samples could perform on the real data. For this multiple segmentation networks were used like: U-Net and SegNet and the networks were trained on different datasets all derived from the synthetic data.

Despite its popularity, recent studies demonstrate that its deterministic nature compromises the anonymity of the Lightning Network. In other words, threatening parties present in the transaction path can guess the sending and receiving parties of transactions easier than in the absence of such strong determinism. As a solution, we propose augmenting the LND with a length bounded random walk insertion to include randomness into the transaction path and regain anonymity. Most importantly, we found that for generated network simulations and the snapshot network, including the random walk into the transaction path improves anonymity. In simulations with LND routing, attackers could identify senders or<br/>receivers for 70% of transactions. For simulations of networks with 100 nodes and an average of 2 edges per node with the weighted random walk insertion, attackers could identify senders or receivers around 65% of the time. However, for simulations of networks with 500 nodes and an average of 10 edges per node with the weighted random walk insertion, attackers could never identify senders or receivers. Besides, for the snapshot simulation, they could only identify either in around 4% of transactions. Thus, we overall believe that the random walk insertion into the LND algorithm addresses the anonymity issue of the unmodified algorithm.","lightning network; random walk; anonymity","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Many extensions of this problem have been subject to research in the last decade and now that electric vehicles are starting to pop up in more and more cities, questions are asked about how an electric vehicle should decide which charging station to charge at to minimize their lateness. This problem is of growing significance due to the growth of the amount of electric vehicles and the disruptions which are caused by the longer recharging times of an electrical vehicle when compared to fossil fuel-based vehicles. Since there are countless possibilities and variables to consider in this problem (e.g. the price of electricity or the distance to a charging station), research should be conducted to see which kind of algorithm most satisfies the need of the end-user. To address this problem, this paper proposes several algorithms and compares them to each other based on algorithmic efficiency, average travel time of the vehicles and possible disadvantages when using the algorithms. Through simulations we show that the IARS algorithm as proposed in an earlier paper leads to the overall best performance, but that it lacks efficiency in terms of algorithmical complexity. We also show that when using a shortest path algorithm, the addition of a greedy geometric spanner significantly decreases the time complexity of the algorithm, in some cases reducing the average timespan of the simulation of 1 day by as much as 34%.","Electric Vehicles; routing algorithm; scheduling; routing problem","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Previous work in deep learning for precision agriculture employs the already established object detectors, Faster R-CNN and YOLO, adapted for the given context. However, these models suffer from the necessary duplicate-removal postprocessing and from the low performance on overlapping objects. On the other hand, the novel Detection Transformer (DETR) object detection approach manages to overcome such limitations, being an end-to-end anchor-free set predictor based on the transformer architecture, using the attention mechanism for modelling long-range dependencies. Consequently, the general sensitivity of this technique for small size objects in the wheat head domain is reduced. Nonetheless, previous research reflects the potential of frequency analysis techniques to increase the accuracy of a CNN. This paper aims to study the feasibility of adding frequency information as a pre-processing step to improve the performance of the DETR model for wheat head detection. Two variants of the original DETR with a mask based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the power spectra of wheat heads and background patches are proposed and explored for improvements in prediction quality. Although promising, the best FFT-based DETR approach manages to deliver an average score of only 0.42, a slightly sub optimal performance compared to DETR’s one of 0.47. Additionally, as to grasp a sense of their capability among well-established detectors, YOLO-V3 and Faster R-CNN manage to achieve around 0.7 on the same wheat data set. Ultimately, a configurable automated overview of the development of wheat fields leads to a more efficient administration of the production process. To such end, this research explores the possible application of this new object detector in precision agriculture and provides insight into its limitations and potential ways of overcoming them.","Object detection; Fast Fourier Transform; Frequency filter; precision agriculture; wheat; DETR; Deep Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Conditional image synthesis refers to the generation of de novo images based on certain preconditions. Applying machine learning to conditionally generate novel comics proves an intriguing yet difficult task. This paper aims to answer whether Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used for conditional comic synthesis. Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks have increased the capability of image synthesis to hyper-realistic levels. Despite this, the performance of GAN models is almost always assessed on photo-realistic images. To extend experimental knowledge of unconditional GAN performance into the domain of comics, an empirical analysis was performed on the unconditioned generative performance of three cutting edge GAN architectures: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and Stability GAN (SGAN). This paper showed that the SGAN implementation far outperforms both the DCGAN and WGAN architectures on a dataset of Dilbert comics, achieving an FID score of 89.1. Due to their relative simplicity, comics provide an intriguing candidate for conditional generation. A comic panel can likely be described using a few specific labels (eg. background and characters). Two conditional networks were created, using the SGAN architecture as a baseline. Multi Class SGAN (MC-SGAN) used a traditional multi-class conditional approach while the Multi Label SGAN (ML-SGAN) utilized a multi-label auxiliary classification approach. Multiple experiments were performed between these two networks resulting in hundreds of hours of training. While performance between the networks was quite similar on simple conditional tasks, on more complex tasks MC-SGAN outperformed ML-SGAN. MC-SGAN was able to conditionally generate comics based on character and color, with desired conditions distinguishable in almost all outputs. Issues with traditional methods of auxiliary classifier training in the MC-SGAN implementation are additionally identified and discussed.","Generative Adversarial Network; Machine Learning; image synthesis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

One potential approach to increase the training data for these rare classes is to augment the limited real data with synthetic samples.

An Art Museum changes the local environment of its surrounding area. It can have a positive influence by developing neighbourhood assets but it also can lead to gentrification and displacement. To increase these neighbourhood assets this graduation research search for an active museum that integrates art in the daily lives of people and local neighbourhood by focusing on theme of participation and interaction. Creating an inclusive public space for a dynamic collaboration between the art, artists the audience and the environment. Where the design concept results in building a connection between Rotterdam south and the rest of Rotterdam. Reflecting the city structure and history. Merging art disciplines, building as performance (active building), openness, transparency, porosity, strong centre point for encounter and free choice of routing.","Art museum; participation; Participatory Art","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51°53'48.6"

It is important that they know exactly where their products are located. If a situation occurred where a vulnerable person needs immediate help, first responders can use the knowledge of the location to get to the patient as fast as possible. This thesis investigates if a modular localization solution can be designed for this product. The product will always be located in an indoor environment, which is a difficult place to establish the location. A modular solution is interpreted as a system that has parts that are replaceable. Some parts can be switched out for different parts with the same functionality, with the system still working properly. In order to design this system according to the requirements, the design process was divided in hardware and software. Both were designed in a modular way, yet eventually implemented in one specific way. This was done to get a tangible prototype that could be evaluated and tested. Improvements to the system were also designed, however could not be implemented in time. Nonetheless, the resulting system works well under conditions of intended use. There were some conditions in which the system performed less than required, however this should be fixed once the improvements are implemented. The results indicate that the localization system that is needed for the company's product is possible to be implemented. The next step is to research whether parts of the modular system can be replaced by an improvement. Then the system can be tested in more distinct working conditions, which could not be done during this project. If the system passes these tests, it is ready to be integrated with the other subsystems of the product, such that the company can bring their product to the market.","Localisation; GPS","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","Redacted Version","","2026-07-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor graduation project Electrical Engineering","51.99892944138642, 4.3733646137236795"

Even though quantum software development research has gained traction over the years, it is still mainly focused on problem analysis, language design, and implementation. Software testing, which is the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding faults, and verifying that the software product is fit for use is yet to receive substantial attention in quantum software development. This work answers the questions of to what extent are classical software testing techniques transferable to quantum programs, how effectively can they be used, what would an application independent theory for testing quantum software look like, and how practical is it with the current state of physical hardware. Using the principles of spectrum based fault localization, we show that we are able to properly detect and localize bugs in the state teleportation application and blind quantum computing application, even with the presence of noise in the hardware.","Quantum Computing; Software Testing; Quantum Software Testing; Quantum networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The accurate estimation of the pose, i.e. position and heading, of a vehicle while driving is of high importance in autonomous driving applications. Right now the main tool to estimate the location of a vehicle is its GPS sensor. However, GPS data is known to be of very low accuracy, especially in urban environments, and is thus not ideal for this application. In this report, the research into possible improvements to an existing vehicle pose estimation technique are presented, with the aim of making it applicable for automotive radar data. The existing technique is a scan-­matching technique known as the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), which was originally designed for LIDAR measurements. By adapting the technique to accommodate radar measurements some of the drawbacks of LiDAR, such as the high cost and poor performance in certain weather conditions, can be overcome. Some of the main disadvantages of using radar as compared to LiDAR, e.g. lower resolutions, are addressed in the presented techniques. The lower resolution results in significant spreading of the target response, this is especially prominent in the azimuth domain for a standard 3 Tx × 4 Rx MIMO automotive radar system. By addressing the scan­matching problem in the polar domain, this spreading of the target response is better captured in the distribution used to perform the scan­-matching. Further, the implementation in polar coordinates allows for incorporation of the Doppler measurements, which contain knowledge about the angles of arrival of targets<br/>and are generally measured at a much higher resolution than the angular measurements themselves. Moreover, the use of radar measurements introduces the availability of knowledge about the radar cross­-section of individual targets, this can be used to reduce the influence of false alarms. The incorporation of Doppler additionally allows the exploitation of the relation between the Doppler measurements and the angle of arrival to estimate a bias in the angle measurements, this can be used for sensor calibration while driving. The influence of the presented improvements to the NDT are examined through simulations and experiments. These results show significant reduction in the estimation errors. The sensor bias estimation technique also proves to provide extremely accurate estimates. Finally, a small extension is worked out to perform trajectory estimation using the individual poses by means of the Extended Kalman Filter.","Automotive radar; Localization; Scan matching; Pose estimation; NDT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-01","","","","","",""

It does so by eliminating the need to broadcast every transaction to the whole network. When one user wants to send a payment to another, the routing protocol generates a path between them that is always fast and cost efficient. The low degree of randomness in the existing routing protocols during path selection allows an adversary to compromise the anonymity of the sender and recipient.<br/>In this work, we propose a new routing algorithm that is less predictable when creating a transaction path. We show that this increases the anonymity of the users of the Lightning Network by creating an attack on the new routing protocol. The attacker tries to identify the potential source and recipient of a transaction. Our results suggest that there is a trade-off between the offered anonymity and transaction fees; it is not possible to get higher anonymity at no cost by designing a non-deterministic routing algorithm.","lightning network; anonymity; bitcoin; routing algorithm","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

(mentor); van Bortel, G.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Housing is a topic that concerns everyone, but the attention for housing has grown in the last years. There is an enormous urge for sufficient and affordable housing in a world where we cannot ignore globalisation. The market is looking for a way to answer this demand for affordable housing. Industrial housing is one of the answers. <br/><br/>Industrial housing can provide an affordable, fast, and quality solution against the tremendous pressure on the housing market. It is an industrialised process to create efficient, flexible, and affordable housing on a large scale and at the same time offer a sustainable circular solution. Multiple constructors developed a product, but despite these benefits and the products that are already available, most of the new houses are still constructed in a traditional way. The reason for this is a lack of knowledge about the industrial housing product, hesitation of the market and lack of cooperation between actors. This research analyses industrial housing and the opportunities and barriers to scale up the production of industrial housing. The goal of this research is to identify the improvements in the process that are needed to scale up the production. To identify the required improvements needed, an understanding of industrial housing, the production process, and the actors involved must be gained. Therefore, in this research, a literature study has been carried out that describes the development of housing in relation to industrial housing, defines the scope of this research, and gives insight into the process with the involved actors. The literature study is complemented with an empirical study, in which interviews have been conducted to get findings from practice. The empirical research focuses on the industrial product, process, and project. This project was explored as a case study on the use of a building flow. The identified barriers and opportunities of the theoretical and empirical study were compared to define recommendations in the synthesis. An expert panel of experts in industrial housing was held to validate and discuss the recommendations. The main recommended adaptions include innovations and digitalisation of the product, national guidance and regulations from the public parties using a long-term vision, the clients in industrial projects must start thinking in terms of the product, the function of a building flow and the transparent exchange of knowledge that is needed to create cultural and organisational change.","Industrial Housing; Housing shortage; housing market; Production process; Barriers and Opportunities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

They add rhythm to a poem, and poets use this literary device to portray emotion and meaning to their readers. Thus, detecting rhyming words will aid in adding emotions and enhancing readability when generating poems. Previous studies have been done on the topic of poem generation. However, those works did not put too much emphasis on the rhyme detector. Thus, this research will solely focus on rhyme detection and its evaluation. The aim of this research is to determine the most accurate way of detecting whether two English words rhyme. English rhyming words will be detected using combinations of features. Five features are used: edit distance, hamming distance, jaccard similarity, longest common substring, and vowel and consonant weights. We also experiment with two methods of retrieving phonemes: using the entire phoneme translation, and using part of the phoneme translation. We find that using only hamming distance and jaccard similarity with part of the phoneme translation, we can already obtain an accuracy of 90.05% with a log loss of 0.25 when trained on a balanced dataset. The reason for this remains unclear because there is no clear separation between the two classes.","machine learning; rhyming word detecting; deep learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""
