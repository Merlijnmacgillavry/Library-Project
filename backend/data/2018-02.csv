Operation and maintenance costs of offshore wind turbines are high, therefore alternative methods should be developed to reduce these costs. The replacement of heavy components, like a gearbox or a generator, is a frequently occurring operation that can be improved.<br/>Currently the replacement of these components is performed by a jack-up crane vessel which has two downsides: (1) long mobilization time and (2) high operational costs. The development of systems that can replace heavy components can contribute to reduce the maintenance costs of offshore wind turbines.<br/><br/>Therefore in the first part of this thesis, developments and techniques were investigated which can do so. It was observed that different types of solutions are already available for onshore maintenance purposes like the crane developed by Liftra and the Gamesa flexifit. Furthermore new concepts are being developed by the wind turbine manufacturer Vestas and Anson, a Chinese crane builder. These developments are addressing the problem of reducing the maintenance costs, but still two important downsides are present: (1) insufficient lifting capacity for gearbox replacement and (2) most systems are designed to be used on specific turbines. <br/><br/>The current developments and available techniques were studied to generate concepts that can address these shortcomings. This resulted in a promising solution where a relatively small crane is installed on the wind turbine tower from a floating vessel. A great advantage over currently used method is that no specialised maintenance vessel is required for a gearbox replacement and thereby costs and time can be saved. <br/><br/>This crane is attached to the tower structure by use of a clamping mechanism and is kept in position by generating frictional force. To generate this force, hydraulic cylinders are pressing the pads (contact surfaces of the clamp) against the tower structure. For the applicability of this concept it is of major importance that the structural integrity of the tower is maintained, while sufficient frictional force is generated to avoid the crane from slipping down during lifting operations. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis a feasibility study is done on the application of this clamping mechanism on wind turbine towers. By use of finite element modelling a workable contact surface configuration of this clamping mechanism was found. <br/><br/>The following four variables were studied: (1) elasticity of the contact layer, (2) number of pads used, (3) width and (4) height of the pads. The latter three relate to the contact surface area and the elasticity of the contact layer influences the distribution of the forces from the clamp to the tower structure. <br/><br/>Investigating these variables, it was concluded that; the proposed solution should have a contact layer where the elasticity modulus is higher than 1200 Mpa. By adding more pads, the loading capacity increases. However, it also results in a more complex structure and therefore it is advised to reduce the number of pads and instead widen them. Considering this trade off, a four pad configuration is selected to determine the required width and height of the pad. For this set-up it is advised to use a pad width of eighty degrees and pad height of three meter to meet the requirement of replacing the gearbox, the heaviest component of the wind turbine powertrain. <br/> <br/>Furthermore, to assure this clamping mechanism works on towers of different dimensions (i.e. diameter and wall thickness combinations), the loading capacity was determined for a variety of tower dimensions. By doing so, insights are gathered on the application of this clamping mechanism on different turbines. To make the data useful for further application, tables are included which indicate the loading capacity for investigated wind turbine towers. <br","Offshore, Wind, Maintenance; Ansys workbench","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Micro-/nanoimprint lithography is a high-throughput, high-resolution, and low-cost mass production fabrication process often used for creating microfluidic devices and optical components. In the imprint lithography process, a surface pattern of a stamp is replicated into a material by mechanical contact and three dimensional material displacements. These stamps are exposed to high pressures and temperatures and need to be able to withstand these circumstances in order to be durable. Diamond is potentially the ideal surface material for an imprint lithography stamp, since it has a high hardness, a high thermal conductivity coefficient, a low thermal expansion coefficient, it is chemically inert and highly wear resistant. <br/>Up until now, only molds made completely out of diamond have been used for imprint lithography. These molds were fabricated using single crystal or polished Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) diamond, which were then micro-structured by focused ion beam, reactive ion etching or e-beam lithography. Unfortunately, the availability of large area, single crystal diamond is very limited, and therefore extremely costly. On the other hand, diamond synthesis by chemical vapor deposition provides the possibility to deposit polycrystalline diamond films on areas up to tens of cm2. However, it is a rather slow process where typical growth rates are about 1 μm/hour, and thus production of full diamond stamps is time consuming and expensive.<br/>In this thesis, two new methods for the fabrication of CVD diamond imprint lithography molds have been developed. In the first method, a layer of 0.5 μm CVD diamond is deposited on micro-structured silicon. The second method makes use of porous silicon templates through which diamond can be grown, resulting in micro-structured diamond molds. Since polishing micro-structured diamond layers is not possible, the molds were coated with an anti-adhesion layer in order to facilitate release of the mold after imprinting. Both methods proved to be suited for imprinting into a cyclic olefin copolymer developed by TOPAS (grade 6013). With the first method, imprint dimensions of 1 μm with a depth of 350 nm were realized, and imprint dimensions of 2.5 μm with a depth of 2 μm were realized with the second fabrication method. These new approaches greatly reduce complexity of the fabrication process for durable stamps, and thereby the costs involved in creating imprint lithography stamps.<br","Diamond; Imprint Lithography; Mold; Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD); Template; cyclic olefin copolymer (COC); TOPAS; Nanocrystalline; FDTS; Micro-structured; Silicon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-08-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The municipality of Amsterdam is facing the challenge to deal with uncertainties accompanied with the maintenance planning of maintenance activities on bridges. Long term asset planning (LTAP) has the goal to show the proposed expenditures, capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX), for the long term to be able to build up a monetary buffer to absorb the CAPEX which is necessary when a period of large expenditures due to multiple major overhauls and replacements comes up. LTAP also gives the opportunity to program the more expensive activities which create the advantage of spreading expenses over a longer term. The Long Term Asset Planning of Amsterdam makes use of a deterministic time value for activities on bridges, while in fact this value does not give a reliable image of the actual situation. The majority of maintenance activities seems to be performed after the deterministic time value has been reached. Thus, the long term asset planning copes with uncertainties which results in an unreliable outcome and prospect in the expenditures for maintenance. Uncertainties can partly be solved by the use of deterioration models. The parameters involved that predict the physical behavior are mostly an assumption and not known with certainty. Data can be derived from historical maintenance data. A problem faced by all municipalities in the Netherlands is the absence of reliable registered quantitative data. Even the presence of past data would not guarantee its future reliability due to the dynamic characteristic of an urban environment. A method has to be found to retrieve the necessary data alternatively to improve the reliability concerning maintenance intervals for bridges in order to improve the reliability of long term asset planning for municipalities like Amsterdam. Expert judgement is a method that has proven to be a mature and scientific tool for achieving the necessary data that is unavailable at this moment and will be used for this research to develop probabilistic intervals for maintenance activities. By qualifying and quantifying the uncertainties regarding the maintenance on bridges, improvements may be realized on the short- and long term for the costs in maintenance planning. A questionnaire reveals that experts in the field have trouble assessing condition over time. A recommendation is given to solve this issue in the future.","Asset Management; Probabilistic design; Maintenance; Interval analysis; Infrastructure; Urban Environment; expert judgement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The fast termination of the last glacial period was strongly influenced by how fast the Earth’s crust rebounded. Formally, this process is known as Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, and is the viscoelastic response of the solid Earth to glacial surface loads. Models to simulate the dynamical evolution of an ice sheet assume homogeneous properties and material structure of the Earth’s mantle. In particular, a constant relaxation time of the bedrock is assumed. However, seismic observations and surface geology have shown that there exist large variations in the composition of the Earth’s mantle and therefore, large variations in relaxation time. This thesis presents a study of the impact of laterally varying relaxation times in North America on the evolution of the North American Ice Sheet in the last glacial cycle. <br/><br/>To do this, a dynamical ice sheet model that accounts for lateral variations of relaxation time has been used for the first time. It has been found that glacial isostatic adjustment always has a negative feedback effect in the evolution of the ice sheet. The evolution of the North American Ice Sheet has been simulated using realistic relaxation time maps. It has been observed that using relaxation time maps at a depth of 200 km, significant differences with respect to the model standard run, that uses a constant relaxation time of 3000 years, exist. The realistic model with the highest relaxation time showed an increase of 5% of the total area covered by ice in North America with respect to the nominal case. Furthermore, it has been seen that the presence of high viscosity areas in North America may tend to delay the start of the fast retreating process of the ice sheet after the Last Glacial Maximum<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Dexterous control of myoelectric upper limb prosthesis is still limited by the capabilities of the modern human-machine interfaces. The first goal of the current work was to develop a system that supplements the academic myoelectric state-of-the-art interface during the interaction with objects (e.g., grasping, manipulation) with the goal of increasing the overall performances and robustness of the prosthetic device. Additionally, the current study aims to define guidelines for a larger-scale experiment to be performed in the immediate future. Approach. I developed algorithms, which provide context- and user-awareness to the system by fusing multimodal sensory input data, and a control scheme that employs such context-awareness to estimate the user’s grasp intentions to automatically preshape the prosthesis for grasping in real time. The control scheme was compared against the major academic state-of-the-art myoelectric control scheme (i.e., pattern recognition) in two able-bodied subjects. The experimental tests consisted of grasping, reorienting, and relocating sets of common objects using a multi-degree-of-freedom prosthesis with two grip types and two degrees-of-freedom actuated wrist. Main Results. The proposed semi-autonomous system was able to function in realistic and time-varying cluttered environments. The obtained results illustrate better and more consistent performances (i.e., lower task completion time and standard deviation) of the developed control scheme with respect to the state-of-the-art counterpart. Improvements in control robustness during object manipulation (i.e., lower number of object drops) have also been obtained. The current study helped in defining guidelines for the future larger-scale experiment: more than one experimental session, data logging and subjective measurements recording. Significance. The proposed system improves multiple aspects involved in the control of myoelectric multi-degree-of-freedom upper limb prostheses. The guidelines defined in this work, are essential for evaluating, during the future larger-scale study, the impact of the proposed system on users’ experience (e.g., workload and ease of use). <br","sensor-fusion context-aware upper limb prosthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

K-nearest neighbours regression and multi-layer perceptron neural network are the supervised learning models used in this thesis.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Polarimetry is a powerful remote sensing technique that can be used to characterize plane- tary atmospheres and potentially, to detect and characterize exoplanets. The degree of linear polarization as a function of wavelength and phase angle varies with the presence and compo- sition of cloud, haze and gas particles. In particular, when in-situ measurements are difficult to obtain, this technique can be used to obtain an approximate atmospheric profile. This is the case of Jupiter. The aim of this thesis is to compute a detailed profile of the atmosphere in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Polarimetry observations for this planet at different wavelengths and a phase angle of 10.7° are used for the fitting process. The objective of the project is to obtain the cloud and haze particles present in the atmosphere, together with the altitude at which they are. For this purpose, a FORTRAN code is used to simulate the polarization val- ues by means of a doubling-adding radiative transfer algorithm. Mie scattering theory is used to obtain the particle properties present in the atmosphere. In order to find the best match of the simulations to the observations, a Matlab fitting algorithm is developed. Once, the fit- ting is done, the main conclusions obtained are that in the Great Red Spot, higher and thinner clouds are present than in the surroundings. The atmospheric profile that best fitted the ob- servations includes a base Water crystal cloud layer, followed by a higher Amonia cloud and finally, a top haze layer. It must be noted that at higher wavelengths, the presence of the GRS is clearer but also it was challenging to find a fitting of the highest polarization values. This fitting method can be also extrapolated to Jupiter-like exoplanets, therefore being able to, ei- ther simulate what a planet would look like if it existed by changing the geometry conditions, or characterize a already known exoplanet if polarization measurements are available. An ad- ditional analysis was done simulating how the Great Red Spot would look like if observed at different phase angles as if the measurements were taken with a satellite in-situ including a polarimeter on-board. The conclusion was that as the phase angle increased, so did the degree of polarization. In the case of the Great Red Spot, the regions of higher and lower polarization could still be identified. However, as the phase angle increased and so did the shadow region of the planet, the fitting became more difficult.","polarimetry radar; Great Red Spot; Jupiter; Observations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Baan, Jan (mentor); van den Berg, Tobie (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the last ten years, the airlines are demanding lower aircraft prices and fuel consumption. Aircraft manufacturers as well as component and sub-assembly manufacturers are adapting to this situation by optimizing existing aircraft configurations. Traditional design processes, due to their inability to capture multidisciplinarity at the early stages of design and to the amount of manual work, do not allow component optimization in the typical time frames of the aircraft industry. Fokker Aerostructures is developing an automated rudder design program, the Rudder Generator, to tackle the limitations of the traditional design method. To effectively capture the multidisciplinarity of aircraft component design, the knowledge of each expertise involved in the design process must be included in the program at the same level of detail. The manufacturing analysis capabilities of the Rudder Generator are significantly lower than the ones of other expertise such as stress, weight or cost.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses on developing a valid methodology to include manufacturing analyses in the rudder conceptual design stage. The developed methodology is created to expand the Rudder Generator capabilities as well as to support the traditional design process. A Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) application, WelToGen, which generates thermoplastic welding tooling for a given rudder geometry is created. The program runs feasibility checks on the tooling models based on the process requirements and then ensures through design changes the fulfillment of those requirements. The application also measures the manufacturing performance by estimating the tooling cost.<br/><br/>The tool is both integrated in the RG and used as a standalone tool to perform design studies. With WelToGen’s automation it is possible generate a tooling conceptual design, analyze its feasibility and estimate its cost in minutes. The traditional method requires detailed tooling design for the analysis, taking up to weeks to perform the same tasks. Rudder geometries for which tooling has been manufactured at Fokker have been given to WelToGen, which has found new tooling designs that, while also being feasible, are between 3 and 5% cheaper than Fokker’s original tooling designs. Also, parametrical studies on the effect on manufacturing feasibility and performance are executed. WelToGen’s results show influences of rudder and tooling design parameters that were unknown to Fokker engineers before. Additionally, it is found to be feasible to create tooling for rudder configurations which manufacturing had not been considered at Fokker before due to the resources limitations of the traditional design methods. Based on the results, rudder and tooling design recommendations are made.<br/><br/>The implementation of the methodology proves to be effective in improving the conceptual design phase. The developed methodology, compared to the traditional method, has obtained improved rudder and tooling designs, taken a shorter lead-time and led to less risk and missed opportunities. The RG team will integrate the tool and plans on creating new modules adapting the same methodology to other rudder manufacturing and assembly processes, expanding the program’s manufacturing analysis capabilities. Fokker’s tooling engineer will use WelToGen to support the conceptual design stage of tooling design projects currently ongoing at Fokker.<br/><br/>This research is performed as part of the European research project IDEaliSM, in which Delft University of Technology and Fokker Aerostructures are collaborating in the development of a design and optimization framework to support the design of a primary aircraft components.","Knowledge Based Engineering; Manufacturing; Front Loading; Rudder Design; Fokker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","IDEalisM",""

Hybrid formulations have very attractive properties but are plagued with non-physical singular modes known as Spurious Kinematic Modes (SKMs). This report is devoted to the development of a hybrid scheme in linear elasticity that is free of SKMs. In the scheme, both the stress fields and kinematic fields are treated as primary variables and can hence be obtained together while also satisfying the equilibrium conditions throughout the physical domain. Subsequently, it is shown that optimal convergence is obtained for the stress and displacement fields. A versatile scheme is setup such that it can be solved efficiently by parallelisation of the system.

These features are often associated with eroding (nourished) coastlines and can reach heights of O(2-3 m), leading to serious hazards to beach users and negatively impacting local ecosystems. New insights into beach scarp morphodynamics related to geometrical, geotechnical and hydrodynamic parameters are presented in this thesis. Aimed at increasing our general understanding of these features, these insights are provided by means of analysing beach scarp presence at (large scale) nourishments and conducting field experiments. An analysis of beach scarp presence at the Sand Engine between 2011 and 2017 has shown that the formation is linked to mildly erosive (summer storm) conditions, whereas destruction is related to both extremely erosive (winter storm) conditions (overwash or inundation, ~50%) and non-hydrodynamic controls (drying collapse or burying by aeolian transport, ~50%). Newly obtained measurements of beach scarps at this nourishment indicate that the toe elevation is `fixed' around the maximum runup elevation, providing a direct relation between the final scarp height, nourishment platform height and hydrodynamic conditions. The associated beach scarp slope can be derived from a Culmann-type stability analysis, in which the matric suction provides the apparent cohesion necessary for the stability of scarps. Field experiments were carried out, which consisted of monitoring the formation, migration, and destruction of scarps from artificially constructed linear slopes. Video observations show that the formation of beach scarps takes place between the 15% and 2% exceedance runup elevation (R15% and R2%) and can be influenced by geometrical controls. High platform nourishments will lead to the formation of beach scarps, as overwash is required for a diffuse beach profile. The field experiments have furthermore shown that steep initial slopes are more susceptible to beach scarp formation. Beach scarp migration will take place when the maximum swash elevation exceeds the scarp toe, initiating the undercutting and slumping mechanism. Topographical measurements have shown that the migration rate is inversely related to the beach scarp height. The beach scarps reported in these experiments were found to be in accordance with the new definition proposed in this study; a non-vegetated, subaerial beach feature with a slope larger than the critical angle of repose of 32 degrees and a minimum height of 0.30 m. <br/><br/>Based on these findings, a conceptual model relating beach scarp morphodynamics to geometrical, geotechnical and hydrodynamic parameters is presented. In general, the formation of beach scarps is preceded by a continuous steepening of the beach slope (between R15% and R2%) until a small vertical discontinuity of O(10 cm) is present. Upon landward migration of this small scale feature, the scarp height changes depending on the backshore topography. The natural destruction of beach scarps can be initiated by four mechanisms; hydrodynamically controlled overwash (1), drying collapse (2), burying by aeolian transport (3) and swash deposition (4). The findings presented in this study provide a better understanding of beach scarp morphodynamics and their relation to various geometrical, geotechnical and hydrodynamic parameters. Furthermore, it was found that the design of beach nourishments can be adjusted to limit the formation of beach scarps and to increase the natural destruction of these features.","beach scarp; morphodynamics; formation; conceptual model; nourishment; runup","en","master thesis","","","","","","NUS-TUD Double MSc Degree Programme","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The approach is based on wireless range measurements between robots, along with the communication of their velocities, accelerations, yaw rates, and height. It can be implemented on many robotic platforms without the need for dedicated sensors. With respect to previous work, we remove the dependency on a common heading reference between robots. The main advantage of this is that it makes the relative localization approach independent of magnetometer readings, which are notoriously unreliable in an indoor environment. A theoretical observability analysis shows that it may also have two disadvantages: the motion of the robots must meet more stringent conditions and the relative localization method becomes more susceptible to noise on the range measurements. However, simulation results have shown that in the presence of significant magnetic disturbances that are common to indoor environments, removing the heading dependency is beneficial. We conclude the paper by implementing the heading-independent method on real Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and performing leader-follower flight in an indoor environment. Despite the observability analysis showing leader-follower flight to be an especially difficult task, we still manage to successfully fly for over 3 minutes with two fully autonomous followers using only on-board sensing.","Relative Localization; Leader-Follower; Swarming; Ultra Wideband","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); van der Zwaag, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Flexible electronics have become the subject of industry focus, generating a market desire for fully flexible temperature sensors. To the best of our knowledge, there are no current systems that can adequately satisfy both the mechanical flexibility and sensing performance demanded for commercial applications. This work focused on a design for a flexible temperature sensor by designing a thermistor using functional granular composites using ceramic NTC fibre particles and a resistive polymer matrix. The objective was to achieve good thermistor performance (high sensitivity: B-value &gt; 3000 K, and low resistivity: rho ˜ 10^1 - 10^2 Ocm) while being mechanically flexible (surviving bending radii = 1 cm over 100 cycles). To achieve this objective this thesis work was organised into 5 major phases. Due to the high commercial value of NTC ceramic thermistors, no reference composition with its exact processing conditions are available in literature that produce a thermistor with commercially desirable properties. Phase 1 was therefore to select a NTC ceramic composition and Phase 2 was to investigate the necessary processing conditions to be able to produce bulk ceramics with adequate temperature sensing performance. Phase 3 involved making NTC ceramic fibres by wet fibre spinning and modifying the processing conditions developed in Phase 2. Phase 4 involved the selection of an appropriate polymer matrix and to attempt to create thermistor composites. Phase 5 involved creating more optimal composite thermistors using stencil printing and to test its thermistor and bending performance. Using an isotropic mixture of Mn2.4 Ni0.5 Cu0.1 O4 NTC ceramic fibre particles in an Electrodag matrix, composite thermistors were created by stencil printing onto thin-film substrates of polyethylene terephthalate that have silver inkjet printed interdigitate electrodes. A percolated network is formed with as little as 10 wt% of fibres (˜ 2.86 vol%). The composite with 10 wt% of fibres has good thermistor performance at a low fibre content. The average resistivity at 25°C (rho_25) is low around 920 · 10^3 Ocm (with a standard deviation of 220 · 10^3 Ocm) and the sensitivity is high with a B-value = 3290 K and alpha = -3.7 %/K. The overall composite resistance and sensitivity can be tailored and customised by changing the gap width of the interdigitate electrodes. At an electrode gap width of 0.13 mm, with our interdigitate electrodes, R_25 = 280 kO and R_85 = 45 kO. The composite with 10 wt% fibre particle content and an electrode gap of 0.13 mm can survive 300 bends cycles (100 cycles with bending radius 10 mm (strain ˜ 0.621%), 100 cycles with bending radius 5 mm (strain ˜ 1.23%), 100 cycles with bending radius 2.5 mm (strain ˜ 2.44%) without any observable, aesthetic damage. The relative resistance (R/R0) does increase with bending, but after 20 bend cycles it appears to stabilise for every bending radius. In comparison to other flexible temperature sensors in recent literature, this thermistor composite is found to deliver a superior combination of thermistor performance and mechanical flexibility.","Flexible thermistors; Temperature sensing; ceramic-polymer composites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A top-down push is witnessed to make smart use of open data for the development of social solutions and services. However, this creates a gap for those citizens that are willing to work on social innovations, but lack technical skills and people that do have these required skills. Numbers and facts have taken a leading role in the decision-making process, which makes data concrete building blocks for argumentation to make knowledge claims about the world (D’Ignazio, 2017). To also include those active citizens in the decision-making process, this graduation project explores how data can support active citizens in their participatory activities and how they can make a valuable connection to their local knowledge by means of design. In Delfshaven Rotterdam, active citizens have taken over the control of public parks and have realized many green initiatives to improve the livability of the neighborhoods. Organizing and managing these parks themselves does not come without facing issues. The context of these green initiatives is taken as a case study for the project to research what problems and obstacles occur in self-managing and organizing these parks and to understand how data can be off support. The conducted research with the green initiatives revealed that they can find common ground with the municipality to show that they are working on mutual goals to improve the liveability of the neighborhoods. Furthermore, combining their deep-rooted insights (small data) gained, by being actively involved in the neighborhoods, with factual data can create a more complete picture of the problems that occur in the neighborhoods. Literature review substantiated that in order to form a complete picture of these real-world problems, both numbers and stories should be combined (Wang, 2016). Standing stronger in political debate happens when stories can be combined with numbers which compels others. In order for factual data to support their initiatives, the challenges the initiators face should be clearly defined. To support citizens to work with data, hackathons can be used as a means to facilitate this process. A more human-centered approach has been identified for such an event by focussing on collective issue articulation as a design practice (DiSalvo &amp; Lotado, 2011) to support defining and analyzing a problem through the sharing of local stories. Stimulating multiple stakeholders to bring their perspectives on a problem into a discussion helps to gain an understanding of the underlying, factors, relations, consequences and actors. This ‘data-analysis process’ can be seen as story-finding, which has a more appropriate approach for non-technical citizens to work with data (Bhargava et al., 2017). To explore the potential of story-finding as data analysis process, several workshop have been conducted that all included data explorations. For these workshops, tools were prototyped as means to facilitate the process. The insights gained showed that in order to find relevant data to explore, first problems that are faced should be clearly defined and communicated. This lead to the the design vision: “A co-creation/ participatory process that helps expert initiators to translate neighborhood problems in a structured way into local cases by combining their local perspectives with factual data to tell a compelling story.” This projected resulted in a process toolkit ‘Blik op Buurt’ which proposes a clear structure to collaboratively surface and define problems in the neighborhood and helps to select potential partners and communicate these insights to them. By going through a story-finding process, initiators are stimulated to make use of their contextual data (small data) about the neighborhood problem in order to reveal missing information and knowledge. This process is facilitated by a set of tools. A collective setting not only stimulates shared ownership to commit to tackle these problems, but also support the self-organization in how they can break down the problems so that their stories can be comprehended and be supported with data from different perspectives. To evaluate the finale outcome and validate the effect, the Blik op Buurt process and tools should be tested by a citizen initiative through conducting a problem case study.","OpenDataLab Rotterdam; Open4Citizens; Open data; Citizen initiatives; Toolkit; Participation; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Open4Citizens",""

In the past 25 years a trend of scale enlargement of hopper dredgers driven by economic and productivity reasons is seen. Scaling of the designs has effect on strength and fatigue assessment as well on settling of particles which affect the rate op production. This thesis is focussed on the fatigue assessment of the hopper dredger. Cracked damages in coaming and bottom door areas have been found in relatively large hopper dredgers that are classed by Bureau Veritas. According to Bureau Veritas rules for steel ships fatigue assessment is required if the ship has length greater than 170 m but damages have also been observed in hopper dredgers with a smaller length. This indicates that the hopper dredger design demands for a specific fatigue assessment procedure. The hopper dredger has a unique characteristic load profile consisting of loading and unloading cargo several times a day in combination with small wave heights due to reduced freeboard regulations. Special interest is given on the effect of the loading and unloading cycle in the corners of the bottom discharge openings. It is suspected that the effect of this characteristic cycle may be underestimated and requires an alternative assessment procedure. The main question is what the contribution of this cycle is and how it should be assessed. The relatively low frequency of the cycle raises the suspicion of low-cycle fatigue and this phenomenon is therefore investigated. It is concluded that the loading and unloading cycle has a major contribution to the fatigue damage in the bottom opening corners. In fact 97% of the fatigue damage is induced by the dredging cycle and therefore this cycle could be seen as the sole cause for fatigue cracks in the bottom opening corner structural details. The high stress ranges confirm the suspicion of a low-cycle fatigue phenomenon and therefore further research is done on how to approach this type of fatigue. A method is proposed to take into account bi-axial cyclic plasticity and material hardening based on the use of a maximum principal hot spot stress range. Linear-elastic stresses are corrected to pseudo elastic stresses and effects of SN-curve selection, material selection, bi-axiallity and residual stress are analysed. Based on the found pseudo hot spot stress ranges it is concluded that the linear-elastic stresses in the analysed hopper are not high enough to demand for such a low-cycle fatigue assessment approach. The bi-axial ratio between the two multi-axial plane stress components has no effect on this conclusion.","Fatigue; Hopper dredger; TSHD; Assessment; Dredging cycle; Procedure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-23","","","","","",""

The continuity or cohesion of the rock body is lost across a fracture. Fractures are formed in response to stress on a rock. A rock breaks and forms a fracture when the applied stress reaches the rock strength. Vertical fractures improve connectivity between multiple layers, and can aid the production of geothermal and petroleum reservoirs.<br/>The heterogeneity of layered reservoirs leads to significant variation in mechanical properties, which in turn influence fracture nucleation, fracture growth and fracture geometry. This variation in rock mechanical properties, combined with layer thickness, is called mechanical stratigraphy. Natural fractures are subject to controls imposed by mechanical stratigraphy. Focusing on the mechanisms that control natural fracture development can improve fracture characterization. As rock strength is an important part of mechanical stratigraphy, the term mechanical contrast is introduced to examine the effect of contrasts in rock strength of adjacent layers.<br/><br/>This study examines the effect of the mechanical contrast and confining pressure on fracture behaviour in layered rocks in the laboratory. The focus of this study is threefold, it examines the effect of mechanical contrast and confining pressure on fracture propagation, fracture orientation and fracture aperture in layered rocks.<br/>Unconfined and confined compressive strength tests have been performed on layered samples with varying mechanical contrasts at different confining pressures. A total of 169 tests have been performed which include confined and unconfined compressive strength tests on layered and monophase samples and brazilian tensile strength tests and velocity measurements on monophase samples.<br/><br/>The results show that fractures initiate in the weakest layer and propagate through the layer interface or are contained within the weakest layer. Unconfined compressive strength tests showed that differences in rock strength do not always act as a containment barrier.<br/>The combination of mechanical contrast and confining pressure does control the containment of fractures within a layer. Lower horizontal compressive stresses are required to contain fractures when the mechanical contrast increases.<br/>Mechanical contrast does not seem to influence fracture aperture. Confining pressure however greatly influences fracture aperture as it limits the ability of fractures to dilate.<br/>Results show that fracture orientation is controlled by mechanical contrast. Fractures refract at layer interfaces when the mechanical contrast is sufficiently high. Confining pressure does not seem to affect the refraction of fractures.<br/><br/>The experimental results can improve the understanding of fracture containment, fracture aperture and fracture orientation in layered rocks at subsurface conditions. The mechanical contrast of the layered rocks, combined with the stress conditions need to be considered when characterizing subsurface fractures.<br/>Vertical connectivity between layers is of importance when predicting fluid flow through reservoirs. As frac tures often serve as preferential fluid flow paths, correctly interpreting fracture characteristics is important for successful development of layered reservoirs.","Fractures; Mechanical Stratigraphy; Confining Pressure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Inertial forces are of little use to them in their propulsion mechanisms. As a consequence of this, an organism such as the scallop which moves through time-reversible deformations of its body would not propel itself in a regime dominated by visocus forces. Hence, microscopic organisms use appendages like cilia and flagella that are not time reversible to move forward. However, inertial effects become important to microscopic organisms at the relevant time and length scales. For example, inertia is used by a microscopic organism such as Paramecium to escape/attack its predator/prey.<br/>The effects of inertia on the model of a spherically ciliated micro-organism are studied numerically using an Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) in the present work. In this model ,the distortions of the envelope that is generated by connecting all the tips of the cilia together, are prescribed. The unsteady Reynolds number which characterizes the influence of unsteady inertia that is generated by the beat of the organism, is varied from 0.025 to 18. The code which uses a Volume Penalization/Volume of Solid IBM to simulate the distorting sphere is validated for several test cases. The mean swimming velocity of the organism that is obtained numerically from the code is in agreement with the analytical model for two cases of the unsteady Reynolds number.

Seaway Heavy Lifting is an offshore company which offers Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation (EPCI) solutions worldwide for oil, gas and renewables projects. <br/><br/>Offshore wind turbines are most commonly placed on a monopile foundation. The installation of monopile foundations used for offshore wind turbine farms is the main part of the projects Seaway Heavy Lifting is executing. The installation of monopiles is done using an installation vessel, which needs to be anchored during installation. The anchoring is done in order to cooperate with external forces on the side shell due to the installation of the monopile. The installation of the monopile is done using a frame which is connected to the side shell of the vessel. In order to stay competitive in the business, the company has been doing research to how to decrease the amount of installation time of their projects. It is concluded that profit can be gained by reducing the necessary time to anchor the installation vessel. <br/><br/>To install monopiles without anchoring the vessel, the monopile installation frame (MIF) was designed. The MIF can be placed onto the seabed after which the monopile can be hoisted inside of the frame. The frame will support the monopile during hammering. No external forces will be acting on the side shell of the vessel when using the MIF during hammering, which rules out the need for anchoring the vessel. Instead of anchoring, dynamic positioning will be used. Since the installation of monopiles will occur in different water depths, the MIF needs to be modular. An extension piece will be used in order to change the height of the frame. <br/><br/>The goal of this thesis is to obtain a structural optimized design of the MIF. The connections needed to connect and disconnect the extension piece are critical sections of the MIF. During the lifetime of the MIF, fatigue due to waves, wind and current loading will play a role. Therefore, this thesis has focused on the structural optimization of the connection with respect to fatigue loading. A bolted flange connection will be used in order to connect the members, which will be machined and then welded to the tube end. An initial geometry of the connection was designed with help of design rules stated by ir. M. Seidel. <br/><br/>The finite element program ANSYS will be used for the calculation of stress distributions. The decision was made to verify ANSYS, which was done by studying the accuracy of ANSYS, its way of working and to get used to the program. The verification has been done using a reference project. <br/><br/>The fatigue analysis of the connection started first of all with a global load analysis. This was done with help of the program SACS, which uses wave heights and wind speeds together with currents data as input. A calculation model of the MIF was built in SACS. Once the input was completed, the internal forces of the MIF were calculated. The global load analysis is necessary in order to obtain the loads in the members that will be connected by the bolted flange connection. These loads were used as input for ANSYS. <br/><br/>To check whether the initial design could be used as a starting point, the 3 failure modes of a bolted flange connection have been explained and verified for the initial design. Once it was verified, it was used as input in ANSYS in order to study the stress distribution of the model. The initial geometry has a negligible radius between the tube and the flange of the connection. Therefore, it was expected that a high concentration of stresses would occur in the junction between the tube and the flange of the connection. In order to find the stress concentration factor (SCF) in this junction, the maximum stress occurring in the junction needs to be divided by the stress applied to the tube. <br/><br/>Once the SCF was known the fatigue analysis could be performed. The fatigue analysis was done for two details: the junction between the tube and the flange and the welded connection between the tube and the machined part. Firstly, the amount of actual cycles was calculated for a certain time period with help of the wave scatter diagram, after which the corresponding stress ranges during these cycles was obtained. The stress ranges were multiplied with the SCF for the tube-to-flange junction, the SCF was obtained using ANSYS. Once the stress ranges were known, the amount of cycles until failure was calculated using S-N-curves that fit the two studied details. The actual damage to the structure was determined by dividing the actual number of cycles happening by the amount of cycles until failure. With the damage known for a certain time period, the life time of the structure was calculated. <br/><br/>The MIF will be used for a period of more or less 8 years, so the design lifetime was set at 9 years. <br/>The initial geometry had an extremely low lifetime. Therefore, the connection needed to be optimized in order to improve the lifetime. The optimization of the connection was done by increasing the radius of the tube-to-flange junction to lower the SCF. A lower SCF value resulted in a longer lifetime. The design has been optimized until an optimum radius of 36 mm was found. The final design has a lifetime of 9 years. <br","Structural Optimization; Fatigue Analysis; Steel Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-23","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

For such devices, major losses occur at both the front and rear contacts where parasitic recombination can be very high. Carrier-selective contacts use a special design in order to build a barrier that would block one specific charge carrier and let the other one go through. A Hybrid solar cell is a combination between a heterojunction solar cell and a TOPCon device, featuring then carrier-selective contacts at both sides. In this thesis, a p-type TOPCon structure is implemented at the rear when the front contact is made of n-type amorphous silicon (a-Si:H).<br/>Intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) used as front passivation layer, is deposited on top of crystalline silicon and requires an interface with as few defects as possible to minimize the parasitic recombination velocity. A new pretreatment method studied in this thesis involves the growth of a silicon oxide (SiO2) on a crystalline silicon substrate, that will allow to get rid of most of the superficial defects after etching and before a-Si:H deposition. Lifetimes of up to 6 ms and saturation current density (J0) as low as 14 fA/cm2 can be reached with a 200 nm thick oxide.<br/>As a-Si:H presents a very low lateral conductivity, a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) is needed to transport the charge carriers towards the front metal contacts. The resistivity of such a material should be as low as possible. While increasing the deposition temperature of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), it has been possible to decrease the resistivity up to 2.5 ·10-4 Ω.cm at a temperature of 130°C, without reducing the optical properties of such a layer.<br/>Finally, manufacturing defects are often introduced during the fabrication process, leading to some shunt losses (low shunt resistance). As we are fabricating several solar cells per wafer, it is most of the time necessary to cut them to get rid of the shunt before doing the measurements. This sensitive step could be avoided with a better isolation of each solar cell. Patterned ITO and metal have been developed in this thesis, allowing to reduce the shunt power losses in the range of 1-2% without the need to cut the cells.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The project was therefore started with mapping the wishes of possibile users and mapping the current context. Already in the beginning it turned out that fluid balance measurements are well based estimations as not all aspects are being monitored and recorded. Aspects like sweating, vomitting, heavy diarrhoea were not taken into account. Frustrations about the paper fluid lists getting lost, not knowing when to replace intravenous (IV) bags and communication between different care takers became clear. The different departments more or less created a way to work aournd the issues. For example, replacing of IV bags at the geriatrics department was sometimes done far before the bag was really empty to avoid forgetting to replace it. This means that the old IV bag will be thrown away before it is fully used. <br/><br/>Another important aspect was the division in responsibility around registering the fluid balance. It turned out that there is a big difference between involving the patient and giving the patient responsibility. Involvement is preferred by both patient and nurse, but responsibility needs to be avoided at all times. Most patients from whom an (hourly) fluid balance overview is required are quited ill and therefore incapable (mentally or physically) to take over tasks that contribute to their recovery. Patients need to have insight in how to contribute to a quicker recovery in a positive way (involvement), but the nurse is responsible in the end. <br/><br/>The product-service-system was divided in different system parts. These different system parts were eventually combined to several concepts that were discussed with multiple nurses at the following wards of the UMCG: geriatrics, nephrology, cardiology and intensive care. Furthermore three nurses from the Haga hospital and the RDGG provided feedback throughout the process. <br/><br/>Most wards preferred to have a product-service-system that is being controlled by the nurse (and assistant) and can be used by the patient when the nurse approves. The final product-service system consists of one tablet (including tablet holder), one adapter, multiple hooks and multiple FluidBalance hangers. <br/><br/>Interaction wise it was prefered to assemble as much functionality into one place at an ergonomic height, meaning that the FluidBalance hanger only requires interaction when (un)installing. Further interaction will happen on the FluidBalance tablet and computer on wheels (COW). <br/><br/>The FluidBalance hangers will gather information about their attached bags. This information will be send to the tablet using Wi-Fi. The tablet will be a central entrance point for all other gained and lost fluids and will calculated the patient’s fluid balance. This information will be send to the COW which means that it will be added to the patients electronic hospital file (EPD). (figure 1)<br/><br/>After defining the overall product-service-system the focus shifted to the conceptualisation and embodiment of the FluidBalance hanger. Both internal and external embodiment were investigated and tested. Several prototypes were used to investigate: accuracy, how to control influences due to movement of the patient, how to attach the product somewhere around the patient’s bed and how to compile the right components to make sure that the product will last for a few months. Findings based on interviews with nurses and trials with different Arduino codes have led to the first working model of the FluidBalance hanger (figure 1).<br","Efficiency; measurements; hospital; workload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

This thesis is aimed to study various inviscid ow models that are capable of modeling such multiple ow separation phenomena. Inviscid models are capable of modeling single ow separation region over typical airfoils. In these models, the ow separation is modeled by releasing vorticity in to the ow from the separation location which are known prior and given as a direct input to the model. The separation locations can be taken either from experimental data or RANS simulation results of the airfoil. From the various singularity elements available for modeling, in this thesis point vortex elements and linear distribution of vorticity elements are utilized for modeling the ow and a step by step procedure of development of the solver starting from steady state to unsteady single wake and then to double wake model is followed. Each solver developed is validated against available analytical results. However, in the time line of the current study, the double wake model developed could not be validated with the chosen test case. The modeling challenges faced in the development phase of double wake model can be mainly attributed to the unclear modeling details in implementing the strength of the separation vortex that is shed from separation location. The other challenged include accumulation and crossing of shed wake elements through the airfoil surface, similar to the challenges reported by Rachel [25]. These challenges are clearly discussed and recommendations have been made for overcoming wake shedding problem. The author believes that such an inviscid model overcoming the modeling challenges experienced in double wake model, can be easily extended to model multiple separation regions over 2D LEI tube kites.","kites; Inviscid flow; 2D LEI kite profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The main objective of a Master Plan is to develop an integral long-term development plan to guide the future of an airport. One important element is the capacity analysis as a first step in strategic airport planning. The research commissioned by NACO is boiled down to the main research objective: to contribute to the development of Strategic Stand Planning for airports, by finding an optimal required Stand Capacity using mathematical optimisation techniques. To give answer to this question a model developed which is called the Strategic Stand Capacity Model. This determines the amount of stands, and the standtype in terms of size and sector. As a case study Schiphol Airport is selected. The mathematical optimisation model at heart of the model can be described as a set of two classic linear optimisation problem, integrated in a larger software architecture. For both models the primal simplex algorithm is used to search for the optimal solution. As an optimiser IBM CPLEX is used. The input of the model is a flight schedule. The output is the amount of stands of each standtype is required, along a Pareto optimal front between operational cost and capital cost. A set of optimal stand capacity solutions for Schiphol is determined and used to analyse current capacity, which is proven to be sub-optimal in terms of standmix where a reduction in operational cost of 18% is possible. The impact of expansions at A-pier and H-pier in 2019 are analysed which show improvements but sub-optimal results in terms of the mix of standtypes, where a reduction of 24% in operational cost is possible. Then, the model is used to divide demand in airline segments to analyse impact of clustering airlines and alliances. When a hard split is made in airlines 14% more stand capacity is needed to find a solution. The model is then used to optimise airline division, which showed that when shifting a part of alliance-free airlines between two larger segments an optimal stand capacity can be found. Historic flight schedule data is used as input and historic stand allocation data is used to validate the results of the model. The result of the model is not a single solution of stand capacity but a range of optimal solutions of different capital investment and operational cost. A web-based supporting tool is developed as part of this research project to make practical application possible. This creates the opportunity for airport planners to make a data-driven trade-off between optimising many performance indicators, such as stand utilisation, bus movements, towing and remote parking. The results of this study will allow airport planners at NACO to develop a flexible master plan with respect to changing demand, and will support decision making to achieve the required stand capacity.","Aircraft Stand; Capacity Optimization; Stand Allocation Problem; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Fouling (algae, slime, and barnacles) on the hull of large cargo vessels is undesirable because it increases their frictional drag, resulting in an increased fuel consumption. As a solution, Fleet Cleaner introduced a ship hull cleaning robot that maneuvers on the hull, using powered wheels and magnets. The robot is controlled by a human operator whose main responsibility is to ensure safe navigation over the hull, by avoiding sharply curved surfaces and irregularities on the hull. The operators are subjected to high levels of mental fatigue because constant vigilance is required. Fleet Cleaner aims to alleviate the operators from demanding missions, by shifting towards a semi-autonomous mode of operation. This thesis contributes to this transition, by developing an obstacle detection framework that is tailored to the primary imaging device of the robot: a forward looking sonar (FLS). This device provides an acoustic image that is characterized by a low signal to noise ratio, a nonuniform illumination, and its sensitivity to viewpoint changes. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no research has been reported about FLS-based obstacle detection for the working environment of ship hull cleaning robots. Therefore, this thesis contributes to both the Fleet Cleaner robot and the research field of acoustic imaging. The thesis scope is delimited by defining two objectives.<br/>Firstly, an algorithm is proposed that detects the line parameters of the bilge, i.e., the rounded transition between the side and the bottom of a ship. Secondly, an algorithm is proposed that detects the boundaries of all obstacles that feature one distinct attribute: a grating pattern. <br/><br/>The design process is guided by four working steps: task clarification, conceptual design, implementation, and a proof of concept (PoC). The task clarification phase defines metrics that measure the detection accuracy of both algorithms, with respect to hand-drawn ground truths. The conceptual design phase establishes candidate solutions for both objectives. For bilge detection, two edge detectors and three line detectors are selected. For grating detection, a supervised approach is preferred, resulting in six texture features, one segmentation algorithm, and two classifiers. The last two working steps employ the conceptual solutions on recorded FLS images, such that the detection accuracy can be computed. The detection accuracy is used to tune the parameters of all algorithms in the implementation phase and to<br/>select the final solution in the PoC.<br/><br/>The PoC of the bilge detector demonstrates that a sufficiently high accuracy was attained by the Radon transformation (line detector), in combination with a first-order steerable filter (edge detector). The PoC of the grating detector shows that highest accuracy was obtained for a fused set of texture features (local binary patterns and Haralick’s features), in combination with the support vector machine classifier. However, the achieved accuracy was not sufficiently high. It is believed that the lacking accuracy is due to the limited amount of training data that was available and the deficiency of the employed segmentation algorithm. By resolving these issues, and by repeating the four working steps for other obstacles on the hull, it is believed that a complete obstacle detection framework can be acquired in the future.","Ship hull cleaning robot; Forward looking sonar; Obstacle detection; Line detection; Edge detection; Semantic Segmentation; Texture Features; Object detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-23","","","","","",""

A backboard structure limited subjects’ whole-body rotation to the sagittal plane which corresponded with the EVS-evoked sway responses in anteroposterior direction, as the subject’s head was rotated in yaw. Vestibular-evoked muscle responses were greatest when sensory cues of gravity matched the expected terrestrial force of gravity, and decreased when these cues were modified. The reduction was largest when both load- and vestibular-related cues of gravity were different from normal. Our results indicate that the vestibular drive for standing balance control is attenuated when sensory cues of gravity are not congruent to normal (i.e. terrestrial) expectations of standing balance and that the degree of attenuation is dependent upon the cumulative incongruency that arises from multiple sensory cues.","vestibular system; balance control; gravity; electrical vestibular stimulation; vestibular-evoked response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A promising technology which is currently actively researched is the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> (ERC). This technology utilizes otherwise polluting and unwanted CO<sub>2</sub> and converts<br/>it into value-added products under the influence of an electrical current. The process can therefore be designed as an energy storage mechanism since electrical energy is stored as chemical bonds. In this research, ERC towards formic acid has been investigated from two perspectives.<br/><br/>First, the feasibility of the commercial production of formic acid compared to other products of ERC was investigated. The electrochemical production of the most common reduction products have been compared based on production costs, energy storage capabilities, toxicity and manageability. Due to the relatively low energy consumption for 2-electron products, namely formic acid, carbon monoxide and oxalic acid, it is found that these products have the most promising business case. Additionally, ERC to formic acid is best studied compared to other products, and high selectivities are commonly reported. Formic acid and methanol are liquid at atmospheric conditions, which is beneficial as relatively large amounts of energy per unit volume can be stored without the need of additional compression or cooling. This will also allow for easy transportation. As hydrogen carrier, formic acid has the advantage that it can be decomposed in H2 and CO<sub>2</sub> near room temperature. In the second part of this research, the use of numerical modeling to study the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> in an electrochemical cell towards formic acid/formate at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> pressures is presented. The model investigates to impact on the cathodic half-cell of a cell designed for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> in aqueous electrolyte solutions at a constant temperature of 25℃, simultaneously assuming non-limiting conditions with respect to the anodic half-cell. The modeled part of the cell has been divided in three main regions, namely the bulk, cathode surface region and the electrode surface, which are discussed separately. The bulk is assumed to be the region of equilibrated concentrations which are constant in time, as they are not dynamically influenced by any mass transport phenomena. Reactants are supplied from the bulk to the electrode surface and products are removed vice versa via the cathode surface region, which is a thin region in the vicinity of the electrode. The transfer of species within this region and the chemical reactions between the species, form a system of diffusion-reaction equations. This system is solved numerically using appropriate boundary conditions. The actual reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> occurs on the electrode surface, and the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions towards HCOO<sup>-</sup>, CO and H<sub>2</sub> are described using Tafel-type kinetics. <br/><br/>The electrochemical model has been verified and compared with experimental data, and despite various simplifications has proven to be predictive of the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>. It is found that the potentially beneficial effects of an elevated CO<sub>2</sub> pressure on both the production rate and selectivity, as experimentally observed, can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the electrode surface is identified as the main limiting factor for achieving both a high selectivity towards formate and a higher production rate on formate producing metals. The model shows that with an increased CO<sub>2</sub> pressure the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved into the solution is increased significantly, resulting in a higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at the electrode and less mass transfer limitations.","CO2 reduction; formic acid; high pressure; electrochemical reduction; formate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-22","","","","","",""

(mentor); Mallon, Niels (mentor); de Groot, Sytske (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Poineering Spirit is a heavy lift vessel that can lift offshore platforms in a single lift. Due to the waves, the vessel moves with respect to the platform. To make sure the vessel does not hit the platform, a motion compensation system is installed on the Pioneering Spirit. The maximum allowable vessel motions during<br/>the operation are restricted by the capacity of the motion compensation system. Comparison of the predicted motions with measurements have shown good comparison for the deep water situation. It was found that prediction of the vessel motions in shallow water does not agree with the measuredmotions.<br/>Therefore the prediction of the vessel motions in shallow water is investigated, to find out how do predicted vessel motions compare to measured motions. The goal is to quantify and reduce the uncertainty in vessel motion prediction in shallow water. First the calculation method of comparing the predictions to measurements was investigated and validated. The wave spectrum and as well as the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) are available in 2D, The vessel response is available as a time series. To compare the predictions to measurements,<br/>both prediction andmeasurement are translated to a 1D response. For the prediction, first the 2D response is calculated, which is then added over all wave directions to get the 1D response. The measured time series of the vessel motions are translated to a 1D frequency domain response using the Fast Fourier<br/>Transform (FFT). The comparison of the 1D response spectra is done by comparing Significant Double Amplitude (SDA) and peak period Tp .<br/>Comparison of the peak period has a relatively large error, with errors exceeding 0.5 s for most of the comparison for heave, roll and pitch. Looking at the SDA, the heave motions are underestimated for most of the time for low amplitudes. As the amplitudes increase, there is a spreading of the predicted motions above and below the measured values. Taking into account the motions with at least 0.4 m measured heave, the SDA is within 10 cm from the measured motions for 25% of the measurements. For the roll,the motions were underpredicted for larger motions, being at an incoming peak wave direction between than 220 and 260 degrees. The heave motions at the location of the topside lift system are dominated by the contribution of the pitch motions. The motions in shallow water are not accurately predicted in most cases, with a deviation from the heave at the sensor location by more than 10 cm. The response deviates above and below the measured motions. A possible explanation for the overestimation is the cushioning and sticking effect due to the presence of the seabed, this needs to be further investigated. The prediction of the peak period is limited by the precision of the buoy data. In order to do a good comparison for the peak period, the precision of the wave spectrum should be increased. This can be done by fitting the measured spectrum, or by using buoy data which has a smaller frequency step.","hydromech; shallow water; Motion prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-22","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The research question posed is: ""How can a parametric bridge design model be composed to fit into the <br/>overall road design process in order to get a comparative overview of structurally sound bridge designs of different typologies?"". Within the literature review some background information is provided about the design of steel-concrete bridges, parametric design, finite element modelling and evolutionary solvers for optimization. With this information seven different bridges are designed according to boundary conditions and requirements posed in a fictitious case. These bridge designs cover the beam-, truss-, arch- and cable stayed<br/>bridge typologies. The designs are then parametrically modelled and converted to a finite element model in a single parametric design environment, after which they are structurally analysed and optimized for minimum costs. The result is that, for the fictitious case considered, the Warren truss without verticals is the<br/>solution with the lowest costs. This bridge design is able to carry the loads, according to load model 1 from the Euro Codes,with a lower amount of structural steel compared to the girder beam bridges, and the absence of expensive cables in the structure makes it less expensive than the arch and cable stayed bridges. Due to the scope defined at the start of the research, there are some limitations. The costs calculated for the bridges are purely based on the bridge structure itself, foundations and approach structures are not considered and this has to be kept in mind when comparing the bridges. Finally, the research into how to implement this design and optimization tool into the overall design process has not been performed, however, the model is composed in such a way that it will be compatible with minor changes to the start and end of the process.","Parametric design; Steel; Bridges; Concrete; Optimization; Automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-21","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Metrikine, A. (graduation committee); van Dalen, K.N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A Cutter Suction Dredger (CSD) is a vessel that is used to cut hard soils with precision. It is moored stiffly through a spud pile while the soil is being cut. This, in combination with wave loads, causes the whole system to be dynamically challenging and nonlinear. Previous attempts to model a CSD in operation have been limited to the frequency domain. However, in order to be able to include these nonlinear effects occurring during the operation of a CSD, a time domain analysis is necessary. The hydrodynamic forces in the time domain analysis will be calculated using Ansys AQWA. The external forces which occur during operation will be calculated by a custom script written in Python. The script consists out of 3 modules; a spud module, a winch module and a soil module. The spud module is responsible for calculating the mooring forces on the spud pile in order to maintain its position. The spud has been modeled as a beam with 3 pinned supports. This linear model has been expanded to include the option to take the presence of a flexible spud carriage into account. This means that if the buffer of the flexible carriage is activated, the stiffness of the system changes accordingly in order to reduce the loading on the spud with increasing displacements. The winch module is responsible for determining the force required to achieve the swing around the spud at the desired velocity. Within the module, the application of a PID controller ensures that the tension in the side wires is adjusted dynamically in order to maintain a stable swing velocity throughout the whole process. Tuning the controller correctly is critical to avoid unnecessary tension peaks while at the same having a sufficiently quick response to sudden changes. The soil module is responsible for calculating the reaction forces on the CSD as a consequence of the cutting of the soil. The soil is characterized by the specific energy characteristic, which enables the module to be applied to all types of soil, from soft clay to hard rock. The 3D force vector on the cutterhead is then calculated using the volume cut and the rotational torque of the cutterhead. Furthermore, the module keeps track of where the soil has been cut, adjusting the new height as the cutterhead passes. This enables to realistically create a time series where the volume cut during each timestep will vary due to the oscillations of the cutter. The final result is a model in 7 degrees of freedom which can dynamically respond to the nonlinear reactions caused by cutting soil, wave loads, mooring through a flexible carriage and varying side wire forces. This model is now ready to be used to investigate the effects of different combinations of soil types and wave conditions.","cutter suction dredger; time domain; AQWA; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-21","","","","","",""

Therefore, one of the main systems on board of submarines is therefore the ballast trim system. This system is able to maintain the submarine balanced. There must be equilibrium in weight and buoyancy as well as in the trimming moment. This makes the ballast trim system a vital system on board of submarines.<br/>The world around us changes, causing new mission specifications and requirements. This results in a different operational profile than before, which has consequences for the ballast trim system. For example, for a modern submarine hovering is desired, resulting in a faster and more accurate ballast trim system. Therefore, the existing systems must be reconsidered for modern SSK submarine applications. Next to the changed environment, new technologies are available, which might be applicable for a modern SSK submarine. The main goals of this research are: give insight in the ballast trim system and see which technologies are best to use in the ballast trim system. The technologies are tested on the 4000 and 2000 ton BB2 submarine.<br/>In this research different empirical models were set up in order to simulate the behaviour of the different ballast trim systems. The results of these models are compared to each other based on energy, noise and redundancy. As an input, different mission profiles were made, which are likely to be executed by a modern SSK submarine. The ballast trim system was divided into three separate systems for the comparison, namely: trim, compensation and hover. <br/>From the simulation made there was seen which modelled solutions were the best capable to use as a ballast trim system. In this research also the second order effects of waves were included. There is seen from the simulation that it is possible to compensate for the motions due to these second order wave effects. The simulations also showed that a new technique, the so called ‘variable buoyancy system’ is very promising.<br/>With the results from this research it can be seen which system can be best used as ballast trim system for the three different tasks on board of the BB2 submarine. To maintain longitudinal equilibrium, it is best to use a centrifugal pump to transfer ballast water between tanks. To maintain balance between the weight and buoyancy forces of the submarine, it is best to use a plunger pump. It is also seen that a centrifugal pump in a system with a very large static head compared to dynamic head, is hard to operate and can even become incapable of expelling water from the tank. For hovering, a special dedicated system is needed. For the 4000 ton BB2 submarine, it is best to use a pre-pressurised tank to lose weight very fast in case of a change in seawater density. The 2000 ton BB2 submarine can use its snorkel mast to maintain equilibrium. For low frequency forces such as the second order forces due to waves, both studied BB2 submarines can use their snorkel mast to keep the submarine at depth. <br/><br/><br","Submarines; Ballast trim system; BB2; SSK; Pumps; Military; Naval","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

The results would be helpful in order to have a better overview on the effect and importance of each modeling parameters on the objective function calculation which would finally affect the layout found by the optimizer. The first phase of the project defines and categorize parameters affecting the WFLO. The second phase involves setting up the methods to find the effect of the categorized parameters such as turbulence intensity, wind direction sampling step, and wake model selection on WFLO.<br/>The research is done on the analyzer stage and ignored the optimizer. The analyzer has function of calculating the annual energy yield and providing the result to the optimizer module for the WFLO process. Moreover, the study starts from a single wake calculation, to wind farm power production for an individual wind direction, and finally to annual energy yield production. Following these steps is helpful because the same steps happen in the analyzer, and it enables us to determine effects of the parameters within the flow of calculation in the analyzer. These steps are vital to sheds light on the origin of each effect that happens on the annual energy production level and helps to understand if they are magnifying or disappearing during these steps. This study shows that Jensen, Larsen, and Ainslie wake models are similar in ranking the annual energy yield of a wind farm with random configuration, although they have different behaviours in increasing the annual energy production by increasing the spacing in a wind farm (which is more sensible in relatively lower spacing). For instance, in a wind farm with turbines relatively close to each other, the Larsen model has the most increase due to the increase in spacing, which leads the analyzer to find a larger wind farm as the solution (compared to Ainslie and Jensen) when costs (like cabling costs) are also taken into account combined with the annual energy production.<br","Wind Energy; Wind farm layout optimization; Wake model; Annual energy production","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

Compared to the present generation – 4G mobile network, a significant improvement in terms of performance and reliability is considered for 5G. One of the important factor in the design of 5G is – about 10 times lower packet latency than 4G. Some of the use cases identified for 5G require packet latency as low as 1 ms. Such stringent latency targets are essential to enable new services like virtual reality streaming of live content over mobile network, automated vehicle platooning over mobile network and tactile internet where machines and tools can be controlled remotely with extreme responsiveness over the mobile network.<br/>The main goal of this thesis is to understand how packet latency is affected by the various factors observed in a realistic environment. In contrast to lab environments, where the packet latency reported would be very low, a consolidated study on the various factors affecting packet latency in a 4G (LTE) network in a realistic environment is missing. To this extent, the results of this work have enabled to identify the various factors affecting packet latency in a realistic 4G network. This further led to identifying the latency contribution of the various components to the overall packet latency. Later on, two different latency reduction techniques were evaluated to verify the possible latency reduction achievable on a 4G network, using those two techniques.<br/>To reduce packet latency to achieve the latency targets for 5G, first it was necessary to identify how packet latency is caused and affected in a 4G network. This work was aimed at achieving this goal. As the latency reduction techniques were evaluated at their best configuration in terms of latency, results from the latency reduction techniques also identifies the lower limit of latency improvement achievable in a 4G network. The inference from the results suggests that in order to achieve the latency targets specified for 5G networks, a redesigned radio access technology of 4G is essential.","latency; analysis; reduction; 4G; 5G","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

The interest for such bodies is not only justified by the threat that they represent for the Earth, but also because they are potential sources of extra-terrestrial materials, provide windows to the past of the Solar System and to planetary formation, and offer a good opportunity to demonstrate deep-space mission technologies.<br/><br/>The Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is the next European Space Agency mission to a NEO, which has among its main objectives the deployment of the Asteroid Spectral Imaging Mission Cubesat (ASPECT) in the vicinity of the binary asteroid Didymos during the Payload Delivery Phase (PDP). However, this deployment is affected by the uncertainties and errors coming from the strongly perturbed environment, the previous phase dispersions, and the navigation and command inaccuracies.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is therefore to assess the viability of the cubesat deployment in terms of the safety of the reference trajectories and the accuracy of the deployment conditions achieved.<br/><br/>The reference trajectories that target the cubesat’s commissioning orbit injection point were designed by implementing a two-arc hyperbolic trajectory design problem in a direct-shooting optimisation architecture in the commercial heuristics optimisation software known as Mixed Integer Distributed Ant Colony Optimization (MIDACO). These trajectories were obtained in an ideal, unperturbed scenario. The safety and accuracy of the trajectories obtained were tested in a series of Monte Carlo campaigns in which the uncertainties, errors and dispersions present in the system were used as Monte Carlo variables in a high-level Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) simulator implemented in Simulink 2016b.<br/><br/>After identifying the pericentre of the target Self-Stabilised Terminator Orbit (SSTO) as the best point to carry out the deployment, five different families of trajectories that bring the spacecraft within the safety deployment margins were found. The total velocity increment required for these trajectories were found to vary from 1.2 to 3.4 m/s. These relatively high velocity increments are caused by the combination of the constraints imposed in the design process that emanate from the mission operational requirements.<br/><br/>The first Monte Carlo set of simulations showed that the optimum number of guidance correction manoeuvres is assessed to be three. The timing of these manoeuvres is case dependent, but one correction must take place in the first arc flown, and the other two during the second arc and before the deployment.<br/>Results of the second Monte Carlo campaign showed that the trajectories were unsafe according to the mission safety requirements on the minimum distance to the main asteroid and on the margin to the escape velocity. Of these two requirements, the escape velocity margin was the main cause of these safety violations, with several trajectories falling below the margin of 2 cm/s at certain epochs. This was due to the initial state vector dispersion coming from the previous phase and, to a lesser extent, due to the potential thrust failures.<br/><br/>In the final Monte Carlo campaign, the ASPECT injection success rates reached a maximum value of 75% for the trajectory that targets the SSTO with a semi-major axis equal to 5 km. The cause of this low success rate was attributed to a combination of high initial position dispersions and velocity navigation errors. Due to this velocity navigation inaccuracies, the corrections made by the guidance subsystem are not capable of compensating the dispersions in initial position. These corrections further deteriorate the final deployment conditions, since their calculation only takes into account deviations in position, and not in velocity.<br/><br/>The results of this study highlight the need of finding ways of reducing the position dispersion with respect to the nominal trajectory prior to the autonomous PDP. Furthermore, they indicate that the prediction of success rates can be improved by refining the navigation performance models, since these are considered conservative when compared to the real scenario.<br","Asteroid; Mission design; Cubesat; Cubesat Deployment; GNC; Optimisation; AIM; Trajectory Design; Guidance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","Asteroid Impact Mission",""

The three main attributes looked for in 2D lattice materials to be deemed suitable for actuation are in-plane isotropy, high specific elastic properties and limited energy requirement for actuation. However, no infallible topological criteria have yet been discovered that determine which micro-architectures meet these requirements. The Kagome micro-architecture yields the best-performing lattice material for actuation known to date. <br/><br/>This thesis contributes to the search for micro-architectures that perform similar to Kagome lattice material, or even outperform it. Four novel micro-architectures are introduced. Each of the new micro-architectures is verified to constitute a stiff (i.e. stretching-dominated) isotropic lattice material. Still, not all of them result in optimal elastic moduli. One of the proposed designs does perform identically to the Kagome structure in terms of elastic moduli. Moreover, it requires less energy for actuation in the range of relative densities of interest. On the other hand, its attenuation distance is shorter; actuation deformations damp out within a shorter distance than in Kagome lattice material.","2D lattice materials; self-stress; mechanical metamaterials; micro-architecture; infinite structures; isotropy; static and kinematic determinacy; homogenisation; actuation; shape morphing; lightweight; foams; mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An example is Volvo's Pilot Assist, which provides a more comfortable journey for the driver as certain parts of the dynamic driving task are taken away, but it still requires the driver to be attentive in order to supervise the system and resume vehicle operation if necessary. Car manufacturers and high-tech companies all around the world are working on the development of an Automated Driving System (ADS) of level 3 or higher where the driver does not need to supervise, but have so far not been able to introduce any to the public. Operating a vehicle on an empty highway is relatively easy, but roads are getting more and more congested so dense traffic driving needs to be accounted for as well. <br/><br/>Unsupervised driving does not only require that a system itself operates the vehicle correctly, but requires that it is able to cope with mistakes of other drivers. In order to take these into account as well as other unpredictable events, current driving automation systems tend to adopt large longitudinal margins with respect to surrounding traffic to use their ability to brake to avoid a collision. In dense traffic situations this conservative behaviour prohibits the ADS from making lane changes. <br/><br/>This thesis was setup in cooperation with Volvo Cars / Zenuity to develop a lane change path planning algorithm that can plan active lane changes in dense traffic, by pushing into a gap without compromising the ability to avoid a possible collision.<br/><br/>Earlier work at Volvo suggested considering the ability of a vehicle to not only brake, but also to make an evasive maneuver. If an evasion maneuver is available the necessary safety margins are reduced considerably compared to a `braking-only' scenario. <br/><br/>In this work, the evasive maneuver was modeled and a constraint formulation was developed that if met, guarantees the availability of the designed evasion maneuver. This constraint translates to a state-dependent safety zone which the ADS should keep the vehicle clear off at all times.<br/><br/>Model Predictive Control allows the implementation of such a safety zone by considering it as a constraint on the optimisation, guaranteeing that an evasion maneuver is available along any point on the prediction horizon. This negates the necessity to plan all possible evasion maneuvers separately, and it was therefore chosen as the path planning method.<br/><br/>Implementation of the safety zone constraint on multiple surrounding vehicles, spread over multiple lanes in a Model Predictive Control framework, together with the requirements of being able to overtake other vehicles within the prediction horizon, necessitated the development of a novel 3-step algorithm. In this algorithm three Optimal Control Problems are solved consecutively to plan a path which positions the ego-vehicle optimally in the targeted gap without breaching the safety zones.<br/><br/>To be able to implement the algorithm in real-time, a computationally expedient vehicle model is chosen and the OCP's are solved using state-of-the-art structure exploiting Interior Point solvers, generated as efficient C-code using FORCES Pro.<br/><br/>With this setup, computation times of $\sim$30[ms] are achieved for a 10[s] prediction horizon sampled at 100[ms]. The algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and shown to be able to find the point of maximum lateral intrusion, to operate on the edge of the safety zone constraint, and to avoid a collision when it is being cut off from behind or when the vehicle in front comes to a sudden stop. <br/><br/>The results show that vehicle operation by an ADS is possible in dense traffic without compromising safety. By using the developed safety zones and novelty solution framework the necessary margins can be reduced, increasing the availability of the lane change maneuver. Furthermore the control strategies necessary for implementation are shown to be applicable in real-time, paving the way for implementation in real vehicles. This way the research contributes to the next step in developing a usable Automated Driving System.<br","Automated Drving Systems; Model Predictive Control; Nonlinear; Lane Change; Autonomous driving; Self-driving car; Automated driving; Merging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The Netherlands has drawn up ambitious goals in the energy transition. However, numerous studies have shown that there is a lack of space in the Netherlands to adapt to a 100% green economy. To solve this dilemma it is necessary to import renewable energy from other countries. Solar electricity prices are dropping rapidly in high solar irradiation areas and are currently the worlds cheapest source of electricity, likewise this is in places where space is often abundant. This thesis examines the techno-economical feasibility of importing solar energy from Morocco to the Netherlands. As subsidized solar electricity is bought by the Dutch government for 0.125 e/kWh, the target is to find a solution below this demand. All energy storage systems are analyzed thoroughly and an energy and cost analysis is performed for a cable, chemical energy storage, thermal energy storage and liquid air energy storage.<br/>A HVDC submarine power cable between Morocco and the Netherlands is compared in proportion to the costs and distance of the NorNed cable. A HVDC submarine power cable over a distance of 2600 km results in a LCoE of 0.113 e/kWh. Other energy storage systems use a tanker to transport the stored energy. In this thesis liquid hydrogen, ammonia and methanol are analyzed as chemical energy storage systems. Liquid hydrogen is produced by cooling and expanding hydrogen, ammonia is produced by the Haber-Bosch process and methanol is formed by reacting H2 and CO2. Fuel cells are used to convert fuels back into electricity. The most efficient and cost effective solution for chemical energy storage is storing electricity in the form of liquid hydrogen. A round-trip efficiency of 27% with a LCoE of 0.491 e/kWh is obtained in 2015, from the predictions of 2030 a round-trip efficiency of 40% with a LCoE of 0.159 e/kWh is derived. The next concept is based on thermal energy storage with Solar Salt as energy carrier. Solar Salt is heated in the receiver of a solar tower where heat from the sun is concentrated to by heliostats. Hot Solar Salt is transported to the Netherlands by a tanker and a steam cycle is driven utilizing the heat of hot Solar Salt. The energy efficiency obtained from solar irradiation to electricity in the Netherlands is 28%, the output power is only 1% less than the output power should be if the power block was located in Morocco. An electricity price of 0.164 e/kWh is obtained, but if heat is delivered a heat price of 0.069 e/kWh can be realized. The final designed energy storage system combines liquid air with the heat of hot Solar Salt. Liquid air and hot Solar Salt are produced in Morocco and in the Netherlands electricity is produced with high efficiencies due to the large temperature differences. The system described results in a electricity price of 0.108 e/kWh with an energy efficiency of 58.7% from electricity and hot Solar Salt to electricity in the Netherlands.<br/>It is concluded that storing electricity in chemical energy storage via the processes described in this thesis will lead to too high costs to be used as energy storage solution. There are possibilities in direct fuel conversion technologies due to high conversion efficiencies, only developments are still in its experimental phase. The combination of liquid air with Solar Salt complies to the cost requirement, some more research is required on the electricity generation process described, but the concept shows a lot of potential. Finally, heat of Solar Salt can be provided at a price of 0.069 e/kWh, subsidized solar heat is bought by the Dutch government for 0.095 e/kWh. This gives possibilities to effectuate a business case.","Liquid Hydrogen; Ammonia; Methanol; Liquid Air; Molten salt; Thermal energy storage; Chemical energy storage; Solar energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) is developing a new offshore wind turbine, including, amongst other innovations, a slip-joint that connects the turbine tower and monopile foundation. The slip-joint is a mechanical, friction-based connection that provides many advantages over a bolted or grouted connection, such as the ability to support high loads, reduced maintenance costs and rapid installation. However, for the slip-joint to be accurately designed and to have its performance guaranteed, it is necessary to know the contact behaviour within the slip-joint. <br/><br/>Heat transfer has been selected as the optimal measurement basis over magnetic, electrical and other techniques, as heat transfer through the slip-joint wall is correlated with both contact pressure and air gap size (in non-contact regions). A continuous-heating thermographic point measurement method has been developed to measure the contact pressure and contact gaps in the slip-joint connection. This requires the use of an induction heater to heat one side of the slip-joint wall while, on the other side of the wall, a thermal camera measures the temperature rise. This method was tested on a sample slip-joint from a decommissioned onshore wind turbine. <br/>Prior to full scale testing, the method was validated through comparison with a finite element model. This comparison shows that the method is sensitive to variations in contact and pressure, especially in regions where contact pressure is close to zero. Additional small-scale experiments were conducted with two 8mm steel plates separated by a known gap. This demonstrated the sensitivity of the method to gap size changes of less than 0.1mm and gap sizes greater than 1mm. Finally, single-ply validation testing shows the precision of the measurement method to be ±13% (at 90% confidence interval). <br/><br/>Following validation, the method was used to measure the contact distribution across 207 grid points on the sample slip-joint. The results show thin (0.3-1m), longitudinal low-pressure regions extending from the top and bottom of the joint towards the centre. Physical verification with feeler gauges indicates that 34% of the joint is not in contact (with 95% confidence interval of [23% 51%]). Feeler gauge testing also shows that the correlation between heat measurements and actual gap size is in agreement in both full-scale and small-scale validation measurements. Finally, feeler gauge measurements show there is a ±13% error in the thermal measurements. <br/><br/>The results show that the thermographic method for slip-joint contact area measurement is suitable to resolve pressure and gap size variations in the slip-joint. Additionally, the measurement results show that it is necessary for engineers to consider up to 50% non-contact during the design process and joint contact should be assessed in all slip-joints post-installation. Finally, future development of the method through the use of more sensitive equipment and performing additional single-ply measurements to establish a clearer error estimate is recommended. This should be augmented by a comparison to residual stress measurements using the Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) method, as well as acoustic resonance stiffness measurements, to verify contact results and examine the cause of such contact variations in a sample joint.","Slip-joint; Offshore wind; Monopile; Thermography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-19","","","","","",""

Researchers are continuously investigating new ways to develop and improve cancer treatments. Currently, remarkable progress has been made in immunotherapy. This treatment uses monoclonal antibodies to enhance or recover the patient’s immune system to destroy the cancer cells. However, these new treatments are expensive and not tailored to the patient’s need.<br/><br/>As a solution, Prof. Schellekens, from the Pharmaceutical department at the university in Utrecht, and his colleagues, proposed to add the antibody manufacturing to the magistral preparation procedures in a pharmacy. This allows the pharmacist to produce medicine for only one individual patient which does not have to comply with the regulations commercially produced medicine have to. This would result in a less expensive medicine which can be adapted to the patient’s specific needs.<br/><br/>To realize this idea, pharmacists need to be able to manufacture those antibodies. Therefore, the concept arose for creating a manufacturing unit to enable pharmacists to produce personalized medicine for patient use. This concept is called: the Bio-Nespresso. <br/><br/>Through user, context and technology analysis, the vision arose for designing a machine that enables a hospital pharmacist’s assistant to manufacture 30 grams of monoclonal antibodies in a sterile and reliable way, without requiring any specific knowledge about antibody manufacturing. To realize this, a new party was introduced: The Supplier. This party delivers all antibody production-specific elements to the hospital pharmacy, enabling the pharmacist and pharmacist’s assistant to only focus on patient care and executing the production process. <br/><br/>This project resulted in a first design of the Bio-Nespresso. The machine provides the ability to produce different doses of medicines, up to an entire treatment. All production-specific elements are integrated into four disposable units, which together form a closed system to prevent contamination. The machine will guide and monitor the users actions when installing these disposables.<br/><br/>The design demonstrates what the stationing of the Bio-Nespresso at a hospital pharmacy should look like. This resulted in concrete challenges which can serve as a starting point for the development of the proof of concept.","Bio-Nespresso; Bionexpresso; Medicine; Antibodies; Immunotherapy; Personalized; Affordable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Creating narrative worlds is a time-consuming process because of the collaboration of writers, 3D artists and game designers, the story adjusting the world over time and the requirement for diverse and interesting environments. This thesis focuses on solving these problems. First, the manual approach was designed that allows the manual creation of a narrative world,<br/>while focusing on filling environments. Secondly, the assisted approach builds on the manual approach and is able to assist a designer in making the decisions necessary to fill environments. The manual approach uses a set of objects with explicit relationships, created following a modular approach. The manual approach incorporates a discrete and sequential timeline of events, with each event connected to a single location, directly into the process. Several actions are used to fill the narrative world for each point in time of the timeline. The assisted approach offers assistance for each decision of the actions. Due to computational complexity, each decision is assisted independently. The discrete decisions are evaluated and ordered through the use of weighted criteria. The continuous decisions, the placement of objects, requires generation of options, which is done through an adaptation of Merrell et al. [2011]’s GPGPU algorithm. A usability study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the assisted approach compared to the manual approach. Results were collected through a creativity support index (CSI), a questionnaire on the assisted approach and quantitative measurements on object usage and time taken for actions and locations. The manual approach scored better in the CSI results than the assisted approach. The final questionnaire showed that this was caused by automation results not matching the user’s expectations as these differ, at least, per user and location type. The following conclusions are made. First, explicit <br/> relationships allow direct insight in how objects interact. Secondly, the usability study results supports the iterative process employed by, both our, and many other creative process approaches. Finally, in general, it is difficult to provide valuable assistance as expectations differ greatly. The incorporation of uncertainty into the assistance can help lessen this problem.","Narrative world; Assistance; Automation; Environments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the future prospect of an autonomous, shared and electric driving experience, side supports might obtain new purposes supporting the passenger. There is a need of objectifying the (dis)comfort of side supports in current and in future car seats to gain insight into relationships to human anthropometry, performed activities and the design of seats. A literature review 2 presents an alteration on the comfort models of Vink &amp; Hallbeck (2012) and Naddeo (2014), aimed at improvement of the physical seat and components. All relevant objective comfort measurements and parameters and variables of the seat and passenger are structured, explained and their optimal (dis)comfort values are described. Scientifical evidence relating side supports to (dis)comfort is marginal and should therefore be studied. The effect of changing the variables of a side support (height, foam hardness, contour and cover friction) are studied in their relation to (dis)comfort. Both static and dynamic (dis)comfort is evaluated, alongside pressure recordings and characterization, looking for the optimal design of a car seat bolster and backrest wing. A redesign of a BMW 5 Series seat, lowers the bolsters from 55mm to 40mm, decreasing discomfort while relatively maintaining a high proportion of its (dynamic) comfort. The backrest wings is fitted with a soft (2kPa) cut foam with 15mm thickness at the side, gradually becoming thinner to the main surface. This preserves low discomfort in widest adjustment and increases dynamic comfort in narrow setting. Internal evaluation in a realistic and long-term driving environment proved its successfully improved comfort. Future autonomous driving, its concept interiors and use cases; intelligent entrance, transition, boost, life experience and holistic health; are analysed, looking into technological developments and consequences for the interior and use of a car. Various secondary activities; relaxing, sleeping, laptop and device work, social interaction and in/egress; are identified and analysed, confining the required space and optimal posture for the design of a conceptual future autonomous car seat. A new 6D adjustable seating concept is developed. The seat has an alteration on the current adjustment system, adding a lateral rail for sideways movement, a planetary gear for normal axis rotation and an individually controlled 4-beam mechanism, enabling the roll rotation alongside height adjustment. The seat requires medium-firm upholstery, supporting the body and distributing pressure at the buttocks and shoulder areas. The cushion is 100mm high, made of a latex rubber.

Currently several tools aimed at the identification of different strains in metagenomic sequence data are available. We present an independent benchmark to compare the performance of several of these tools. The tools have been evaluated with a variety of synthetic metagenomic samples containing strain mixtures of the species Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br/>To facilitate this research, a benchmark framework in Python 3 was built.

This with the aim of creation of a locally available material from a current waste stream, exploiting the possibilities of local manufacturing with 3D printing, as this has the potential to contribute to a circular economy.<br/>This project was meant to continue the search for a material made from mussel shells that was printable and recyclable, and find possible applications.<br/>Based on the literature and initial tests was concluded that an additional ingredient was required besides ground mussel shells and water, to create the right viscosity. Research was done into suitable binder materials. Four potential materials were chosen with a weighted criteria method. These materials were sugar, potato starch, iota-carrageenan and NEO-alginate. These four were tested on their effect on the printability and recyclability of the material. Both sugar and NEO-alginate were chosen to continue with as they both had proven to be the best suitable binding agents according to a set of defined criteria. <br/>Relevant technical characteristics of both material combinations were defined by material tests. As the material is developed in this project, there is a certain amount of control over its characteristics by varying certain parameters in the process; Because of this not only the characteristics themselves but also the effect of process parameters was defined. The experiential characteristics, i.e. how the material is perceived, were defined by user tests.<br/>Based on found characteristics a Material Experience Vision was defined. This Vision was meant to give direction and provide guidance through to the ideation process. The Vision is defined as<br/>“I want to create an application in which the material has clear benefits over other suitable materials and fits within a system compliant with the principles of a circular economy.

From these three the concept Circular Lighting was elaborated on; in this concept the material was used to create lamp shades in a ‘light as a service’ system. This system was meant for circular built tourist residences. The manufacturer keeps ownership of the light system. Repair and replacement is outsourced to local parties, who would collect the material of the lamps and use it to print new lamps, creating local material loops. A prototype is made of a possible lamp design to validate and showcase the possibilities with developed material.¬<br","Additive Manufacturing; Circular Economy; Mussel shells; Material Driven Design; 3D Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The goal of this thesis is to implement a blind approach to the cocktail party problem and challenge some of the regular assumptions made in literature. We approach the problemas wideband FD-BSS. From this field of research, the common assumption of contineous activity is dropped. Instead a number of users detection is implemented as a preprocessing step and ensure the appropriate number of demixing vectors for each time frequency bin. The validity of the standard mixing model used for STFT’s is challenged by looking at the response of a linear array. Source separation is achieved by demixing vectors based on the GSVD, derived in a model-based approach. While most ermutation solvers offer an a posteriori solution for all users, we looked at finding local solutions for a single user. Combining this with the user identification called the alignment step, we conclude that the permutation problem can be reduced to selecting a demixing vector for each discrete time-frequency instance.<br/>The correlation coefficient proves to be a sufficient metric to couple reconstructions to the original data as it selects most of the active time-frequency bins. In the far-field case, our approach performs in a comparable<br/>but not superior manner. We did find that our method is much more robust against inaccuracies introduced when narrowband channels are assumed but not actually available. This is strongly exemplified by our experiment of a changing DFT-size. <br/>The Frobinius norm was suggested as a measure of distance between the estimate STFT and the orignial signals time frequency domain description but it resulted in counter intuitive results which didn’t correspond with other metrics used in this thesis. It is expected that there are effects induced by changing the size of the STFT which are not accounted for.<br/>Our demixing vectors achieve comparable inteligibility, measured by STOI, as the compared techniques and it is more robust against smaller sample sizes than the theoretically SINR optimal MVDR.","Speech separation; Blind source separation; Generalized Singular Value Decomposition; Permutation problem; Cocktail Party Problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was identified that this phenomenon advertised a Western-centric perspective since its birth in 1851. This means that its way of representing the world excluded and marginalized others. Furthermore, it implies that the model of the World Expo did not change over the past 150 years. So, the opportunity arose to develop an exposition of the world based on another model, for the sake of inclusion.<br/><br/>The project took a position within decolonization theory, which is concerned with the disruption of any ideology of domination. At this point three guiding principles were articulated to lead the design: Interdependence, Multiplicity and Disruption. By using a design-based research method, the project developed from the interaction between theory and practice. In addition, it allowed two disciplines, Architecture and Science Communication, to consolidate in the course of the process.<br/>The design process resulted in Expo Mondo, a patio-pavilion located at numerous cities around the world, where it provides visitors a place to distance from everyday life. Facilitating both a place for self-reflection and an aesthetic experience. The architecture of Expo Mondo performs as a communication mean. This means that the architecture does not house an exhibition, but is the exposition itself. Expo Mondo aims to reveal unity in diversity, by exposing a context specific content through an universal architectural framework.<br/>The universal framework is made of the fundamental elements of architecture: the constructive elements. The patio-pavilion behaves autonomously in its context. In this way it allows itself to be familiar, and yet be distant to its surroundings. Furthermore, the framework takes a both/and approach with regard to spatial opposites. This is determined to be an inclusive approach, because it does not prioritizes one over the other. Instead, the opposites co-exist in a mutual relationship. Expo Mondo concerns, among others, the co-existence of the man-made and the natural, the open and the enclosed, the classical and the neoplastic, the individual and the communal.<br/>Expo Mondo fosters diversity. The design triggers visitors to give multiple interpretations to Expo Mondo, and it allows different types of use. In this way it appeals to various individuals. Furthermore, the content - its nature, sculptures, and visitors - adapts to correspond to local conditions. Hence, the patio-pavilion fits the community and the climate in which it is implemented. As follows, it exposes the local culture. To leave room for interpretation the design of Expo Mondo is left open to some extend. The purpose of patio-pavilion is not mentioned in advance, only the name Expo Mondo is apparent. Additional information on the patio-pavilion can be looked up by visitors on the internet. <br/>Three focus groups were done to test the design of Expo Mondo. The participants represented three different groups of potential visitors. The results were related to the guiding principles of the design. The findings shows that the participants give different interpretations to Expo Mondo, and that not all intentions are recognized. Furthermore, this research has mapped the design process. In this way it provides insight on the integration of two disciplines, theory and practice in one research project. The design-based research method allowed for this integration to happen. The integration already started at an abstract level with the guiding principles. <br/>Lastly, the report concludes by answering main research question, interpreting the findings and discussing the limitations of the research.<br/><br/>This master thesis is the result of a joint graduation project in partial fulfilment of my masters in Architecture and Science Communication, as part of a double degree master program at Delft University of Technology.

Industries, consumers and the Dutch government feel increased responsibility to tackle barriers to sustainable development. The government is increasing its investments to stimulate consumers to live more sustainably and companies that develop circular products are established. Industry, however, seems to fall behind on this. Engaging in industrial symbiosis could be an easy start for industries to become more sustainable. Not having to adjust their production processes, merely replacing raw materials with residual materials, creates a low threshold. To enhance the environmental performance of industries, the use of industrial symbiosis thus needs to increase.<br/>Research focussed on the development of industrial symbiosis mainly focusses on geographic proximity. By discarding geographic proximity and focussing on regional networks, more opportunities could be spotted and more synergies realized. Especially when this is combined with a bottom-up approach. However, lack in coordination to create these synergies is a huge drawback for IS development according to literature. Establishing a bottom-up facilitation-brokerage network can tackle this issue. Key in this network is the network manager, the private facilitator. Literature shows, however, that a clear approach for a facilitator to develop an industrial symbiosis network is missing. Given the important role of network manager, this strategic policy should be developed.<br/>This study provides an analytical tool which private facilitators can use to support their decision-making in coordinating an industrial symbiosis network. A combination of business process modelling and stage-gate theory have led to the development of a schematic overview and an Excel model. By identifying the processes, the private facilitator needs to consider, he can actively engage in the development of an industrial symbiosis network in the Netherlands. This moves the circular economy forwards.","Industrial Symbiosis; Circular Economy; Business Process Model; Sustainable development; Netherlands; Industrial Ecology; Supply Chain Management; Facilitation-brokerage dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Aggregators could act as intermediary entities to exploit the flexibility potential of small end-users and create value for Distribution System Operators (DSOs) by delivering electric flexibility services that support congestion management. <br/><br/>Aggregator Eneco CrowdNett is planning to commission a pool of households which will have a combined system of solar-PV and residential Battery Energy Storage (BES) units. Next to optimizing the household’s self-consumption, these systems will jointly be able to deliver power to the grid. Therefore, the system as designed by Eneco CrowdNett is used as a case-study during this research. <br/> <br/>This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the value of an Aggregator’s electric flexibility services can be determined for DSOs, without jeopardizing the business case for the Aggregator and the CrowdNett participants themselves. A tool that simulates the behavior of residential BES units connected to the LV distribution grid is developed and tested, followed by a reflection on its usability for other cases. <br/><br/>The system under review in this study is framed as a Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), in which the generation units are represented by CrowdNett’s residential BES units that primarily deliver local service, but can also deliver congestion management services through load shifting. Linear Programming (LP) is considered a useful method to solve the UCP, which is implemented in the modelling software Linny-R. <br/><br/>It can be concluded the value of Eneco CrowdNett’s electric flexibility services for DSOs can not be determined by exclusive using a Unit Commitment model with a LP solver to replicate the behavior of residential BES units located at the LV distribution grid. <br/><br/>The model rather provides a tool to generally assess whether an Aggregator is able to reduce congestions in a given distribution network without jeopardizing her own business case and that of the end-users owning the BES units. The model should be supplied with input data regarding residential demand profiles, PV production profiles and the power capacity of the LV substation before the model output can be compared with the expected costs of grid reinforcements on a case-by-case basis to determine the value for DSOs. <br","Congestion Management; Aggregator; BES; Flexibility; Distribution Grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The highly competitive nature of Formula one makes every team eager to find areas of improvement on their cars. In the case of Scuderia Toro Rosso, it was found that there is a gap to improve performance while driving on kerb stones. Analysis of competitors showed that they can take wider driving lines with more speed. In order to improve this performance, the need for a high fidelity dynamic car model arose. This model can be used to understand the car dynamics, which can be used to choose a better suspension setup.<br/><br/>The baseline model used for this study was developed in MSC.Adams. After a discussion with field experts, two areas of model improvement were identified. In the baseline model, the tire is modeled using a MF-Tire model, where the vertical dynamics was modeled as a single spring and damper. In order to simulate the tire dynamics on kerb stones, a more advanced model is necessary. For this research, FTire was chosen as the best option. The other area of improvement is modeling the compliance of the suspension system. In the baseline model,<br/>all suspension members are modeled as rigid links, without any compliance. To model this compliance, an ’equivalent stiffness’ model was proposed, where all stiffnesses are combined into flexible joints.<br/><br/>To use the FTire model, a set of parameters needs to be found for the Formula one tires. To find these parameters, measurements were done to capture the dynamics of the tire. A method is developed to filter out any rig disturbance, and make the data useful for parameter estimation. The estimation was done using Matlab, with MSC.Adams and FTire in-the-loop, and made use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Comparing the simulated behavior with the measurement showed good correlation for various conditions.<br/><br/>Since every part in the car contains some compliance, modeling and measuring every single part would be an extensive task. In order to reduce the complexity, all compliances are combined into a simplified model. In this simplified model, all compliances are modeled in the joints. A Pattern-Search algorithm in Matlab is used in combination with MSC.Adams to find the joint stiffnesses in such way the model matches measurements of the overall car compliance. <br/><br/>To measure the overall improvement, both models are combined into a full car model. The baseline and proposed model are validated against measured track data. From this compare, it can be concluded that the proposed model shows a significant better correlation on kerb simulations. This is mainly due to the fact that the baseline tire model is not capable of simulating the harsh road input. The proposed model provides a more powerful tool for engineers to better understand the car dynamics, and to find the best suspension setup for<br/>kerb riding.","Formula one; Automotive; Motorsport; Compliance; Tire Dynamics; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-16","","","","","",""

(2015), Raso (2013)). A major advantage of MPC is that multi-variate system dynamics and constraints of the control problem can be explicitly incorporated in the method. Challenges for application to reservoir systems include nonlinearities in the system dynamics and objectives and the large-scale optimization problem that arise when dealing with large systems (Lin and Rutten, 2016).<br/><br/>In this research a two-stage MPC method is presented for the optimal operation of a system of 21 reservoirs for hydropower, irrigation and flood management. The two-stage approach divides the problem into subproblems using the structure of the dynamical system (parallel connection of the reservoirs to the river) and periodicity of the external disturbances to the system (wet season and dry season). This approach reduces computational time for solution of the problem by using a decentralized approach (Christofides et al., 2013) for periods without flood risk, allowing parallel optimization of the reservoirs. In periods with flood risk, a coordinated MPC approach (Rawlings and Stewart, 2007) reduces the size of the problem while optimizing for the system-wide objective to mitigate flood. Spillway dynamics were defined by a complementarity constraint and included in the objective function using the penalty method (Pecci et al., 2017). Results showed appropriate behavior of the flows through the spillways. The main challenges for solving the nonlinear optimization problem were the scaling of the problem, the normalization of terms in the objective function, determination of appropriate penalties for the spillway constraint and the increasing size of the problem for longer optimization horizons.<br/><br/>The method was applied to a system in the Sittaung river basin, which suffers from frequent floodings (Rest, 2015). Results showed that trade-offs between irrigation, hydropower and flood mitigation for this basin are limited. The main limitation for flood mitigation by the reservoir system are the conduit capacities and optimization horizon of the MPC system. Results for the case study were promising and indicate clear directions for future research and necessary steps to be taken for practical implementation of a MPC system in the Sittaung river basin.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before successful implementation in clinical setting, it is key to evaluate the long-term reproducibility of the functional connectivity profiles. To this end, the reproducibility of rs-fMRI data is studied in this work. The main research question revolves around the improvement of the overall reproducibility by selectively omitting single components (either nodes or elements) from BOLD rs-fMRI connectivity matrices (CM’s). The scans of the subjects are parcellated using four different schemes, which are all analysed throughout this work. A reproducibility study is carried out on a dataset of 37 subjects that are scanned twice within 2 weeks on average. The inter-subject intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is used to quantify component reproducibility within the dataset. An algorithm is designed to quantify which component has the lowest inter-subject ICC, which is then eliminated from all CM’s in the dataset. After every single component elimination, the intra-subject ICC is computed for every subject to quantify the reproducibility, and a matching accuracy (MA) test is performed on the set to quantify the distinctive power of the CM’s.<br/><br/>The order in which components are eliminated and its effect on the overall reproducibility is tested by applying this to a larger test set of longitudinal data. To this end, a dataset of 521 subjects is used to quantify the reproducibility of the CM’s after iteratively removing components in the order that is found in the reproducibility study. This larger dataset of 521 subjects is analysed, along with 4 subsets, namely: sex based, age based, interscan time based and based on the grounds for exclusion. The latter is a subset where the quality of the rs-fMRI scans could not be assured due to pathologies or excessive motion during image acquisition. No significant difference is found within the sex-based subsets, and no relation between the reproducibility and the interscan time (within the range that is assessed in this work, namely 5 years) is found. Significantly lower intra-subject ICC’s are found for the subjects whose scan quality was subpar, due to excessive motion or pathology. For the age-based subset analysis, it is reported that reproducibility decreases with age.<br/><br/>The node removal algorithm clearly outperforms the element removal algorithm when looking at the intra-subject ICC. As the element removal algorithm can increase the intra-subject ICC by roughly 0.1, whereas the node removal algorithm manages to increase the intra-subject ICC of roughly 0.3. The MA, which is used as to quantify the distinguishing power between various CM’s, is seen to increase from 82.4% to the maximum of 98.7% correctly matched subjects for the RSS100 parcellation scheme within the reproducibility study. Aside from the element removal within the reproducibility study, the matching accuracy is not improved for any of the other analyses. The component elimination algorithm can increase the intra-subject ICC’s of the subjects of the longitudinal set. The MA is not found to increase with the component elimination algorithm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Baker, Murphy, &amp; Fisher, 2008) and better collaboration within project teams lead to more successful projects (Hoegl &amp; Gemuenden, 2001). Hence, proper collaboration within project teams is of high importance to the successful outcome of a project. However, in a considerable number of projects in the engineering industry, collaboration is not optimal. Communication and knowledge sharing are both aspects of collaboration that often lack in teams in the engineering industry (Humpfrey, Ma, Qi, &amp; Wang, 2008). This leads to unbalanced team dynamics and demotivated project team members. Moreover, in complicated and innovative projects, project complexity often makes it challenging to precisely determine the outcome of a project. Clients assume to know upfront what they require, however, along with growth and innovation within the design, the clients often adapt their expectations and thereby requirements with it. Adapting these requirements during later stages of traditionally managed projects often leads to budget overruns, time delays and reduced productivity of the employees (Ibbs, 2012). These problems can be partially attributed to the characteristic of traditional project management of freezing the requirements at the start of the project. This management methodology is not designed to unfreeze and adapt the requirements at later stages. Abovementioned problems of collaboration and requirements management have led to the introduction of agile project management (APM) in the software development industry (AgileAlliance, 2001). APM aims at value creation rather than freezing project design at early stages and by means of better communication, collaboration is improved as well.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It is concluded that the theory is correct in qualitatively describing the phenomena driving the steering behavior of the kite. It is also concluded that the proposed system can contribute to a more streamlined design process for energy producing kites.","kites; steering; turning; kitepower; airborne wind energy; wind energy; experimental; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.059753, 4.204490"

(mentor); Sakes, A. (graduation committee); Spronck, J.W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Background: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a surgical procedure which is characterized by inserting long and slender instruments through small porthole incisions. On many occasions tissue will have to be extracted from the operation site through one of these small portholes, therefore the sheaths of the instruments that are inserted into the body are limited in diameter. Less than optimal functioning of the transport of tissues which occurs within currently available transport mechanisms in laparoscopic instruments can be attributed to the selected method of transport, i.e.: aspiration (also commonly known as suction). The combination of modes of less-than-optimal functioning are referred to within this report as sub-optimal transport behaviour. The different modes of sub-optimal behavior limit the transport rate and the reliability with which the tissue can be extracted. <br/>Methods: An analysis of the modes of sub-optimal behavior was used to formulate a list of qualitative and quantitative functional requirements which were used in order to produce several conceptual solutions. These conceptual solutions were subsequently divided into categories which are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (the ACCREx method). The most promising conceptual solution was developed into a prototype and is based on the egg-laying needle in insects. The prototype was subsequently subjected to a test procedure in order to determine if it was able to transport tissue and to investigate several factors which may influence the transport rate. The effects of the gelatin mixture density, particle presence, motion sequence were assessed in several sub-experiments. In addition, minced meat was transported in order to accurately mimic morcellated tissue.<br/>Results: From the results of Sub-experiment I it can be concluded that there was a statistically significant difference in inverted transport rate between the different batches of pure gelatin artificial tissue mimicking material. The highest ITR was attributed to mixture D2. From the results of Sub-experiment I it was also concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in inverted transport rate between the different batches of grainy gelatin artificial tissue mimicking material. The addition of particles was not statistically significant. Statistical analysis between the hexasected motion sequence (DH2) and trisected motion sequence (DT2) show that there was no significant difference in inverted transport rates. Sub-experiment III shows that the prototype was able to transport compacted minced meat. <br/>Conclusion: The prototype has shown that the friction-based transport principle has the potential of becoming a viable and reliable alternative to suction as a transport method within laparoscopic instruments. Future work should be directed towards improving the speed with which transport occurs, to investigate what improvements can be made to increase the reliability and the development of the proof-of-principle prototype into a fully functional medical device.<br/><br","Laparoscopic; Transport Mechanism; Friction-based; Biological Inspiration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-14","","","","","",""

In fractured reservoirs, fractures are often treated as parallel (smooth) plates, between which the flow is assumed to be steady state fully developed, with no-slip boundary condition. Under these assumptions, the Darcy law is employed inside fractures with permeability (Kf ) as a quadratic function of aperture (a), i.e., Kf = a2/12. Although this model is a rough simplification of real rock fractures, it is still widely used in subsurface flow<br/>modelling. <br/>This study aims to investigate the validity range of the so-called local cubic law (LCL) by using a Darcy-Stokes-Brinkman model in which a unified formulation describes the Stokes flow in the free-flow sub-domain and Darcy flow in the porous sub-domain. Two simulation strategies are developed: a sequentially coupled approach, and a fully coupled approach. The nonlinear velocity profiles inside the free flow require enough grid resolution to be captured. As such, the grid resolution sensitivity is presented. More importantly, the permeability contrast between the two media is found to be an important factor for the applicability of the LCL (Darcy-Darcy) approach. A threshold of 10−7 is found, below which the difference between the two modelling approaches is negligible, and above which the LCL model no longer provide reasonable results.","brinkman; Porous Media; fractured reservoir; reservoir simulation; Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, efforts still have not led to sustainable economic development. Scholars are arguing that new policies should be developed that build forth on existing values and institutions, instead of working against it. For this reason, this research is developed a qualitative research project that investigates the behaviours and strategies exercised by local entrepreneurs in Tanzania in light of the socio-cultural and economic context. It will therefore answer the research question:<br/><br/>How are SMEs operating in the technology industries dealing with the socio-cultural and economic demands originating from the Tanzanian business environment?<br/><br/>Tanzania is transforming from a traditional system that includes traditional socio-cultural and economic values and institutions, towards a modern system including more modern values and institutions. A clear distinction between the two systems has thus been proposed, where practices that are value- and institutional laden are identified and classified over these systems and the levels of the company, the civil society and the state. A total of 16 cases were developed of SMEs operating in the tech-industries by interviewing managing directors and senior managers, as well as making observations, which were consequently cross-analysed. This led to the development of a model that contain the values and institutions across the aforementioned levels and systems.<br/>The main findings include that Tanzanian businesses tend to be hierarchical, are socio-culturally connected to informal ties including reciprocities, have a fatalistic attitude to production controls and rules, and have a synchronic time management. Supply chains are compartmentalised with little cooperation, coordination, information sharing and suggestions for innovations. In addition, due to the prevailing copying behaviour of many entrepreneurs, markets are characterised as either being very competitive with little to no product differentiation, or as being severely underdeveloped. The institutional environment remains unfavourable, where regulatory compliance is often time-consuming and expensive due to the bureaucratic systems. In addition, a combination of bureaucracy, weak law enforcement and a lack of transparency generates an unequal playing field, with unfair competition, privileges and corruption. Entrepreneurs often face a dilemma, where not participating in these practices leads to losing business opportunities. Nonetheless, the ICT sector seems to struggles less with these issues and the companies tend to be more successful.<br/>The amount of the developments happening in Tanzania are tremendous and four of these stood out from the rest. These include a shift towards egalitarian management, a reduction of the social ties, a decrease in corruption and strong market developments. Drivers for these changes include improvements in the institutional surrounding, urbanisation, developments in infrastructure and technologies, and education.<br/>Companies will benefit from implementing teamwork and remuneration policies, balancing social ties, rotate employees over station, implement basic SCM principles, occasionally pay allowance fees, apply to support organisations and have an open debate on more controversial practices.<br","Tanzania; Entrepreneurship; smes; cultural transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was also found that neither of these systems put significant burdens on acceleration-sensitive components, such as the generator and gear box.

This raised questions, namely whether the extra reinforcement is needed, how accurate the EC2 calculates the crack width and what the influence is of the construction height on the crack width?<br/><br/>Are the current rules in the Eurocode 2 for the calculation of flexural cracks too conservative for large thicknesses that are applied in the concrete lining of immersed tunnels?<br/><br/>In this thesis the crack width calculation of the EC2 has been compared with other codes around the world. When these codes are compared with each other it seemed to be that the EC2 is not conservative in comparison with the other codes, however it does not directly mean that this is true. <br/>To check whether the codes, especially the EC2, are conservative, the codes should be compared with laboratory experiments. Since there is little data of experiments available where the cracks are carefully measured, in particular beams with large thicknesses, the finite element program DIANA is used to gain more data sets. A DIANA model is validated with three different experiments with each a different height. <br/><br/>When the EC2 and the DIANA results are compared, a few differences are found. The predicted crack widths in the EC2 are larger than that of the DIANA results. In the EC2 the crack width is the multiplication of the crack strain and crack spacing. If these values are compared, the EC2 gives a smaller crack strain than DIANA and therefore the crack spacing gives an even larger difference than the crack width. Next to that, the influence of the parameters in the EC2 is analysed. In both the EC2 and the DIANA results the cover is the most important parameter for the crack spacing and the steel stress of the reinforcement is the most important parameter for the strain. In all the results there is almost no effect of the construction height visible, except in the crack strain of the DIANA results when the cover is relatively large. A decrease of strain with an increase of height has been detected. <br/><br/>The differences in crack strain can be explained by the fact that the strain in the EC2 is calculated at reinforcement height, but the strain at the outer fibre is needed. In axial loaded cases these strains are the same, but in cases where the cracks appear due to bending moments, which is the case in this thesis, the strain is bigger at outer fibre. Next to that it seemed that influence factors used in the crack spacing calculation are overestimated, but no clear reason is found for this result.<br","Crack width; Eurocode 2; Tunnels; Thick structures; concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The three-dimensional liquid-gas interfacial profile is quantitatively reconstructed using the laser induced fluorescence technique. The waves observed had higher surface steepness at the front when compared with the back of the wave crest. The film thickness at the back of the wave crest is higher than at the front, resembling the streak-like waves observed in the literature for low-viscosity liquids (Ka in the order of 1000) at comparable Re. When the lateral surfaces of the waves are in contact, merging in the transverse direction is observed. The experimentally determined mean film thickness was approximately 15 % lower than the Nusselt’s flat film thickness, while the experimental values of average wave velocity was approximately 4 times higher than the Nusselt’s velocity for the corresponding film thickness. On the time-averaged film thickness field, a transverse variation in the film thickness, called as ridges and valleys, were observed. These transverse variations are found to be unsteady in their behaviour.

(mentor); Geerlings, Harry (graduation committee); Vloemans, PH (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Reefers are refrigerated containers commonly used for transporting perishable goods such as meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Due to the growth in reefer usage, energy consumption of reefers at container terminals grows significantly to 40% of the total energy consumption at terminals. When reefers are connected to the electricity grid, peaks in energy consumption can lead to high costs. A specific grid capacity is reserved for the container terminal, exceeding the reserved capacity will result in high energy costs. Therefore, reducing peak energy consumptions of reefers at container terminals will reduce energy costs and reduce the carbon footprint of reefer transport.<br/><br/>Previous research has taken highly technical views on the problem. Refrigeration and insulation techniques research result in efficient reefers, but innovations in this area seem to reduce. However, Lukasse et al. (2013); Barzin et al. (2015. 2016) have shown that advanced control systems can reduce the energy consumption of individual reefers significantly. More recent and promising studies of van Duin (2016) focus on the broader picture of multiple reefers connected simultaneously at the container terminal. Filina and Filin (2008) have taken a process-based view by investigating factors that lead to power-out moments within the supply chain. Meanwhile, the root-cause of energy consumptions remains un-researched. <br/><br/>A sequential multiple regression analysis with backwards feature selection is performed. A model is found in which the number of arriving reefers, dwell time, plug-in temperature, insulation value, and cargo type are found to be significant. The developed model shows that the number of arriving reefers explains 76,6% of the variance, dwell time 4,6%, cargo type 1,1%, thermal insulation 0,3% and the delta plug-in temperature 0,4%.<br/><br/>Finally, an improvement for the dwell time is developed as this produces the highest yield. It is suggested that long stay reefers can only be targeted if the revenue of the container terminal does not reduce. Therefore, two Revenue Management schemes are proposed: a complex dynamic pricing scheme and peak pricing. Dynamic pricing requires fixed capacity, perfect knowledge of demand, and price sensitivity. Peak pricing scheme is less fine-tuned and does not require perfect demand knowledge. Additionally, price sensitivity is not a requirement when using peak pricing as the peak price an incentive for fast collection of the reefer. Considering the perfect demand knowledge requirement, it is attempted to predict the energy consumption using only data known to the terminal prior to the ships arrival. Using a neural network, it is attempted to predict the dwell time with the purpose of using this in the energy consumption model. The neural network has shown that the dwell time cannot be predicted with the available data. This reduces the prediction accuracy of the model. Additionally, Dutch importers of perishable goods indicate that demand is not price-sensitive. Therefore, a peak pricing scheme is advised to provide an incentive reduce the dwell time. An effective implementation of peak pricing provides 5,5% to 11,6% reduction in energy consumption. Estimations show that the energy reduction is achieved without decreasing revenue of the terminal.<br","Reefer; Energy consumption; SIx-sigma; Root cause analysis; Improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Seemingly, there are societal concerns regarding the impact of SGSs, which underlie ethical values. Due to a lack of understanding and thus consideration of public values in the design of SGSs, these emerging innovations are not adopted on a large-scale yet. This research project argues that public values can be acknowledged as relevant factors (i.e. social barriers and drivers) for the adoption of smart grid technologies. As such, contestation of public values might lead to deadlock of technology implementation. This thesis aims to provide insights about ethical values that can be associated with SGSs. For this purpose, a literature review is carried out related to this topic in order to identify and conceptualise values at stake for smart grids and their related technologies. Thereafter, a qualitative content analysis of the British public debate on SGSs (assumed to be represented by national newspaper reports) is carried out in order to empirically uncover the normative stances (i.e. ethical values) of smart grid stakeholders and how those values are related. The result is a network of related values and conceptualisations. This network can be used by the energy industry and policy-makers to tackle challenges in designing for values in SGSs, from both a technical and institutional perspective. As a result, ethically and socially better energy systems can be reached. Additionally, the findings serve as a basis for future research regarding the relative importance of the identified values, the dynamics of the public debate, translation of values into design requirements, and to expand value sensitive design into the energy domain through case studies on SGSs in different countries.","smart grid systems; value sensitive design; ethical values; content analysis; technology adoption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The study on head support for watching IFE in a slouched posture resulted in a scientific publication in Applied Ergonomics. Further research and development is proposed of a premium economy headrest supporting for sleeping with a limited recline and head-neck support for watching IFE in premium cabins. In addition, the exploration of a highly personalised BC bed-seat is advised.<br/><br/>Sleeping full-flat in BC<br/>The earlier mentioned focus on headrest design is less applicable on BC sleep. Here the focus should be on overall bed design and control features. Nevertheless, as new generation BC seats provide full flat sleeping capabilities, it is advised to level the headrest with the backrest when in full-flat mode (becoming a part of the mattress surface area) and provide a separate pillow based on the passengers choice. This gives passengers more freedom of posture and approximates the conditions passengers are used to at home, which is important to sleep quality. Also disturbing factors should be minimised as much as possible. This includes cabin services and belt checks. <br/>One of the challenges BC passengers face is the lack of control over their own activities and environment within the cabin. A BC bed-seating concept is proposed which includes personal flight scheduling features, which gives BC passengers the option to opt in or out of services and schedule their own activities. Their choices will be communicated by displays outside the seat (e.g. non-disturb and seatbelt on sign) and in the galley. In addition, automated seatbelt checks prevent flight attendants (FA's) to wake BC passengers. This can improve passenger's sense of control and prevent unwanted disturbance by cabin crew. <br/>In search of improving the bed-seat experience, it was found that the firmness per area of the seat should be adjusted according to the taken posture for proper support. When seated, firm support is needed at the pelvis region, as most of the body weight can be carried here. When sleeping lateral, that same area should soft, to allow the pelvis to sink for a straight alignment of the spine. In addition, anthropometric differences and preferences (e.g. firmness) require personal optimised support. Exploration of a bed-seat that can actively adapt to the taken posture by and anthropometrics of the passenger is advised.<br/><br/>Sleeping with limited recline in PEC <br/>Sleeping with limited recline in PEC is challenging. Muscles relax when entering deep sleep, which causes the head slide, nod and fall. This triggers the sleep-wake system, waking up the passenger. Without adequate support of the head passengers will not be able to have a qualitative sleep, as they will not go trough deep sleep and REM cycles (which account for physical and mental recovery respectively). Two headrest designs are proposed which support the head by a jaw line on the side ‘wings’, as the load of the head can be carried here and prevent the head to fall and nod. One design iterates on existing headrests, requiring the addition of two rotational hinges and jaw-line support on the ‘wings’, allowing it to create a ‘bowl shape’ the head can rest in. Implementation might be relative simple, but further prototyping is advised. The other design is more radical, as it articulates sideways following natural movement of the head during sleep. When going sideways (over the Z-axis), the headrest turns (over the Y-axis) ’catching’ the head, preventing it of falling down. The mechanics to articulate this headrest are more challenging and require further research and development.<br/><br/>Watching IFE in premium cabins<br/>People prefer to watch IFE and TV in a slouched posture (reclined backrest and leg support), as is possible in premium cabins like BC and PEC. In current aircraft seats passengers lack head/neck support, as they flex their head forward to have a perpendicular view on the IFE screen. Prolonged contraction of the neck and eye muscles to sustain view on the IFE screen (e.g. during multiple movies) may fatigue the muscles, lead to pains and discomfort. Pillows offered in premium cabins may offer some support, but – depending on the thickness and material – may be insufficient. The scientific study in this thesis shows that head support improves the ‘expected comfort’ and may lower muscle tension in the neck as shown in an AnyBody™ simulation. This was however not validated by an EMG study, which showed no difference in major flexion and extension neck muscles. The discovery was that humans search for a neutral posture, with minimal strain on the musculoskeletal system. This could explain the lack of a significant difference. However, further research on the long-term (dis)comfort is advised. Nevertheless, a proposed design of a forward tilting headrest based on a simple friction hinge may be an interesting solution to improve passenger comfort when watching IFE. <br/><br/>This master thesis thus shows that through headrest design comfort of premium aircraft passengers can be improved for watching IFE and sleeping with limited recline. Aircraft seat manufacturers are therefore advised to further research and develop proposed headrest designs, as current headrest are insufficient and/or underexposed in seat design.","Aircraft; Seat; IFE; Sleep; Headrest; Business Class; Premium Economy Class; EMG; Comfort; Posture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The cross-section geometry of the beam can be optimized using structural optimization techniques, such as size, shape or topology optimization.<br/>The proposed 3D beam is partially based on the formulation of the classical beam element for slender beams (Euler-Bernoulli), including Saint-Venant torsional effects for isotropic materials, and with the addition of the terms related with the coupling between axial and torsion, and bending and torsion contributions, which may arise when using non-linear materials.<br/>The stiffness information of the beam is interpolated from its cross-section geometries and materials, which can vary along the beam length.<br/>The cross-section geometries are defined on a XFEM mesh. The fluid and solid domains are specified using a Level Set Function. This provides a smooth geometry and crisp representation of the solid/fluid interface without the necessity of re-meshing, as in the case of classical FEM. A 2D fluid simulation based on Incompressible Navier Stokes flow at low Reynolds number is carried around each cross-section, in order to obtain the aerodynamic loading over its contour. This aerodynamic loading serves as an input for the beam model, to compute deformation of the beam. This deformation is mapped onto the cross-sections, obtaining the updated displacements and rotations of the geometry. With the updated geometry the fluid field is altered and it needs to be updated as well, forming a non-linear iterative process that loops until a converged structure is obtained.<br/>The 3D FSI model is solved on a monolithic Newton-Raphson solver that treats all the equations involved at once. The Jacobian terms derived for the monolithic solving scheme that has been developed for the forward analysis allow a straightforward computation of the sensitivities using adjoint method. This sensitivity analysis makes possible the optimization of the geometry of the cross-sections based on certain criteria and constraints.","3D Beam; FSI; XFEM; Level Set Method; Sensitivity Analysis; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

An example of its growing importance is the recent development of autonomous driving solutions that is been carried out by most of the world leader car makers.<br/>A common aspect of such applications is the need of involving cooperation with other agents, that might be robots or humans, in order to accomplish the given task. Therefore, having at our disposal effective models that accurately predicts other agents actions becomes crucial in this context.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is the design of a cooperative motion planning algorithm that comprises a series of required features in order to be employed in an autonomous navigation scheme. Among these features, we will focus on the ability to reason about neighboring agents and static obstacles, including observable information from other agents and characteristic data of the ego agent, and performing multi-hypothesis estimates.<br/>In this work, we have chosen the task of navigating through human crowds in complex environments. Therefore, our goal consists in designing a cooperative motion planning algorithm capable of modeling human motion behavior, including the earlier mentioned characteristics.<br/><br/>The developed approach is an extension of a current state-of-the-art method designed by Alexandre Alahi, known as Social LSTM.<br/>This algorithm is composed by an artificial neural network that captures cooperative motion behavior by sharing information of the neighboring agents latent representations, and returns unimodal stochastic estimations of the future positions of the agents. This baseline method is going to be extended in order to include the missing mentioned qualities that are desired in a path prediction model within the context of autonomous navigation. <br/><br/>These extensions are implemented through simulations of crowded environments in complex scenarios by using the open source crowd simulator Pedsim. The generated datasets, together with some real world recorded scenarios from public datasets, allowed us to test the presented algorithms in order to tune the corresponding hyperparameters of the neural network and design the different employed network architectures. Due to the lack of an official code implementation of the Social LSTM from Alexandre Alahi, it has been considering, as starting point, the Social LSTM implementation publicly available from Anirudh Vemula.<br/><br/>In the presented results can be observed how the mentioned characteristics included in the path prediction model increases the inference accuracy of future trajectory distributions, evaluated using the obtained log-likelihood. This increment of the performance is translated into a 45% increase of the log-likelihood value in comparison with the Social LSTM baseline model in the evaluated datasets.<br/>These results indicate that the studied state-of-the-art path prediction methods, like the mentioned Social LSTM trained over datasets containing simple scenarios have a large margin of improvement when executed in more realistic situations.<br/>In following works, the implemented contributions together with some proposed future works might be employed to raise the performance of autonomous navigation algorithms in real-world environments.","Neural Networks; path prediction; cooperative planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Parties, such as consumers and government agencies, have shown an increase in demand for information regarding their products and materials. Studies throughout the last few years have proposed approaches for a traceability system for supply chains. These systems employ either a centralized or decentralized network to overcome the trust concern present in supply chains.Although there exist numerous frameworks for traceability solutions, these frameworks failed to address the concerns with regards to privacy-sensitive information, certificate verifiability, and auditability. <br/><br/>In this research, we aim to improve the existing solutions and address the aforementioned concerns, where we decompose the concerns into four aspects. First, we analyze the appliance of blockchain technology for a decentralized traceability system. Next, we analyze possible anonymization techniques to preserve the privacy concerning the identity and the corresponding relationships of actors. Then, cryptographic primitives are examined to prove the ownership of a certificate, in a privacy-preserving manner. Finally, a technique is required to realize product-specific auditability for supply chains.<br/><br/>We propose two systems to the concerns mentioned above. For the former, we propose TRADE, a fully transparent and decentralized traceability system. The system shows that blockchain technology can be successfully incorporated to achieve traceability in supply chains. Moreover, consumers and other parties can view all the data in the system and verify the claims of actors on the products. Positive brand-image is gained by the latter. The second system, DECOUPLES, is the first decentralized, unlinkable and privacy-preserving traceability system for supply chains. The system incorporates cryptographic techniques to address the privacy, certificate verifiability, and auditability concerns. In addition, we propose the PASTA protocol, which allows unique tracking keys per product, per actor. The protocol also anonymizes the receiver of a transaction. Moreover, cryptographic primitives are used for actors to prove the ownership of a certificate without revealing privacy-sensitive and linkable information. Our complexity analysis and proof-of-concept implementation results show that DECOUPLES is a feasible and practical traceability system for supply chains, that benefits both the included business as well as the end-client.","Blockchain; Decentralized network; Confidentiality; Privacy-preserving; Anonymization; Auditability; Supply chain; Cryptography; Traceability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Reinders, K.J. (mentor); Broere, W. (graduation committee); Kloosterman, Jan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In 2009 and 2010, two leakages through immersion joints occurred in the First Coen Tunnel near Amsterdam. From the study on t-he cause of these leakages, it followed that there was a potential problem for existing immersed tunnels: failure of the temporary Gina-seal combined with corrosion on the clamping structure of the definitive Omega-seal. It is unknown whether the immersion joints of existing immersed tunnels in the Netherlands will still function during the remaining design lifetime. There is lack of calculations on the governing watertight parts (Gina-seal and Omega-seal) in immersion joints. The main goal of this research is to become both qualitative and quantitative insight into the watertightness of existing Gina-seals and Omega-seals in immersed tunnels. It is applied to the Kil Tunnel (case study).<br/><br/>Leakage through immersion joints can only take place when both the Gina-seal and the Omega-seal fail. The Gina-seal consists of a rubber gasket (the Gina-gasket) and a clamping structure that connects the Gina-gasket with the tunnel element. It can fail due to widening of the joint (due to seasonal temperature changes) combined with relaxa-tion, increased soil pressure and differential movements of the tunnel elements. The Omega-seal consists of a rubber gasket (the Omega-gasket) and a structure that connects the flange of the Omega-gasket with both tunnel elements (the clamping structure). It can fail if the clamping structure is affected by differential movements, relaxation, corrosion and widening of the joint (due to seasonal temperature changes).<br/><br/>The Kil Tunnel (case study, finished in 1977, below Dordtsche Kil) consists of 3 tunnel elements, so it has 3 immersion joints (1A, 2E and 3A). Immersion joint 1A and 2E connect the tunnel to both abutments and are exactly the same. Immersion joint 3A connects two tunnel elements to each other. The Gina-seal and the Omega-seal are slightly different for 1A/2E and 3A.<br/><br/>The Gina-seal has to meet several requirements in order to be watertight. The result of the case study on the Gina-seal in the Kil Tunnel is the following:<br/>- Joint 1A/2E may not meet Requirement G2 roof (Force equilibrium in the roof). This check requires attention. Therefore, it is recommended to do visual inspections in the roof of joint 1A/2E. All the other requirements are met with large margins.<br/>- Joint 3A meets all requirements with large margins. It is expected that this Gina-seal fulfils its function over the entire lifetime.<br/>- It is recommended to measure the value of maximum difference between winter and summer of the immersion joint in longitudinal direction (Δx) in all immersion joints.<br/><br/>The Omega-seal has to meet several requirements in order to be watertight. The result of the case study on the Omega-seal in the Kil Tunnel is the following:<br/>- The compression of the flange of the Omega-gasket (cO) determines strongly whether the requirements on watertightness are met. When the compression of the flange of the Omega-gasket is smaller than 5 mm, the requirements are not met. This means that leakages through the immersion joint can occur. It is recommended to measure this value.<br/>- The maximum allowed penetration depth of the corrosion is 2 mm of the core of the bolt. If this value is exceeded, the functioning of the bolt is not guaranteed anymore. It is recommended to remove a bolt at the “splash zone” in order to see how far the corrosion has penetrated the bolt. Besides, it must be checked whether the corrosion is an on-going process.<br/>- When one bolt fails, the clamping plate will deform. As a result the forces on the adjacent bolts will be lower. It depends on the state of the bolt whether this is able to take the loads. This will determine whether the ‘zipper effect’ will occur.<br/><br/>This study has created a theoretical description of the state of existing Gina-seals and Omega-seals. However, visual inspections and measurements are also needed to judge whether the seals will function during the remaining lifetime.","Immersed tunnels; Maintenance; Immersion joints; Gina gasket seal; Omega gasket seal; Kil Tunnel; COB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Visser, K. (graduation committee); Pecnik, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The time a naval combatant can be deployed for a mission is limited by its dependency on supplies. At a certain point the ship needs to leave the area of operations to be replenished in a harbour or by a support ship. Moreover, the Royal Netherlands Navy has a societal obligation to reduce its environmental impact, in particular on global warming. Therefore, the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) wants to reduce the fossil fuel dependency of its fleet significantly [50]. One of the methods to reduce fossil fuel dependency of ships is to reduce their energy requirement. <br/>The operational profile of fast naval combatants for the RNLN requires that the ships operate on the diesel engines for 90 percent of the time, often in part load. In part load, the turbocharger cannot supply the engine with the right amount of charge air. This results in a limited operating envelope for the diesel engine, and a decreased efficiency in part load. This is caused by the matching of a turbocharger, which is a compromise between high efficiency in the design point, and off design performance. However, in part load, advanced charge air configurations can potentially resolve this and improve the results as shown by Grimmelius et al. [15] and Zhang et al. [56]<br/>This study investigates the effect of advanced charge air configurations on the efficiency and acceleration performance of diesel engines in hybrid configurations aboard fast naval combatants. First, two mean value first principle diesel engine models based on the work of Geertsma et al. [12] were used to model the diesel engine. Next, the models were partly validated with ship data. We found that an approach using compressor maps and a motion based turbocharger model was most accurate. Then, a parallel-sequential turbocharger and a hybrid electric turbocharger were incorporated into the model. A hybrid turbocharger is a turbocharger with an electric machine coupled to the turbocharger shaft. The electric machine can increase the turbocharger speed to boost the charge air pressure in motor mode. Also, in generator mode excessive power from the turbocharger shaft can be taken out and utilized elsewhere. It was concluded that the application of advanced charge air configurations can significantly improve the engine efficiency in part load. For example, in a diesel hybrid propulsion configuration with power take-off this can lead to an efficiency increase of almost 10% at 20% load in comparison with a single charged engine. Furthermore, hybrid turbocharging enables extending the operating envelope of a parallel-sequential turbocharged engine with up to 25% at 60% engine speed. This enables the engine to deliver constant torque from 600 to 1000 rpm. With these concepts therefore, both improved efficiency and improved acceleration performance can be achieved.<br","Turbocharger; Diesel engine; Naval Combatant; Hybrid; Efficiency; Performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

In order to become more resilient, organizations need to shift from an efficiency focus to a learning focus. If everyone in an organization or ecosystem learns faster from experiences, the collective performance and innovative capabilities will increase more rapidly. The necessity to learn and personally develop continuously is also recognized by individuals to cope with changing roles and to ensure sustainable employability. Learning Agility (the ability to develop new effective behavior quickly and flexibly based on new experiences) can play an important role in increasing people’s change readiness and innovative behavior. It accelerates learning and gives direction to the development of an individual, by providing insight in his or her learning potential. Fundamental for developing learning agile behavior is Self-Awareness: if you know your strengths and weaknesses, you know where to begin in your development. This is where ReflAction comes in. ReflAction is an application that allows employees to add scores to the activities they engage in that actually contribute to achieving their personal learning goals. A goal is achieved when a self-defined number of positive scores is met, for which also the needed time is kept. Through this simple input, employees can see where they learn from, what they could to do to optimalize their learning and how they progress in their learning goals over time. The organization receives valuable data on e.g. people’s learning preferences, speed and taken approaches to learn a goal, which could enable providing employees with a more personalized learning experience.<br/>By triggering reflection moments to evaluate the learning value of what you do during a day and getting provided insight on where you learn from and how this relates to your progression and performance, people could increase their Self-Awareness and accelerate learning. A Learning Agility profile is established over time through the variety of activities you learn from and the speed in achieving goals. Consequently, by promoting tips, suggestions and micro learnings based on the user’s input data, the organization can not only support people with their learning goals, but moreover evoke explorative behavior and take people out of their comfort zone, in order to experience (and learn) more. Besides a step towards a better intergration of working and learning, the input data indicating learning (agile) behavior could support strategic decision making concerning human capital and retention as well.<br/><br","Learning Agility; Deloitte; Reflection; Self-Awareness; Data; App; Learning; Design; Service Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","The smart use of big data (Deloitte Innovation/IDE)",""

The liver model and surroundings are made from water-based solution with polyvinylalcohol (PVA). The liver model and surroundings are made of 6%m, 4%m PVA with 2 and 3 freeze thaw cycles, respectively. The rigid structures, i.e. vertebrae and ribs, are made of a flexible polymer.

Preliminary results of the reproduced motion in the liver model are 20.7, 10.8 and 6.7 mm in CC, AP and LR direction, respectively. Further, the phantom allows both subcostal and intercostal ultrasound needle guidance. The liver model is designed to simulate diseased tissue. From Fibroscan measurements, the livermodel is characterizedwith an elastic modulus of 24.0(±8.0) kPa. Further, the liver model shows median higher axial needle friction forces (0.0374 N/mm) compared to healthy liver tissue (0.01108<br/>N/mm). Furthermore, tactile feedback on the liver model is obtained from a liver surgeon, dr. W. Polak, whom graded the liver model with fibrosis scale 2.

As a result, during the past few years, Oasen started to research a new treatment concept based on 100% reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration to provide an excellent barrier for organic micro pollutants. However, the water produced by the RO membranes, called permeate, is corrosive, bitter in taste and does not comply with the drinking water regulation standards in the Netherlands. Therefore, a certain degree of remineralisation is crucial to solve these problems and improve the water quality. A commonly used remineralisation process is to filter the desalinated water through a calcite contactor, providing the appropriate amount of bicarbonate and calcium in the water. In order to properly design and operate the calcite filters as well as to predict the final water quality, it is essential to understand the processes that occur in the filter. <br/>The aim of this study was to find the best kinetic calcite dissolution model in order to understand the calcite grains dissolution behavior inside the filter and subsequently to adequately design and operate the calcite filter. Therefore, extensive pilot research was conducted to investigate the effect of various parameters on calcite dissolution such as the calcite grain size, velocity and carbon dioxide concentration. On top of that, the dissolution was modelled based on a successful empirical expression given by Yamauchi et al. (1987). However, it was found that the effect of the flow rate on the diffusion boundary layer around the calcite grains has not been taken into account in the study carried out by Yamauchi et al. (1987). Therefore, the effect of velocity on the calcite dissolution coefficient was investigated at five different velocity ,i.e., 5, 10,15,20,30 m/h. From there, a function was developed to describe the correlation between flow rate and the dissolution rate coefficient. In order to calculate the equilibrium concentration, the chemical reactions were simulated using PhreeqPython (Phreeqc built in Python).<br/>The main difference of this study compare to previous investigations was the low temperature of the water (12 oC vs 22-40 oC) and the smaller grain size of the calcite (0.5-1.2 mm vs 1-2 and 2-3mm) which was tested. Besides that a high range of CO2 dosing (1.45- 9.5 mmol/l) was tested. As expected from theory, the dissolution rates was strongly affected by the varied parameters. It is concluded that the smaller grain size of 0.5-1.2 mm reduced the required empty bed contact time (EBCT) to15 min where operating the filter with the larger grain size of 1-2mm needs a minimum EBCT of 25 min to reach calcite equilibrium. The CO2 dosing is recommended to be less than 3 mmol/l, since the CO2 efficiency will drop under the 60% at higher CO2 concentrations. <br/><br/>Eventually, the optimal design will be introduced for the remineralisation process at Oasen treatment plant De Hooge Boom located in Kamerik. For this purpose various operational scenarios were compared on capital and operational cost. The overall cost including, both Capital expenses (CAPEX) and Operational expenses OPEX, was estimated between € 0.048 and 0.064 per m3 for different scenario’s where 71% consists of investment cost. The total treatment cost of this design is 0.057 €/m3 and the investment cost was found to be € 1.351.000 which is 32% less than price estimated by previous study done by Oasen. <br","remineralisation; Post-treatment; calcite filteration; Desalinated water; Modeling; low temperature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Remineralisation",""

Therefore, the critical shear displacement is used as a failure criterion. <br/>The results indicate that digital image correlation is an adequate technique to obtain the refined crack kinematics since it permits to continuously track the evaluation of the crack even an instant before failure.

The objective of this thesis is to design a generic fault detection system for mooring line failures, which can accurately detect a mooring line failure within a certain time frame. The research is done through Catenary Arm Leg Mooring (CALM) buoy systems, as this thesis is a Proof of Concept. Two types of mooring line failures are considered in the XZ-plane, a top segment failure close to the buoy and a bottom segment failure close to the anchor. Both failures characterize themselves by a constant offset in equilibrium position and a changed mooring stiffness. Using theoretic concepts about mooring configurations and waves, it is shown that the shift in equilibrium position has most potential for detecting a mooring line failure. These analysis are verified by hydrodynamic simulations in OrcaFlex. For the bottom segment failure the breaking stage cannot be predicted, as this stage depends on the mooring design, the external loads, and the location of the failure. The focus must lie on what stage the failure becomes detectable, rather than how long it takes. The fault detection algorithm is using a model-based approach for fault detection as a general framework which can be used for any variation in mooring design. Current flows, tankers mooring at the buoy, and non-linear effects of mooring configurations in waves cause a constant offset in position as well. By including measurements of the current flow velocity and the tanker hawser tension as inputs of the CALM buoy model, the fault detection algorithm can distinguish between the sources of the constant offset. Additionally, the non-linear effects of a mooring configuration in waves are for small wave heights not significant and not included in the modeling of the buoy. The mooring tensions and system parameters are introduced as specific parameters per mooring design. Via an Unknown Input Observer (UIO), the two unknown input loads are estimated: the wave load and the residual force. The residual force is chosen to represent the mooring line failure in the model. When there is no mooring line failure this force should be zero. The two unknown input forces are estimated by decoupling them in the frequency domain. Using a shaping filter the wave forces are restricted by a predefined frequency bandwidth. The non-linear effects of a mooring configuration in waves are determining the thresholds for the fault detection algorithm. Therefore, no wave load can be mistaken for a mooring line failure. The load cases show that for small offsets the fault detection algorithm is capable of accurately detecting the mooring line failures. The two unknown forces are decoupled in a way that the residual force can be used as residual for fault detection. The residual signal in RY-direction can be used for fault detection. Additionally, it is shown that no step in position data is required for the algorithm to detect a failure. The answer on the research question, is yes. It is possible to accurately detect to accurately detect a mooring line failure. Since this thesis is only applied for the three Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in the XZ-plane, a six DoF model needs to be investigated in future research. Furthermore, by including the non-linear effects in the modeling of the CALM buoy, higher wave amplitudes could be considered. Another possible way to deal with these non-linear effects is to use adaptive thresholds.","Fault Detection; CALM; SPM; UIO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Currently however, issues with navigable depth in the river mouth (Bocas de Ceniza) make it difficult for the larger vessels to enter the port area. Resolving these issues will increase the navigability of the Magdalena river which in turn will help Barranquilla bloom as a port city. The aim of this research is to analyse the various sedimentation processes and to explore the possibilities for mitigation measures.<br/>In order to gain more insight into the processes which affect the sediment transport in the first 38 km of the Magdalena river a morphological model is developed using Delft3D software. However, to understand and capture the essence of the issue also the socio-political context is researched. This is done by analysing both the stakeholders and the previous unsuccessful Magdalena recovery project. The combination of both the physical and more organisational aspects formed the input to come up with multiple intervention ideas to solve navigability issues. To evaluate these interventions a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is conducted witFh both technical and managerial criteria. Finally, also an engagement plan is constructed as a guideline to have successful stakeholder management in a future river project. <br/>From the exploration of the physical part of the issue it can be concluded that there are both natural and anthropogenic aspects which influence the river system, hence the sedimentation issue. With regard to the natural aspects, high discharge variability, stratification and wave action are selected to be further investigated with the Delft3D model. Model results show that sedimentation and erosion rates increase in the access channel above a discharge of around 5000 m3/s. For discharges below this value, the salt intrusion length increases faster than for higher discharges. This salt intrusion leads to a low flow velocity at the bottom that is directed upstream, making the reach over which salt intrudes susceptible to sedimentation. Waves mainly influence bar formation in the river mouth and are not important further upstream.<br/>The analysis of the non-physical aspects leads to a few important conclusions as well. First of all it is concluded that the stakeholder network, in which this problem exists, is a fairly complex one. Therefore stakeholder and process management are key elements in making a future river project successful. Furthermore hypotheses on the success factors of setting up a public private partnership (PPP) in Colombia are formed based on research by Koppenjan (2003), cultural differences between the Netherlands and Colombia and interviews with important stakeholders. These hypotheses are that corruption, political stability and openness for change are also important factors in setting up a successful PPP in Colombia.<br/>Possible interventions to mitigate the sedimentation issues in the first 38 km of the Magdalena river have been assessed separately for three different sections. For the first section (reaching from 0 km to 8 km), the most promising intervention resulting from the MCA is water injection dredging. This would efficiently improve the navigation conditions, capital investments are relatively low and it is also an adaptable solution. For the next section (from 8 km to 22 km), a fixed bottom layer is considered a promising intervention since it will lead to erosion of the relatively shallow inner bend and therefore increase the navigable width. As for the last section (from 22 km to 30 km) it can be concluded from the MCA that none of the assessed training works score better than the current situation.<br","Río Magdalena; Sedimenation; Delft3D; stakeholder analysis; navigability","en","student report","","","","","","","","2018-08-01","","","","","MP233","11.1, -74.8"

Every year more plastic is produced, a lot of plastic litter is mismanaged and enters the ocean. It’s important to know where these plastics accumulate. With this information the problem can be quantified and the plastic litter can be cleaned up. In this project, the transport of micro plastics will be studied. These are plastic particles with a diameter smaller than 5 mm. <br/><br/>To model micro plastics in an accurate way, it is important to include the physical properties of plastics in a transport model. Plastic particles have an extra upwards buoyancy force in the vertical direction, this force has to be taken into account in the model. Therefore, the two-dimensional vertical behavior of plastic particles is studied in this project. Two common transport models are explored: the advection-diffusion equation and a stochastic random walk model. The properties of plastics are discussed and how the transport models can be adapted to be adequate to model micro plastics.<br/><br/>Micro plastics are assumed as spheres in fluid. With this assumption, the flow regime around a plastic particle is estimated with the Reynolds number. These assumptions make it possible to calculate a terminal buoyancy velocity, due to the floating character of plastic. This velocity is added in the vertical direction to<br/>both transport models. To model the turbulence in the ocean, the eddy diffusivity coefficient is defined. This is a variable that states how turbulent the flow is, it can be described as an enhanced diffusion coefficient. The eddy diffusivity coefficient can be estimated with the model Prandlt defined. Here we used a simplified turbulence model for the tests described. In combination with Delft3D-FM the eddy diffusivity from the turbulence model in there can be used.<br/><br/>Both models are implemented in Matlab. The characteristics of the model match with the expected behavior of floating plastics. Plastic particles will perfectly follow the velocity field, except for the extra vertical velocity. When this term is non-zero, the particles will float. Both models have some limitations in efficiency<br/>for modeling plastic particles. The advection-diffusion equation is not suitable for high concentration gradients. The random walk model is not suitable for big areas or long timescales. The choice between both models is depending on the sort of case that someone wants to model.<br/><br/>This project has been carried out at Deltares, an independent water research institute. At Deltares there is a two-dimensional horizontal model available to model particles in the ocean. In the future the existing model of Deltares and the model in this project could be combined. This combined model can be tested for<br/>real-life situations in the ocean. With this combined model, the physical properties of plastics are included in a three-dimensional particle model.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

In this thesis, particular emphasis is given to wave energy, which can deliver up to 2 TW on a global scale. The aim of this thesis is to optimize the control system of the Symphony Wave Power Device, which is a point absorber, so that the energy that is being delivered to the electrical grid is maximal and the device functions in a stable way. The device is analytically described in terms of structural parts, operating principle and presentation of all the forces that act on the moving part, which is called the floater. The device is in fact a mass-spring-damper system, for which the spring constant needs to be tuned according to the period of the incoming waves, so as to maximize the energy extraction. For this tuning, not only the actual mass of the floater, but also the added equivalent mass due to the inertia of the inner turbine need to be taken into account.<br/>The whole device is modelled with the help of a Matlab/Simulink programme, in which simulations can be performed, to observe the motion and make certain calculations. The already existing PI controller, which makes use of an energy error, is briefly described and the relevant calculations for the energy extraction are presented. The energy losses in the electrical parts also need to be taken into account.<br/>To evaluate the current controller, it is necessary to calculate the upper boundary of the energy that the Symphony can obtain from a certain wave. This is done with the help of the GAMS software. The code, as well as the necessary assumptions and approximations, are presented in a mathematical way. The results, both in numerical and graphical form, provide a good insight as to how the ideal theoretical control system looks like.<br/>Next, simulations are performed in the Matlab programme and comparisons with the GAMS results are made. The essential parts of the controller are tuned to their optimal values. Only a proportional part for the PI controller is needed and the energy should not flow in two directions. <br/>The results show that, with correct tuning of the proportional part, as well as of the spring constant, the Symphony operates very well in all realistic sea states at the location where it will be placed. A high percentage of the theoretical energy boundary is being extracted from the waves and the motion of the floater is close to the optimal pattern. It is thus concluded that the existing controller has a remarkable performance, if regulated correctly. Finally, recommendations for future research on many levels are given.<br","waves; control; oscillation; spring; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-05","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The objective of this research is therefore to (1) conceptual-ize the functioning of circular Product-Service-Systems on an operational level and (2) develop conceptu-al working models that could be used by real estate developers to perform the role of the circular ser-vice provider. <br/><b>Research question: </b>How could a circular service provider interact with service suppliers and customers in order to implement circular Product-Service-Systems in real estate development projects?<br/><b>Methodology:</b> The research process consisted of fours steps. The first step relates to the development of concepts. An explorative literature review and several explorative interviews were conducted within this step. The second step comprehended a systematic literature review in order to gain insight in exist-ing theories. The third steps related to practices, whereby three case studies were conducted and ana-lysed. The fourth step related to the synthesis, hereby theories were built around four business tactics, which in the end led to the generation of a proposition in the form of empirical lessons.<br/><b>Findings: </b>As Product-Service-Systems aim at meeting end-users needs, service value is created over time. This implies that a mindset change within the real estate sector is needed in order to servitise real estate development projects. Organizations in the real estate sector should hereby aim at long-term value creation for customers and collaborate with partners. Actors within the supply chain should opt for equal partnership and form networks of organizations around a specific goal. <br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The role of the service provider is hereby to find the right partnerships and ensure incen-tives will be directed towards thig long-term service delivery. The form and content of these partner-ships is essential in order to implement Product-Service-Systems successfully. The service provider could establish this by using the developed 'Interaction Model'.<br/><b>Limitations:</b> Three case studies from one real estate development company have been analysed as not many servitized project are available. The validity of findings is increased by using different sources of data and research techniques (triangulation).<br","Product-service-System; Service provider; real estate developer; Circular Economy; Servitization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

In recent years it became clear that scarcity of resources, pollution and landfill will make circularity inevitable in the near future.To achieve this major changes should be made in the built environment and the building sector, as the built environment is currently mostly organized in a linear way. This report describes the steps that need to be taken to reach a circular economy, and identifies the main challenges. It is possible to start building more circular already at this moment, but full circularity cannot be guaranteed until the whole market behaves circular. Contracts can play a role to guide the market in this direction by incorporating take or buy back guarantees and maintenance components to create incentives for circularity. Lease or integrated contracts might be the best options to achieve this, but in general all contracts can be used to achieve the first steps to circularity.","Circulair economy; Building sector; Contracting; Assessment; built environment; Sustainability","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A patient's medical data is stored in the systems of the different healthcare professionals that treat or have treated the patient, thus explaining the need for transfer of medical data. In the Netherlands, it is required by law that the patient gives permission for the transfer both to the healthcare professional requesting the medical data and the one providing it before transfer can take place. The law went into effect partially on July 1st, 2017, and has to be fully implemented in three years' time. However, the transfer infrastructure is still in development, resulting in varying and even conflicting communication about the system. This makes it difficult for patients to understand and make the decision about access to their medical data. The aim of this thesis is to facilitate and support patients in making this decision. The patients' decision is influenced by numerous factors, such as their health, their previous experiences with healthcare, their values and their preferences regarding their medical data. The patients' perspective is therefore the focus of this thesis. The research question answered in this thesis is 'How can patients make an informed decision that fits their wishes regarding the accessibility of their medical data?' Contextmapping techniques such as sensitizing packages and personas helped revealing the patients' wishes regarding their medical data and their current experiences with (the transfer of) medical data. Through literature research, decision-making in healthcare was explored, leading to the identification of a combination of informed consent and shared decision making as a fitting approach for communication about the patient's decision. <br/><br/>Following the analysis, a solution was designed, consisting of necessary steps for creating the right context to enable patients to make a decision that fits their wishes about access to their medical data. This included a patient decision aid to concretely facilitate and support the patient during the decision-making process. Previous to consultation, the decision aid prepares patients for a conversation with the healthcare professional. It informs patients about the subject, makes them aware of the fact that the choice is theirs, and encourages them to think about their personal values and preferences. The decision aid enables patients to fit the decision about access to their medical data to their health situations and personal preferences. The design was then evaluated by discussing the patient decision aid with experts from practice, by testing the tool with patients and by using patient decision aid criteria identified in literature. <br","Contextmapping; User-centered design; Decision support tool; Decision-making; Shared decision making; Informed consent; Patients; Patient decision aid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction | Science Communication","",""

It stores physical and digital records from the region’s professional activities with an ambition to make its collected knowledge accessible.<br/>The area balances between a post-industrial identity, characterized by coal mining and textile factories, and a new strategic placement as the ideal investment location for business and services like logistics, design and information technologies. This shift from the primary and secondary sectors of economy to services related to digital technology, is also reflected in the collected material.<br/>Higher educational institutions developed parallel to the previous industrial development in order to provide research in the same fields. Today, research centers try to link again education with the contemporary growth of digital production and commerce. The Archive of Work is the mediating partner between industry and education. While serving its administrative function, it serves as a bridge between the past and the future. By becoming an integrated part of the educational system, the archive can offer its collected knowledge for further research in the professional world against the region’s high unemployment.<br/>The chosen site for the archive is the disused freight station Gare Saint Sauveur, centrally located in Lille. This location places the archive among the civic buildings of the city, like the town hall, the museum and the library, suggesting its urban nobility, as one of the main public institutions. Located along the horizontal boulevard connecting the new master planned area with the existing city, the Archive serves as a gate, joining the former industrial site with the urban fabric. This position sets the Archive as a monumental institution in the city center of Lille.<br/>The building consists of eight floors, organized in two volumes with a cut in-between them. Precast concrete panels create a closed envelope, providing insulation for the storage rooms while thin window slits, indicate the accessible spaces within. Concrete’s austerity and roughness communicate the building’s industrial content, despite its mute and closed exterior.<br/>Archives operate with a clear separation between storage and human accessible areas, clearly outlining circulation paths of the archived material, the working staff, and the visitors. In the proposed building, the public areas are not separated, but placed in-between the storage rooms to evoke an interaction with them. From the closed ground floor, a public ascending route leads the visitor to the middle part of the archive, an elevated square, offering views above the city. From this space that can serve as a meeting place, one can explore the rest accessible parts within the facility, placed in various levels around the vertical voids, in conjunction with the stored formats.<br/>The project is altering the archive, from a storage infrastructure to a productive educational facility. This new character can transform the institution from a collection of dead objects, to an active organism, providing a space for reflection and gathering for the community while transmitting its collected knowledge.<br/>Propositions<br/>1. The archive is not an administrative storage facility, but an educational institution and thus it should be open to the public.<br/>2. The archive, as a civic building, belongs to the cultural and educational facilities of the city, the library, the university and the museum.<br/>3. Industry and education used to be more closely related, as research would explore for production.<br/>4. The Archive of Work is necessary to bridge industry and education, as without understanding the labor of the past, it’s difficult to innovate in the present high-tech economy.<br/>5. The archived elements are not objects of a museum, but they can only be understood through activation. The archive provides the necessary facilities to comprehend and interpret the data in order to produce new knowledge from it.<br","Archive; work; employment; public institution; public building; Lille; Eurometropolis; digitization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

Approximately 13% of the energy spent in Greece comes from renewable energy resources, however a significantly higher percentage is essential in order to meet the European standards by 2020. A prompt solution is the in-situ energy generation. Additionally, the harmful emmisions of the various air-conditioning and refridgerating systems need to be eliminated. The current master thesis involves the use of solar energy for indoor temperature regulation, mainly for cooling purposes. This is achieved by the use of two different technologies; the photovoltaics and the thermoelectrics. A series of PV panels convert the solar energy to DC power, which is supplied to the thermoelectric devices. The TE modules are able to create temperature difference and depending on the direction of the DC current, they can function either for cooling or for heating. The system is 100% emission-free and can operate entirely on renewable energy. Location of the project is set to Athens, Greece, a city with rather high air-conditioning demands during summer and high solar irradiation all year long, traits which make it very favorable for a PV-TE solar cooling application. Objective of the thesis is to develop a solar cooling facade concept which, along with the implementation of passive design strategies, is able to cover the cooling and heating demands of a certain office space. Considering the context, the local climate, the prominent vernacular building strategies have been studied. Moreover, a field research and analysis of 25 case study buildings has been carried out leading to the definition of the ‘typical office building’ in Athens. Based on the typical office, a passive optimization with the implementation of multiple passive strategies has been carried out resulting in the optimum scenario. The PV and TE system has been calculated and designed according to the optimum passive scenario and is applied on a case-study building. A range of architectural possibilities is explored, based on the typical office buildings of the area.","Facade design; Climate design; Renewable energy; Thermoelectric; HVAC; Athens; Office buildings; Building envelope; Solar energy; Solar cooling; Cooling; PV; Passive Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Façade and Climate Design","37.975746, 23.733277"

To tackle these problems, different strategies are developed: a systematic change of the informal building industry towards circularity and decentralization, design of a low-tech prefabricated building kit with local materials, urban riverside improvement and a collective housing design that is open to incremental building. The focus lies on the empowerment of the community towards an autonomous long-term development and the (re-) integration of local renewable building materials, which could reduce the CO2 footprint of housing construction and enable the improvement of living conditions.

For numerous areas in earthquake prone regions this information is outdated, unavailable, or simply not existent. Traditional methods to gather this information, such as building-by-building inspections, are costly and highly time-consuming, making them unfeasible for assessing large building inventory. For this reason, the use of remote sensing data has been proposed to allow a fast acquisition of relevant building information on urban and regional scale. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms may be used to analyse the gathered data, e.g. to classify a building stock into groups with similar seismic behaviour. This thesis investigates into such an approach for the building stock of Groningen in the Netherlands. Our focus lies on the extraction of detailed geometric information from a point cloud gained by aerial laser scanning. We thereby follow the assumption that similar structural systems and materials can be inferred from geometric similarities. To describe the geometric shape of a building we apply Shape DNA, a spectral shape descriptor based on the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In a first experiment on a synthetically generated building stock we succeed in predicting the roof type of different buildings with accuracies above 80%, only relying on the Shape DNA. The experiment shows promising results, however, further research is necessary in order to explore the usability on real building data. In a second experiment we use a sample of buildings from the Groningen building stock. Here we can automatically predict detailed SBST information, such as the type of lateral load resisting system, with accuracies above 80% only by taking a buildings footprint area and year of construction into account.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The middle-income households in the Netherlands are currently disadvantaged in finding affordable housing, as they are pushed towards the private rental market in which affordable private rental housing is scarce. Together with participation trends, this gives opportunities for collective private commissioning (CPC) to add to the supply and make it more inclusive and stable, as different interests could come together and the housing is expected to stay affordable. Therefore, this study entails an explorative research into the possibilities of CPC and affordable private rental housing, focussing on the type of collaboration, the enablers and barriers in the collaborative process and the role division within the collaboration. A single case study of CPC for middle-segment owner-occupied housing was conducted, supplemented with a cross-sectional study, with interviewees currently involved in CPC for affordable private rental housing. The main findings show that the type of collaboration can be considered hybrid, as it can act in a commercial market while maintaining its social goal and it has a collaborative and innovative approach. Important enablers and barriers towards collaboration are in the initial phases of such a project, where expertise and political influence are crucial. During collaboration, a board providing connecting leadership, acknowledging power differences, trust and striving for a win-win situation by serving both social and commercial interests encourage collaboration. However, difficulties in the complex financial situation of such a development can cause barriers. Important roles for this type of development are defined as process responsible and executive, in order to guide the process.

Besides the previous implications, the role of the residents seems moderated compared to other forms of CPC, as they will only be in charge after the housing is realised.

Thus, the development of tidal flats is important to foresee. The presence of specific small scale features could indicate a certain development and large scale morphological shape. The shape is a predictor for development and it is expected to influence small scale feature formation. Tidal flat management could benefit from technological process, e.g. in drones, if these indicators can be used. Hence, the aim of this research is to find indicators and gather sufficient knowledge to make them applicable.<br/><br/>The main research question is: ""Can small scale morphological features on estuarine tidal flats be used as indicators for large scale morphological shape and development?”. The main question contains two aspects. The first facet is whether the small scale morphological features are indicators for large scale morphological shape and development. It focuses on detecting indicators. The second part is about gathering knowledge to properly use the indicators. It is investigated which mechanisms explain the found indicator roles of the small scale morphological features. The focus is on the identification of the mechanisms. Two sub-questions can be extracted from the above:<br/>1. Are the small scale morphological features on estuarine tidal flats indicators for large scale morphological shape and development?<br/>2. Which mechanisms explain the found indicator roles of small scale morphological features? <br/><br/>Indicators are detected with the analysis of aerial photographs and elevation measurements at transects in the Eastern and Western Scheldt. New and already in literature known features are identified and classified in this process. The mechanism that form and erase the small scale morphological features and their dependence on large scale morphological shape are investigated to explain the found indicators. The mechanisms are determined in various ways: Two 1D models are created, a field campaign is conducted, (subsequent) aerial photographs are looked into, elevation measurements are analyzed in detail and literature research is done.<br/><br/>Small scale morphological features on estuarine tidal flats can be used as indicators in the Western Scheldt. This research detects and explains features that indicate large scale morphological shape, development, hydrodynamic conditions and ecological activity of an area. However, the applicability of the indicators in other systems should be proven by extending this research to other situations. A specific sequence of small scale morphological feature categories between salt marsh and waterfront, a build-up, has been identified as indicator for convex large scale morphological shape and indirectly for accreting behavior. All the features in the build-up are indicators on their own. Megaripples, seen within build-up, indicate (future) convex profiles. Furthermore, all of the features indicate a certain relative height and slope when they are seen within the build-up. These individual indicator roles are clarified by elaborating on the hydrodynamic conditions that form and erase the features. Therefore, the prevailing conditions can also be determined with the indicators.","tidal flat; estuary; morphology; aerial photograph; elevation mesurements; SWAN; small scale morphological features","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.384119, 3.750306"

Before the printing press was invented, word of mouth was the primary source of news, gathered and distributed through pubs, inns and markets. The invention of the printing press brought an autonomy in news production, technology made the news more coherent, content controlled and regulated, ensuring that the same news travelled to more people. This, according to Victor Hugo, transferred the responsibility of conveying human thought from architecture to printing, from the book of stone to the book of paper, which was far more well traversed path in the city, through the form of an arcade, to renew its relevance within public life, while presenting an opportunity to increase its credibility by being in constant public view. Born out of industrial overproduction and new goods that flooded the market, arcades in 19th century Europe consolidate and put in public view the new products of industrial luxury. The symmetrical sky-lit interior street acting as a shortcut within the dense city blocks provided a way for the extension of public space on private property. While they were extensions of streets, with interior facades, signage, colours and lights of the commercial establishments, they were covered, protected from the weather, hence behaving like a public drawing room, where the collective lives, experiences, understands and invents. The New Newsroom utilises these architectural elements, incorporating them into a productive space; the shop windows look into podcast stations and screening rooms, benches along the interior façade act as social space, the street lights give a hazy domestic glow to the productive news floor, that acts as a constant backdrop to a frantic city life. solid and durable; and now to the book in the cloud, that is more permanent still through its physical absence. “This will kill that… Printing will kill Architecture”.1 The book of paper was still monumental, immortalised through its multiplicity.

In an era where we have multiple news sources, an overwhelming number of opinions through the social media, every tweet and Facebook post, considered news, goes onto the immortal web of the internet; the newsroom is not an autonomous organisation for news production.

These manipulation activities have found its applications in myriad fields of engineering, ranging from medical diagnostics to chemical industry to drug discovery. This has increased demand for the development of devices such as 'Lab on a chip', which performs laboratory-sized experiments and analysis on a single small chip, with the same speed and accuracy as its room-sized counterpart. However, manipulation activities carried out in these devices has fixed channels, designed to serve purpose for specific manipulation tasks. This makes the device suitable for a specific application. Addressing this aspect, a device designed without having any real channels would give an opportunity to integrate multiple functionalities onto a single-chip in the long run. As a first step towards reaching this 'bigger picture', it is necessary to explore the feasibility of manipulating particles, droplets and bubbles by generating so called 'virtual channels'.<br/>The present thesis focuses on an attempt to manipulate particles without the use of any real channels or external field. Although such manipulation is desired in the micro-scale, a top down approach is preferred and hence, the manipulation is carried out in a scaled up model. First, a Hele-Shaw flow cell is designed with sources and sinks in the millimeter scale to deviate streamlines in the same range. Thereafter, four different velocity fields are studied under different combination of sources and sinks, which are then compared to the computational ones. The property of a Hele-Shaw cell that the averaged velocity over the height of the channel is irrotational, makes it possible to compute velocity fields by the use of potential flow theory. The same velocity fields are hence, computed using a discrete source based Panel Method. A good agreement is found between computation and experiment, making PIV measurements not a necessary option for evaluation of velocity fields under these sources and sinks. Finally, individual particle is inserted into the Hele-Shaw cell and manipulated using unsteady fields. The manipulation includes tasks such as diverting particles having same initial position to different end locations; trapping particle for different instances of time and then releasing them into different directions; flipping positions of two particles; and deflecting a particle by ninety degrees. The individual particle trajectory for the above manipulation activities are tracked down using a particle tracking code and then compared with the ones generated using the Panel Method. This, however, excludes the activities where particles need to be trapped because of particle fluctuation near stagnation point. Overall, the Panel Method serves well in predicting particle path-lines and can be used as a tool for manipulating particles.","Hele-Shaw cell; sources and sinks; Volume illuminated PIV; Particle manipulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The purpose of this thesis is to look the possibilities of using glass columns to replace the existing concrete columns of the 1st floor of the Civil Engineering faculty at the University of Technology in Delft. First, a study about the different properties of glass will be conducted to gain enough knowledge for designing a glass column. In a detailed central section the research presents methods on how to build a column made of modified Tetris shapes. In conclusion, the results suggests that it depends on the design as some methods are more efficient than the other. Casted glass is often for unusual and irregular shapes. However, it takes a long time for glass to cool down after manufacturing and therefor often expensive in comparison with laminated glass. The latter method is used for the Tetris design.","glass column; cast glass; tetris; Laminated glass","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The turbopumps operate at high rotational speed, which in turn leads to cavitation at the inlet of the impeller. Cavitation can cause performance issues, instabilities and mechanical damage of the blades.<br/>This thesis presents and validates a shape optimization framework for the design of splitter blades that extends the operative range under cavitation while maintaining the wetted performance. For a target turbopump application, the optimization framework allows for independent changes to the blade angle distributions across the span and to the pitchwise position of the splitter blades while preserving the thickness distributions. <br/>The optimization is conducted with a surrogate-based gradient method. The geometry is optimized at a fixed cavitation number corresponding to a 5% head coefficient drop-off, while constraints are imposed on the wet pump performance. It is found that this approach, coupled with the optimal design points distribution provided by the Design of Experiment method, reduces the computational cost of the optimization process by minimizing the number of multiphase calculations. <br/>The numerical results show that the optimized splitter blades successfully increase the pump operative range by 2.2% and increase the head coefficient by 5.3% compared to the baseline case with non-optimized splitters. These results are corroborated by experiments conducted in a closed-loop water test facility. Several pump geometries are tested through rapid prototyping using additive manufacturing. The experimental data validate the optimization framework, demonstrating a 4.7% increase of pump operative range and a 7.6% increase in head coefficient. The calculations are used to gain insight in the physical mechanisms for the performance improvement. The analysis of the results indicates that the improved performance is due to the optimized position and shape of the splitter blades which increase the pump slip factor. <br","shape optimization; Cavitation; Splitter blades; CFD Optimization; Multi-phase simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

By using a self-formed database of subjects around this theme I have written five short essays in this manuscript. I started with a quote by Hannah Arendt where she speaks about the importance of the permanence of our surroundings. I really believe that this is important for the reality and reliability of the human world but I wanted to research the relation between my theme of transiency and the permanence of the world. <br/><br/>These five themes contain subjects explaining why modern architecture cannot age well, ruin porn, acceptance of the passage of time, the importance of the landscape and mortality.

By maintaining such reliable surroundings nothing will be hidden or unpredictable. With the acceptance of ageing and death we can create a stable situation which is predictable.

Vegetation maintenance has a significant effect on flood risk, because the hydraulic roughness decreases after cutting of vegetation. Stream restoration is a project in regional water systems, where floodplains are constructed and weirs are removed to recover the ecological value of streams. In streams with floodplains the vegetation is relatively more important because of smaller water depth. Moreover, climate change increases the flood risk, which increases the urgency to investigate the vegetation maintenance strategy.<br/><br/>A vegetation maintenance strategy involves of a cutting frequency, how often and when the vegetation is cut, and a cutting intensity, the percentage of the cross-section that is cut. The aim of this research is to optimize the performance of the vegetation maintenance strategy by consideration of the aspects ‘flood risk’, ‘ecological effects’ and ‘maintenance costs’. The research answers the following question: How can risk-based vegetation maintenance strategy reduce flood risk in a cost-effective way in regional water systems with consideration of ecological effects?<br/><br/>A case study, a recently flooded stream in the south of the Netherlands, is used to answer the research question. The performances of nine selected vegetation maintenance strategies are investigated. Dimensionless performance indicators are designed for the three aspects to assess the total performance of each vegetation maintenance strategy. For the aspect ‘maintenance costs’, data from a water board is retrieved and the aspect ‘ecological effects’ is assessed by a literature study. For the aspect ‘flood risk’, several steps are conducted. The vegetation maintenance strategy is translated into a probability distribution function of roughness coefficients. To that end, use is made of roughness functions including vegetation growth curves and roughness coefficients of the stream. Stochastic modelling of the water level by the hydraulic model Sobek 1D is used to examine the influence of vegetation maintenance on the water levels. A consequence model, the Water Damage Estimator, translates the results of the stochastic modelling step into flood risk. The three performances of the aspects are combined into the total performance of the vegetation maintenance strategy.<br/><br/>The results of the case study show that the timing of cutting has the largest influence on the flood risk, followed by the cutting frequency. The cutting intensity has the smallest influence on the flood risk. For a high performance of ‘maintenance costs’, a low cutting frequency is necessary. For a high ecological value, pattern cutting and cutting in August is important. In conclusion, for streams with floodplains the optimal vegetation maintenance strategy is ‘cutting of the main channel and parts of the floodplains before summer’.<br/><br/>The total performance of the vegetation maintenance strategy can be further optimized by a dynamic maintenance strategy with ‘roughness’ of the stream as maintenance trigger. Hereby, the vegetation maintenance strategy is dependent on the current roughness in spring. Moreover, it is found that the conclusions of the case study can be applied on many other streams in the Netherlands.","vegetation maintenance; regional water system; performance indicator; Stochastic modelling; ecological effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.43678, 5.74679"

As a result, there is a high demand for energy neutral refurbishment of the existing housing stock. With the currently low refurbishment rate is it expected to take around 250 years to reach this goal. Due to the high initial investment costs of refurbishment, spread out over a short period of time, replacement and rebuilding is often the preferred option, while refurbishment is significantly less material consuming. Still the environmental impact of a refurbished building appears to be similar to the environmental impact of a new building, when looking at the material use spread out over the lifetime. <br/><br/>The Circular Economy is a solution to the problem of the current linear lifecycle of refurbishment, because it strives for an increased lifetime of the refurbishment by enabling reuse of components at the end of their functional service life and recycling of materials at the end of their technical service life. The Circular Economy aims to close and extend the loops of material cycles, in order to preserve value of materials, resulting in decreased raw material consumption and waste generation. <br/><br/>In this research the level of circularity of the 2nd Skin Façade Refurbishment system, which is a refurbishment strategy that wraps the building into a second layer of insulation, is examined. The level of circularity of the materials as well as the disassembly potential of the connections between the components and materials, have been analysed. Based on the assessment results, a Roadmap for circular façade refurbishment is developed. As validation of the approach, a design proposal is made for the Circular 2nd Skin Façade Refurbishment system, which is a universal refurbishment system that can be applied to different residential building typologies. The system is designed for future changes, as it enables reconfiguration of the façade arrangement and disassembly at the end of its functional lifetime. Instead of ending up as unrecoverable waste, the circular façade refurbishment system can be reused multiple times for the refurbishment of other residential buildings, exploiting the technical lifetime of the materials to the fullest.","Refurbishment; Circular Economy; 2nd Skin Façade; design for disassembly; modularity; life cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-02-01","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

This ambitious and exciting goal demands a broad range of new technologies, innovations and a fresh view on current challenges we are facing on Earth. This also applies to the field of Architectural and Building Technology. <br/><br/>To start with, the need for building a sustainable habitat is established, where sustainability is defined as being as independent as possible from Earth. Therefore, being sustainable on Mars is vital. This aspect is leading to the research by focusing on using in-situ resources (ISRU).<br/><br/>Based on this insight, the research question was formulated: Which in situ materials and forming techniques are suitable to create an outer shell for a sustainable habitat on Mars which protects the crew from the harsh Martian environment? The Martian habitat will have to protect the crew from, among others, radiation and the extreme temperatures (ranging from 20 °C to -153 °C).<br/><br/>Literature study shows that ice provides an excellent shield against radiation. Moreover, ice is widely present on Mars. Hence, a number of experiments were performed to test the feasibility of using ice as a building material. The results for all three tests were the same: the addition of sand or plastic does not upgrade the building properties of the ice. However, adding salt does improve the building properties. The outcome of the experiments indicates that up to 15 ppt of NaCl increases the compressive strength from an average of 1 MPa to 4 MPa. A higher percentage of sodium chloride does not influence the compressive strength. The experiments also indicated that the colder the testing environment (up to -70°C), the higher the compressive strength of the NaCl ice is. The warmer the environment (up to +25°C), the more ductile the NaCl ice behaves. <br/><br/>A further challenge to building a habitat on Mars is that it has to be built semi-remotely. This thesis singles out the use of robotic technology, which can perform all tasks necessary to build the habitat, ranging from mining the ice to assembling the building. A short analysis indicates that the use of additive manufacturing has great potential for the assembling of the building. In this thesis, preliminary studies and experiments have been conducted on additive manufacturing techniques for sodium chloride ice. The main outcome is that the ice structure has a greater overall strength due to the freezing of the ice layer by layer. This technique also enables the possibility of repair during the building phase as the water fills the possible cracks, and then expands upon freezing, creating a stronger structure. <br/><br/>Finally, a habitat has been designed to assess if the technological findings are useful and comply with the overall habitat requirements. The “Ice Hab” uses two different techniques of building with ice; one almost completely independent from Earth materials and another one with Earth technology for redundancy. Overall, the habitat design complies well with the requirements. <br","habitat; Mars; sustainability; ice; ice composite; additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Demographic shrinkage, digitalization in agriculture and the arise of new big typologies as windturbines, datacenters and mega farms are transforming the countryside of Groningen into a desolate production landscape.<br/><br/>The research is concerned how the landscape of Groningen can be translated into architectural form. Thereby the thesis learns from the landscape and explores context as a generating tool. At first the sea-clay landscape of Groningen is historically and geographically defined and second, more sensitively, examined for its architectural value. The open and wide landscape of Groningen is characterized by nature and the cultivation of man, especially in the last 200 years. Through time the threshold between the natural and unnatural blurred. This current presence of the cultivated landscape is explored in material, landscape, typology and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Resembling these new emerging big typologies the design brief consists of an agricultural research institute of 30 000 square meter, including a laboratory, farm and crops storage. The institute is placed in a typical large scale sea polder in the most northern part of Groningen. <br/><br/>Scale, position and movement play an inevitable role in the relation between the buildings and its surrounding landscape. In doing so the buildings are experienced big as small simultaneously, putting its scale in relation to the wide polder landscape. <br/><br/>The climatized crops storages are disconnected of their direct surroundings for an optimal storage climate. The paradox of this introvert arrangement is, that the outer facade can therefore be completely devoted to its surroundings; the landscape. Made completely out of natural reed the facade gives an ambiguous feeling to the highly engineered structure. An lazy arch in the facade interrupts the horizon, a constant sharp line in the wide ad open landscape that divides the sky from the soil.<br/><br/>Instead of conserving the old, the proposal embraces these new changes to enrich the existing qualities of the landscape. The proposal takes existing qualities as point of departure without disregarding the technical and efficient character of the new emerging typologies. By embracing the new typologies existing qualities of the landscape are emphasized and even amplified. In radically rethinking the countryside, the identity and experience of our rural areas is developed instead of forgotten.","Groningen; Eemspolder; Countryside; Agriculture; Landscape; Farm; Storage; Archive; Laboratory; Reed; Scale; Land-art; Production landscape; Polder; Context; Research-by-doing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

But to make a decision you have to look beyond your building’s subjective beauty or uglyness and it’s immediate site, you have to analyze it’s history, everyting that surrounds it and the building consists off to make the right judgement.<br/><br/>There are many factors that come into play regarding an architectural, cultural and technological research/analysis, but I think it may be important to understand (as you are coming up with solutions to your architectural design) what the perception is by yourself, the public and the municipality of what is currently on and in your building site (or what once was there). You should however not be limited by this with regard to the site and building awaiting your design and the design process, but I do think you will formulate a better design concept if you understand the different and sometimes intangible dimensions to the site where you will build and/or intervene. I used this as a springboard during the graduation studio to think outside of the box by still being true to our own design style, but still solve all the challenges, opportunities and needs this place, the building and the surroundings bring.<br/><br/>The research is very important for many reasons. And key among those is that it presents you with many clues and provides arguments which together add up to help you determine what design opportunities and challenges you can solve, leverage and build upon. <br/>The relationship between research and design for me is quite clear; a good research gives you a peek into the underlying “personality” of where you will build/design — and that may just spark and/or justify your own best innovative design solution and approach.<br/><br/>In this particular studio we had the option of redeveloping one of five different industrial buildings.<br/>I chose to redevelop the Katoenveem building.<br/>The Katoenveem immediately for me was a fascinating building and site. This large oblong building maybe seems boring and ready for demolition for the untrained eye, but the eyes only see what the mind is prepared to comprehend.<br/><br/>The still standing structure, designed by J.J. Kanters, was built along one of the quays of the, at that moment, brand new and busy Vierhavens industrial and harbor area. In only two years; 1919-1920 the building was constructed together with several structures which together made the Katoenveem Complex (see fig. 2). The main building, the one still standing, was built for the storage and transshipment of cotton. In Rotterdam this was the first warehouse that was especially designed for storing and distributing cotton. Katoenveem and the complex functioned for the cotton industry for over 43 years untill 1964 when the company quitted due to the rapid development of synthetic fabrics. After 1964 the building still functioned as a warebouse but not exclusively for cottonbales. Later Atelier van Lieshout had it’s offices here and even later an appartment was made on the roof. <br","redevelopment; katoenveem; Heritage & Architecture; cultural center","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.905440, 4.427194"

(mentor); Avissar, I (mentor); Weaver, T (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The river Leie is a commercial waterway that flows from Pas-de-Calais to Gent. Between the cities of Armentieres and Mennen, it defines the Belgium-French border. Seven islands along this 20 km-long section are the product of canalization, introduced in the 17th century. Over the following years, this waterway developed into an infrastructural artery by the construction locks chambers in order to overcome height differences. By the mid-20th century, however, the canal went into decline, prompted by the slow demise of the industrial activities in the region. More recently, this wider area has been redefined not through industry but political bureaucracy, with the dissolution of permanent border controls. Ironically, despite this erasure of boundaries, the line of the waterway and its canal infrastructure has remained rigid – a register of a former industry, but one without any form of public, or indeed human presence.<br/>The idea of the public festival is as old as the public itself. In the context of the Eurometropolis, Belgium has a long-existing festival culture, from the historic Flemish kermis to its more than thirty annual festivals. Similarly, France has historically delivered policies of access to culture for the masses. However, over the last 20 years, the seasonal musical festival, sited in large and typically rural areas, has emerged as an increasingly prevalent type, pulling the festival away from public, urban space. This move out of the city is largely because of the size of the audiences–a mass and density of people that would collapse existing urban structures. Based in International Standards, this audience is housed in temporal structures, but the effect of lacking permanent infrastructure is a forfeiting of its public function and responsibility outside the bounds of the festival. Architects cannot design the feast, the concert of the festival, and actual inhabitation cannot be designed; however, permanent elements can define how inhabitation might take place, and this does definitively fit within the remit of architects.<br/>Since the ephemeral nature of the contemporary music festival deprives the festival of any architecture quality, laying foundations is the first, significant step towards an architectural scenario in this de-industrialized region. A festival ground forms the extension of a canal lock, and can simultaneously be seen as larger systematic strategy for the reuse of an underused waterway infrastructure. The lock’s only occasional use mirrors the essentially cyclical nature of the festival. At<br/>the same time, its permanent infrastructure offer the opportunity to improve the logistics of the festival, such as the transport and storage facilities. The waterway is not only a scenario that actively attracts and hosts spectators in search of experience, but is also an infrastructural framework for public inhabitation. The multi-cultural and de-industrialized river Leie offers a scenario to re-think the preconceived rigidity of the waterway infrastructure.","De-industrialization; Infrastructure; music festival; canal lock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""

(mentor); Avissar, I (mentor); Weaver, T (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Asphalt Gardens are a landscape intervention alongside the E17 Highway that connects Belgium and France. <br/>The project looks at the idea of highway landscape as a pastoral landscape. It deals with what is artificial and natural, with the idea of perceiving something through a window frame, through speed. It deals with the specific environment of the Eurometropoils and by extension the northern European Landscape. Appreciating the as found condition as a given situation of the motorway landscape, Asphalt Gardens provokes the ideas of beauty. They don’t acquire borrowed beauty but they celebrate the rough and artificial highway landscape.<br/> The manner of our regard to discarded artifacts, such us the ordinary highway defines the way we look landscapes and how we can create gardens. The highway landscape has a particular aesthetic language and beauty. In the same context, a garden next to a highway can be beautiful if it refers to the highway. <br/> The project focuses on the highway landscape as a particular post-industrial territory which deserves attention because of its dominance and use. <br/>The world landscape gradually changed in meaning through the last two centuries. First it meant the picture of a view, an artist’s interpretation of a scenery. Informal landscape tradition, such as the 18th century English gardens designed from Humphrey Repton, was influenced by the pastoral landscape. The gardeners, with a similar way as the painters of pastoral and picturesque landscapes, decided what to include or omit in their design. They created stylized, picturesque landscapes, leaving out from the composition the muddy roads. <br/> In this logic, the garden consists of a series of pictorial compositions. In each of these pictures we find the basic principles of harmony, unity and contrast. In the landscape paintings of Jacob van Ruisdel and Van Goyen, the northern European landscape is depicting as an as found condition and that makes it pastoral. In many of the paintings the idea of harmony between the man-made and the natural is introduced with the ruin. The artificial is taken over from the natural and the ruin harmonizes the two contradictory principles. <br/>Aspalt Gardens recontextualize existing artifacts and reflects the reality in a way that provokes relations between objects and materials that are taken for granted. They suggest a new reading and observation of the ordinary landscape. <br","Asphalt; Garden; Highway; Landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","The Berlage Post-MSc in Architecture and Urban Design","",""
