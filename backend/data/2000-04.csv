(mentor); Derksen, J. (mentor)","2000","Agglomeration is the process in which crystals grow together in a supersaturated fluid. The agglomeration rate of crystals in the size range between 5 and 20pm depends on the supersaturation, shear rate, and density difference between particles and fluid. The aim of this research was to validate experimentally the theoretical model of shear induced agglomeration for shear rates in the range between 10 and 20s^-1. The model ions are Calcium Oxalate ions, and the dimensionless supersaturation is 2.5. In this research project, an optical setup for determining shear induced agglomeration rate constants has been improved. A Couette-flow device is used to generate a constant shear flow. In order to determine the particle size and number concentration, a non-intrusive, optical system is used. The optical setup is based on a CCD camera, to record enlarged images, and a pulsed laser, to illuminate the suspension. The use of the laser results in images that consist of speckles. A computer algorithm is developed to remove the speckles. Subsequently, the particle size and number is obtained. Determining the agglomeration rate constant by means of the increase of the particle size proves to be inaccurate. Measuring the decrease of the particle number concentration in time gives good results, suitable for determining the agglomeration rate constant. It is shown experimentally, that the particle number concentration can be determined accurately up to 2.5 Â• 10^11 m^-3. For higher concentrations the illumination of the measuring volume is insufflcient.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische Technologie","","","",""
