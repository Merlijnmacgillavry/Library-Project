(mentor); Galuzzi, C. (mentor)","2014","Over the past years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the definition and implementation of techniques for the optimization and acceleration of applications on various computing platforms. Among these techniques, the extension of a given instruction-set architecture with custom instructions has become a common approach. Custom instructions effectively reduce the dynamic instruction count, which, in turn, leads to increase in performance and reduction in power consumption. Traditionally, existing techniques address Instruction-Set Extension (ISE) on a per-application basis. Anyhow, when many applications have to be considered at the same time, ISE on a per-application basis is, clearly, less effective, as the custom instructions have often limited re-utilization across applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a new framework for the automatic generation of domain-specific ISEs. Experimental results show that, the proposed framework, evaluated on a number of applications from various domains, can effectively generate domain-specific instructions with high utilization factor across the targeted applications. At the same time, the generated instructions reduce the instruction count, 45% on average and upto 80% in special cases. This, in turn, can lead to considerable improvements in performance and reduction of power consumption.","Instruction Set Extension; Processor Specialization; Domain Specific accelerators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

(mentor); Gehrmann, T. (mentor); Emmerich, M.T.M. (mentor)","2014","Cell differentiation is a natural process occurring in all higher organisms, since the early fetal stage of life. It is, also, a part of disease – such as cancer – as the cell cycle becomes deregulated and cells behave differently compared to healthy ones. Differentiation occurs although the genome of all cells is identical across all cell types of the same organism. The motivation behind the current work is to understand why this happens. Cells differentiate because of different gene expression patterns. The genomic features close or around a gene determine its expression. One of these genomic features is the binding of Transcription Factors (TFs), which are proteins that bind in the promoter region of genes and are responsible for their (non-) expression. Other genomic features in?uence the binding of TFs close to genes, such as the accessibility of DNA, the levels of DNA methylation or the modi?cation of histones. The purpose of this study is to identify the genomic features that in?uence the binding of the TFs that are responsible for gene expression. Normal classi?cation cannot express that multiple TFs need to bind in a gene’s promoter region for it to be expressed and the number of TFs varies among genes. The TF labels are also unknown, meaning that it is not known which TF, or TFs, is/are responsible for gene expression. For these reasons, this problem – and the data – ?ts the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework. A method is formulated, where a gene is treated as a bag and all the TF binding sites are instances. The results are promising, as TFs that were selected as important for gene expression were found to be so in a biological example.","machine learning; pattern recognition; bioinformatics; transcription factors; gene expression; differential regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","MSc Computer Science, Bioinformatics track","",""

(mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor)","2014","In small to medium enterprises (SME), industrial robot arms are not used very much despite the fact that they offer a large potential to increase the competitiveness. The problem is that to be effective in the SME sector, robot systems should be more flexible. To be economically effective a robot arm should be used with multiple different tasks which are usually in different locations in the company. Therefore, the robot should be able to be reconfigured quickly to the new task and location giving a low robot set-up time. Prevention of collisions with obstacles in the different locations and the extrinsic calibration of sensors on the robot are two important and time consuming tasks during set-up of the robot. Automatic generation of a 3D map of obstacles near the robot would decrease set-up time and therefore increase the flexibility. The calibration of the camera is also a tedious procedure which could be automated. Therefore, in this thesis a system is proposed which extrinsically calibrates a camera on the robot arm, and uses the calibrated camera to scan the environment in a safe way to create a collision map. Several calibration methods are investigated. The method created by Tsai et al. gives the best results and is selected. The calibration system works by estimating the position of the camera relative to a checker-board pattern from multiple points and matching this with the robot orientation. From this the camera position and orientation on the robot are calculated. In this thesis the system is tested in simulation and on a Universal robots UR5 robot arm. To safely map the environment without colliding in to obstacles which are not seen yet a Next Best View (NBV) viewpoint generation system is proposed. The system generates viewpoints for the camera which add the most new information to the map. A virtual wall in the map round the robot represents the unknown space, which prevents the robot to move into unknown space. By viewing the unknown space with the camera the unknown space is cleared. As monocular mapping algorithms are not available yet, a 3D camera is used for data acquisition. Data is stored in an OctoMap system, which is a memory efficient, discretized probabilistic storage system. This system is also implemented on the UR5 robot arm. The calibration system works successfully. In addition, we concluded that noise in the camera pose estimation system is the main limiting factor for achieving high precision. The collision map system has been implemented correctly and also functions successfully. For this part of the system, we conclude that the main limiting factor for the processing speed could be removed if the mapping system would be integrated in the NBV software.","next best view; extrinsic calibration; ROS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-07-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Guedon, A.C.P. (mentor)","2014","Background – With the growing costs in healthcare and the growing need for care, prediction models offer great opportunities for improving efficiency and patient outcome. With these models, one can manage the different outcomes as efficient as possible and next to that, understand which variables influence the patient’s pathway. The Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam provided the data of the kidney transplantation patients (donors and acceptors) to examine the effects of different preoperative variables, such as age, body mass index and gender, on the operating time, the surgical complexity, the occurrence of peri- and postoperative complications and the length of stay. Prediction models using this data can give insight into the patients and the processes, it can improve the efficiency, and make it possible to steer the process when necessary. Goal – The goal of this retrospective thesis study is to gain insight into the patient groups and processes and to create a model able to predict the patients pathway through analyzing preoperative patient data. This model should lead to higher efficiency and better patient outcomes and give insight into the variables influencing the patients pathway for both the kidney donors and acceptors. Additionally, this study should provide a practical guideline for prediction model use to achieve the best results in efficiency and patient outcome. Materials and methods - Two sets of clinical histories were used for both the kidney donors and the acceptors: one for deriving the predictive equations and another for validation. For deriving the predictive equations, preoperative patient data was collected from 282 donors and 269 acceptors admitted to the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in the period of 2011-2012. For the validation of the equations, patient data was collected from 141 donor patients and 135 acceptor patients admitted in the year 2013. The data includes variables such as gender, age, patient’s body mass index (BMI) and medical history. The variables were selected with the consultation of previous research and experts in the kidney transplantation field. Regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for each outcome and to estimate the predictive equations used for predicting the patients pathway. Results – For the 80% best predictions, the validation shows that the operating time can be predicted with an average deviation of 11,9% (21,4 minutes) from the actual operating time for the donors and 12,8% (17,0 minutes) for the acceptors. Relevant features for predicting the operating time include gender, BMI, number of veins and arteries, surgeon and surgical technique for the donors and gender, ethnicity and previous transplantations for the acceptors. The length of stay can be predicted with an average deviation of 17,9% (0,6 days) from the actual length of stay for the donors and 16,6% (2,3 days) for the acceptors. The relevant features for predicting the length of stay include gender and pulmonary history for the donors and age of the donor, BMI of the donor and number of months of dialysis for the acceptors. The other outcomes do not show good predictive powers in the regression analysis and in the validation. Conclusions and discussion – Although the predictive equations for operating time and length of stay showed good results for the 80% best predictions, the results for all data were less promising. It is thus recommended to first improve the models before using them in practice. Therefore this study provides a set of adaptations that could improve the model performance. When the models show better results, it is advised to start with a pilot study to find out the benefits of the prediction equations in daily use. Different requirements are created that should be considered when implementing the model for daily use.","Predictive model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

EMS providers incorporate facility location models and simulation software packages into decision support tools, allowing the extensive evaluation of 'what-if' scenarios. We give a literature survey of facility location models applied to EMS and analyse the properties of one EMS model in particular, namely the Maximal Covering Location problem (MCLP). We analyse the sensitivity of the MCLP to changes in the parameters and design approaches to construct insensitive solutions. Furthermore, we prove performance guarantees for two heuristic solution methods for the MCLP: the Greedy Search and the Swap Local Search. All solution methods are numerically evaluated using generated instances and realistic instances based on The Netherlands. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, we apply Robust Optimisation to EMS optimisation models. We derive and analyse a Robust Counterpart formulation for a general linear constraint under the assumption of a certain polytopal uncertainty structure. Second, we present a constructive proof of the tight performance guarantee for the Swap Local Search. The proof explicitly derives the family of worst-case MCLP instances, which have a certain symmetry. Finally, we perform a thorough computational study for the described methods.

The research revealed that project risk management and project management had integrated into one process, but that people had become unaware of the effects of risk management. The actual management of the risks was not linked to risk management practices. The interviews showed that the risk register can play a major role in increasing the risk management awareness if used as an active monitoring tool by all risk owners. The research showed that for this company the added-value of project risk management is when risk management has integrated into project management but when people are aware risk are being managed.

(mentor)","2014","Feed-in tariffs (FIT) and Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) have been introduced as main support schemes to deploy wind power in major economies. Both policies involve a high cost burden to the public through either government expenditure or a surcharge on consumer electricity price, since wind is still more expensive for generation than conventional resources like fossil fuels. The cost burden of policy can be justified as long as it is clear that the support schemes are helping the renewable energy technologies become more cost-efficient. Unfortunately, previous policy evaluation studies have tended to concentrate on short-term static efficiency. But long-term – dynamic – efficiency which is related to cost reduction over time is arguable more importantly than minimising short-run costs. Thus, this study dealt with how to improve dynamic efficiency of wind energy technology under both FIT and RPS based on theoretical analysis of the efficiency concepts and related factors on one hand and empirical comparative studies of Germany, the Netherlands and Texas in the United States on the other hand. As a result of the analysis, for the promotion of dynamic efficiency of wind power not only four key factors – additional profit for innovative generators, technological differentiation, competitive pressure and domestic industry ecosystem –should be satisfied, but also the short-term cost burden and related social resistance needs to be well addressed due to the reciprocal relation between dynamic efficiency and static efficiency. A crucial point of this study is that both FIT and RPS can be workable for dynamic efficiency of wind energy technology. The additional profit depends on specific designs of the deployment scheme regardless whether it is price-based FIT or quantity-based RPS, while the previous studies tended to try to choose which approach is better. This result overcame the bias that only FIT can ensure the surplus from cost reduction. The cross-country case studies showed that the surplus for innovative wind generators in RPS can be existent when the scheme involves mandatory targets with strong penalties for non-compliance, relevant lifespan of certificate and most importantly long-term contracts between generators and retailers. This was supported by the economic model analysis. For the next step, it is recommended to apply the dynamic efficiency factors for demand-oriented deployment schemes like green power marketing.","wind energy; dynamic efficiency; feed-in tariffs; renewable portfolio standard; cost reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-05-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Economics of Technology and Innovation","",""

(mentor)","2014","The water quality of a 5 hectare lake system in Gardens by the Bay, Singapore is modelled. The lake system comprises two lakes, Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lake, connected by a 5 metre wide stream. Inflow is from runoff from the 50 hectare catchment and from pumping from the neighbouring Marina Bay Reservoir at a rate of 20 Ls-1, 24/7. Outflow is through the irrigation offtake in Dragonfly Lake and by excess overflow from Dragonfly Lake to Marina Bay Reservoir. Monitoring and modelling of the water quality of the lakes is important for reasons of ecological sustainability, public health concerns and aesthetic purposes. Water quality data for external inflows was collected by direct measurements for temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, electronic conductivity and turbidity in the field and through collection of water samples for the analysis of chlorophyll-a and total phosphors concentrations by colorimetry and determination of total nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate concentrations by ion chromatography. The data was collected during three dry and three wet events at seven point-source and five non-point source locations in the period 26 November 2013 to 06 January 2014. Nutrient inflows into the lake system in Gardens by the Bay range between 2 and 20 mgL-1 for total nitrogen and 0.05 and 1.7 mgL-1 for total phosphorus and are well above threshold values for total nitrogen (1.0 mgL-1) and total phosphorus (0.06 mgL-1) by Singapore’s Public Utility Board (PUB). The inflow of nutrients is approximately equally divided over inflow from the Marina Bay Reservoir and catchment inflows. Non-point sources contribute approximately 40% of the total phosphorus and total nitrogen load in [kg yr-1] and [kg yr-1ha-1] associated with the catchment runoff (that is excluding inflow from Marina Bay Reservoir). Point sources contribute the remaining 60% of the load from the catchment for total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The water quality model represent the water column temperature well with Root Mean Squared Error of 0.38 oC in Dragonfly Lake and 0.63 oC in Kingfisher Lake and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.73 and 0.72 respectively. Due to the use of average concentrations as model input values, fluctuations in the concentrations for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen and total phosphorus are not well captured by the model. Concentrations for water quality variables in Kingfisher Lake and Dragonfly Lake are in space. Vertical concentration differences for the modelled variables at the deepest location (4 metres) in Dragonfly Lake are highest for dissolved oxygen, 0.20 mgL-1, and chlorophyll-a, 0.37 µgL-1. An increase of the total nitrogen by 1.3 mgL-1 and total phosphorus concentration by 0.15 mgL-1 from the Marina Bay Reservoir leads to a response of corresponding magnitude in Kingfisher Lake and a an increase that is three-fold smaller in Dragonfly Lake. The same holds for a reduction of the concentrations for total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Kingfisher Lake strongly responds to changes in the characteristics of this inflow location; the water quality in Dragonfly Lake is influenced more by other catchment inflows. The combination of observation data and model data show there is a net inflow of nutrients in the lake system in Gardens by the Bay and show nutrients are accumulating in the biomass and sediment in Gardens by the Bay. Further studies should verify the nutrient loads from subcatchments through comparison of land-use types and fertilizer application in the Gardens. Sediment sampling will be required to verify the magnitude and rate of nutrient accumulation in the sediment layer. The sensitivity of the model to time-varying input data can be assessed by using the data collected for individual events rather than the average values. The three dimensional model can be simplified to a two-dimensional model. More extensive studies should indicate whether a further simplification of the model in which Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lake are represented as two fully mixed reservoirs is possible.","Gardens by the Bay; nutrients; Singapore; water quality (modelling)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Pakula, L.S. (mentor)","2014","Colorectal anastomotic leakage is one of the most feared complications after colorectal surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and risk of local cancer reoccurrence. One out of ten anastomoses leak, leading to infections. Colorectal anastomotic leakage is currently diagnosed by sniffing and watching drain fluid, which takes six to eleven postoperative days. Clinical research shows the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in the drain fluid indicates leakage from postoperative day one, while the concentration grows from day four. Therefore measuring E. coli can reduce the time to diagnosis to one day. In this thesis an E. coli measurement system is proposed, which enables early detection and therefore greatly decrease morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and healthcare costs. METHODS An E. coli detection system was designed, simulated and assembled. The system was built around an evanescent waveguide device, which features a reference and sensing path to enable differential measurements. The surface of the sensing path is functionalised to capture E. coli. Light is coupled in and out of the waveguide device by fibres. Evanescent light in the waveguide device is absorbed by captured E. coli. By measuring the light absorption, the concentration of E. coli bacteria is calculated. The proposed system is portable, user-friendly and is tested in clinically relevant simulations. The proposed solution features a microcontroller, a constant current source circuit, an infrared LED, two photodiodes, a transimpedance differential amplifier, a display and computer software. It is powered by USB, communicates over USB and rejects power line noise. Subsystem performance was measured in clinically relevant simulations, i.e. 0.1 dB light absorption measurements. This resembles 10^6 CFU/ml E. coli on postoperative day five. RESULTS The subsystems were assembled on experimental PCB and measured. The light source outputs 2.655 mW of light and shows no drift after a warm-up period of five minutes. Electrical measurements show a stable LED driving circuit with no oscillations. Light coupling from the LED to a fibre was not measurable. The photodiode monitoring circuit can measure light absorption in high detail. A drift of 6.92·10^-5 dB per minute was measured. The detection time for individual measurements is 60.8 ms, or 6.08 seconds for an averaged measurement. Electrical measurements show oscillations of 2 kHz in the monitoring circuit, which may limit the functioning. The waveguide device was coupled with 40 dB of light loss. It confines light in the vertical plane, but not in the horizontal plane. Therefore the waveguide device could not be embedded in the measurement system and no biological measurements could be performed. CONCLUSIONS Measurements show a stable infrared light source and precise monitoring circuit were constructed. The proposed measurement system has a detection limit of 9,700 CFU/ml E. coli, thus anastomotic leakage can be detected from postoperative day four. The detection time is 6.08 seconds and allows quick measurements. The designed electronics and waveguide devices are portable, although the complete measurement system is not. The system can calculate the bacteria concentration automatically, adding user-friendliness. In future research the LED can be replaced by an fibre-coupled laser, the differential amplifier stage can be replaced by an instrumentation amplifier and the waveguide device’s functioning can be improved.","biosensor; evanescent waveguide; colorectal anastomotic leakage; E. coli","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","","Biomedical Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Vaessen, P. (mentor)","2014","The rapidly increasing penetration of rooftop PV systems in rural LV distribution networks calls for the attention of DNOs in order to secure end-user voltage range. In times of high photovoltaic generation and low load consumption, voltage at PCCs may exceed the specified upper limit and make PV inverters trip. This phenomenon hinders further PV integration in the network although MV/LV transformer and conductors are by far not used up to their full capacity yet. In this thesis, voltage rise problem is analysed through load flows and simulations on a suitably designed rural test network model implemented in PowerFactory software. The suggested local voltage support strategies by the German directive VDE-AR-N 4105 and the recent European standard EN 50438, namely PF(P) and Q(V), which require reactive power control capability of photovoltaic inverters, are implemented, tested and analysed in order to check their effectiveness and compare their behaviour. As active power curtailment capability is also already required by some DNOs, a dynamic active power curtailment control algorithm is designed and tested as well, taking into account the local load demand and the network’s feed-in limitations. Afterwards, local battery storage is also incorporated in every PV system model and all the three aforementioned strategies are tested and analysed again. All studied strategies manage to mitigate the voltage rise problem up to a PV-integration level of 10 kW/household. However, their effectiveness is compared in terms of a set of evaluation criteria for a range of PV-integration levels. Subsequently, the best candidate strategy, among the ones studied, emerges through the help of experts’ opinion and a suitably designed overall evaluation score number, for both the perspectives of a DNO and a PV system owner. It is revealed that the overall preference of a DNO is for a solution which involves active power curtailment and local storage, in contrast to the overall preference of a PV system owner for a reactive power based strategy without storage.","distribution network; low voltage; distributed generation; photovoltaic systems; reverse power flow; voltage rise; inverters; voltage support; reactive power control; active power curtailment; storage; photovoltaic integration; hosting capacity; PowerFactory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","This master thesis is the result of the graduation project for the master Design for Interaction at Delft University of Technology and is an attempt to combine two field of research, namely, materiality and (social) interaction design. As this project did not originate from a specific problem but merely from an opportunity for innovation the main focus was on research. This was both theoretical and explorative. The title for this thesis is: Designing for deliberate traces Applying knowledge of material aging to daily life (social) product interaction. Within HCI and interaction design there is a growing interest in bridging the gap between digital interaction and the material qualities of artifacts and environments (Giaccardi, Ciolfi 2013). As computing becomes more transparent and moves into the background (smart objects and environments), designed interactions become embedded into everyday materials and artifacts. Social media in particular has created a new vocabulary of digital social interactions that frames interpersonal communication and the social sharing of personal data. Even though this advanced system stimulate social interaction with its fast, efficient transmission of content, it lack some subtle ways for emotional expression due to the fact that physical interaction over a distance is not yet possible (Wang 2013, Giaccardi 2013). Merging social data, social networks, and socially sensitive interactions with a vision for materiality in computing, can provide a brought perspective on emerging material-oriented design methods in HCI (Giaccardi, Karana 2013). Of course this is not without purpose as the goal is to create meaningful interactions with daily-life object. This could be to create social connectedness or draw social connections but also affecting individual social behavior (Giaccardi 2013). Ranging from one discipline to another, materials are known to be a powerful tool in facilitating tangible interactions. Every material develops a certain look and feel over time, which contributes to a certain aesthetic (Ashby 2002) of the object it embodies. Also the physical nature, structure and endurance of these materials change over time; for example concrete breaks, wood wears out, metals are subject to fatigue (Tehlan 2009). This “aging” stimulates the development of material traces (Rosner 2013, Rognoli & Karana 2013). Material traces have a narrative character (Rosner 2013), they can tell stories about the people that create them and the environments they manifest in (Ingold 2002). The majority of our understanding of the world depends on our ability to tell stories about it. Stories are an important way for us to explain things, exchange information, show our identity and express ourselves within different contexts (Brooks 2003). Storytelling is a natural but yet powerful tool for people to share information about the world. Therefore the narrative character of material traces makes them especially interesting for designers to facilitate meaningful interactions through designing for traces (Rosner 2013, Rognoli & Karana 2013). While attempting to find ways to change the way we design products/materials we take into account Ewalds (Ewald 1996) view on this. Starting with “prudence” (Cucuzella 2010) which refers to how humans deal with situations when they are faced with uncertainty. According to Ewald humans react on situations in 3 ways, which can be seen as reasons for why we would prefer to shift to more conscious design. 1. Foresight, encourages the integration of the future with the present; Focusing on achieving a future goal by changing the current situation. 2. Prevention; developed from a certainty of risk based on the knowledge possessed, changing the current situation to prevent a future risk. 3. Precaution originates from the uncertainty of proof of future, and therefore refers to conditions not covered by either foresight or prevention. All the above, and more, lead to the formulation of this assignment.","material traces; materiality; social interaction design; material aging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The project is executed in collaboration with the Amsterdam urban community ‘Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt’ (SNDM), Waag Society, and Delft Institute Of Positive Design. ‘Community well-being’ is a new and unexplored field for designers. The project is divided into a general research part on the phenomena of ‘community’ and ‘community well-being’, and a design case on the urban community Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt. Goal of this graduation project is to design a product-service-system to enhance well-being of the urban community ‘Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt’. Leading question is: “What are design opportunities to enhance community well-being in general, and for Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt in particular?” ‘Community’ is defined as a group of two or more mutually connected people having a shared identity and collective purpose that requires collective action. The structure between community members is most important since it enables them to interact with each other and hence, to function as a whole. A community’s existence is determined by four main characteristics: members, a mutual structure, a collective purpose and a boundary. On top of this, additional characteristics are identified that contribute to a community’s existence: self-representation, vision, customs, admission policy, achievements, mutual exchange, shared ownership, self-organization, renewal, adaptability, diversity, regularity, legacy, and long-term mission. However, not all characteristics are present in every community, or at any given time. ‘Community well-being’ is understood as a community’s ability to develop a communal identity, bring about efficacy, provide resilience during periods of change, and ensure continuity of its existence. These needs are dynamic and influence each other. ‘Design for community well-being’ is a bottom-up process that requires close involvement of community members. When designing for community well-being, not only community needs play a role but members’ needs as well. Eventually, one designs for the people within the community. The designer has a facilitating role in this, so that the community does not become dependent on the design, or on the designer. The urban community Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt was set up by Nieuwmarkt residents in order to form local network together that can serve as social safety net when needed. Based on interviews with members of SDNM, the state of the cummunity was analysed. This showed that current focus of the community is mainly on ‘care’, whereas it takes more to develop a solid and future proof care network: creating connections between Stadsdorpers and eventually, attracting a wider variety of people is desired first. In a series of co-design sessions, results of the analysis were verfied and complemented with members’ needs and desires. Next, these insights were translated into concepts. Together, we designed ‘Stadsdorp story’: a concept to create solidarity among Stadsdorp members through sharing stories. By means of their personal Stadsdorp label, Stadsdorpers can share something about an object of place that is special to them. Each label has a unique number that relates to an interactive map on the website of Stadsdorp Nieuwmarkt, where all stories can be found. The uniform appearance of the labels creates unity among all individual contributions. The concept of ‘Stadsdorp story’ requires active participations of the users, so the final concept actually arises at the moment it is put into use. This way, the design of ‘Stadsdorp story’ encourages and facilitates the process of enhancing community well-being in a bottum-up way.","design; well-being; community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van Engelen, J.M.L. (mentor); Hatton, C.E. (mentor)","2014","This graduation thesis treats the design process of the development of a biogas stove for East African households. In East Africa more than 80% of the people cook on fossil fuels. Exposure to the exhaust fumes of this way of cooking is the fourth worst health risk in East Africa which is similar to the amount of deaths caused by malaria. SimGas installs biodigesters to middle class households in East Africa, which yields biogas which can be used for cooking, lighting or generating electricity. Currently, poor quality Chinese stoves are imported to East Africa and sold to the local market. However, SimGas wants to implement stoves which fit the East African demands better and represent the company inside the kitchen. The design process involves research executed in the Netherlands by desk research, communication with field experts by Skype and email and by visiting East African communities in the Netherlands. The CAD program Solidworks has been used for modeling the concept and a working prototype is embodied. The concept stove is mass producible (in East Africa as well) by using four production techniques, includes no screws and compared to the Chinese stoves realized a volume reduction of almost 40% and has only 2/3 the amount of parts. The main feature is that the stove is 'ugali proof', which means it is robust enough to resist the heavy forces that are involved in the East African 'cuisine'. Besides that, the stove is adapted to the East African cooking ware and habits, which can be found in the amount of space, the single and extra stable pan supports, the special double burner functionality for frying and using larger pans and the wide range of power control. Furthermore, thermal efficiency and corrosion resistance are improved and the stove is easily adapted to LPG or natural gas. The prototype consists of a frame, cover, eight pan supports, three burners, two mixing tubes and two valve systems. The proof of principles are demonstrated in a separate report.","biogas; stove; East Africa; altered design methodology; ugali proof; prototype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-05-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","","52.0167, 4.3667"

(mentor)","2014","This report contains the graduation project for the master ‘Design for Interaction’ of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Technical University of Delft. The project was conducted for the foundation ‘Masters that Matter’, which aims to solve todays’ societal problems through design. The problem tackled in this project is the excessive household waste we are dealing with nowadays. ‘Since 1950 the amount of household waste has multiplied by four’ (Compendium voor de leefomgeving). To understand how this problem came into being three research questions were answered through literature, desktop and user research. 1.How come the amount of household waste has multiplied by four since 1950? 2.Which household waste stream is most promising to tackle? 3.What do people throw away and why? Answering these research questions resulted in insights that determined the project’s focus. We are distanced form the products in our lives; we don’t know were they are coming from, how they are made and who made them for us. This results in a lack of involvement and therefor a lack of respect. As well the benefits presented to us to decrease our discarding behavior are rational and functional benefits; they are weak benefits that hardly influence our behavior. If reducing discarding were emotionally more beneficial, it would be causing a higher impact on our behavior. The most promising household waste stream is food waste because of its high environmental impact, its quantity and the power of households to make a change. Therefor the project’s focus became creating involvement with food to reduce household food wasting behavior. This evolved to the design statement: “I want to create involvement with the circular food chain to evoke personal stories behind the food, to make food more present in people’s life” Out of this statement, the ‘Trap & Hap’ concept evolved. ‘Trap & Hap’ is a service that offers a fun day out with family or friends by providing personalized cycling tours that guide people to local food producers to experience how their food is made. At the same time they can pick up fresh local ingredients for a home made dish. ‘Trap & Hap’ increases the involvement with food by letting people experience how their food is made. Meeting the producer personally increases the emotional involvement. This increase in involvement results in more respect for the food people received and will finally result in a decrease in the food wasting behavior.","household; waste; service; involvement; design; Masters that Matter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor)","2014","Activity plays an important role in maintaining health and avoiding excess disabilities in later life. This is not only true for physical activity, but also for mental activity and the according mental health. Example of a beneficial activity that keeps the brain healthy and preserves mental functionality is social activity or in other words social interaction/communication. It stimulates the brain and builds cognitive reserve which diminishes the chance on mental deterioration. Besides, it is fun to do and will boost peoples mood. All this is especially important in institutional care facilities where the environment is often tranquil if not boring. Improving the social interaction of elderly in such facilities therefore became the main goal of this project and as a result of this, institutionalized elderly who are cognitively healthy and want to have (more) social interactions became the target group. This graduation report describes the design process of designing a product that can fulfil the before mentioned goal. First of all, a literature research is conducted to gather knowledge and information about the target group, their way of communicating and the effects of their interactions on their well-being. Because of the extensive amount of research and literature about elderly and their well-being, six specific research questions have been composed that are all related to the main goal. These questions helped to focus when searching information. During the analysis phase, the group of ‘elderly living in care facilities’ was further investigated. Their demographics and cognitive and physical condition is considered. This is done to create a clear view on the target group and help set boundaries. The group of ‘elderly living in care facilities’ is so divers that without these boundaries, it would have become difficult to create a well matching and fitting product for the envisioned user group. There was extended contact with the target group throughout the complete project. During the target group research for example, observations were done to observe the current situation and peoples’ daily activities in care facilities. Besides, conversations were held with residents as well as staff. Both broadened the understanding of the target group, delivered insight in their needs, made it possible to reflect on the information found in the literature research and analysis phase and provided inspiration for developing a suitable product. Literature and contact with the target group showed that although elderly are often willing to be socially active, conversations or social interactions do not develop. Stereotypes and reservations make it difficult to select a conversation topic resulting in silence. The to be developed product should therefore help with the selection of a conversation topic, taking away this threshold and stimulating people to start communicating. Observations, user tests and also literature showed that this could be accomplished by developing a product in the form of a game. A game can create a casual, playful, relaxed and pressure free atmosphere which is beneficial for the development of social interactions. To find out what is already available in the field of games for elderly, existing games were analysed. This analysis helped to eventually come up with a new and nonexistent game. Next to this, it resulted in three additional goals besides the main goal, which helped to guide the development of the game. During the synthesis phase the acquired information, knowledge and experiences from the previous phases were translated into multiple ideas for a game. Three of these ideas were prototyped and tested with residents of a care facility. Their feedback and opinions helped to make design choices. Eventually one game concept is chosen that subsequently was further elaborated during the detailing phase. This chosen concept fitted the target group and had the envisioned effect: it stimulated elderly to have social interactions. In the last phases of this project, the developed game is prototyped and the future production of the game is considered. Finally a final user test with the target group is performed. The eventual game called ‘Plezant’ is evaluated with the help of the residents. They described the game as fun and pleasant to play and expressed that the game helped them to have conversations and above all offered them a good time.","social interaction; communication; elderly; care facilities; residential homes; game; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","Fokker Aerostructures is a supplier of e.g. fuselage parts, wings or tails in the aviation industry. In its goal to achieve operational excellence, machine maintenance has been subject of interest. The machine park has an inherent demand for machine maintenance; it is therefore subject of continuous adjustment and improvement. This research discusses a machine maintenance improvement process on machine and organizational level, covering the required information flows and necessary functions for improvement. No connection between this processes and existing operations has been found in literature, which is therefore subject of research within Fokker Aerostructures. Analysis shows that no formalized and structured improvement process exists, and improvement actions are initiated by gut feelings. No formal connection exists between improvement projects and operations. The available data is limited or incomplete when compared to the required data for machine maintenance improvement. A machine maintenance information and control system is designed from a continuous improvement perspective. Both the machine level, as well as the organizational level is covered, using respectively an information framework; and the DMAIC cycle, which is suitable due to its data driven nature. The design has been created by adding a formalized improvement process to existing operations, which has been interconnected by means of a data framework that combines the different data types required to determine the demand for maintenance for a specific machine; being Function, Impact, Cause, Part and Action. The steps Define, Analyze and the development of Improve are performed by a team, which consists of experts on the machine, and is executed outside regular operations. Measure and the implementation of Improve are executed within operations. Measure creates data that feeds the initiation and development of an improvement. The Control step has been expanded to a control mechanism that connects the improvement process to operations. This is showed in Figure 32. The demand for maintenance differs per machine, which can be quantified using machine specific data. This serves as an input for the improvement process, by both initiating it, and making the development of an improvement possible. It therefore is the interconnecting aspect between operations and improvement, and is actively being guided by the control mechanism. The model has been developed within Fokker Aerostructures, within the scope of a limited amount of departments. It is however applicable wherever continuous improvement has to be executed; the model connects the environment where the improvement takes place, to the development of the improvement. Specific data flows, such as the framework that has been used, have been grafted onto machine maintenance, and should be altered when the model is implemented in another context.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor); Bierbooms, W.A.A.M. (mentor)","2014","In this study, the offshore wind farm effects of Thanet (300 MW) in the U.K, and of Middelgrunden (40 MW) in Denmark were analyzed in a meso-scale numerical prediction model, whilst working at MeteoGroup. For the final analysis of Middelgrunden, the model is validated with measurement data from Middelgrundens Vindmøllelaug. The model uses parameterizations for the atmospheric flow, surface physics effects, and a turbine scheme based on a Drag disc concept. The scheme uses turbine data in relation to changes in the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow as it passes through the rotors. The free stream is affected by the farm through local reductions of turbulence intensity aligned in front and in-between turbine rows, and the regions affected are as high as the turbine themselves. Wind speed near the surface is found to increase inside the wind farm (a phenomena often times unexpected), transporting turbulence downstream by advection. The simulations indicate that the added turbulence form turbine rotors promotes strong vertical transport of turbulent kinetic energy up in the atmosphere, and directly above the wind farms. Further, horizontal momentum exchanges is proven to be negligible behind turbine rotors in the downstream of the farm due to the lack of proper turbulent advection. Local meteorology is affected as the air suddenly expands above the farm, increasing the height of the planetary boundary layer as a consequence. The expansion creates a vertical temperature gradient, separating cooler air masses above the rotor area, from similarly hotter air masses near the surface. The gradients obtained varied from -0.2OC to +1OC. Surface to air heat fluxes are lessen inside turbine arrays, whilst increased downstream in the farm wake. Additionally, the Local flow patterns are found to be crucial in determining the shape and a sense of direction of the wake downstream. Finally, the meso-scale model with turbine scheme is found to mimic the interaction between the turbines and the atmosphere, to some extent due to uncertainties in the horizontal gradient of turbulence intensity. Further improvement is needed to produce a precise power forecast, which also depends on the model input data, such that a focus of attention is the correct prediction of wind direction. Further, the accurate representation of the turbine layout and number of turbines per grid location are essential to detail the turbulence inside the farm, but not for analyzing meso-scale effects. Winds speed and power ratio profiles were found in agreement with measurements.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, a ‘paradoxical situation’ occurred as the reported average rent levels do not demonstrate the sever price decrease one might expect. In contrast, the rent levels remain relatively stable in the market. One of the explanations for this occurrence is due to the provision of so-called lease-incentives by landlords instead of decreasing their rental price. As published rental prices are not corrected for these incentives, the rental price development remains on a relatively stable level. However, the true and underlying rental price corrected for incentives might differ from the published rental prices.

(mentor)","2014","One way of deriving the dynamics of a structure, is by combining the dynamics of its substructures. This concept is named ’Dynamic Substructuring’ and it allows us to cope with the increasing complexity of models by dividing them into substructures and deriving their structural dynamics independently. This allows an improvement in computational efficiency. Substructuring in the frequency domain is well established nowadays, but it is not per definition best suited for simulations containing impact-like load cases. Impulse Based Substructuring (IBS) has recently been proposed allowing analysis of the high-frequency dynamics induced by these load cases more efficiently than the so-called Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS). Unfortunately IBS is not yet as mature as its frequency based counterpart. Performing a stable substructuring operation without non-physical side-effects using experimentally obtained models is at least as extensive as when done in the frequency domain. This research is performed in order to make IBS a worthy alternative to FBS. The focus of this research is twofold. First, methods on how to obtain a structure’s dynamics using its Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) are discussed. It is derived how structural dynamics can be obtained by the convolution product between the IRF and force loading history. It is discussed how this convolution product can be discretised and it is shown that an algorithm exists which assumes piecewise linear behaviour for both the IRF and the force loading history. This results in only a third order error in the obtained response compared to the response obtained by the original convolution. Obtaining these IRFs is a challenge on its own. IRFs can be obtained either numerically, analytically or experimentally. It is shown how the IRFs of a multiple Degree of Freedom system is derived using Modal Superposition and how this relates to obtaining the system of IRFs numerically using two Newmark time integration methods. The errors made when obtaining IRFs experimentally are discussed and it is shown what effect they have on the simulated dynamics of the structure for varying load cases. Since solving the convolution product for lengthy load cases becomes computational extensive, techniques to enhance computational performance are discussed. Among those a matrix recurrence procedure for modal contributions is proposed. Secondly, the research focusses on the coupling procedure itself. It is explained how the convolution product is expanded to satisfy equilibrium and compatibility between the coupled substructures. It is shown that the main challenge is to accurately determine the forces acting on the interfaces between the substructures such that compatibility is maintained. Three coupling methods are discussed. The first method amounts an analytical procedure using the Laplace domain to obtain the interface forces. Secondly, the classical discrete coupling method is discussed, which satisfies compatibility explicitly to obtain the interface force every time step. Finally an inverse IRF filter approach is proposed. This approach uses the predicted uncoupled behaviour of the system to obtain the required interface forces. Next, it is discussed how the contribution of the interface forces in the convolution product relates to the contribution of the excitation on the coupled structural dynamics. It is shown how the contributions of the interface forces are constantly compensating the uncoupled structural dynamics induced by solely the excitation, such that their combined contributions show the coupled structural dynamics. This process is very prone to errors in the IRFs. Different effects as a result of these errors cause unstable and incomplete coupling behaviour. These effects are discussed and eventually a summary is given on which criteria an IRF should satisfy in order to guarantee stable and clean substructuring. Finally, the classical discrete approach and the inverse IRF filter approach have been tested on a case consisting of the coupling of two numerical models of a linear bar. It was seen that the used IRFs are required to be causal in order to result in a stable substructuring procedure. Furthermore it is seen that the inverse IRF filter method seems to underestimate the interface forces resulting in incomplete coupling.","Impulse Based; Substructuring; Structural Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Wormgoor, R. (mentor)","2014","Today’s 10 year olds will die at a younger age than their parents will (Sportnext, 2012). For the first time in years the life expectancy of a human has declined. During the last few decades in Europe young people’s physical performance has declined. A decrease can be identified in most of the motor abilities, and physical performances such as speed, endurance and strength (Brettschneider & Naul, 2004). Research has been done in order to determine the differences between boys and girls concerning physical activity. Literature research and interviews with experts indicated that girls are less physically active than boys (Harten, Olds & Dollman, 2007). Girls also have less developed gross motor manipulative skills (GMMS). Reasons for the differences between boys and girls might be both internal and external. Internal reasons for example are the differences in interests of the two sexes. An external reason is that girls and boys are stimulated differently by culture and environment. Girls also feel that boys have greater skills in sports, which results in girls participating less in certain sport and activities (Frost, Wortham & Reifel, 2012). Many sports and games played by children require mastering GMMS (ball skills). In order to enable more equal chances among boys and girls a solution should be found. It is assumed that helping girls to develop GMMS will also help them gaining confidence to participate more in ball sports and games. In collaboration with Studio Jan Ooms playground equipment is developed in order to give six to eight year old girls a chance to practice and develop ball skills. To further develop the chosen concept and to test the interaction between user and product a mock-up model of the Magic Magnetic was tested with eight boys and girls. It was evident that the participating children were enjoying themselves a lot when they were playing with the Magic Magnetic (§ 5.3.3).The children also believed that the game will help developing ball skills. It was noticed during the test that the playing area was too small and the table’s shape needed to be changed. Using strong magnets increases the effect on the movement of the ball. For that reason in the final design even stronger magnets will be placed inside the table than the ones used in the mock-up model. Different patterns of the magnets and two settings were tested during the mock-up test. The game has been played and tested with and without bowling pins. Both were experienced as a lot of fun. For the final design a decision has been made to leave out the bowling pins. In future product development the bowling pins can be reconsidered as they add a lot of game possibilities to the product. The Magic Magnetic is a magnetic table with a magnetic ball hanging above this table. It consists of a ball suspended from a pole by a chain, and a bowl shaped table underneath. A strong magnet is inserted inside the ball to make it magnetic. The table’s surface contains several groups of strong magnets as well. The magnets inside the table’s surface are repelling the magnet inside the ball. This is causing the ball to move unpredictably. Children can stand around the table and inside the gaps of the table’s surface to play with the ball. They can discover the magnets and try to play and throw around them. On the surface of the table are coloured lines. These lines are positioned in a way that when a ball is being thrown exactly in that direction the ball will follow the path of the line. Because this game only requires the use of hands, it is also possible for children in a wheelchair to play. The product will be placed in a public outdoor environment. Girls are given the opportunity to practice and play whenever they want to. Further research is required to evaluate the final design. In order to check the play value and the interaction with the final design a prototype must be built and tested with the target group.","children; motor skills; gross motor manipulative skills; ball skills; magnets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Fischer, J. (mentor)","2014","This graduation project redefines the interior of a Car2Go vehicle by using Design for happiness as explorative research. Design for Happiness is a fairly new term in the design world and is increasingly applied, though there is still no existing methodology. The outcomes of this report will be used as a case study for a scientific paper at the TUDelft, concerning the methodology of Design for Happiness. The report walks through four steps of happiness: the current level, the base level, the essence and the outlook of happiness. All outcomes are derived from literature research, in-depth observations using ECC, surveys and interviews. The goal is to identify the steps to design for happiness in the particular case of car sharing. Though the use of a personal vehicle interior is primarily different than the use of a sharing vehicle interior, the design of the two is indifferent. Instead of designing on a functional level meant for individual use, it should be a reflection on the emotional needs in sharing context. Towards the somewhat rigid design attitudes present in the automotive industry the facets of positive design can redefine older thinking patterns. The first level, the current level of happiness searches for existing values within the product that already increases happiness. In this particular case, Car2Go should maintain a car that is small in dimensions and electrically driven. The base level of happiness creates short-term happiness by taking out negative emotions. The interior is designed to be easily cleaned and to be intuitive in use. Quantitative rules define the design of the floor, seats, dashboard and doors. The floor should have a flowing design without gaps and holes. A gully can be implemented to cover dirt and for personalization purposes. The seat should be connected to make it easier to clean and to improve the use of getting in and out. The dashboard should have a personal communication towards the driver and should guide the user through its user steps. The doors should cover its compartment areas with a panel; which can have multiple applications. According to Design for Happiness, solving the contradiction between collective needs and individual behaviors evokes long-term happiness. These qualitative rules are discussed in the essence of happiness. An interaction is designed that changes along the expert level of the user. In phase 1 social driving is stimulated by rewarding each other’s behaviors. In phase 2, a radar map shows the positions of other Car2Go’s to stimulate collective collaboration. The last phase gives occasional rewards to stimulate explorative city behavior. The final design gives a platform for interaction and combines the quantitative and qualitative rules in one interior design. The last level, the outlook of happiness, looks at the society implementation within the future developments of Car2Go. It suggests an increase in tourism purposes, whereas to link the personal needs of this specific group to the city possibilities. In conclusion, Design for happiness is not a key finding that manifests in one design element; it is a gradual change through all levels of happiness. For every level, happiness increases.","design for happiness; interior design; automotive design; car-sharing; subjective well-being; positive design; emotion; urban mobility; electric vehicle; smart; Car2Go","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-05-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","Automotive specialization","",""

Nevertheless, a high demand remains for grasping mechanisms that are cheaper to produce, easier to assemble and lower in overall maintenance.

Through a literature survey on existing grasper mechanisms, a basic structure was defined of a three phalanx finger with anthropomorphic dimensions. By using a Pseudo Rigid Body model, a generation optimization analysis was conducted that resulted in a partially compliant conceptual design. This underactuated, anthropomorphic compliant finger was able to reach a fingertip trajectory of 180 degrees. A prototype based on this final design was manufactured out of flexible, high strength nylon, and experimentally evaluated to compare with the simulation model. It was found that the finger met all the set design criteria. Furthermore, despite consisting out of multiple components, no additional assembly steps are required once the design is completed in the 3D printer. In addition, a basic 3D printable compliant hand was created to further show the feasibility of the design as a compact yet versatile low-cost, underactuated hand prosthetic.","3D-printing; anthropomorphic; compliant; multi-phalanx; prosthetic; underactuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

This system consists of a rigid wing connected to the ground using a using a number of bridles and a tether. The tethered wing ﬂies crosswind trajectories and generates power using on-board turbines. Sensitivities of power output to design variables are required for various design trade-oﬀs. A simulation and optimization approach is presented which allows analysis of a fairly complex model with realistic controls and constraints. Using trajectory optimization removes the assumption of a predeﬁned trajectory and allows analysis of the impact of the ﬂightpath itself. The wing is modeled as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom. Aerodynamic forces are determined using a response surface on results of a vortex lattice code. A time-varying position of the bridle attachment point couples the wing to the tether. This tether is implemented as a straight elastic element with analytic approximations for the eﬀects of mass and aerodynamic drag. The power system model consists of a turbine response surface and DC-equivalent generator model. Optimal trajectories are determined using the direct collocation method resulting in a capacity factor of 48.1% for a site with uniform wind ﬁeld and annual mean wind speed of 7.5 m/s. The relative impact of aerodynamic lift and drag on long term averaged power output are found to be an order magnitude more important than wing mass. Topology and circularity of the ﬂight path are found to have a low impact on power.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Weustink, R. (mentor)","2014","The shifting of the European energy market towards the wind energy means there will be more wind farms developed in deeper water and farther away from the shore. The existing infrastructure being used for installation is seldom purpose-built for this task, resulting in delays and consequently loss of money for the operators and contractors. Furthermore, the existing process is labor intensive, time consuming and not very safe, the vessels are limited by design to work in moderate sea conditions that for instance exist in the North Sea during the summer season. Seaway Heavy Lifting has been actively involved in solutions for the single lift installation of wind turbine generators (WTG’s). This thesis is to investigate whether there can be a new concept based on improved hull shapes to install WTG’s in a single lift operation more efficiently. The study involves the development of a concept which can provide safe and speedy transportation and installation of fully assembled next generation WTG’s. The selection of the hull shape is based on an extensive but subjective multi criteria analysis using the mission profile and functional requirements of the vessel and available research & operational data. Most important criteria used are: sufficient capacity to carry 8 completely assembled WTG’s of 7MW in vertical position on deck, sufficient speed potential for good North Sea logistics, good motion characteristics for high installation work-ability, sufficient stability to perform the lifting task. From the multi criteria analysis the SWATH (small water plane area twin hull) appears to be the most promising hull shape and is therefore selected for further analysis. Because Seaway Heavy Lifting has more than two decades experience with mono hull heavy lift vessels, a dual draft mono hull vessel dedicated for WTG installation is also analysed for reference. The dimensions of both vessels are determined based on a parametric study in order to comply with the various design requirements. The required deck area and layout together with the strict stability requirements like drop load criteria and intact stability turned out to be important for overall dimensions of both the SWATH and dual draft mono hull. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis is done on these dimensions to check which ones affect the operability of the SWATH. The stability calculations are validated with the help of recognized stability software. Different speed scenarios are evaluated for a given location to check the dependence on vessel speed, resistance and power requirements which could limit the operability. Based on the derived dimensions both vessels are subjected to multi-body frequency domain motion analysis using a recognized hydrodynamics program. Subsequently the workability of both vessels is investigated using very detailed 2D wave spectral data available for an important North Sea wind farm development area. The results of this thesis are the first steps towards establishing the SWATH as a viable option for operating as a WTG installation vessel. The motion behavior of the SWATH is better than the mono hull in certain important operational conditions. There are some significant advantages which the SWATH exhibits over the Monohull and other hull forms which can be utilized for the purpose of WTG installation and helps in avoiding complex installation systems and techniques to get safe and fast operation.","floating systems; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Floating Structures","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Bos, H. (mentor)","2014","Since 2001 Kuyichi, a conscious fashion brand, has been on a journey to market sustainable denim. Kuyichi is interested in adding a Track & Trace (T&T) feature to their jeans. With a T&T feature the consumer can trace back important production steps and characteristics of the jeans, while being in a store. The purpose of this graduation project was to examine how Kuyichi can highlight sustainability in stores to create competitive advantage, with the use of Track & Trace. Research shows that sustainability is needed in fashion, yet consumers seldom buy clothes from sustainable brands. Although consumers are concerned about sustainability and try to make conscious purchase decisions, their concerns rarely translate into actual behaviour. A part of this non-action might be the consumers’ negligence, though sustainable brands such as Kuyichi could also do more to get noticed and trigger consumers to act. What seems to be missing are specific triggers that would prompt consumers to pay more attention to sustainability and to notice Kuyichi’s sustainable characteristics in the store. Product labels can serve as such triggers, given that they are important as eye-catcher, to assess the quality of the jeans and for branding. In this report different approaches to highlight sustainability were compared, through the design of a new hangtag - a product label attached to clothes with a cord. Kuyichi’s current hangtag emphasises sustainability by using textual information. This is the typical approach used by sustainable brands: providing text about sustainability and its importance. Based on existing literature four alternative approaches were identified for highlighting sustainability: by asking a provocative question about sustainability; through the use of a sustainable material; by evoking self-reflection; and by storytelling. For each approach a concept was designed and tested to see if they showed significant differences in Action-orientation, Attention drawing, and Uniqueness. This was first done in a 1 x 5 between-subjects experimental design conducted in a lab environment (N=107). After data analysis two concepts were selected. A second experiment was conducted in a real store (N=61). Kuyichi’s current hangtag was used as benchmark in both experiments. Results of both studies show that communicating sustainability through text triggers consumers the least. Highlighting sustainability through self-reflection has the greatest impact on the target group’s call to action. This concept consists of a square cardboard with a mirror-silhouette on one side and a ‘production worker’ on the other side. In this way, a one to one connection is made with the maker. Previous studies showed when consumers believe their choices have an impact they are more likely to engage in sustainable consumption. The idea behind the mirror is that it gives a sense of self-reflection. The in-store experiment suggests that Kuyichi’s target group is partly interested in sustainability-related information about the jeans, but a digital Track & Trace feature is not the best way to provide this. Consumers prefer to look at the hangtag or to visit Kuyichi’s website at home for more detailed information. Even though a digital T&T feature will be appreciated by a very small group of consumers, the effect on consumers’ behaviour will probably be low. Therefore the advice for Kuyichi is to drop the digital Track & Trace feature, and instead introduce the selected hangtag to highlight sustainability in stores. Furthermore Kuyichi should improve its corporate website, so it shows a complete overview of Kuyichi’s corporate social responsibility practices. Qualitative feedback from the experiments was used to improve the design of the self-reflection hangtag. The final design includes the topics the target group is most concerned about. According to this thesis, there are: labour conditions in factories, the suppliers’ location and sustainable materials. With this new hangtag that enhances self-reflection, consumers are triggered to act an Kuyichi can differentiate itself from competitors in stores.","competitive advantage; in-store; Kuyichi; intention-behaviour gap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Marketing and Consumer Research","",""

The most important benefit of a NoC compared to a communication bus is that it is scalable. The heart of the NoC is the router, which provides the communication between different computational units. This component is highly suitable to be a 3D component, which means that the connection can go into a vertical direction. This way the NoC is extended, with the same area footprint. This thesis describes the physical design of the 3D router, where various design problems are solved. An existing router architecture is used as a start-point. One of the problems which this thesis is trying to solve, is the reduction of the number of needed data lines. This is especially useful for the vertical data lines, which are implemented with Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). A TSV has a large footprint compared to a transistor, which means it takes up a lot of chip area. This results in increased cost. The reduction of the data lines is accomplished by the serialization of the data. It is determined that the best serialization ratio is 4. The 3D router is also adjusted for asynchronous operation. This is accomplished with the use of FIFOs, two-flop synchronizers and Gray Encoders.","3D; NoC; serialization; asynchronous; router","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Visser, P.J. (mentor); Bisschop, F. (mentor)","2014","Sand dikes have a sand core and a clay layer to protect the core against erosion. It is not unlikely that this layer fails due to several failure mechanisms, exposing the sand core to water. This can be catastrophically when water is overtopping the dike. In case the protective cover fails, water can flow over the core and erode the sand, eventually causing the dike to breach. This breaching process is described and modelled for a better understanding. The BRES-model (BReach Erosion in Sand dikes) was specifically created for sand dikes and is used to simulate this process. It determines, among others, the final breach width, flow rate through the breach and duration of the breaching process. These breach parameters are important for determining rise rates and flow velocities of the water in a polder. By reducing rise rates and flow velocities, which can be achieved by retarding the breaching process, the number of casualties can be reduced. The safety of the inhabitants depends on the mortality during a flood event, i.e. the fraction of casualties of inhabitants in a polder. The safety increases when the mortality reduces, i.e. the amount of casualties decreases. To reach a desired ten times higher safety level, the mortality has to decrease by a factor 10. The breaching process can be retarded in several ways, such as altering the dike shape, increasing the cohesion or strength of the sand core, adding components to the dike or influencing the erosion parameters of sand. Literature research results show that adding a few percent bentonite clay to sand, cementing sand with a biological process or mixing sand with fibres are the most promising options. For these options erosion formulas were determined to implement into the BRES-model. The most promising options were modelled in the BRES-model using a norm dike. The breaching process of this dike was simulated in case it was constructed of sand, mixed with bentonite or fibres, or biologically cemented. The norm dike is the dike which was constructed for the ZWIN’94 experiment. The model simulates the breaching process of these options and the results are compared to each other. From this comparison it is concluded that adding bentonite or polypropylene fibres to sand, or biologically cementing sand lead to similar reductions of the breach parameters. To test the results of the model outcome, laboratory experiments were executed. Sand, sand-bentonite and sand-fibre mixtures were subjected to direct shear, permeability and erosion tests. These tests show that sand-fibre mixtures do not significantly influence the measured parameters of the sand. The sand-bentonite mixtures show a significant reduction of the permeability and erosion velocity compared to sand. The erosion velocities of these mixtures can be modelled in the BRES-model with the Van Rijn-Van Rhee formula. Using the results from the laboratory experiments the effects of bentonite on the breaching process of the norm dike were determined. Even adding a few percent of bentonite reduced the final breach width, maximum breach flow and inundation velocity (rise rate) significantly. For the norm dike it was calculated that 5.4% bentonite is sufficient to reduce the inundation velocity below the threshold value of 0.5 m/h. This results in a reduction of the mortality of approximately a factor ten. Preliminary research indicates it is possible to mix bentonite with sand in-situ, using a Mixed-In-Place technique. A cost indication shows that improving a dike with bentonite using this technique might cost approximately the same as a traditional dike reinforcement. Depending on the circumstances this solution may lead to a decrease of mortality and thus an increase in safety, even by a factor 10.","dike; breach; sand; erosion; flood; BRES; mortality; retarding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Researchers have been investigating the effects of such networks on end-users and called them “Network Externalities”. These network externalities are either direct or indirect. There have been no prior researches on negative and indirect consequences of these networks. The aim of this paper is to observe negative effects of the network on the market from both macro and micro level. Therefore, our main research question is: “Does expansion of network lead to Negative Indirect Network Effects?” The objectives of the present research were to investigate the nature of the network and to acquire more insight into the causes of Negative Indirect Network Effects (NINE) and their impact on network growth, to develop an empirical model for it, and simulate this model in order to have a better understanding of underlying network dynamics. The focus of the present research was on the laptop operation system network. To start with, we reviewed different aspects of this particular network in order to reform a new conceptual model about consumers’ behaviour. Then, we studied three major operating systems (OS) existing in the market today (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux). First, we reconstructed the history of these technologies, their life cycle, network characteristics, network size, and then, we continued with a short history of unwanted complementary products like bugs, viruses, worms, and malware. We surveyed user attitudes for the two main operating systems, Windows vs. Mac OS, and used those insights to make an agent-based simulation derived from our empirical model and mathematical equation. This simulation was applied to different scenarios. Specifically, we found that a network becomes more attractive for unwanted complementary goods when it expands in size. Also, we discovered that an increase in problems for the dominant design will lead to NINE. Importantly, security measures play an important role in the satisfaction of end-users. When users distrust security measures of the dominant technology, they may decide to switch to a smaller and saver network, and create herd behaviour in NINE, leading other end-users or even new consumers to choose for the secondary technology. However, expansion of the secondary design could also attract unwanted actors in its network and same procedure would emerge for the secondary technology as well. Our model is able to explain this recursive S-curve mechanism. Therefore, the present research provides additional understanding for industries to implement dynamic strategies in order concern to NINE. That is, security is important and industries have to be conscious about it and maintain safety measures with the intention of preventing NINE to happen. But also, industries must be aware that end-users should be involved in the feedback process.","network; network externalities; network effects; strategy; operating system; IT consulting; indirect network effects; standard battle; substitute technology; negative indirect network effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","Ever since the first time that the term sustainable development has been used, the attention to approach design with the environment in mind has been growing and several sustainable design strategies have been developed. However, museums do not seem to follow these developments, especially when it comes to the design of (temporary) exhibitions. This master thesis focuses on analysing the possibilities for sustainable development within exhibition design and working out concepts based on these analyses. The research into exhibition design shows that the main aspects that make sustainable development difficult are; the wish to come up with an original design, the strict requirements from museums to protect objects, the lack of knowledge necessary to go for more sustainable solutions, no time or budget to research new solutions, the short lifetime of temporary exhibitions (approx. five months), the lack of an ‘end-of-life plan’ for exhibitions, no sustainability requirements in the exhibition design process and the a negative image of sustainable design within museum. Sustainable design methods like EcoDesign, Cradle to Cradle and Biomimicry were analysed, to see how they could be applied to exhibition design. As a result different focus areas can be formed, of which the most promising was selected, which was formulated as ‘Changing the concept: Rethinking the necessity of the current means that translate the story of the objects to a tangible temporary exhibition, in order to use fewer resources. As a result the experience of the visitors should be improved and the amount of visitors should stay at least the same’. The following steps included the development of several concepts; two were worked out further, a ‘Growing exhibition’ concept and a ‘Local Waste Stream exhibition’ concept. These concepts were applied in three existing exhibitions, to investigate how these concepts can be worked out for different exhibitions. This resulted in the conclusion that there is such a broad range of ways to ‘change the concept’ and that it is very difficult to show all of these in one exhibition design. As each exhibition has and should have very specific characteristics, many very useful solutions would be discarded when the end result of this project would be one design for a specific exhibition. This formed the decision to make a toolkit for exhibition designers who want to create new, sustainable and visitor-focused exhibitions. In this way all the valuable insights from the literature research and the research through design can be made accessible to the world of exhibition design, without losing the uniqueness that each exhibition should have. This toolkit was developed with the help of all the knowledge gained in the analysis and through the designs of multiple concepts for a range of exhibitions. The final design proposed in this thesis is the ‘Changing the Concept’ toolkit, an online toolkit for exhibition design teams. The toolkit takes a team through four different phases (Debriefing, Idea generation, Conceptualisation and Embodiment), in which they have to use a set of standard tools and where they can choose from a range of optional tools. The addition of optional tools to the toolkit answers to the wish of exhibition designers to be original in each new exhibition. The toolkit offers design teams the opportunity to share their knowledge and ideas online with each other, in order to inspire the whole exhibition design field to ‘change the concept’. This graduation project was executed for Ontwerpwerk, a The Hague-based design agency, which initiated the Living Lab ‘Green Museums’, which aims to develop innovative concepts for designing and realising sustainable museum exhibitions.","sustainable; exhibition design; tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","The goal of the graduation project is to explore application possibilities for a novel piezo plastic, that is developed recently at TU Delft, Novel Aerospace Materials group (NovAM) and currently being further developed in the EU FP7 project Light Touch Matters (LTM Project). In that sense the aim is to provide a real life example and context of application that is translated into requirements of material properties. The process of the project relies on a design-driven innovation method that has a double focus:  The novelty of the message/meaning of the new interaction possibilities that the material could bring into a given context.  The novelty of the material by revealing possible new functions and the material’s unique selling points. In the current project a boundary domain of focus is defined, which is the area of Health and Well-being. Based on 1st iteration project results from Light.Touch.Matters, the focus is identified in a need area where such material can make a difference, namely – intelligent self-quantification, with a strong focus of prevention and prediction. During the exploration phase it turned out that the combination of unique technical and sensorial properties of the material makes it possible to envision unusual user-product interactions and create new meanings within the context of self-quantification. The smart attribute of the material, namely that is reacts to “different types of touch” especially the dynamic change during material deflection, make it possible to create scenarios that has a strong focus of non-obtrusive bio-data measurement. Sensorial properties of the plastic – mainly its ductility and 3D shapeability – make it feasible to seamlessly integrate it into wearable clothing. The creation of new meaningful scenarios, through several concept ideas, leads to a final concept/context proposal. Such application features the novel material as an insole that measures real-time pressure distribution during running. The measurement monitors a correct running behaviour and strike pattern. Based on universal running guidelines and individual running assessment feedback is being given to the runner throughout the exercise. In case an overload pressure is detected under inadequate points of the feet, a composed sound feedback is sent to the user In order to relate such concept to future material requirements, it is necessary to build and mimic the experience and measurement itself. Substituting material – PVDF – was used for prototyping, since the development of LTM piezo-plastics are still in initial stage. PVDF has the same technological properties – in sense of output signal – therefore it is suitable to provide real insights for the material development stream based on test results. Iterative prototyping, material and user testing make it possible to reflect on the envisioned context, generate guidelines for further concept development, and provide insights into novel material integration.","Novel piezo plastic; PVDF; application; intelligent self-quantification; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-05-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Een belangrijk statement is dat causaliteit niet gelijk is aan associatie.

(mentor)","2014","The Rhine River and the Meuse River discharge into the southern North Sea, and form the Rhine Region of Fresh Water Influence (ROFI) in front of the Dutch coast. A complex hydrodynamic system is generated, dominated by mixing from strong tides, wind and waves and the stratifying influence of the freshwater and solar heating. This influences the distribution and dynamics of fine sediments. A proper understanding of the system is required to evaluate the effects of human interferences, such as the dredging for Maasvlakte 2. Previous years more insight is gained into the interaction between the tide and the stratification by numerical modelling (de Boer, et al., 2008). Furthermore, various measurement campaigns are carried out to determine the effect of dredging activities for Maasvlakte 2. This Master Thesis presents the analysis of a unique in-situ dataset focused on the different cross- and alongshore processes which induce the onset and breakdown of stratification. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into the complex four dimensional nature of the Rhine ROFI, in order to generate a better understanding of the behaviour of Suspended Particluate Matter (SPM). In October 2011 the Port of Rotterdam Authority (PoR) and NIOZ (Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research) sailed simultaneously on two parallel cross-shore transects in order to conduct measurements, one near Egmond and one near Wijk aan Zee. Salinity, temperature, SPM and velocities were measured. The advantage of measuring along two transects is the extra dimension in alongshore direction. Therefore, a dataset is obtained allowing analysis in four dimensions. In the previous years the four dimensional nature of the ROFI has only been studied with numerical modelling. However, data analysis was only performed with data from a single mooring or a single transect, both of which do not give spatial information in cross- and alongshore direction. The contribution of alongshore advection and straining is investigated with a simplified form of the three-dimensional Potential Energy Anomaly Equation (PEA) (de Boer, et al., 2008), influenced by wind, waves and tide. Tidal analysis is used to investigate the presence of ellipses, which indicate the presence of the plume. After analysis it has become clear that the Northern transect is far more stratified than the expected. It was anticipated that the waters this far north were well-mixed. Instead it is shown that the Northern transect is even more stratified than the Southern transect. The simplified three-dimensional Potential Energy Anomaly analysis shows that cross-shore straining is the dominant process inducing stratification and mixing. Although the other cross- and alongshore processes are also observed and these prove significant as well. However, the alongshore advection works different than expected; it enhances stratification during ebb instead of during flood. This is the result of the more stratified Northern transect in comparison with the more homogeneous Southern transect. Tidal ellipses are observed in front of the coast. The ellipses show that the state of the water column is spring-like, stratification is yet observed. Using two vessels to obtain information in four dimensions is on the verge of what is currently possible with the ships available to the Dutch community. This first measurement in four dimensions with two vessels and using the three-dimensional Potential Energy Anomaly Equation has led to more insights. This study highlights the dynamic and unpredictable behaviour of the Rhine ROFI, as the measurements have led to surprising outcomes.","stratification; Rhine Region of Freshwater Influence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-05-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Vegt, N.J.H. (mentor); Thoolen, F. (mentor)","2014","Over the past centuries our way of working has changed drastically. The computer and related technologies play an important role in that. Nowadays, many people work in an office on a computer, causing them to sit a large part of the day. Sitting is comfortable for many people. However, when done for too long or in the wrong position it can lead to physical and cognitive complains and, according to latest research, it can even cause early death. This new knowledge raises the demand for products to be used in the office that can do something about this work-related problem. For this design challenge the needs of the users and potential buyers were studied, because no good solutions are available yet. Many of the products that are currently on the market look like a direct translation of a fitness machine into an office setting. They hardly comply with the needs of the user in this specific situation. The most important requirement appearing from research and a user study done for this project is the accessibility of the product. For the companies accessibility means simple and affordable solutions that are easy to implement. For the users it means a solution that does not interrupt work flow and that preferably takes no valuable work time to use. The Petsekletser is developed with the user and environment as focus point. It is a product that stimulates movement of the upper body while walking from A to B in the office and in this way preventing stiffness in the upper back and shoulders. Passers-by are triggered to hit a ball that hangs from the ceiling on various walking routes through the office. The movement of hitting the ball at the right height can help in loosening the vertebrae in the upper spine, a place where many complaints occur when working with computers. The Petsekletser not only make the physical activity fun to do, it might also help in preventing upper back pain and stiffness. The Petsekletser is very easy to install. It consists of a main frame that is mounted to the ceiling and that can, in case of a suspended ceiling, replace one or two standard ceiling plates. Two balls at different heights are attached to the frame to provide a good hit for people with different reach heights. The balls include a sensor that can measure the rotation speed which is displayed next to the product. It gives feedback to the user and can in this way increase the use rate. A covering fabric provides a striking look of which the colour and print can be adjusted to the interior of the company. This fabric also prevents the product from making noise when used. Fogg behavioural model has been used to optimize the accessibility of the product. According to this theory trigger, ability and motivation need to happen at the same time. For the Petsekletser this leads to the following situation: Trigger: the Petsekletser triggers people to move their arms at a moment they have time for it (walking from one place to another). By integrating the physical activity with existing work interruptions, employees are not forced to interrupt their work flow. Ability: they do not have to make any more effort than the movement itself; using it only takes a second and a free hand Motivation: if people are still not motivated enough to do it the feedback and playful character are there to stimulate use of the product. The Petsekletser is designed to become a habit so it will be used for a longer period of time. To increase the chance for it to become a habit, the movement is integrated in existing routines: walking a certain route. In this case the trigger – seeing the balls – also plays an important role, just like the reward. The reward is the feedback and, indirectly, a good feeling in the upper body. This feeling can cause craving, which is important for creating habits. The design seems promising. Several companies have showed interest during the testing phase and a first evaluation with a prototype at the Center for People and Buildings resulted in very positive feedback. The balls were hit in sixty per cent of the walks and the users liked the movement and the playfulness it brings to the office. The feedback was appreciated, although this could maybe developed further into more challenging variations. Further development of the product will need to include a more elaborate use study to see the effect of long term use, further embodiment of the design and finding a company that is interested in doing this. The goal of this design challenge was to design something that will actually be used. Therefore, a design direction was chosen that has a subtle impact in this conservative environment; something that could bridge the gap between the current, stiff and sedentary situation and a futuristic, dynamic work place when technology has developed new ways of working. So, the Petsekletser does not provide a daily workout, but it introduces a for the office unusual movement of the upper body and it sets the tone for a more playful work place in which physical activity gets more accepted.","physical activity; office; stimulating; product; Petsekletser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Munnig Schmidt, R.H. (mentor)","2014","This MSc research project is a feasibility study to explore the possibilities of using ferrofluid bearings in high precision, low load applications. Ferrofluids are fluids containing suspended ferromagnetic particles, which are influenced by magnetic fields due to their ferromagnetic properties. In similarity to for example iron powder, a ferrofluid moves towards the location with the highest gradient of a magnetic field. In the case of permanent magnets, the highest gradients occur on the edges. When the ferrofluid is applied on a magnet, pressure builds up within the ferrofluid, providing the ability to carry a load. In this case the ferrofluid acts as a hydrostatic bearing. The absence of stick-slip in these types of bearings makes them suitable for high-precision positioning systems. Ferrofluid bearings might typically be applied in precision XY-stages, as are used in biological microscopic research, where it is desired to image a specimen quickly with high resolution. This is commonly achieved by stitching multiple images of roughly 0.1×0.1 mm together to one full image. For this application, actuation in the planar degrees-of-freedom (DoF) is required. Since the ferrofluid bearings do not restrict rotations, all three (instead of two) planar DoF should be actuated. During planar motion, a ferrofluid trail is left behind, thereby lowering the stage with approximately 2 ?m/mm. When the vertical DoF are also actuated, the stage can bring (and keep) the microscopic sample into focus of the microscope. In order to apply the ferrofluid bearing to the mentioned microscopic application, a 6 DoF motion stage has been built with a planar range of 10×10 mm and a vertical range of 0.2 mm, see Figure 1. The moving stage has a mass of 0.15 kg, resulting in a steady state ferrofluid-film thickness of approximately 80 ?m. The stage is actuated by six Lorentz actuators. The magnetic field that is required for the Lorentz actuators is delivered by the same permanent magnets that are used for the ferrofluid bearings. This synergy between bearing and actuator makes the system compact and lightweight. Each magnet delivers the magnetic field for two coils; one for vertical- and one for planar actuation. The six coils of the Lorentz actuators are etched in a 4-layer printed circuit board (PCB). This PCB simultaneously acts as the surface on which the ferrofluid bearings can move. The non-linear position dependency of the actuator-forces is modelled in Matlab and it is verified that this model describes their behaviour with 95% accuracy. This model is also implemented in the control scheme. Possible microscopic samples can be placed on top of the moving stage. The bottom of this stage (see Figure 2) consists of three magnets, three interferometer mirrors, a PMMA support structure and an iron top-plate. This iron top-plate is used as a target for the capacitive sensors and a flux-path for the magnets, thereby increasing their efficiency. The Lorentz coils are an inductive load, so feedback current amplifiers are required to drive these loads with a flat (input to force) frequency response. Custom-made amplifiers were designed and manufactured of which the gain and current-limit can be altered easily. Their performance was tested up to 30 kHz, resulting in a flat frequency response and a phase lag of only 5 degrees while the cumulative noise-level up to 1 kHz remains lower than 0.025 mA. For validation of the system, a capacitive/interferometric measurement system was used to provide position feedback. These high resolution sensors are by far the most expensive components of the setup. In future applications these sensors could be replaced with for example position sensitive detectors (PSDs) and integrated in the same PCB. The 6 DoF demonstrator stage is a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, but decoupling matrices decompose it into six single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, each having their own controller. The control scheme is built in dSPACE, which executes the high-level programming language of Matlab/Simulink. Open-loop measurements show that up to 500 Hz the planar motion can be treated as a pure mass, so that a simple PID controls are sufficient to control the planar motion up to this frequency. Due to the highly damped vertical motion, a PI-controller is sufficient for out-of-plane control. The behaviour of the demonstrator stage is slightly dependent on its vertical position: when the vertical position is increased, the surface area of the ferrofluid is decreased, causing a lower damping. Planar steps of 0.1 mm settle within 10 nm in 0.03 seconds. The vertical motion has a control bandwidth of 100 Hz, 250 nm steps in this direction have a settling time (position within ±1% of reference) of 0.02 seconds. These specifications allow the system not only to be used in digital microscopy but also in other applications which require higher specifications, such as white light interferometry, where typical vertical steps of half the light’s wavelength (250 nm) are required. The settling times are mainly limited by the maximum force of the actuators. When faster settling times are required in future applications, the system can easily be altered to meet those requirement by adding more layers to the PCB and/or increasing the number windings at each layer. It can be concluded that a system with ferrofluid bearings can be used in low load applications were fast, high precision positioning is required. The ferrofluid bearings do not seem to limit the precision that is achieved by the demonstrator stage.","ferrofluid; linear bearing; six degrees of freedom; nanometer positioning; PID controller","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

These 4D vector fields of the heart are used in clinical research to gain insight in the flow patterns within the heart which in turn can be used to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The temporal, 3D dimensional nature and spatial freedom of the blood flow within the heart all add up to the complexity of the blood flow data which can be a challenge to interpret without a proper visualization. The biggest challenge would be the occlusion of relevant flow patterns due to visual clutter. This work describes a visualization technique called Spatial-temporal Clustering based on Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents, that aims to circumvent the challenges posed by the structural complexity of the flow and give a concise and insightful representation of the blood flow patterns within the heart. This technique uses pathlines to visualize the blood flow of which the placement is determined by a seeding strategy based on a clustering of a scalar metric extracted from the 4D vector fields. This scalar metric is the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent that describes the temporal separation of pathlines. This results in seeding regions (clusters) that create pathline bundles that share the same temporal separation in time and thereby reduce the visual clutter. Aside from the main visualization technique this works also introduces a novel probing technique that highlights the base principles of the FTLE fields to provide the user with a better understanding of how a FTLE field works.","FTLE; vector fields; hierarchical clustering; medical imaging; flow visualization; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics and Visualization","","Computer Science Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","The class of Discrete Event Systems (DES) are systems of which the dynamics consist of the occurrences of discrete events in the time domain. Typical examples of DES from everyday life are transport systems , production facilities or communication systems. Recently legged locomotion has been adressed from the point of view of DES. Here, the continuous motion of each leg is represented by the discrete touch-down and lift-off event of the feet. This abstraction allows for a novel approach in the control of legged robotic platforms. A certain sub-class of DES, the so called Max-Plus Linear (MPL)-DES can be described in a linear fashion using max-plus algebra. An extension to MPL models is the class of Switching Max-Plus Linear (SMPL) models. This extension is used to describe DES that can switch between different modes of operation. In each mode the system is described by a unique MPL state space model. Because of the algebraic structure of the max-plus algebra, stable transient dynamics are guaranteed during a switch of mode of operation. However, very little research has been done on how to decide which mode of operation to switch to, possibly given a certain set of information. This thesis focuses on the development of such methods. In particular, it has been researched how to select the appropriate mode of operation as a function of the measured disturbances and the environment the MPL system operates within. The problem of selecting the most appropriate mode of operation is recast as an optimization problem in a feedback control setting. For the development of such methods an analysis of the structure of MPL state space models is performed. Moreover, it is analysed how one can model disturbances in a MPL framework. Finally, the ordinal optimization method has been extended to incorporate learning. Two feedback methods have been developed. The first is the so called reactive feedback loop. It uses the structural information of the MPL system to mitigate disturbances as fast as possible. The second feedback method is named the deliberate loop. In the deliberate loop a certain performance function is learned as a function of the disturbances, mode of operation and the environment. Then in the optimization procedure to goal is to find the mode of operation that minimizes the approximated performance function. The deliberate feedback method has been implemented on the Zebro, a hexapod robotic walking platform using SMPL models to schedule and control the walking pattern. It has been confirmed that the algorithm optimizes the mode of operation if the performance function is known. However, more experimental data is needed to claim anything about the learning capabilities of the algorithm in practice.","Zebro; max-plus algebra; Ordinal Optimization; max-plus linear systems; SMPL models; CyberZoo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control","",""

A Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) surgery is an effective and common solution for moderate to severe osteoarthritis. After THA surgery patients start a rehabilitation phase in which they have to comply to a rehabilitation regimen. This rehabilitation phase includes execution of physical exercises and compliance to restrictions in their daily life. The patient recovers approximately for 80% after six weeks and 100% after one year. Orthopaedists perceive different rehabilitation outcomes and presume that this is caused by different rehabilitation behaviour of patients. Some patients are acting too passively during their rehabilitation phase, whereas others are acting over-active. Wrong rehabilitation behaviour causes an unnecessary longer rehabilitation time and patient dissatisfaction. Till now, little is known about patient rehabilitation behaviour and techniques to influence this behaviour. Literature research revealed the principles behind rehabilitation. In psychology, rehabilitation is defined as a person making a health behaviour change. In this project, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model was taken as a basis to explain rehabilitation behaviour of patients. This model is a stage model that describes how health behaviour change can take place over time in different phases. Three important initiators for making a health behaviour change are outcome expectancies, risk perception and perceived self efficacy. There are many factors influencing the patient’s health behaviour change, ranging from psychological factors to interpersonal factors. One of these factors is the patient - medical professional relationship. Health care interventions of medical professionals can be improved in many ways. Because of technological developments and use of the Internet patients are becoming more pro-active, which affects the way medical professionals have to approach patients during consultations. Literature gives recommendations about (1) the manner of information provision, (2) the understanding and adaption to the patient’s health beliefs and (2) the involved attitude medical professionals need to have. Comprehensive user studies explored the orthopaedic consultations in practice. The user studies included patient & medical professional interviews, consultation observations and a questionnaire among patients. Patient’s widely differ in how they cope with their rehabilitation. During this project, four different patient types were defined during medical professional interviews with the support of a patient type framework. Combining the literature finding with user study finding resulted in five main insights about the current rehabilitation strategy of hospitals: 1. Orthopaedists have an important advice giving role, but are limited in time 2. Patients do not sufficiently know before surgery what to expect of the impact the rehabilitation period will have on their daily lives 3. The hospital provides limited advice specifically about rehabilitation to the patient and assigns the responsibility about rehabilitation guidance to the local physiotherapist 4. During consultations the rehabilitation advice is mainly provided verbally. Supportive products could improve the rehabilitation advice understanding and remembering of the patient. 5. There is no collaboration between the local physiotherapist and hospital These five main insights formed a basis for the development of three design directions. One of these three design directions has been worked out in this project. The final design brief was: ‘Design an application that supports the communication between the orthopaedist and patient during their first consultation to manage a patient’s personal expectations, taking into account different patient types’ Since from this moment on, the scope was narrowed down to the first consultation of the orthopaedist, a detailed consultation experience journey was developed that represented this consultation. The journey served as a tool to visualise the points of improvement and applicability of the product to the user context. Also, a list of requirements was set out, to give structure to the design process. Because the product would be used in a context that has been described as stressful and time-limited, the product had to be smart and adaptive to the stressful and time-limited situation. The metaphor of looking into a shoebox diorama was taken as the interaction vision, which gave direction the concept design. This methaphor allowed the orthopaedist as well the patient to quickly understand information. In case of the orthopaedist this was valuable to have a quick understanding in his consultation preparation about the patient’s personal context as well physical state. Through an iterative process, including several co-creation sessions with orthopaedists, a final concept was created: BiConnect. BiConnect is an application that serves as a supportive tool for communication during orthopaedic consultations. The main principles of BiConnect are: The main principles of BiConnect are: - Involvement of the patient in his or her treatment path; - Provides tailored and personal advice - Enhances the quality of the conversation, including understanding and explanations, between the patient and orthopaedist during the consultation The overall goal of BiConnect is to let the medical professional and patient effectively talk about the patient’s personal expectations of the rehabilitation period, so that the patient develops realistic expectations resulting in confident and responsible rehabilitation behaviour. The application is used by patients as well as medical professionals during different touchpoints. The patient will have a digital intake that will contribute to a better preparation of patient and orthopaedist. During the consultation BiConnect serves as a supportive tool for communication and after the orthopaedic consultation patients can review and see more information (including their personal advice given during the consultation). Finally, an interactive prototype was build to test the product during consultations. The product was reviewed during two evaluation studies with orthopaedists and patients. The first reaction of patients and orthopaedists on BiConnect during were very positive. The main bottleneck for implementing the product would be the current hospital software systems. BiConnect can work parallel to these systems, but it would be ideal if they can correspond or integrated with each other. BiConnect has the potential to serve for a broader market than only orthopaedic consultations. However, it is recommended that Biomet will bring the product step-by-step onto the market.","patient type; consultations; health care; orthopaedics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-05-13","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","","",""

We define the desirable properties that a balancing mechanism should have and present several mechanisms that satisfy these. We also show that if brokers can actively participate themselves in the regulation it is impossible to create an efficient mechanism with all the desired properties as the problem becomes equivalent to a multi-unit double auction. Finally we identify an open problem in auction theory and propose a 2-item multi-unit auction.","auction; markets; electricity; sustainable; mechanism; game theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Algoritmics","","","",""

(mentor); Tuijthof, G.J.M. (mentor)","2014","Sit-snowboards allow a person with the inability to actively use his/her legs to snowboard while sitting. However, existing prototypes do not allow using a chairlift. The goal of this study was to modify a prototype sit-snowboard, MINI, to add chairlift accessibility. MINI has a seat construction and two handlebars which allow the user to steer the snowboard. After thorough assessment of all constructed design parameters the most important design parameters for this research were determined; 1) the sit-snowboard seat needs to turn 90 degrees with respect to the snowboard, 2) the tubes of the sitting construction have to be constructed differently to allow the chairlift seat to get under the sit-snowboard seat, and 3) the rear handlebar needs to make way to allow space for the chairlift. A redesign of MINI was made with a bearing and locking mechanism for the sit-snowboard seat and detachable handlebars with a locking mechanism. Subsequently the prototype, SnowGo, was built and tested on snowboard-functionality and chairlift accessibility. The test results show that with SnowGo, it is possible to use the chairlift and maintain the ability to sit-snowboard. Using the chairlift without tumbling over during loading and unloading requires practice, but the sit-snowboarder showed that he did not need a lot of practice with SnowGo since he was able to use the chairlift without falling in four out of five trials. Two advantages were that the safety-bar of the chairlift can be closed during the chairlift ride and that the chairlift can be used by the sit-snowboarder completely independent of any help from a second person.","disability; snowboard; sit-snowboard; design; paraplegia; accessibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Standard nonlinear finite element analysis techniques using incremental-iterative solution procedures have been adapted to deal with the sharp softening curves associated with brittle materials, but convergence difficulties have stimulated the development of alternative modelling methods. The sequentially linear analysis method is an attractive alternative approach, since it is driven by increments of damage instead of increments of displacements, force or time. Consequently, this non-iterative procedure circumvents the aforementioned convergence difficulties. This method is still in its development stage and needs to be augmented, verified with tests and validated with experimental results with respect to multiple situations.

(mentor)","2014","Historically, the coastal zone has always attracted people and across the globe the benefits of inlet systems have made communities settle there. The Tu Hien inlet and the Tam Giang–Cau Hai lagoon system in Vietnam are no exception, as approximately half a million people depend on it for their livelihood. Tidal inlets are also known for their volatile and disruptive nature, because they are dependent on the delicate balances between oceanic processes such as tidal flow, wave action and mean sea level, and riverine processes such as discharges and sediment supply. Disturbances of this balance cause changes in the behaviour of the inlet system, which will have an impact on the surrounding coastal area. The crux is that these processes can all be significantly affected by climate change. The goal of this thesis is to understand the effect of changes in climatic conditions on the morphological stability of the Tu Hien inlet. Achieving this goal was done by studying the present day behaviour of the inlet in order to use this knowledge to validate a process-based model for the present day and subsequently applying climate change scenarios to that model. Newly acquired satellite images show that in recent years (since 1999) the behaviour has changed and the inlet is not closing anymore as was the case in the time before 1999. A conceptual model has been created that captures this behaviour of the inlet and shows that in the present day the inlet is often shifting between being narrowed and open. This cycle is caused by the processes of spit growth and widening due to a certain degree of breaching. A simulation strategy has been drafted which is mainly founded on the yearly seasonal character of the forcing conditions. During a simulation of the northeast monsoon the growth of a spit should be visible; during a simulation of the southwest monsoon a status quo should be maintained. To model this behaviour an existing model (Lam, 2009) has been adapted to include sediment transport and morphology. The adapted model has been calibrated to reproduce the sediment transport up and down the Tu Hien coast and subsequently morphology simulations have been carried out to reproduce the desired morphological behaviour. The results show that after a breach the inlet mouth is narrowing and the cross-sectional area reduces until it reaches a certain stable equilibrium by the end of the northeast monsoon period. During the southwest monsoon there is little wave action and the inlet is tide-dominated, it slightly widens but a status quo is maintained. By reproducing the present day behaviour of the inlet the model has been qualitatively validated and is considered suitable for an investigation into the effects of climate change. Four climate change scenarios consisting of combinations of sea level rise, a change in fluvial run-off and a change in wave climate have been applied to the present day model. The model shows that future changes in river flows and waves are of minor importance compared to the effects of sea level rise with regard to inlet stability. The narrowing behaviour which was apparent in the present day is not observed in the climate change scenarios involving sea level rise. An increase in basin area caused by a higher mean sea level enlarges the tidal prism which results in more flushing capacity of the flows through the inlet. The increased flushing capacity ensures that a larger inlet cross-sectional area is maintained and also enhances the locational stability of the inlet. The predicted increase of the morphological stability can be considered a positive development. An increased cross-sectional area and the lack of a narrowing behaviour means that the future morphological behaviour will not have negative consequences for inlet navigability, water quality, ecology and other socio-economic factors. Even though the predictions show that climate change is likely to have a positive impact on inlet stability for Tu Hien, it is emphasised that the overall impact of climate change on low-lying coastal zones may be significant in a negative sense and deserves continuous attention.","Tu Hien; tidal; inlet; climate change; morphology; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","16.355442, 107.918636"

(mentor)","2014","Hilti is a worldwide supplier to the construction industry and their ambitions are to expand bonding with its customers and increase online net sales share percentages. Furthermore Hilti wants to explore the possibilities on creating additional products or services based on smart devices. An extensive research has been performed to be able to associate better with the context of the project and the role Hilti plays in it. Starting with the (internal) analysis for in-depth research on the company. The internal analysis is followed by the external analysis in which the market, industry and trends are analysed. This is done throughout internal documents, objective research, bank reports, industry related magazines, porters 5 model and more. The most important aspect of the analysis is the customer and it’s relation with Hilti. Existing practices in the customers work context have been explored by observation at job-site and sending a survey among selected customers of Hilti. To explore the possibility for improving the interaction between customers and Hilti by the support of smart devices, respondents of the survey were interviewed. The extensive research resulted into three suggested design directions; “Virtual support”, “Don’t stop after the sales agreement” and “Take the customer on a safari”. The outcomes of the analysis was used as input for the synthesis. The synthesis started with the ideation that diverged towards a large number of ideas throughout brainstorm- and creative sessions. There after converge towards three concepts based on the design direction; “Interactive Catalogue”, “Business Development Tool” and “Be Next”. As closure of the synthesis phase the Interactive Catalogue has been selected as final concept based on the ‘best’ match with the companies and customer vision. The interactive catalogue is the transformation from the current paper catalogue into the digital environment with a lot of additional features. The concept aims to; fulfil the customer’s in their information need online, keeping the users up-to-date on Hilti innovations over a certain amount of time and increase their satisfaction during the post-purchase. The interactive catalogue is based on a tablet and makes use of its technical features. Furthermore the catalogue can be personalised and turn into a service tool after the customer is logged in. Being logged in the users are able to receive personal information and order products directly online. All this comes together combined in an attractive and easy to use interface. Eventually a prototype was build to test the concept among the target group during a user test. In the user test participants were asked to complete a scenario task. Both scenario and prototype were designed to mimic reality as much as possible. The test resulted in first recommendations and improvements for the interactive catalogue by Hilti. The validation showed that the target group was convinced that a concept like this would be the future. The interface is attractive and easy to use apart from some advised minor adjustments. In conclusion, the interactive catalogue was very well received, not only by the participants of the user test, but also by Hilti. The design and functionality of this digital catalogue aims to increase the users satisfaction, which results in loyal customers. Furthermore, it is possible to purchase products directly online from the interactive catalogue as well as managing Hilti services, which aim to increase the online net sales share. The opinions remain divided whether this is the best alternative for the paper catalogue. However, this graduation project has triggered Hilti to widen their ‘horizon’ and led to discussions in which the future of the catalogue will be seriously considered. ========================================================================================================== Prototype description; The prototype is simulating a working application on a tablet, in this case the iPad and was used for testing the usability of the interactive catalogue interface design.

(mentor)","2014","Due to the ever growing demand for more efficient aircraft novel aircraft concepts have to be explored. By improving design tools the potential of unconventional configurations can be further studied. This requires improvement of conceptual design tools such that more knowledge can be gathered on alternative solutions as early in the design process as possible. Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) can support this process by providing an environment in which the various disciplines can be designed and optimized concurrently, while a certain level of consistency is maintained. An optimization design tool has been created to assess the potential performance gains of novel aircraft configurations. It connects with the Initiator design tool, which is a conceptual design framework. As such, it can also be used as a means to expose any design issues that may exist in the Initiator. With the optimizer tool the following four case studies were performed: a conventional Airbus A320, a forward-swept canard aircraft, a threesurface aircraft and an oval-fuselage aircraft. For this purpose the genetic algorithm, a gradient algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm were used. From the case studies followed that large improvements can be obtained with unconventional aircraft configurations when compared to the initial aircraft design proposed by the Initiator design tool. Up to 20% improvement was found with the three-surface and canard aircraft. The oval-fuselage aircraft could be improved by a solid 10%, while a 5% improvement was obtained with the conventional A320. Among all cases the most contributing factors were the wing position, sweep angle and aspect ratio. There is a tendency towards lower sweep angles due to the positive effect on the weight of the wing and an underestimation of the drag rise. With the forward-swept canard relatively high sweep angles were found, from which followed that the weight penalty of forward swept wings is underestimated. The sizing routine of the control surfaces is found to be inadequate, since the Initiator derives most parameters directly from the wing and does not properly take into account control and stability requirements. Results have shown that this mainly regards the sweep and dihedral angle. These sizing issues also affect the static margin. It was found that class II design information was not fed back to the control surface sizing. From the used optimization algorithms can be concluded that the gradient algorithm was the least effective as it had difficulties with the noise. It sometimes stopped prematurely or started oscillating. The genetic algorithm was found to be the best option due its robustness. It proved to be far less sensitivity to noise. Its computational cost could be significantly reduced by applying parallel optimization and using a caching mechanism. The hybrid algorithm was found to be too computational expensive. The obtained increase in objective value did not outweigh the added cost.","optimization; aircraft design; mdo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-12","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Aerospace Structures and Design Methodologies","","52.009507, 4.360515"

(mentor); Zhu, X.X. (mentor)","2014","For decades, spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry has evolved into a widely used geodetic method for three-dimensional mapping and analysing the geophysical processes of the surface of the earth. Nevertheless, effects such as atmospheric disturbances, temporal and geometric decorrelation are considered as the main degrading factors for the quality of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products. By overcoming the major deficiencies of the conventional InSAR, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) proved the applicability of the interferometric methods also in monitoring of urban areas by restricting the analysis only on the time-coherent scatterers. In particular, the launch of modern SAR sensors, such as the German TerraSAR-X, characterized with very high spatial resolution and short revisit times has enhanced the capability of PSI in mapping and deformation monitoring of urban areas. However, PSI considers only a single dominant scatterer in each resolution cell which is not a valid assumption in urban areas due to the prevalent occurrences of layover phenomenon. This gives the motivation to exploit the most advanced SAR interferometric method, namely tomographic SAR inversion (TomoSAR) including SAR Tomography and differential SAR Tomography. TomoSAR coupled with very high resolution TerraSAR-X images produces the most detailed multi-dimensional maps of urban areas by distinguishing among multiple scatterers within a resolution cell. Nevertheless in TomoSAR, similar to conventional InSAR and PSI, elevation and deformation rates are estimated with respect to a previously chosen reference point which makes them relative 3D estimates. One unique feature of TerraSAR-X is the precise orbit determination and high geometrical localization accuracy of the sensor. After compensating for the most prominent geodynamics and atmospheric error sources, the absolute two-dimensional (range and azimuth) positions of targets such as corner reflectors and persistent scatterers can be estimated to centimetre-level accuracy, a method called SAR Imaging Geodesy. Moreover, using two or more SAR observations acquired from different satellite orbits, their absolute 3D positions can be retrieved by means of Stereo-SAR. In this thesis a framework is proposed that fuses the SAR imaging geodesy and TomoSAR approaches to obtain absolute 3D positions of a large amount of natural scatterers. The method is further utilized in order to automatically fuse multi-track TomoSAR point clouds. The methodology is applied on four Very High Resolution (VHR) TerraSAR-X spotlight image stacks acquired from the city of Berlin. The horizontal and vertical localization accuracy of the obtained fused point cloud is analysed by comparing them with a highly accurate geo-localized Digital Surface Model (DSM) of Berlin obtained from aerial laser scanning. The fusion of absolute TomoSAR point clouds obtained from cross-heading tracks also allows for the decomposition of the Line of Sight (LOS) motion observations into the real 3D motion vectors. As the final contribution of this study, the 3D motion decomposition of seasonal deformation observations is carried out on two test sites located in the city of Berlin.","Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography (TomoSAR); SAR imaging geodesy; stereo-SAR; urban mapping; deformation monitoring; Point cloud fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Geomatics","",""

The whole “Post Pericardial Flushing project (PPF)” was initiated by Dave Koolbergen and Johan Manshanden as a clinical study to introduce a new technique to actively flush the pericardial section of the human body after open heart surgery. The key functionality of the device is to flush an infusion fluid through the space around the heart sack to make sure the unwanted body fluids and clots are safely drained. Therfore, they will not cause any inflammatory reactions inside the pericardial area in a post-operative state. Within this project several clinical studies and trials are involved. At this stage there was a need for technical development of the experimental prototype which was built by the AMC itself. After a selection procedure I got the opportunity to work on designing the next generation of the pericardial flushing device. The designing project consisted out of three main phases: the Analysis, the Concept and the Embodiment phase. First, in the Analysis phase an internal and external analysis was performed to formulate a final design scope. The result from this analysis phase was a visual with possible design directions. After a selection of the possible design directions the final scope of this project is described as follows: 1. Design a casing to increase the safety and hygiene of the device 2. Increase the user friendliness of the device 3. Reduce the dimensions of the device The design project was carried out with great attention for the user; User Centred Design. The current prototype of the AMC was functioning, but minimal attention was paid to the user experience of the device: the IC-nurses, the surgeons, the OR-staff and of course the patient itself. The introduction of this new vision created a lot of “positive buzz” inside the AMC. Everyone knew about the developments and people were getting more and more enthusiastic. Subsequently, in the Concept phase many ideas were generated and a final concept was designed. It all started with brainstorm sessions with several stakeholders so the total spectrum of wishes was carefully analysed. Next, the iterative process of creating concepts started: start with a great variety of idea sketches and conclude with one feasible concept. Major outcome was the transformation of the 1.80 meters tall stand-alone AMC prototype to an integrated device into the back of the IC-bed without using any unnecessary space. The result is an almost invisible medical device on the back of the IC-bed for the patient and an intuitive medical assisting device for the medical professionals to work with. Finally, in the Embodiment phase a prototype was created. Extensive optimizations were made to make the step from feasible concept to feasible prototype. Aspects such as materials and production methods greatly influence the manufacturability of the prototype. After this engineering step the prototype was produced and evaluated in several clinical lessons given by Johan and myself. The development of the design can be found in the timetable of the design.","Design; Medical; Cardiothoracic; Surgery; Innovation; open heart surgery; Heart; User centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-05-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","The need to increase specific impulse of rocket launcher engines has lead design engineers to start development of ever more complex engine cycles starting from simple gas pressure fed engines to the very complex staged combustion cycle engines. Currently a wide range of different cycles does exist. These cycles not only differ in terms of performance, but also in terms of mass, cost, reliability etc., which in general makes it difficult to quickly determine which cycle is best suited for a certain mission or task. For this a tool that is capable of analysing different cycles and the impact of design choices has been developed. The tool, named LiRA, has as goal giving the user better system level understanding of the different possible engine cycles and the functions of the components; it can therefore provide valuable and time saving assistance during design or in analysis and optimisation studies. A modular approach is applied where engine components are sized using a performance, dimension and mass model who make use of corrected ideal rocket theory and empirical relations. This work focuses mainly on the methodology and the construction of the models, and further includes the optimisation of an upper stage and a verification, validation and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the tool and the optimisation to assess its accuracy, precision and applicability. The completed program has proved to confirm known trends and known cycle characteristics like the mass savings that can be achieved when using turbo-pump fed engines instead of pressure fed engines for mid- to high-thrust booster applications. Further the superior performance of closed cycles, especially staged combustion cycles has been confirmed, and some cycle specific design choices like the need of bypasses in expander cycles have been explained. The tool however is not complete and should be expanded; the addition of a cost and reliability assessment model is for example strongly recommended. There also remain issues with the accuracy and uncertainty of certain estimates which make that the current version should only be used for comparative studies.","Liquid Rocket Engine; Design; Optimisation; pressure fed; gas generator; staged combustion; expander cycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

On the one hand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the most commonly used tool for measuring the environmental performance of a product, including the raw materials a company buys, and can greatly assist managers in material selection process. On the other hand, assessing a supplier’s potential for improvement is also important when an organization seeks to achieve certain environmental targets concerning their supply base, taking into account the limited resources available. In the context of this thesis a methodology for developing a green supplier segmentation tool, incorporating information from LCAs, is proposed as a means to identify and prioritize sustainability related opportunities regarding suppliers. In this methodology, fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) using fuzzy preference programming (FPP) is utilized in order to solve the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem of supplier evaluation. Additionally, the methodology is applied in a real world case and the results serve as the basis for further recommendations.","supplier segmentation; green supplier selection; supplier development; green supplier management; fuzzy AHP; sustainability; carbon footprint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","TLO","","MOT","",""

This dataset contains a wide variety of human generated spelling errors, and consists of over 1.4 million instances. It can serve as a basis for further research. The obtained dataset showed to be a valuable source for the creation of an error model, with which we could improve the ranking of candidate replacement words. This model takes the character context in which erroneous edit operations occur into account, and therefore reflects what kind of edit operations are more likely to occur. The spellchecking results using our dataset show that the context-based approach used, works for both the detection of errors and the ranking of candidate replacements. A comparison with literature was made to assess if the technique used performs as good for Dutch as for English and we conclude that the performance is comparable.

(mentor); Loth, M. (mentor)","2014","This project is part of the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Delft University of Technology. Due to the lack of proper sanitation facilities in Indian slums, there are hardly any possibilities for women to discretely manage their menstrual affairs during the day. If women are not able to address their personal hygiene during menstruation, urinary tract infections may occur and women tend to feel unclean and insecure. Additionally, many women are harassed or raped when they try to find a secluded area to manage their personal hygiene. The lack of proper sanitation facilities results in both health related problems (infections, diseases) and psychological problems (stress, insecurity). During a month long field research in the slums of Ahmedabad (India), several sessions with female slum dwellers were conducted to collect information about the needs and habits regarding menstruation. Although menstruation is a societal taboo in India, the participants of the sessions discussed this topic openly. Most Indian female slum dwellers use ‘cloths’ during menstruation. These cloths are made from old saris (Indian clothing) and can be reused. The women do not only wash their sanitary products before reusing, but also before disposal. This is because the women are very conscious about what happens with the feminine hygiene product (FHP) after usage. Finding a place to properly (and discretely) dispose the FHP can therefore be a challenge. Given the societal taboo and the risk of harassment, it is not surprising that the women indicated that privacy is crucial during the management of menstruation. They ratherpostpone taking care of their personal hygiene than risk being seen by men. This need for privacy is especially important when menstrual blood (stains) and private body parts arevisible. The insights from the field research were used to develop a “feminine hygiene room” (FHR) that is going to be part of the toilet facility designed by the RTT team of the TU Delft. This FHR should allow women to pursue their changing ritual during menstruation and to wash their FHPs in a way that is common and comfortable. In the feminine hygiene room, the women can change and immediately clean their used FHP. To make sure that the bloodstains can be properly washed out, the women have the possibility to soak the FHP beforehand. The women can then go to the washing area in the FHR and properly clean their FHP with water and soap. Privacy is crucial; outsiders should under no circumstances be able to look inside the changing facility. The final design of the FHR offers a nice, safe and clean place where women can manage their menstruation.","menstruation; India; slums; BOP; women empowerment; sanitation; interaction; laundry; personal hygiene; Feminine Hygiene Products; menstruation management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

FRAMEWORK The reversal theory, from M.J.Apter, was used to explain the dynamics that bring passengers to be stuck in the same mental condition for many hours, and how this leads to a drastic drain of mental energy. PROCESS Object of this graduation project was to explore different opportunities for varying the stimulation on board making the situation more dynamic. The direction taken focuses on mental energy in relation to physical well being, mens sana in corpore sano. VISION It is important to enable passengers to have healthy behaviours during the flight, in order to provide them with an energising experience. CONCEPT Spring of well-being is a product system in which passengers are provided with their own water container which they can refill at the water points in the aircraft and then store at their seat, to have water always close at hand. The container also gives an indication of how long before it was used, to remind users to drink. DESIGN GOAL The goal of the design is to engage passengers throughout the journey and to persuade them to have a pro-active behaviour to improve their health. The combination of staying hydrated, reactivating the circulation walking to the water point, and changing situation, has the potential to increase passengers mental energy and therefore fulfil the goal of the project. PRODUCT The product is called Bota, a bota bag is a traditional soft water container, used to carry liquids around. It was chosen because it conveys a careful and refreshing interaction. The product is a food safe plastic water pouch with spout, with a plastic nozzle and a lid. The drop shape communicates the purity of water. And the silicon valve in the nozzle helps to give the feeling of current water. Bota also has a nudge to stimulate passengers to drink frequently.","reversal theory; in-flight experience; mental energy; water pouch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design aesthetics","","Double master programme IPD DFI","",""

(mentor); Hekkert, P.P.M. (mentor); Janssen, A. (mentor)","2014","This research and design graduation project revolves around two topics: sustainable meat consumption and the impact design can have on attitude-behavior consistency. The project is a collaboration between Wageningen UR Livestock Research (WUR) and Delft University of Technology. WUR is currently seeking solutions to increase the sustainability of meat consumption and this particular project is an attempt to find a design solution to this problem, by focusing on the relationship between consumers and meat products. The first part of the project is mainly dedicated to understanding the domain of meat consumption. The ViP method served as an aid in this process. A variety of relevant and inspiring contextual factors were collected to support the development of an appropriate and viable design solution. This subjective selection of factors forms the backbone of a statement: “We want to help consumers behave in line with their attitudes, by strengthening their association between meat products and their impact on sustainability issues.” After the formulation of an interaction vision and desirable qualities of the future product or service a firm preparation was completed for the development of ideas and concepts. The final concept is Tomorrow’s Menu, a service that helps people consume meat according to their intentions. It distinguishes three farm types on the basis of their sustainability. Consumers can become a member of the farm type that fits their personal values best, by making an online prepayment per kilo of meat. This money directly supports the sustainability measures of that industry. In the supermarket consumers can easily find the meat that comes from their chosen farm type and get a large discount on all of its products. Tomorrow’s Menu reconnects consumers and farmers and helps every party involved to contribute to a brighter, more sustainable future. In the final part of the project, the Tomorrow’s Menu service concept is used as a means to research and manipulate the consistency between people’s attitudes and behavior. This research was executed in collaboration with the University of Groningen. An online study across a time span of several weeks was done to measure the correlation between people’s attitudes towards sustainability issues and their meat consumption behavior. Data of a control group and a treatment group are compared to determine the effectiveness of the design intervention.","design; sustainability; attitude-behavior consistency; food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van der Woude, S. (mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Labouchere, P. (mentor)","2014","In the Netherlands, when a bored tunnel has to be constructed, a launch and a reception shaft have to be excavated to guarantee sufficient cover. This is necessary to ensure face stability, prevent uplift and risk of blow out. Moreover, especially in the western part of the Netherlands, the first 10 to 20 meters of soil consists of the Holocene layer consisting of soft clays and peat. By starting the tunnelling process at sufficient depth, the tunnel will be driven through the Pleistocene and and the soil deformations will remain small. In 2009, a new method was introduced in Japan: the Ultra Rapid UnderPass (URUP) method. With this method the tunnel boring machine (TBM) starts tunnelling from ground surface level. Consequently there is no more need for a launch and reception shaft. This eliminates the need for expensive shafts which are time-consuming to build, which makes the URUP method interesting to apply in the Netherlands. However, applying this method will result in small covers at the beginning and the end of the tunnel lining. Therefore complications are to be expected. In this report, the feasibility of this method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is assessed by investigating the main complications associated with this method (tunnelling with marginal cover method) in the Netherlands. As a basis for the feasibility study a reference project, which is planned for the near future, is used. The reference project “Rijnlandroute” is situated in the west of the Netherlands (between Leiden and Voorschoten), where the first 11 meters consist of Holocene soft soil. For this thesis only the eastern start of the tunnel is considered, that is located in a polder. The groundwater level is located approximately one meter below surface level and the surrounding area is largely greenfield. Firstly, the soil deformations in the Holocene layer, when placing the TBM at surface level, are determined. It can be concluded that without ground improvement the settlements will become too big. It is therefore recommended to apply Mixed In Place columns, that have been applied successfully several times in the past for similar cases. When the TBM reaches the Pleistocene layer, ground improvement is no longer required and deformations remain small. Due to the high groundwater table an embankment is necessary in permanent situation to prevent uplift. Moreover, the tunnel invert has to be filled with a sand ballast as well. During construction (ballast is not constructed yet) the water level will be drawn down temporarily with a maximum of two meters. Due to the absence of cover at start of the tunnelling process, the force distribution in the lining differs from the conventional method. The axial loads are negligible, whereas bending moments still exist resulting in opening up of the joints, which might cause leakage. Therefore it is required to increase the capacity to withstand high bending moments when tunnelling with shallow covers. The required embankment will increase the normal force. However, this increase is too low to counteract the occurring bending moments in the lining. The Japanese box, which is a bolt type where the tension forces are transferred directly to the reinforcement, will be applied (permanently). This bolt type can withstand higher forces, though this bolt type will increase the construction costs. It can be concluded that despite these issues, tunnelling with marginal covers is feasible in the Netherlands. To gain more insight in the relative benefits of this method compared to the conventional method, both are assessed, considering the costs as well as the construction time. The comparison shows that the total construction costs only differ 1.8 % (the costs of the conventional method will be 1.8 % higher). However, the construction of the tunnel with the marginal cover method will result in a shorter construction time. The construction time of the conventional method is approximately four years whereas the construction time of the tunnel applying the tunnelling with marginal cover method only amounts approximately three years. Therefore, it will be efficient to apply this method in the Netherlands. However, despite the feasibility and efficiency of this method in the Netherlands, it cannot yet be concluded if tunnelling with marginal cover will be recommended in future. Further research is still required to conclude if the marginal cover method will be successfully. With this thesis it can only be concluded that the tunnelling with marginal cover method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is feasible in the Netherlands.","TBM; starting from surface; settlement; deformation; buoyancy; tunnel lining; URUP; UltraRapid Underpass; Rijnlandroute","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

It currently has a beer range of more than twenty different beer styles. The focus of the assignment for Brouwerij Klein Duimpje was to define a strategy to attract more consumers to buy Klein Duimpje beers. During the analysis it was discovered that the greatest potential for Klein Duimpje’s beers are in the local region around the brewery: the Bulb Region. This region has a unique local heritage, and is annually visited by around 800.000 day trip tourists, especially around the flowering season. Moreover, Brouwerij Klein Duimpje currently has a unique selling point as the only microbrewery in the local area, and the only location that serves such a wide range of craft beers in its tasting room. Then it was discovered that many restaurants are also interested in serving local craft beer. Lastly, for the brewery itself it was most profitable to sell its beers directly at the brewery. Following the insights, the following vision was formulated. “Klein Duimpje should attract more tourists and locals of the Bulb Region to the tasting room, inspire them with a passion for craft beer, and enable them to spread this passion with others.” Accordingly, a strategy was developed that connect to this vision. For this strategy a concept was developed for the redesign of Klein Duimpje's beer labels. Furthermore several touch points were designed to make the vision happen.","branding; beer; business strategy; local; social media","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Eijk, A.C. (mentor)","2014","Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) allows spectral tissue sensing through optical fibers at the tip of a needle, endoscope, or other medical device. A so-called photonic tool could be applicable in a variety of application areas to aid in diagnostic decisions or to support image-guided procedures. The use of light in combination with medical imaging techniques is clinically appealing, since an optical technique can detect physiological and biological changes whereas medical imaging techniques provide morphological information. The objective of this thesis was to design a user interface for a photonic tool that provides real-time tissue information during image-guided procedures. To determine the possible parameter output of a photonic tool and to identify parameter visualization possibilities a background analysis was performed by means of a literature study (Chapter 1). Afterwards, the influencing factors in relation to a user interface design were investigated (Chapter 2). Next, the viable focus areas for a photonic tool user interface were defined according to an exploratory research and a literature study (Chapter 3). Thereafter, a feasibility study of a photonic tool device within two focus areas was performed by focus area specific interviews and observations. During these interviews, static prototypes were used to identify user preferences in relation to the visual feedback (Chapter 4). Subsequently, an advice was created for the photonic tool user interface design within the two focus areas (Chapter 5). The user interaction with a simulated photonic tool in relation to a specific visual feedback design was studied. A dynamic prototype was used that could provide three visual feedback types: numerical, graphical, and a combination (Chapter 6). Finally, conclusions and future steps were defined to promote the further development of the photonic tool user interface (Chapter 7). The main conclusions of the background analysis were that the parameter output is application dependent and can aid in tissue characterization by a full spectrum or extracted optical properties from the spectrum. Furthermore, a user interface overview is created to show visualization possibilities. Additionally, visual feedback and workflow considerations are defined that can be used as a guideline during the user interface design process. Next, the dependent factors are identified that influence the user interface design: the environment, clinician, procedure, and patient. A photonic tool appears to be beneficial for cancer detection, tissue layer detection, and surface detection. The chosen viable focus areas are nerve block and bronchoscopic lung biopsy procedures. Within the nerve block application area the parameter output depends on the experience level of the anesthesiologist, the bock location, and block type. For the lung biopsy application area, target reach feedback (i.e. tumor identification) is required. An overview regarding the type of information, and the visual feedback and workflow requirements & desires are presented that led to focus area specific user interface scenarios. One user interface scenario for the lung biopsy application is tested based on three visual feedback types. The type of visual feedback that is provided to the subject influences the performance in relation to the length of time, accuracy, and needle path towards the target area, a peripheral lung tumor. A graphical feedback type is required on a user interface display to increase user performance. Furthermore, the simulation study resulted in new design recommendation that defined the final step in this iterative user interface design process.","User interface design; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Image-guided techniques; Lung biopsy; Nerve block; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-05-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Schmehl, R. (mentor); Tiso, P. (mentor)","2014","This thesis investigates the dynamic modelling of a kite power system. The goal was to create a model that is able to capture the complex flight dynamic behaviour of a kite. A proof-of-concept already existed. From that work the steady fluid-structure interaction (FSI) module, using finite elements (FE), was used and coupled to a bridle and tether model. The bridle and tether model is based on an existing tether model that used spring-dampers. The tether model was then extended to include the full bridle system and steering due to line deflection. The focus thus lies in their coupling. An interface was created to couple the two models, such that the dynamic bridle model calls the FSI model at the end of every time step. For stability reasons the ends of the bridles were included in the FE model, so that high forces perpendicular to the bridle lines are avoided. In addition, spring-dampers with a low stiffness but high damping were placed between the bridle boundary points. Yet, due to a lack of aerodynamic damping in the FSI module, the kite proved to be unstable. Therefore artificial damping was implemented, based on the differential between the bridle particles' individual velocity and the wing's overall velocity. This resulted in a model capable of simulating the dynamic flight behaviour of a kite power system. This was compared to the empirical turn rate law, which was tuned to KitePower's technology demonstrator. It was found that the turn rate of the simulation matched qualitatively, but not quantitatively, due to the inevitable need for artificial damping.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

Currently, two compilers exist that target the ?-VEX processor: a HP-VEX compiler and a GCC-based compiler. We show that both compilers have disadvantages that are very dif- ficult to fix. Therefore we have built an LLVM-based compiler that targets the ?-VEX processor. The LLVM-based compiler can be pa- rameterized in a way similar to the HP-VEX compiler. Furthermore, we will present certain optimizations that are new for LLVM-based compilers. These optimizations include a custom machine scheduler that avoids structural and data hazards in the generated binaries. Finally, we demonstrate the operations of the LLVM-based compiler and compare the performance of generated binaries with the exist- ing compilers. We will show that the LLVM-based compiler exceeds the performance and code quality of the GCC-based compiler. Bina- ries generated with the HP-VEX compiler outperform those of the LLVM-based compiler.","LLVM; Compiler; ?-VEX","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","One of the vital safety mechanisms in the reactor core of most nuclear power plants is the negative feedback from the core temperature on the power output. An increased temperature will reduce the power output of the reactor, 'automatically' cooling the it and preventing the nuclear reaction to spin out of control. For this reason, it is important to have a good understanding of the temperature distribution within the reactor core. The water that flows through the core is the main reason for the transport of heat, hence it is of interest to have a good understanding of the behavior of the flow. On of the aspects that defines the flow properties is the geometry of the reactor, a so called 'rod-bundle geometry'. It is the presumption that a large shear in the fluid, induced by the geometry, causes the formation of largescale coherent structures. These structures affect the mixing of heat in the reactor and are, therefore, of interest.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering / Radiation Science and Technology","","Transport Phenomena / Nuclear Energy and Radiation Applications","",""
