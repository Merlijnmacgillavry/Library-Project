With the advancement in sensor technology and access to big data, it becomes possible to understand driver behaviour at a more fundamental level. This can assist in mitigating the impact trucks have on the environment while enhancing safety. Several studies have worked towards examining the predictability of driving behaviour through driver profiling (i.e. scoring a driver's behaviour or classifying drivers by assigning them different categories such as aggressive/non-aggressive). However, little research still focuses on the importance and impact of individual features used to develop these models. In the current study, an analysis of driving data from 1,727 trucks recorded over one year as part of a Dutch Field Operational Test (FOT) has been performed. This FOT, to date, has not been investigated in the published academic literature. Recent studies have analysed historical location data to assess risk associated with specific routes and environments. This is being used to provide notifications to drivers around work zones to mitigate the impact of accidents. <br/><br/>The current thesis extends the geo-specific analysis of (truck) driving data by analysing stability in truck driving behaviour with a focus on time and location (urban areas and motorways). Here correlation analysis has been used to explore stability. Correlational analysis elucidates that metrics such as the number of headway warnings, braking events and lane departure warnings are stable over space and time. A discussion reflects on the role of vehicle characteristics (i.e. mass and engine power) towards stability. <br/><br/>It is concluded that in the case of spatial stability: Mean point speed has higher stability on motorways than in urban areas. It has been determined that trucks with higher mass and lower engine power tend to have lower mean speed than the norm. Contrary to mean point speed, headway warnings show higher stability in urban areas than on motorways. Braking events and lane departure warnings exhibit high stability. Secondly, a strong correlation between (t and t+1) hours over the entire day is observed for temporal stability. <br/><br/>This research is a precursor to building generalised models for profiling drivers and assessing various driving patterns. An in-depth understanding of different driving patterns can help driver coaching companies better understand metrics when time and location are factored in before providing targeted feedback. Apart from this can also facilitate fleet management. The code for analysing this dataset is accessible online and may stimulate future researchers to explore this dataset further.","driver behaviour; Stability; Heavy duty vehicles; Reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

(mentor); Bauer, P. (graduation committee); Santbergen, R.

Despite the widespread benefits that VIPV and V2G have to offer, their potential impact on battery life governs their economic viability. Current studies on the impact of VIPV and V2G on battery life are often simplistic, use unrealistic battery data, and rarely investigate methods to reduce battery ageing. To fill this research gap, this study combines validated models to determine the impact of VIPV and V2G on EV battery life and investigates methods to reduce battery ageing. <br/><br/>First, an EV battery data generation model was developed to simulate EV load profiles with and without VIPV and V2G. Afterwards, a one-year mobility and charging profile was constructed based on EV driving data in the Netherlands and Germany. Subsequently, driving cycles were simulated using Lightyear’s Vehicle Performance Model (VPM) to generate realistic per-second EV battery data. Following this, VIPV power generation profiles for the Netherlands and Spain were modelled using Lightyear’s SolarSimulator tool. Thereafter, two load profiles of V2G services in the Netherlands were modelled, namely day-ahead electricity trading and automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR), both with a battery capacity retention limit during V2G of 50% state of charge (SoC) and 20% SoC. The VIPV and V2G load profiles were merged with EV battery data to generate eight EV battery datasets. Finally, the EV battery datasets were implemented in a semi-empirical NMC-based ageing model (NMC-AM) and a semi-empirical LFP-based ageing model (LFP-AM) to determine the impact of VIPV and V2G on battery life. <br/><br/>Results from the EV battery data generation model show that gradual VIPV charging can reduce the annual grid charging frequency by 23% in the Netherlands and 44% in Spain. Reduced grid charging frequency due to VIPV caused the battery to range at lower SoC, which is beneficial for battery calendar life. Consequently, NMC-AM suggests that VIPV could extend battery life by 6 months, while LFP-AM suggests a battery life extension of 2 months. However, additional irregularity in the load profile due to gradual VIPV charging is likely to have caused the ageing models to overestimate cycling ageing. Furthermore, the ageing models suggest that additional cycling due to V2G, with the aim of maximising profits for the EV owner, could shorten battery life by 7.8 to 12.5 years for NMC and by 1.2 to 3.9 years for LFP. The results of the ageing models indicate that LFP batteries are more resistant to additional cycling than NMC, which is in line with literature. <br/><br/>Additionally, simulated scenarios in which the SoC was kept at 50% or 100% for one month per year, showed that SoC regulation could extend battery life by up to 2 years, allowing for 38,000 km of additional driving range before the battery reaches its end of life (EoL). Furthermore, results suggest that VIPV could lower battery temperature by 10 °C within one sun hour and can keep the battery cool when parked in the sun, by 23 °C in the Netherlands and 35 °C in Spain. Ageing simulations in which VIPV was used to cool the average annual battery temperature by 5°C, suggest that VIPV can extend battery life by up to 4.6 years, allowing for 88,000 km of additional driving range before the battery reaches its EoL. SoC regulation can be performed by delayed VIPV charging, delayed grid charging, or V2G. Battery temperature regulation can be performed using VIPV or grid power. Taking electricity cost into account, grid-powered battery temperature regulation could prove to be a cost-effective method to extend battery life, especially for EVs experiencing extreme temperatures. <br/><br/>Furthermore, as semi-empirical ageing models often lack clarity regarding their implementation, are usually not based on ageing tests with irregular load profiles, do not consider path dependency, are based on accelerated ageing tests under limited operating conditions and on a particular battery cell chemistry and size, applying these ageing models on irregular load profiles or other cells may lead to ageing estimation errors. Consequently, to determine how VIPV impacts battery cycle life, it is recommended to conduct battery ageing tests under identical operating conditions, with and without VIPV. Further research on the impact of VIPV on battery life would help develop strategies that optimally balance VIPV power used for battery charging and for battery temperature regulation. <br/><br/>Concluding, this research shows promising initial findings on methods to reduce battery ageing using VIPV and V2G, which could further improve their business case, accelerating the transition to sustainable mobility. <br","battery; ageing; degradation; VIPV; V2G; Li-ion; calendar; cycling; modelling; semi-empirical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Šavija, B. (graduation committee); Lukovic, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Research about alkali-activated materials or geopolymers has increased in the past decade as they are regarded as a potential replacement to cement-based materials. This is due to the fact that alkali-activated materials possess several advantages over cement-based materials, and the most important one is that they are more sustainable to the environment, as they have less CO2 emissions, less energy consumption during the production process, and the use of byproducts as a binder.<br/>The main aim of this work is to develop a mixture that has superior buildability properties with an open time of two hours or more. In order to achieve this, the effect of admixtures, specifically retarders and viscosity modifying admixtures had to be studied. The use of admixtures in geopolymer has been regarded as a complex subject because multiple factors influence their effect on the mixture, like: binders used and their percentages, alkaline activator used, and liquid to binder ratio. <br/>In this work, the effect of 3 retarders: sucrose, sodium chloride, and sodium borate on the setting time, flowability, and yield stress development was studied. Moreover, the effect of those retarders was studied with the addition of viscosity modifying admixtures: nano-clay (attapulgite), xanthan gum, sodium carboxymethyl starch, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose on the same properties.<br/>The binders and the alkaline activator used were fixed through out the entire work. the binder composed of 60% fly ash, 20% blast furnace slag, and 20% glass wool. The alkaline activator consists of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate with a SiO2/Na2O ratio of 1.5. <br/>The addition of sucrose didn’t lead to any delay in the setting time. While both sodium chloride and sodium borate delayed the setting time, increased the flowability, and improved the extrudability of the mixtures. Out of the viscosity modifying admixtures, attapulgite had the most positive effect as it improved the thixotropic behaviour of all the mixes and improved the yield stress. Sodium carboxymethyl starch and cellulose almost had the same effect on the all the mixtures as they both improved extrudability and the yield stress in a similar trend. Xanthan gum was considered a poor admixture to be added to this mixture as it led to significant dryness which led to loss in fluidity which affected both flowability and extrudability.<br/>The most suitable design was the B3lbA0.5 mixture which has 3% borax and 0.5% attapulgite and a liquid to binder ratio of 0.45. It had an initial setting time of more than 8 hours, flowability was maintained for 2.5 hours and it remained extrudable for 2 hours. Its yield stress ranged from 1360.87 Pa to 1977.78<br/>Pa. After 28 days, it had a flexural and compressive strength of 5.72 MPa and 30.42 MPa respectively. Moreover, the flexural and compressive strength of 3D printed prisms was tested in the vertical and horizontal direction on the 7th day. The results showed that the flexural strength of the 3D printed prism tested in the vertical direction was the highest compared to the cast prism and 3D printed prism tested in the horizontal direction by 0.29% and 0.43% respectively. While the compressive strength of 3D printed cube tested in the horizontal direction was higher than both the cast cube and the 3D printed cube tested in the vertical direction by 0.24% and 0.32% respectively. The strength results indicate that<br/>the mixture could be used in structural applications. The tensile bond strength was 0.69 MPa and the failure occurred near the glue, meaning that the interface is stronger than the material. In 3D printed concrete, usually the interface between the layers is the weakest point, however due to the addition of attapulgite the interface was strengthened. This explains why the compressive strength in the horizontal direction was higher than the vertical one as the interface was no longer the weak link in the specimen. The mixture’s buildability wasn’t optimal as the bottom layer had a slight big deformation and it had only<br/>ten layers of printed material, but that is reasonable since the open time is 2 hours. This means that for big spans this mixture can be useful as it can be printed for a long period of time and its yield stress will develop.<br/>In order for the mixture to be printable, it had to have an initial setting time higher than three hours, a spread diameter between 150-200mm and a yield stress above 1400 Pa. The above mentioned results<br/>fall within the range of values that were needed to have a printable mixture. However, after printing the mixture it was concluded that a spread diameter of 150-180mm and a yield stress above 1600 Pa would be more suitable for both printability and buildability, because when the spread diameter was above<br/>180mm and the yield stress was lower than 1600 Pa, the mixture’s viscosity impacted the buildability.","3D Printing; Alkali-Activated Materials; Admixtures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Wool2Loop",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In order to help the building and construction sector move towards a Circular Economy and lower its environmental impact, a better founded choice regarding the design and selection of building materials for a building’s load bearing structure is required. By investigating different design strategies that focus on optimizing various aspects of the Circular Economy, an office building can be designed in such a way that it matches both the initial client’s requirements as well as possibly changing future needs. Different design strategies then lead to varying lay-outs of a building’s load bearing structure and the building material it’s made of. <br/>By ranking ten design perspectives in varying orders, three main design strategies can be formed. The first one maximizes a building's technical service life, thereby limiting the use of new materials and energy during maintenance activities. The second strategy aims for a maximal functional service life, by making the original building fit for possible other functions in the future. The final strategy maximizes a building's residual value, which includes re-use of building elements in new projects. <br/>The next step is to link these design strategies to various criteria that can be included in the Multi Criteria Analysis. This results in a total of nine criteria, some of them being linked to the characteristics of a building material and the type of connections that come with that material. Other criteria depend on the design of a load bearing structure, such as the total weight of a structure, its ECI value and a cost indication. Now, all these MCA criteria can be given different weights, according to their level of importance per design strategy.<br/>Finally, the MCA as explained above, can be tested on a case study from Witteveen+Bos. Based on the Program of Requirements as formulated by the client, both design strategy 2 and 3 could be followed during the design phase. The main difference between these two strategies can clearly be seen in the lay-out of the load bearing structure’s. After completing the MCA for both strategies, it can be concluded that a bolted steel structure is most likely the best option for design strategy 2. On the other hand, a bolted CLT structure seems to be the best solution when designing according to design strategy 3 for this specific case study. Concluding these results, it can be stated that the MCA can indeed help in selecting a design and building material, however in some cases, the differences between some building materials seem limited. Therefore, it can be said that the MCA is more likely to be helpful in eliminating some of the building materials from next design steps, based on their low MCA results.","Environmental impact; Design strategy; Multi Criteria Analysis; Material selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

In some tasks, an AI system by itself will take over tasks, but in other tasks, an AI system making decisions on its own would be undesired due to ethical and legal reasons. In those cases, AI can still be of help by forming human-AI teams, in which humans get advice from the AI system helping them with making their final decisions. Human-AI teams are for instance used in the medical and legal fields. One problem arises, in which instances should one trust an AI system and in which not? Trusting the AI system when it is correct and trusting yourself when you are correct, results in a high appropriate reliance. If users appropriately rely on AI systems, it is possible to achieve complementary team performance, which is better than any single teammate. However, as known from previous literature, people struggle with assessing their performance and knowing how well they perform compared to peers. When one overestimates their performance this can be because of a dual burden, due to the lack of skill they also lack the skill to accurately estimate their performance. This phenomenon is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE). This raises questions about whether the inability to estimate their own capabilities would also reflect on their assessment of the AI system its performance.<br/><br/>In this thesis we look at how the DKE affects (appropriate) reliance on AI systems and if so, how such effects due to the DKE can be mitigated. The effects of the DKE and possible mitigation are being tested through an empirical study (N = 249). The attempt at mitigation is done by including a tutorial intervention, which has been proved in previous research to be useful in decreasing the DKE. The tutorial intervention is aimed at revealing the weaknesses of the participant and making them aware of their miscalibrated self-estimation. Furthermore, in this thesis, the effects of revealing how the AI system makes its decisions through explainable AI (XAI) are explored. The XAI consisted of highlights from logic unit-based explanations, it should allow participants to gain more understanding of the AI advice. This thesis shows how this will affect user self-assessment and reliance on the AI system.<br/><br/>We found that participants who overestimate themselves tend to rely less on the AI system, compared to participants that had an accurate or underestimation of their performance. After the tutorial participants have a better calibration of their self-assessment.

It is a classic saying that anyone can end up in debt, but it is how we treat those with debt that defines their well-being. With the current financial system, we are prejudicing a part of society, making an already vulnerable group even more prone to debt.<br/><br/>We have designed systems which are almost impossible for these people to navigate, making vulnerable groups overrepresented in private debt. These vulnerable groups are made out of intellectually disabled, illiterates, multi-lingualists and financially stressed people. The goal of this thesis is to lift the barriers drawn up in private debt, and to introduce an inclusive approach to debt collection for collector coeo incasso.<br/><br/>During the analysis I will explore the private debt system as implemented by law. The debt trajectory is complex - privacy and new regulations make interventions difficult - leaving little design space. <br/><br/>The typical debtor and the implications of debt on human well-being are perhaps even worse. We can find vulnerable groups making up more than half of debtors. <br/><br/>These vulnerable groups then have to deal with the implications of debt, symptoms such as chronic stress and shame are common. This can even go as far as suicide. The effect of debt goes far beyond the wallet, it impacts every aspect of life.<br/><br/>When looking at the current debt trajectory ats coeo incasso we see that there is room for improvements which may drastically reduce barriers for debtors. By slightly altering the current layout of a debt trajectory we can help debtors have a more stress free debt experience.<br/><br/>The proposed interventions, on a service and interaction level, have to goal of lowering those barriers by making debtors feel acknowledged in their skills.<br/><br/>By lowering these barriers we can now expect debtors to live a more stress free life. These practices will help anyone, not only vulnerable groups. By introducing these interventions we can expect coeo to fully align with their goal of being the most empathic debt collector again.<br/><br/>Through these principles the debt trajectory can now be improved. New methods of communications, such as interpersonal communication, are introduced. New colalborations with municipal financial advisors are set up. <br/><br/>But also the existing communication is redesigned. New letters in understandable language will be sent. Digital communication now includes important accessibility principles. By implementing these kind of design choices coeo can now offer a debt trajectory with lower barriers.","Private debt; Vulnerable groups; Intellectual disability; Illiteracy; inclusiveness; Service design; Interaction design; UX design","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.figma.com/proto/ddNB0z9CypYVvOQwHkNxTm/Desktop?node-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down Website design https://www.figma.com/proto/CJP8ewh0ZCoICuXjmJ5F3z/Mobile?node-id=7%3A6&starting-point-node-id=2%3A6&scaling=scale-down Mobile design","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, this procedure is time-consuming and needs sufficient prior knowledge. As a result, small satellite developers may not be able to test the software thoroughly. <br/> <br/>A promising direction to solve this problem is reinforcement learning (RL) based testing. It searches testing commands to maximise the return, which represents the testing goal. Testers need not specify prior knowledge besides the reward function and hyperparameters. Reinforcement learning has matured in software testing scenarios, such as GUI testing. However, migration from such scenarios to onboard software testing is still challenging because of different environments.<br/> <br/>This work is the first research to apply reinforcement learning in real onboard software testing and one of few studies that perform RL-based testing on embedded software without a GUI. In this work, the RL agent observes current code coverage and the interaction history, selects a pre-defined command, or organises a command from pre-defined parameters to maximise cumulative reward. The reward function can be code coverage (coverage testing) or estimated CPU load (stress testing). Three RL algorithms, including the tabular Q-Learning, Double Duelling Deep Q Network (D3QN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are compared with a random testing baseline and a genetic algorithm baseline in the experiments.<br/> <br/>This study also performs regression testing with a trained RL agent, i.e., to test a version of onboard software that it has never seen before. To do that, the agent processes graph input with code coverage information. The graph is extracted from the onboard software source code via static code analysis. The work tries two graph neural network architectures (GGNN and GAT) with several graph pooling mechanisms to process the graph input.<br/> <br/>Apart from the test command generation algorithms, some middleware is also implemented, including a command/response parser, a state identification module, a branch coverage collection tool, and a tool to extract the graph representation and node features. During onboard software testing, the onboard computer (OBC) or the electrical group support equipment (EGSE) can be the master of the bus. The command generation algorithms can run on a lab PC or a cloud server. <br/> <br/>The research reveals the advantages and drawbacks of using reinforcement learning to test onboard software. On the one hand, RL-based testing performs well in non-deterministic environments (e.g., stress testing) and regression testing. On the other hand, more straightforward methods like random testing and the genetic algorithm are more useful in deterministic environments.<br/> <br/>This document also introduces relative background knowledge.

It is challenging to numerically simulate the real structure using Electromagnetic (EM) solvers because the mesh size of an EM solver is inversely proportional to the number of vertices in the layout and the inclusion of these metal fills has a significant impact on these vertices and increases mesh size. It is important to understand the metal fills do have an impact on the RF performance of the component and the impact becomes stronger as the frequency increases due to the parasitics and hence we cannot neglect it. Therefore, a Design Flow Methodology is studied and analyzed to take into account the effect of metal fills without penalty in accuracy and simulation time. <br/><br/>The second part of the thesis focuses on two different approaches that can be used to extract the complex parameters providing the electromagnetic response of the layers, i.e. electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability. First, we describe the Quasistatic approach to extract the epsilon parameters from the capacitance and inductance. After, describing some of the limitations of this approach we focus on the Oblique Incidence Method as reported in the literature to extract the complex epsilon tensor parameters. <br/><br/>The third part of the thesis looks into the Design Flow Methodology that embeds the Oblique Incidence Method into the design flow for 3D EM solvers to take into account the effect of metal fills. The 2.5D EM solver takes into account a scalar number which is less accurate and hence an insight of how the solution from the Oblique Incidence Method can used to extract a scalar number for the effective parameters and therefore be implemented in 2.5D EM tools is discussed.<br/><br/>The fourth part of the thesis shows the validation of the Oblique Incidence Method for the 3D EM tool for two test cases which are wave propagating structure and lumped structure namely Grounded Coplanar Waveguide (CPWG) and Stacked Transformer. Validation of the Scalar Number Approaches for the 2.5D EM Tool was done for the CPWG structure.<br/><br/>Finally, a brief study on the Design Based Approach is conducted with different metal fill shapes and alignment by using the Oblique Incidence Method by making use of 3D EM tool. This approach provides a better understanding of the epsilon variations for different metal fill shapes and that for less epsilon variations, an accurate scalar number value can be extracted to enable 2.5D EM simulations with improved accuracy.","Oblique Incidence Method; ADL; EM; Homogenization; DRC Compliant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Cu is a desirable bonding and sealing material for low-temperature vacuum packaging of next-generation microsystems, as it is compatible with modern CMOS circuits and 3-D IC fabrication. Cu thermocompression bonding has been reported to achieve vacuum sealing at low temperatures, but these approaches need extremely flat and clean Cu surfaces or additional capping layers, and the overall bonding areas are still rather large.<br/>To mitigate this, the use of copper nanoparticles as the sealing material has been proposed. In this study, the first successful demonstration of die and multi-die level hermetic sealing has been demonstrated using Copper nanoparticle paste as the sealing material for sealing ring widths as small as 8$\mu$ at a minimum temperature and pressure levels of 300$^\circ$C and 10 MPa respectively with average encapsulated pressure of 54.18 mbar. Moreover, the leak rate evaluation was conducted which revealed no discernable leakage over a period of 48 days.

Larger carrying capacity, better collaboration mode and more optimized operation mode are required to handle the sudden increase in travel demand. The ever-growing micromobility system and the multimodal transport system of micromobility and other public transportation methods can well meet this trend.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to develop a multimodal transport optimization model that takes full advantage of the micromobility mode. This thesis, from the perspective of the traffic system administrator, explores the influence of micromobility on the cost of the entire traffic system under the premise of maintaining the normal operation of the metro system after micromobility joins the traffic system at the same level as the metro.<br/><br/>Firstly, through literature review, the research object is determined to be a representative shared bike in micromobility mode. The way to deal with the excessive travel demand brought by mega-events is to add shared bikes to the transportation system with the same status as the metro on the basis of maintaining the normal operation of the metro system, and cooperate with the metro system to meet the demand.<br/><br/>Secondly, the research methods are qualitative research and quantitative research. In the qualitative research, model design, adjustment and optimization are carried out in combination with actual experience to realize the design of the multimodal transport system of shared bike and urban metro system. In quantitative research, this thesis describes a case study area based on real condition and proposes six scenarios.

(mentor); Kana, A.A. (graduation committee); Droste, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The need for relating stakeholders with requirements and the need for systems modeling are the main drivers for this thesis. Relating stakeholders with requirements is beneficial in order to balance the interests of all stakeholders associated with complex design projects. The variability in types of stakeholders and information abundance in current projects are the main causes of the difficulty in establishing this relationship. The need for system modeling is part of the transition towards Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), realizing a single source of truth and improving efficiency by better communication between all involved stakeholders.<br/><br/>At first, a breakdown of requirements management processes is presented, followed by an exploration of stakeholders within the naval domain. Requirement management processes are extensive, elaboration of requirements is the more important step during this thesis. Structuring the requirements as part of the elaboration is based on an OFP-decomposition, where `O' stands for Operational, `F' for functional and `P' for physical.<br/>The complexity of stakeholders is tackled by an analysis which consists of the main steps: identification, differentiating \&amp; categorizing, investigating relationships and prioritization. Prioritization of stakeholder is based on four attributes: power, interest, urgency and legitimacy.<br/>Applying MBSE by incorporating systems modeling demands a selection of the main pillars, being a method, tool and a language. The method during this thesis is ARCADIA, preferred by DAMEN due to the compatibility with the software `Capella'. The language is chosen to be the NATO Architectural Framework (NAF). System modeling is currently in a state of implementation at DAMEN Naval, therefore, this research aids in the continued development of their processes.<br/>As mentioned, the NAF is used as a language to model the stakeholder`s concerns in a systematic way. The NAF consists out of 47 independent viewpoints, each specifying a different concerns on a specific level of detail. The representations of these viewpoints are not strict, therefore, translating these concerns into Capella was one of the first major tasks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A method is designed to establish the relationship between stakeholders and requirements by using the NAF as a backbone. The method consists of 12 steps and inhibits an iterative character, as is common in naval ship design processes. The inputs of the method are a stakeholder analysis and a set of OFP-classified requirements, resulting in a systems architecture relating requirements with stakeholders. Creating additional non-NAF existing concerns is one of the pitfalls of the method and the presented guidelines are still creating room for error, therefore more research into this part of the method is advised.<br/><br/>The method has been assessed by using a Proof of Concept (PoC), a limited case study based on 2 selected stakeholders and a limited set of requirements. The requirements for the PoC were found in the Maritime Interdiction Force Operations (MIFO), displaying demands for conducting boarding and deterrence missions at sea. Concerns per stakeholder have been analysed and viewpoints were selected from the NAF. The Capella project model was used to construct the diagrams from. The result was an agglomeration of diagrams representing all viewpoints, contributing to the construction of the `best suited' systems architecture and fulfilling most of the success criteria. Relating all requirements to the diagrams has proven to be hard during the PoC and it is recommended to improve these efforts in a next iteration, as well as the use of other representation-forms instead of the diagrams common to Capella.<br/><br/>The subsequent step was to address the method by a case study, including more stakeholders from within the naval domain. The analysis comprised 12 stakeholders, internal and external with respect to DAMEN Naval. The concerns per stakeholder have been analysed, viewpoints selected and the diagrams were constructed by the system modelers team. This resulted in more detailed diagrams w.r.t. the PoC. The final systems architecture is capable of relating the requirements from the operational layers to the physical layers by the structured representation according to the NAF. Classification of requirements is done according to the OFP-decomposition, however further research into other classifications could prevent increasing complexity.","Systems Modeling; Model Based Systems Engineering; Early stages of ship design; NATO Architectural Framework; Naval domain; Capella","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The key challenge for robotic grasping is to exert enough grip force to prevent slipping while being gentle enough to prevent damage to an object. Existing grippers used for processes like automatic harvesting of fruits, either apply excessive grip force leading to object damage or react to slip resulting in object release from the gripper. The aim of this study is to develop a grip force controller that uses tactile feedback to maintain a constant frictional safety margin over the minimum required grip force, called Safety Margin Control. Tactile sensors can provide information on friction, which is used to predict slip. An optical tactile sensor is modeled and used in simulations where Safety Margin Control regulates the grip force during interaction with various virtual objects. The deformation of the sensor’s soft viscoelastic membrane is described by local frictional behavior and used to estimate the safety margin. The desired safety margin is set to 30%, based on comparison to the way humans control grip force in their fingertips. The desired value can be tuned to favor release over damage and vice versa. Safety Margin Control is compared to two baseline controllers: React To Slip and Conservative Control. The performance is evaluated based on maximum pressure and total lateral displacement of the object relative to the sensor. Safety Margin Control results in a pressure decrease of 44% on average compared to Conservative Control, and no significant pressure change was observed compared to React To Slip. The total lateral displacement for Safety Margin Control is 0 mm, as opposed to 1.3 mm for React To Slip. Safety Margin Control provides a way forward for automated harvesting as the pressure exerted on an object can be reduced while no slip occurs.","automated harvesting; control; friction; robotic grasping; safety margin; simulation; tactile sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive Robotics | Robotics","",""

This flood risk assessment includes a study of the current flood risk management in Kenya, and in the Isiolo River Basin in particular, because the need for proper flood management is urgent: various climate studies predict an increase in rainfall and an increase in flood risk as a result of the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>Current flood risk management is inadequate. Kenya has defined 21 flood-prone areas whereof one of them is Isiolo Town. Isiolo Town is located in the ENN basin which is, relatively, the most prone to the effects of climate change compared to the other basins. Furthermore, the ENN basin currently has the highest poverty rate and avoidance of further enlargement in poverty rate is important, so there is a need to mitigate flood risks. Since Isiolo Town is located in the Isiolo River Basin, this basin has been chosen for an in-depth study.<br/><br/>The Isiolo River Basin is an Arid Semi-Arid Land region which is often prone to flash floods. Isiolo Town is a flat area located downstream of mountainous area, the rain which falls upstream flows fast downstream and converges into town, often resulting in inundation. Many hazards, both natural and others, are increasing the flood risk in the basin and specifically Isiolo Town.<br/><br/>This flood risk demands flood risk mitigation measures. One possible measure is the SLAMDAM. The SLAMDAM is a movable water-filled flood-barrier. One dam has a length of 5 meters and a height of 1 meter and the dams can be connected to a desired length. The water stored in the dam can be used afterwards for irrigation or other uses.<br/>To recommend effective areas to implement the SLAMDAM, 3Di and the FIS Tool are used. 3Di is a hydrodynamic model and it creates flood maps for different rain events. These flood maps are used as input for the FIS Tool. The FIS Tool calculates the benefits for deploying the SLAMDAM at a certain location for a particular length. The locations which result in the highest benefit are recommended to deploy the SLAMDAM in case of particular rain events. However, a site visit is required to see whether the modelled situation aligns with the real-life situation and to see whether boundary conditions are met.<br/>The SLAMDAM is also compared to other flood risk mitigation measures. Some were analysed using the FIS Tool, whereas others are evaluated based on five self-formulated ranking criteria. These criteria form the base of a scoring matrix where each relevant mitigation measure is scored on.<br/><br/>The performed research has shown the SLAMDAM to rank the best compared to other mitigation measures, both when using the scoring matrix and when using the FIS Tool. However, it is highly recommended to use the SLAMDAM in combination with a Flood Early Warning System. In this way the community downstream can be warned in time to deploy the SLAMDAM. The FIS Tool is found to be especially valuable in finding proper locations for deployment and the dam can be stored close to these locations, enabling fast deployment of the dam in case of need.","Flood risk; SLAMDAM; FIS Tool; 3Di; Kenya; Isiolo River Basin","en","student report","","","","","","For this project, the disciplines are Water Management, Geo-Engineering and Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering.","","","","","","Water Management","Civil Engineering Consultancy Project",""

To keep up with demand, parts for these wind turbines are being produced all over the world. To get all the parts needed to their destination on time, they must be transported on heavy transport vessels (HTVs).<br/><br/>Today, business cases focused on maximizing profits dictate the design of these vessels. Despite the upcoming energy transition, the environmental impact of these vessels is usually neglected. Therefore, there is a need for a method to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of HTVs.<br/><br/>One basis for such a method is Blended Design. This method is able to cope with market uncertainties in the early stages of ship design by expanding knowledge when design freedom is still high by combining market forecasts for offshore wind farms with multiple vessel designs. An uncertainty model then evaluates the financial performance of the vessels in the market, allowing designers to explore the performance on basic main dimensions of an offshore wind installation vessel. The main limitations of this method are that it is not able to optimize on environmental performance and evaluate the financial impact of alternative fuels.<br/><br/>Due to growing concerns about climate change, Ulstein has seen an increase in requests for the use of alternative fuels in ship designs. For this research, methanol, ammonia and liquid hydrogen are being investigated as these alternative fuels are considered future-proof.<br/><br/>The use of alternative fuels in ship design involves some adjustments to the<br/>Blended Design method. Due to the different gravimetric and volumetric densities of these alternative fuels, this has implications for the endurance of the ship design and the amount of cargo the ship can carry. Changing system and installation requirements and varying fuel costs also drastically alter the financial performance of alternative fuels on ship designs.<br/><br/>The proposed methodology accounts for these changes and quantifies alternative fuel emissions by converting them to CO2-equivalent emissions. In this way, other greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O are also included in this metric. The environmental performance is then expressed in the EEXI-equivalent: the amount of CO2-e emitted by the ship design per tonmile. The EEXI-e index makes it possible to compare the various alternative fuels in terms of their environmental performance on the same basis.<br/><br/>In this work the EEXI-e method is combined with the original Blended Design method and the method is adapted to include alternative fuels. This makes it possible to evaluate the environmental performance and associated financial impacts of different alternative fuels.<br/><br/>Because financial and environmental performance are now linked, it is possible to examine the impact of different ranges of carbon taxes. The case study results presented in this thesis show that the carbon tax has a large impact on the financial performance of the ship when it is applied. When enforced, the choice of an alternative fuel system becomes more attractive.<br/><br/>The proposed method has provided a guide to ship designers to make better decisions about the main dimensions of a ship at an early stage of ship design. In addition, the method can provide much-needed insight in the selection of alternative fuels by evaluating the financial and environmental performance of alternative fuel systems.<br","HFO; Methanol; Ammonia; Hydrogen; Blended Design; Alternative fuels; EEXI-e","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Thus far, only conventional fuel-based cruise holidays are related to various environmental impacts and are known as an energy intensive form of tourism. International regulations are increasingly stringent on direct pollution and energy-use related impacts but exclude upstream and downstream externalities in sustainability targets for cruise tourism. Whether sailing cruise tourism can form a truly low-impact alternative to conventional (i.e. fuel-based) cruise tourism however, depends on a myriad of lifecycle interactions. Consequently, a manageable lifecycle approach is needed for estimating the distribution of direct and indirect impacts of a sailing cruise voyage. Furthermore, when sailing cruise operators wish to mitigate their environmental impacts, focal points of impact hotspots and alternatives need to be determined.<br/>In this design-oriented research report the Seafaring Applied Impact Ladder (SAIL) is introduced. This framework makes use of fast track-LCA methodology for determining systemwide impact distribution and mitigation pathways for major impact contributors in sailing cruise lifecycle systems. By applying the SAIL to a case study sailing cruise voyage on board the Clipper Stad Amsterdam (CSA), insights in impact distribution and feasible impact reduction emerge. <br/>The case study found that a passengers’ fuel related carbon footprint is greater for conventional cruises than for a sailing cruise on board the CSA. In the SAILs systemwide assessment however, fuel-related impacts remain the major culprit for all three included indicators. Food consumption and crew flights generate a considerable additional share of systemwide impacts. For fuel combustion and food consumption, technological substitution can result in feasible impact reduction, which is quantified in the fourth step of the case study. <br/>The SAIL proves itself a useful and improvement focused approach for impact assessment in sailing cruise lifecycle systems. The presented procedures form a straightforward approach from which practical inferences for impact reduction follow. Further application of the framework in case studies will contribute to sustainable development in (sailing) cruises and broadens the scientific domain of impact assessment. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Local optimization planners like Model Predictive Control can incorporate collision avoidance constraints, but they can only lead to socially compliant trajectories if the cost function embeds information about the desired social behavior. The same holds for Reinforcement Learning, where a sophisticated reward function needs to be defined. However, formalizing social behavior through a reward or cost function is difficult due to the complex nature of pedestrian behavior. Imitation learning allows for inferring the desired behavior by learning from human demonstrations, making them suitable for learning socially compliant navigation policies but without any safety considerations. In this work, we propose to learn a socially compliant navigation policy directly by observing surrounding pedestrians’ trajectories from a commonly available detection and tracking pipeline and combine it with a local optimization planner to enhance safety. A Subgoal Recommender policy is developed to guide the local optimization planner to generate socially compliant trajectories by providing intermediate subgoals. To adapt the policy to changing social contexts without forgetting previously learned information, we train the Subgoal Recommender in a Continual Learning setup exploiting new pedestrian data.<br/>We demonstrate in simulation that our method can learn a policy that has similar performance metrics as that of the observed trajectories with 95% confidence estimated from a t-test, resulting in a lesser number of collisions. Further, the policy can adapt to different social preferences exhibited by pedestrians, while being able to remember the learned behavior in a previously encountered social context. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can learn navigation policies from actual pedestrian data recorded using the onboard perception pipeline of a Clearpath Jackal robot.","Socially Compliant navigation; Mobile robot navigation; Imitation Learning; Continual Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

The construction industry generates more than one-third of waste in landfills around the world is considered a critical sector. Material leakage is becoming one of the most concerning issues in the construction industry globally. <br/><br/>Due to globalization, many corporations are growing in size, as a result, there are numerous corporate real estate (CRE) changes. These changes in the corporate real estate sector lead to a significant amount of material leakage generation which could cause negative effects on company stakeholders as well as the environment. Many researchers claim that office refurbishment is the main material leakage contributor, hence the company should apply a circular strategy to minimize the material leakage effects.<br/><br/>A product-service system (PSS) is a procurement strategy that provides a combination of products and services to meet consumers' demands. Most of the PSS product ownership remains with the PSS providers while consumers can access or possess products in other ways such as leasing or subscribing instead of traditional purchasing. By doing so, the PSS providers take more responsibility for the products, and the products are treated more effectively and properly by the PSS providers because they have specialized facilities and knowledge to support product treatment. This will also lead to a reduction in material leakage. In sum, the PSS strategy could directly contribute to the circular economy and it seems to be a proactive solution to minimize material leakage in office refurbishment.<br/><br/>According to a built-up story, the main research question is formulated, which is “To what extent does the Product-Service system (PSS) help corporate real estate (CRE) in minimizing material leakage?”<br/><br/>To assert that implementing PSS could minimize material leakage in CRE, theoretical research, empirical research, and the analysis of both theoretical and empirical research findings have to be conducted. The theoretical research is to identify all research-related concepts and the relationship between each concept, namely PSS, material leakage, and CRE. Also, the potential of PSS in minimizing material leakage is studied while the theoretical research is conducted by literature review. <br/><br/>The empirical research investigates how and to what extent can PSS contributes to material leakage minimization in real-life practice. This is will be conducted by a case study.<br/><br/>Thereafter, an analysis of the theoretical and empirical research findings is conducted to find whether both of them are aligned before using the result to answer the research questions.<br/><br/>The result of the research shows that material leakage minimization seems to be a consequence of PSS implementation. The circularity of the PSS product is greater compared to a similar product that is provided by a linear economy strategy (take-make-dispose).

Therefore, hardware accelerators that can exploit CNN parallelism and methods to reduce the computation burden or memory requirements are still hot research topics. Quantization is one of these methods. One suitable quantization strategy for low-power deployments is logarithmic quantization.<br/><br/>Logarithmic quantization for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): a) fits well typical weights and activation distributions, and b) allows the replacement of the multiplication operation by a shift operation that can be implemented with fewer hardware resources.<br/>In this thesis, a new quantization method named Jumping Log Quantization (JLQ) is proposed. The key idea of JLQ is to extend the quantization range, by adding a coefficient parameter ""s"" in the power of two exponents ($2^{sx+i}$).<br/><br/>This quantization strategy skips some values from the standard logarithmic quantization. In addition, a small hardware-friendly optimization called weight de-zeroing is proposed in this work.

A proper offshore description of incident IG waves is required for storm impact models, which generally assume a local equilibrium between sea-swell (SS) waves (0.04-0.33 Hz) and the resultant nonlinearly excited bound IG waves. The contribution of free incident IG waves and the directional properties<br/>of the IG wave field are neglected, though they play a critical role in IG wave variations. Various research focuses on IG wave dynamics in shallow waters, but a detailed understanding of IG wave variability in intermediate water depth is lacking. Furthermore, the directional spectra of bound and free IG waves in the field are usually unavailable since bound IG waves do not follow linear dispersion relations, which is assumed by commonly applied directional spectra reconstruction methods.<br/><br/>In-situ observation data (surface elevation, pressure, and velocity) of IG waves from November 2021 to April 2022 at three cross-shore locations in intermediate water depth (∼ 6 − 14 m) off the Dutch coast are analyzed to study generation, propagation, and directional properties of IG waves. The bispectral technique is applied to quantify the contribution of bound IG waves to the total IG wave field. A newly developed method is validated and used on the offshore (∼ 14 m) data to reconstruct directional spectra of bound and free IG waves separately during storms.<br/><br/>The results show that IG wave heights are best predicted (correlation coefficient R² up to 0.94) with an offshore forcing parameter that includes peak period H<sub>ss</sub>T<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> , which indicates SS wave energy flux. The growth rate of IG waves is in between the shallow water equilibrium solution (for bound waves) and Green’s Law (for free waves), indicating the total IG wave field consists of bound and free components. The relative contribution of bound IG energy (up to 76%) is correlated to SS wave energy, whereas it decreases dramatically during intense storms when SS waves break. The bound IG waves that are assumed to follow the weakly nonlinear wave theory, have a similar peak direction and broader directional spreading to SS waves. In contrast, the directional spectra of free IG waves are nearly isotropic during calm conditions, but may have diverse peaks during storms, which incident IG waves from remote sources and edge waves can<br/>influence.

The initiative to perform this study was the uncertainty in modeling the Boom Clay behavior during the design and the over-predictions of the combi wall deformations in the aftermath. The problem has been attributed to the constitutive soil model and soil properties used for that layer. <br/><br/>In the context of this thesis a Python - PLAXIS application has been developed, which facilitates an iterative method to determine the real soil properties of the Boom Clay layer based on inclinometer measurements of the wall throughout the construction stages. The monitoring data present the reality; hence the safety factors had to be filtered out of the design for the comparison with them to be applicable. Therefore, the mean (most probable) soil properties have been recalculated, and the as-build external loads, aquifer heads, structural elements, and phasing have been deciphered to create the Mean model. Using the Mean model, the most appropriate constitutive model and drainage conditions for the Boom Clay are determined. It has been concluded that the Hardening Soil small strain is the most appropriate constitutive model. Using the Mean model as initial input and the constitutive model conclusions, an iterative process on the relevant soil properties has been conducted to reach ±10% convergence with the corresponding monitoring deformations. The Fine Tuned model uses the soil properties derived by the iterative method to represent reality with the highest accuracy and reaches, on average, 45 % more precision on the prediction of the deformation in comparison to the monitoring data than the Mean model. <br/><br/>Using the Fine Tuned model, sensitivity analysis of the wall to Boom Clay’s soil properties is performed. It revealed that φ′ had the highest impact relative to the other properties. Scenarios with thinner Boom Clay layers have been tested due to the relevant wedging geometry it follows in the project location. Additionally, the Fine Tuned model has been used to improve the prediction of future stages with data derived from earlier monitoring. The example studied was able to improve the prediction by 87 % in comparison to the initial design. In comparing the Design model with the Fine Tuned model, a problem with the anchor wall behavior is discovered that is attributed to the inability of PLAXIS to consider the shaft friction of the anchor rods. The Fine Tuned model, in combination with the fixity solution, allowed for an improvement in deformation accuracy of up to 95 %. <br/><br/>It is concluded that the actual design, despite over-predicting its deformations, produced a retaining wall validated by the Fine Tuned model. It is suggested that the Python Application should be used alongside the traditional designing process and in site engineering to reduce the risk by simulating the actual behavior and limits of the retaining wall.<br","Geotechnical Engineering; Deep excavation; Python; Plaxis; Retaining wall design; Monitoring; Back analysis; Boom Clay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","New Terneuzen Lock",""

However, breast pumping is sometimes not a pleasant journey for mothers. Pump-related discomfort and pain were reported by many women. The goal of this project is to solve pump-related problems and optimise breast pumping ergonomic comfort by reducing discomfort and ultra-personalizing. <br/><br/>I closely studied the principles of breastfeeding/lactating, the problems mothers encountered during breast pumping, and the existing solutions and breast pump products on the market. The insights were gathered from the research, which formed the two pain points for pump-related problems: mothers lack emotional connections with breast pumps which restricts the hormone release for milk ejection reflex; the mismatch of breast pump shields causes most pain and discomfort. After analysis of the causal model and the frame innovation, the two main problems were reframed as follows: there could be more physical stimuli on the nipple and areola to make up for the shortness of psychological stimuli; the optimized pressure distribution could reduce the pain and discomfort. <br/><br/>To solve the two problems above, the envisioned breast pump design direction was narrowed into three perspectives: ideal breast contour achieved by 3D scanning; ideal pressure distribution based on perceived discomfort differences in different breast areas; effective physical stimuli applied on nipple and areola based on correct mechanisms (compression), intensity and local pressure sensitivity differences.<br/><br/>The preliminary design requirements were concluded according to the previous research. To consolidate the LoR (List of Requirements), experiments regarding breast sensitivity were implemented on 20 women to find the discomfort thresholds and lower sensory thresholds of women’s breasts. Two breast sensitivity map towards positive pressure was made to present the difference: the breast discomfort thresholds increase from the nipple top to the outer breast. The breast tactile thresholds decrease from the nipple side to the outer breast, and the sensitivity of nipple top is between the nipple base and the areola. And there are correlations between breast sensitivity and other parameters such as breast volume. Apart from that, other experiments show that a personalized perfectly-fit breast pump shield has a better force distribution than normal breast pump shields. An artificial breast was also made for further verification.<br/><br/>After that, concept ideas were generated and used for virtual exploration. According to the experiment conclusions and views from users and experts, a consolidated LoR (list of requirements) for a possible ultra-personalized breast pump design was made. The consolidated LoR was applied for a design proposal, which has a personalized adjustable shield shape with better pressure distribution and bigger contact areas. The design proposal was prototyped and verified on an artificial breast and compared with traditional breast pump shields.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Currently, inland waterway shipping mainly includes barges and bulk transportation with little to no variation in volume, product, and route. Since transport over water emits less CO2 per tonne-km than road transport, a potential way to reduce CO2 emissions is to transport more containers via inland waterways. Large delays cause unreliability, which in their turn cause an opportunity cost and increased operational costs. These increased costs have a negative impact on the competitiveness of inland water transport with regards to road transport. <br/><br/>An alternative to the way planning is handled currently is by solving a Vehicle Rotaton Planning Problem (VRPP). The problem is solved by minimizing a cost function. For example, the total time spent in a port area (called the sojourn time) can be minimized. <br/><br/>Solving the VRPP results in a rotation plan that dictates the order in which vessels visit terminals and how many containers they should transport from one terminal to another. There are multiple ways to solve the VRPP, one of which is through the use of the Distributed Pseudotree Optimization Protocol (DPOP), where the vessel operators reach an optimal solution together by sharing only information about those variables that share the same constraints with other variables from other agents. An attractive property of DPOP is that it is possible to include privacy constraints in the algorithm, such that vessel operators only have to share minimal information about their journey and not lose a competitive advantage to one another. For example, the operators might only want to share variables like the arrival time, and only want to share it with operators that have the approximately same arrival time. <br/><br/>To ensure the problem can be solved and that the message size does not run out of memory bounds, the memory-bounded version of DPOP is implemented. Because Memory-Bounded Distributed Pseudotree Optimization Protocol (MB-DPOP) requires an exponential number of messages when the inference width is above a certain threshold, an alternative way of formulating and solving the problem is considered using the Maximum Gain Messaging (MGM) algorithm and a formulation that includes how much vessel operators are willing to change their current rotation plan for a lower overall cost. With this formulation, when something changes in the problem definition, the entire calculation does not have to be done again because starting from the previous solution is possible.<br/><br/>Two simulated case studies in the port area of Rotterdam are done to performed the performance of the algorithms. The results show while MB-DPOP can guarantee some level of privacy, it does not scale very well and is thus not really useful in real life. While the algorithm yields a global solution and can guarantee a certain level of privacy, its execution time is in the order of hours, even for relatively small problem sizes. Conversely, the MGM algorithm with reformulation scales quite well and can possibly guarantee some level of privacy as well with extension. While the algorithm does not come up with a global solution, it can be a decent trade off between a level of privacy, and scalable algorithms that are centralized, such as a genetic algorithm.","DPOP; Privacy; VRPP; DCOP; MGM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This led to the creation of many embedded devices, which are usually quite different from the more commonly known computers and each other. The cause of this is the diversity in constraints that are placed on these devices, in terms of size, weight, energy consumption and more. It is important to test and analyse these embedded systems, to avoid malicious actors to gain control of these systems, or for bugs in the code running on these systems to cause problems. In contrast to other computers, embedded systems are often tightly integrated with their environment and are designed to control it. However, there still are major challenges when analysing these systems, just because of their tight integration with the environment. When executing the code out of the environment it was intended for, it often functions differently, if at all. Current solutions attempt to solve this problem in various ways, but they all fail to create a system that is general and flexible. As such, this project set out to find a methodology that solves this problem in an automated way, while ensuring the device's code executes accurately. This thesis presents a methodology to solve this problem in a general and flexible way, using symbolic execution. By using symbolic execution to handle interaction with the environment, the system can realistically and generally emulate embedded devices. Additionally, symbolic states are made concrete after a while, to continue executing concretely. When the system is executing concretely, user-defined hooks can be executed, which can be used to further instrument the process, allowing for great flexibility. Such extensions could be used to attach a debugger to the system, or by redirection output from a serial connection to a file. We conduct an empirical study to find that the system emulates accurately, reaching a nearly identical result to the same code running on real hardware, using four diverse samples. Additionally, we compare the system against Jetset, a system that attempts to solve a similar problem using just symbolic execution, and find that, although our system is considerably slower, it remains accurate. The difference in performance is primarily due to their system being more tightly integrated. Still, the added flexibility our system provides makes it more suitable to extend with further analyses, and thus might make it preferable in some situations. Finally, we provide the source code of an implementation of the system to allow researchers to continue developing and improving this system.<br","Embedded Systems; Emulation; Symbolic Execution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This increases application development time, reduces re-usability, and increases the cognitive burden of users leading to decreased design efficiency. Generic solutions from Workflow Management (WfM) can capture process knowledge in models outside of the KBE application and enable better collaboration. However, a challenge is to maintain flexibility when using WfM, which is rigid compared to other groupware. The research work of this thesis contributes technologies for saving and accessing the information of a KBE application to enable a methodology that flexibly facilitates collaboration by taking advantage of runtime caching and dependency tracking to dynamically populate tasks based on runtime context. These contributions are highlighted through case studies that demonstrate how present limitations of KBE and WfM can be overcome to open a new frontier for the next-generation of engineering software.

However, basic needs are poorly specified and discussed, the effectiveness of the FMC concept is unknown and difficult to measure by current indicators. Therefore, this paper clarifies the FMC concept. It statistically analyses the effect on the promotion of active modes by logistic binary regression, applied to the Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan region. It introduces FMC indicators to measure and geographically analyse urban regions. It reveals a set of amenities that characterises the FMC. Further, it demonstrates that the FMC concept has a positive effect on the probability of making trips by active modes, but also demonstrates the effects of other relevant variables, such as car ownership or the quality of cycle paths. Moreover, an FMC indicator that combines both the proximity of amenities and the number of amenities within 15 minutes predicts the effect of the FMC concept best. The FMC concept is beneficial to promote active modes, but to be most effective, active modes should also be stimulated via other measures, including the improvement of the quality of cycle paths and discouragement of car ownership for areas with all FMC amenities in close proximity.","Fifteen-minute city; Proximity; Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan region; Mobility; Spatial planning; Logistic binary regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The addition of new loads like Electric vehicles (EV), Heat pumps, etc. is putting additional pressure on the grid leading to some technical problems. Due to this, it is important to have real-time monitoring of the system by the Distribution System Operators(DSO)s which can be obtained by performing the State Estimation. The Distribution System State Estimation along with the state estimator has been discussed in the literature.<br/><br/>However, the accuracy of the state estimation is highly affected by the absence of real measurements from the meter and the presence of high-variance pseudo measurements. But due to the cost factor, it is practically not possible to install meters at every node. To reduce the state estimation error, a new meter placement strategy has been proposed in this project with the help of open-source software called Power Grid Model, devolved by the Dutch DSO Alliander for performing steady state analysis of the network.<br/><br/>The work presented in this project includes a sensitivity analysis of the proposed meter placement algorithm which is applied to a test MV distribution network in the Netherlands for the different sample sizes of the load profile as well as the standard deviation of the pseudo measurements. The application of the meter placement algorithm results in a subsequent reduction of the state estimation error. To find a suitable number of meters that can be placed in the network, three-meter placement criteria have been proposed and applied to the test network. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed meter placement algorithm for the determination of a suitable path as well as the number of meters that can be placed in the distribution network. This is important for the grid operators as it will help them to make decisions for the proper maintenance and operation of the grid.","State Estimation; Distribution Network; Meter Placement; Linear Weighted Least Square; Heuristic Method; Power Grid Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this paper, the emissions mitigation potential of implementing operational towing at major European airports is evaluated. Using mixed-integer linear programming, a scenario simulating mixed taxiing operations is used to find the relationship between fixed vehicle costs and target emission savings at an airport and European level. Using formulae derived from the ICAO Advanced Emissions Model, fuel burn and emissions are calculated for conventional taxiing, single-engine taxiing (SET), and hybrid and electric operational towing. An assignment optimization model is used to assign vehicles in a vehicle fleet to flights; yielding the minimum fuel to cover a flight schedule with mixed taxiing operations. As the number of vehicles in the fleet increases, the saving potential for each additional vehicle is calculated, linking fuel and emission savings with vehicle costs. Two scenarios are compared; Scenario 1 with hybrid towing vehicles and Scenario 2 with electric towing vehicles. Applying this method to 30 case-study airports, a maximum jet fuel reduction of 66% for hybrid towing and 57% for electric towing is calculated; outperforming SET at 29 of the 30 airports. The average taxi time and aircraft compatibility are the driving factors that influence the maximum fuel savings potential. The total average taxi minutes of compatible flights is thus the best metric to predict an airport's potential, with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.96 for hybrid towing and 0.97 for electric towing. Because of the shorter refuelling downtime, hybrid vehicles can service more jobs per day than electric vehicles. This means a smaller hybrid fleet size can achieve the same CO2 and jet fuel savings on a European level. As the fleet size increases, the marginal savings per hybrid vehicle decrease at a higher rate than electric vehicles. This means that the maximum emissions savings potential can be a misleading metric for comparing strategies. By using this approach to link vehicle fleet size and potential savings, a more extensive trade-off of emission mitigation strategies is possible, allowing stakeholders to find the best strategy to fit a budget or emission savings target.","Operational Towing; Single-Engine Taxiing; Emissions Mitigation; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming; Assignment Model; Mixed Taxiing Operations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Alonso Mora, J. (mentor); Schulte, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With increasing urbanization and a need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, new forms of urban mobility are studied worldwide. An interesting transportation method is ridesharing, where people can share parts of their rides with other passengers travelling in a similar direction in the same car. To im- prove the attraction of ridesharing systems, research into extensions to the existing ridesharing model formulation is required. The goal of this research is to make ridesharing more attractive to potential users by including the option to make reservations. In this work, the inclusion of reservations (pre-bookings) into the on-demand ridesharing problem is studied. The inclusion of ridesharing has to potential to make better assignments by having knowledge on part of the future demand. The main challenge from reservations is the increased computational load generated by having more available information. This thesis proposes multiple adjustments and different heuristics for a state-of-the-art on-demand ridesharing system to deal with the requirements and challenges brought by the incorporation of reservations. An additional consideration is a trade-off between providing benefits for reservations and serving on-demand requests. Numeric experiments are performed on the Manhattan street network with NYC taxicab request data. The results indicate that reservations can be included in on-demand ridesharing at a tolerable compu- tational cost with the proposed framework. Passengers that make reservations shortly in advance can be guaranteed service once initially accepted by the system. Having passengers make reservations in advance does increase the overall service the system can provide.","ridesharing; ridepooling; on-demand mobility; reservations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Emission-free zones are being instituted in cities in the Netherlands to combat the emissions caused by transportation activity causing operators of large commercial vehicle fleets to electrify their vehicle fleet. E-truck fleets need sufficient charging infrastructure and power capacity at the distribution centres they operate from. However, due to the prevalence of grid congestion causes, the capacity of actors’ connection to the power grid is be constrained and solutions behind the electricity meter are necessary to either increase local supply or reduce momentary demand. The main research question is: “What is the most cost-effective electric infrastructural composition and operation to facilitate the electrification of heavy truck fleets of large-scale distribution centres in grid congested areas in various scenarios to ensure that the route schedules can be driven?” This thesis proposes a mathematical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which simultaneously optimizes the composition and operation of the electric infrastructure of a distribution centre, while considering the periodic energy balance, for various scenarios in the electrification process. This has not been done earlier in the literature for distribution centre-like systems, while no similar use case has been studied in the Netherlands or its general region. Before the model was applied to the real-world case, it was verified using a recalculable numerical test and validated using linear regression analysis. In the model validation the K-means method was used to determine a typical day per month, to comprise the simulation period to 288 time periods of an hour. The proposed mathematical model was tested by means of a case study and various scenarios for the distribution centre of a supermarket company to analyse the models’ behaviour in a practical setting. The results show that from a greedy charging subscenario to a variable electricity prices subscenario, the model is able to decrease the yearly total costs and the number of infrastructure components required. The model is able to reduce the yearly total cost by up to 19.4% in the final scenario. The infrastructure investment steps in the electrification process to take, would be to install consecutively or collectively 1, 3 and 7 charging stations and 994, 1623 and 4340 PV panels in 2022, 2025 and 2030, leading to a PV installation with a total rated power of 1.562 MW, which proved to be the more cost-effective than wind turbines and battery storage. The results of the scenarios, the graphs and the sensitivity analysis show that the model is effectively able to optimize the infrastructural composition and operation to minimize the cost in all cases, giving managerial insights into the decisions that need to be made in all steps of a fleet electrification process.","e-truck fleet; infrastructure composition; smart charging; MILP; grid congestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The market for AI software, for example, reached a valuation of \$62 billion in 2022. A growing number of new computer architectures specialized in running these AI software were also developed. At first they were run on conventional CPUs (Central Processing Unit) and GPUs (Graphical Processing Units), but then more specialized hardware emerged, such as the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit). However, since algorithms in these AI software are generally data-intensive, the power consumption became a problem. Therefore, as many of these algorithms were based on biological neural networks, there is a growing interest to develop hardware similarly based on principles found these networks as well to replicate their efficiency. This new architecture is known as neuromorphic architecture. <br/><br/>However, a new architecture does not come without challenges. As a nascent and fragmented field, neuromorphic computing in general lacks a standardized benchmarking suite or methodology. In other, more mature fields, benchmarks are a standard way of evaluating the performance of different designs objectively and fairly. This thesis aims to propose and demonstrate a benchmarking methodology and implementation flow for neuromorphic processors. This methodology aims to measure the important performance metrics for a neuromorphic processor, both on the small scale of individual synaptic operations, and the large scale of performing an actual workload. The chosen workload is a keyword spotting program based on a simple DNN architecture, which detects a specific phrase in an audio recording. This workload was chosen due to its potential application in an environment where energy is limited, such as an embedded device.<br/><br/>The neuromorphic processor that is the target of this benchmarking is SENeCA (short for Scalable Energy-efficient Neuromorphic Computer Architecture), a flexible and scalable design developed at IMEC The Netherlands. To implement the keyword spotting program on SENeCA, the keyword spotting program was rewritten and parsed. Since no physical chip implementation of SENeCA exists at the time of writing, the program was run on SENeCA using a HDL simulator. The execution time of the program is measured in detail, taking into account not only the total time, but also the time required to complete the specific stages of program. Afterwards, the power consumption of SENeCA during the execution of the program was measured using a power estimation software, both for the entire chip and its individual components. This is done both in average mode, obtaining the average power consumption over the total execution time, and in time-based mode, providing insight to the peak power and fluctuations over time. Then, the energy to solution is calculated using the execution time and power consumption. This process is done in multiple iterations, with a specific optimization done each iteration using SENeCA's accelerators. This provides insight into the impact of each optimization to power consumption and performance. Finally, a measurement of the energy consumption of SENeCA per individual synaptic operations is also done, allowing estimates of the energy consumption of future implementations.","Neuromorphic computing; Benchmarking; Neural network; DNN inference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Based on pathway dependency, a combination of biofuel and BEVs is most likely to mitigate these CO2 increases. A number of complex barriers were highlighted in the fields of fuel, infrastructure, actor interaction and market attraction for this scenario. The use of participative backcasting using workshops for both academic and bureaucratic actors to create policy packages has been suggested as a method to resolve these complex barriers.","Policy Management; Transport; Backcasting; Pathway Dependency; Energy Transition; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","A robotic vehicle must continuously determine its position within the map to traverse a path safely; this is called self-localization. Current localization methods use mainly sensors like LIDARS. However, a LIDAR does not return data points if the environment is an empty field; the laser scan of the LIDAR does not reflect without obstacles, making self-localization in those environments impossible. Self-localization with visual information from cameras can be an alternative for vehicles operating in an open environment, such as the Lely Juno, an agricultural robot operating on farms. A widely used visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method in literature, ORB-SLAM3, lacks robustness on Lely Juno's visual data; the track is lost multiple times due to a sudden drop in the number of feature matches.<br/> <br/><br/>This work aims to experimentally determine (a) the cause of the drop in the feature matches that eventually causes the tracking error and (b) the robustness and accuracy of ORB-SLAM3 compared to a simple visual odometry (VO) system.<br/>The cause of the drop in feature matches is investigated outside the ORB-SLAM3 pipeline by replicating the matching thread of ORB-SLAM3 with OpenCV ORB feature matching. The robustness and accuracy of ORB-SLAM3 are compared with a simple visual odometry system by comparing the trajectories and the minimum number of matches found in the sequences. <br/><br/>The sudden drops in feature matches could not be replicated outside the ORB-SLAM3 pipeline with the brute-force-based ORB matcher in OpenCV. While in some cases, the decrease in feature matches is related to the image itself (e.g., blur, movement), the leading cause is complicated. In this work, the leading cause is further reduced to the quality of the disparity map, the type of matcher used, and the use of grids when extracting features. The simple VO system is more robust than ORB-SLAM3. However, the absolute pose error is worse and unsuitable for reliable navigation for long trajectories.<br/><br/>For the Lely Juno, a simple visual odometry system can only be used for short distances outside. Therefore, investigating the issues in ORB-SLAM3 is an excellent direction from the project's point of view. More understanding is needed of the exact effects of the disparity map, the type of matcher used, and the use of grids on the number of feature matches.<br/><br/>The contributions of this work are insights into the reasons behind the tracking errors, exploring the effect of different ORB parameters and datasets on the matching performance, and creating two new datasets in low-textured and repetitive agricultural environments. Investigating the exact impact of the disparity map, the type of matcher used, and the use of grids on the number of feature matches is left for future work.","SLAM; ORB SLAM; visual SLAM; ORB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","Lely Juno",""

The digitization of the financial sector has made the threat for cyber attacks significant. Cyber attacks such as the Petya virus or the Wannacry attack have exposed the vulnerability of the critical infrastructure. The financial sector is especially prone to cyber attacks within the critical infrastructure. The financial sector must be available at all times. Even a minor disruption could cause wrongful or unexecuted transactions leading to cascading effects on careers, organizations, or entire industries. The way to cope with disruptive cyber events is through digital operational resilience. In order to ensure this the European Commission has proposed the Digital Operational Resilience Act. A regulation that harmonizes existing guidelines aimed at ensuring resilience against cyber attacks for the financial sector in the EU. To estimate the regulatory performance of the DORA, insight is to be created into the perceptions of the stakeholders. Therefore, the research question of this thesis is: What is the perception of the financial sector towards the expectation of the Digital Operational Resilience Act? In order to answer this research question, interviews were conducted with high-level security managers of financial service organizations (FSOs) in the Netherlands, ICT providers and supervisory authorities. From insights gathered through the interviews, it can be concluded that the participants share a predominantly positive perception of the DORA. They were confident about there ability to be compliant within the given 24 months. The DORA is also seen as a step in the right direction towards a digital operational resilient financial sector. Recommendations are made for supervisory authorities regarding the implementation and supervision of the DORA and for the FSOs on the implementation and compliance with the DORA.","Digital operational resilience; cybersecurity; regulation; perception; semi-structured interviews; financial sector; EU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

These small microfluidic devices allow the culture and development of living cardiac cells in 3D structures, to reproduce tissue dynamics and functionality in-vitro, thus fostering the development of new and more precise models for human diseases and organs’ physiological response.<br/>One of the most important gaps in this recent technology is the lack of integration of electronic devices in the platforms, such as electrodes for tissue stimulation or sensors for real-time monitoring of the tissue.<br/><br/>To cover this gap, a polymer-based platform with microwell and micropillars for culturing EHTs and measuring their contractile properties was developed in ECTM group at TU Delft. The contraction force exerted by the beating cardiac tissue, self-assembled around the micropillars, is quantified by measuring the displacement of the micropillars with spiral capacitive sensors embedded in the substrate. The force generated by the tissue corresponds to a capacitance change which is simulated to be in the aF range, requiring a high-precision, sensitive, and portable read-out circuitry.<br/><br/>The investigation and development of this readout electronics is the final goal of this Master Thesis. A literature survey about possible capacitive readout techniques was conducted to identify suitable architectures for measuring such small dynamic changes in capacitance. Two solutions available on the market (Smartec UTI and Analog Devices AD7746) implementing two of these architectures were chosen, tested, and characterised. Benchmark measurements with accurate laboratory instrumentation were performed, and noise figures of the two solutions were evaluated.<br/>To allow the readout, EHT platforms with embedded sensors need to be transferred and assembled on a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB): the viability of this challenging assembly process was evaluated. The multiple constraints deriving from such a complex project determined the development of a non-standard assembly process, which proved to be delicate and gave origin to multiple failure modes. Those were documented and analysed, to identify alternative or improved assembly procedures which need to be developed to fabricate reliable samples, since these weaknesses were identified as the most critical aspect at this point of the project.<br/><br/>The results obtained showed how the two solutions for the readout provided results in good agreement with more precise non-portable laboratory instrumentation, and promising noise figures. The platforms with embedded sensors were successfully transferred to the developed PCBs, and measurements showed good agreement with the simulated static behaviour of the sensors, thus providing a valuable proof-of-concept for the whole project.<br/>The dynamic behaviour of the sensors was preliminarily investigated and characterized using nanoindentation tests, indicating the possibility to measure a linear relationship between the force applied and the difference in the sensed capacitance. Despite this good result, further tests need to be performed to verify it and to address some criticalities that were identified.<br/>Cardiac tissue was cultured on platforms with integrated sensors and the biocompatibility of the entire system was proved.

There are several network architectures in the fields of deep learning and artificial intelligence that are used for NLP. Deep learning techniques like recurrent neural networks and feed-forward neural networks are used to develop language models that perform several NLP tasks. Over the years, researchers have worked on developing state-of-the-art language models that achieve high accuracy and performance for NLP applications. With the development of deep neural network language models, the computational resources requirements and the energy costs for training and running language models increased. This led to research to compress the language models, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the language models. One of the methods used for this is tensor decomposition, like the tensor-train (TT) decomposition. During this thesis work, the application of the TT-decomposition method for compressing the embedding layer in a long-short-term memory model was investigated. Specifically, the effect of factorization and the order of factors in the embedding layer when it is represented in the TT-matrix format on the maximum test accuracy of the long- short term memory model for the NLP task of sentiment analysis was investigated. This was done by considering three different factorizations of the embedding layer in the model. Further, the effect of change in TT-ranks (hyperparameters of the model when the embedding layer is represented in the TT-matrix format) on the maximum test accuracy was also investigated. Based on the investigation and empirical results obtained, this thesis concludes that by having a larger number of factors in the factorization of the embedding layer, the maximum test accuracy of the model increases. Further, in a particular factorization, when the factors were arranged in such a way that the maximum values of the TT-ranks had a smaller gap, the maximum test accuracy of the model improved. In one particular configuration of the model, the number of parameters was reduced by 24.5 times compared to that of the original uncompressed model, and a maximum test accuracy of 77.10% was achieved compared to a maximum test accuracy of 78.05% in the case of the original model.","tensor decomposition; Neural Networks; LSTM; Green AI; NLP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Despite their benefits in terms of sustainability, their ubiquity poses challenges in maintaining grid stability given their intermittency, emphasising the prediction of power fluctuations. Physical models and statistical approaches, especially for nowcasting (forecasting for 0-6 hours in the future), have been superseded by Machine Learning (ML) methods in terms of forecast accuracy (below 3% Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)). Within ML, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods seem to perform particularly well for nowcasting. This project focuses on predicting solar and wind meteorology with that level of accuracy, and on how to best use the prediction to minimize the cost of maintaining a balanced energy system, i.e. one where power consumption matches production at any moment. Producing accurate power predictions based on Multi-Modal (MM) data and the extent to which prediction accuracy reduces system cost are challenges to be addressed in this thesis. MM and End-to-End (E2E) training (with the system cost as the task of an ANN based algorithm) are investigated to this end. MM learning involves handling information from multiple types of input (audio and visual, for example) for performing a ML task such as regression or classification. It is of interest for this project because it has been shown to outperform other NN approaches in predicting sudden changes in solar irradiance. E2E learning entails an algorithm design which predicts the end goal of a ML process directly from the inputs. This is pursued because it addresses the true task (cost minimization) of system operators as the focus of the ML algorithm. The proposed method consists of a NN architecture that learns to fuse features from MM data (sky imagery and meteorological sensor data) at intermediate layers of the network in order to predict PV or Wind generation. This prediction is then used as an input to an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem (which seeks to minimize generation costs in a power system, considering power balance and transmission network constraints to ensure the twin goals of economic and secure system operation). The proposed model is trained E2E, therefore it is informed by the minimized cost solved by the optimization, rather than the intermediate power prediction (as conventional approaches would involve). In an IEEE 6-bus system with PV generation, a sequential training baseline results in costs 10% higher than a perfect forecast, while our proposed MM4-E2E approach achieves costs only 7% higher, a significant improvement. The intermediate prediction of PV power by MM4-E2E is also improved, with 18% lower RMSE by the proposed model compared to the baseline, explained by the enhancement of one modality by the other through MM learning. In a power system with two renewable sources, costs are reduced through the proposed model compared to a conventional approach (4% excess cost compared to 7%, measured against a perfect forecast), but power prediction accuracy is worse, sue to convergence to local minima.","Multi-modal learning; End-to-End learning; optimal power flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Crucial in this search is the atmospheric characterisation of small, rocky planets orbiting in the habitable zone around solar type stars. The LIFE initiative will be able to perform atmospheric characterisation of a sizeable subset of these planets in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength regime (5-20 &#x1d707;m). The mid-IR is an important bandwidth as it contains some important atmospheric biosignatures. Extremely sensitive and highly efficient detectors are required to detect the faint signal from these small exoplanets. Current state-of-the-art detectors based on semiconductor technology are unable to meet these requirements. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are superconducting pair-breaking detectors able of single-photon detection with no readout noise or<br/>dark current. This makes MKIDs a promising candidate for mid-IR detectors for the LIFE initiative. In this thesis we investigate what development is necessary to meet the detector requirements set by the LIFE initiative. We also investigate how the performance of MKIDs can be reliably measured in the mid-IR.<br/><br/>Currently, there are no single-photon counting MKIDs designed for the mid-IR. Measurements are done with two MKID devices that originally have been designed for the near- and far-IR bandwidths. Prior to this work the near-IR detector has shown single-photon counting 1545 nm and the far-IR detector at 38 &#x1d707;m. In this work we show the single-photon counting ability of MKIDs 3.8 and 8.5 &#x1d707;m. This is the first time that single-photon counting has been shown at 8.5 &#x1d707;m. The resolving power (&#x1d438;/&#x1d6ff;&#x1d438;) at 8.5 &#x1d707;m is found to be about 4.

We also perform an optimisation of the near-IR detector geometry to see if a realistic device can be made that is sufficiently sensitive to 18.5 &#x1d707;m radiation. The results show that a realistic design could in theory be made but this strongly depends on how the detector is limited by the noise.<br/><br/>Next steps are to design a dedicated MKID for the mid-IR to determine its efficiency and dark current. This will also require us to improve the current measurement setup as measurements show that we suffer from thermal background radiation which limits the detector performance.","MKIDs; Infrared; Superconductivity; Kinetic Inductance; Microwave resonator; Single Photon Detection; Exoplanets; LIFE Initiative; LEKID; Lumped Element; NIR; MIR; Cooper pairs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Offshore wind energy has the potential to enable this transition to a CO2-emission-free energy supply. Consequently, the development of offshore wind farms in the Dutch North Sea has been expanding enormously in the last decade. The Dutch Government is also ambitious to achieve biodiversity goals in the Dutch North Sea, by restoring ecosystem functions. The European flat oyster is identified as a key species when restoring the biodiversity in the North Sea, because they embody a distinctive benthic community that provides a range of valuable ecosystem services. The environmental conditions in offshore wind farms have shown to be suitable to act as a habitat for the European flat oyster reefs, because of hard substrate and undisturbed areas. Multiple oyster recovery initiatives have been introduced in offshore wind farms, to kick-start oyster reef restoration. No larvae source is nearby, therefore oysters need to be introduced for oyster reefs to develop in offshore wind farms. These oysters are introduced by applying oyster brood stock structures, which are structures to which adult oysters are attached. The brood stock structures are installed by onboard cranes present at vessels, on the scour protection at offshore wind farms. This crane installation method has shown to be complicated and costly, due to the vessel type and equipment required. These complications result in a challenging and therefore limited application. Hence, there is a need to look for an alternative installation method, that ensures a simple and cost-effective application. Deployment of brood stock structures via dropping from a vessel manually is selected, which ensures easy deployment, because it does not require a crane (and a vessel that can hold this crane). This would decrease the engaged expenses significantly. Such a new installation method requires a different design for the brood stock structure. Research is needed into a new design for a flat oyster brood stock structures, which is appropriate for the drop installation method. This leads to the following research objective for this master thesis;<br/><br/>What is the design for a flat oyster brood stock structure, that can be installed at the scour protection at offshore wind farms, via dropping from a vessel, such that it will be stable and integer during deployment and operational lifetime? <br/><br/>Based on literature study and consultation sessions with experts, a set of design criteria for the<br/>droppable brood stock structure are set. Behavioural predictions are made for the performance of the concepts during the lifetime of the droppable broodstock structure by performing calculations.. which are used to select the most suited concept parameters (e.g. volume, dimensions) for the six basic concepts by an iterative process. Ten concepts emerged. <br/><br/>Physical model tests were performed to test the behaviour of the ten selected concepts during the<br/>relevant situations. Three types of tests are executed; fall test, land test and stability test. The physical model tests are performed in the wave flume in the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory at TU Delft.<br/>The fall test investigated the fall of the structure from the vessel onto the scour protection, to define<br/>the dropping accuracy during the fall. <br/>The land test investigates the landing of the structure on the scour protection, by analysing the<br/>interaction between the prototypes and the stone layer after dropping them in the wave flume. The<br/>interaction observation is used to get insight in the amount of oyster damage encountered during the landing. <br/>The stability test investigates the stability of the concepts during extreme hydraulic conditions, by<br/>generating storm conditions in the wave flume. <br/><br/>To select the design for a droppable flat oyster brood stock structure, the ten concepts are analysed<br/>and assessed, using two methods. The first method entails a requirement analysis and a multi-criteria analysis. Two concepts have been selected as suitable based on these methods, A Tetrapod concept and an Open Table concept.","Broodstock structure; Flat oyster; Offshore Wind Farms; biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This paper demonstrates the effects of bulk materials on the scraping process of a reclaim screw by modelling its mechanics using DEM, as scraping is most prone to external influences like consolidation. The reclaim screw has been simplified to a single linearised flat disk, which is still able to exhibit a behaviour similar to the screw. The effects of bulk parameters have been investigated using the DEM model by a comparison to the analytical model to see whether the simulation results agree, a screening process to find the most significant bulk parameters on the scraping process and an optimisation to find the optimal screw design of a low- and high-density bulk material.","Bulk handling; Discrete Element Method; Cutting; Screw conveyor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

However, these types of solvers are not able to automatically output a timetable when the problem gets overconstrained and no feasible solution exists.<br/><br/>It is possible to transform the timetabling problem into an equivalent Satisfiability problem that can be solved by SAT-solvers. In a recent thesis performed at NS, this has proven fruitful in cases where pre-chosen route choices prevent the model from finding a feasible solution.<br/>This is because the increased solving speed makes for a quicker discovery that no feasible solution is possible within the preset routes. It is then possible to iteratively call the solver, adding more route options in each iteration. By doing so, feasible timetables can be sought out within a reasonable time frame. Nonetheless, complications due to overconstraining still occur within these newer models, in particular when it comes to constraints that enforce train<br/>series to depart on set intervals, frequency constraints.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses on overcoming the problem of overconstraining due to frequency constraints and on consistently producing a timetable by using a maxSAT solver that can distinguish hard and soft constraints and assign them weights accordingly. Its aim is to minimize the total weight of violated soft constraints while maintaining all hard constraints, and this objective value can be compared to the total weight of violated clauses in solutions found by previous models.

With changing climate conditions and awareness of sustainable working, there has been a change in market demand to prevent raw materials from being exhausted and the living environment being affected. The current traditional industry is building with primary raw materials and is being challenged towards sustainable construction, but how the transition from traditional construction to sustainable construction will take place, is rather unclear. This resulted in the need for a good overview of different factors and aspects involved in the transition from traditional building towards circular building. A good overview was still missing and more research was needed into the innovation of reusing elements. Furthermore, the current calculation tools did not provide an insight into the total transition process from traditional building to circular building. Thus, for the construction sector, who currently has to minimize the usage of primary raw materials and reuse as much as possible, it was not clear which factors play a role in the transition process towards circular construction.

This work will examine how designers can use the patent stimuli to explore both design problems and solutions and in what way.<br/>The study applied a within-subject experiment with 6 participants. Each participant did brainstorming tasks with patent data tool and baseline tool. After the experiment, they gave feedbacks on the patent data tool. The concurrent think-aloud protocol, screen recording and idea sketches were used for explorative data analysis. <br/>From the participants' self-report, they all gave positive feedbacks on the tool's value for acquiring new knowledge for divergent ideation. External raters clustered all the ideas by categories, following function-behavior-structure theory model. The overall fixation rate in the patent data condition did not bypass the baseline condition. From qualitative analysis on the ideation process, the patent data tool effectively eliminated knowledge-based fixation in the query stage. Its textual stimuli helped to release conceptual fixation if they were not exposed to solution visuals. The patent stimuli inspired participants with solution directly but did not provide problems consistently. The limitations of patent data tools are discussed. It points out the possibilities of using supplementary tools to better support exploration on problems, using analogies and thinking at an abstract level and overcoming conceptual fixation.<br/>Lastly, future studies are needed to look into a combination of new tools to work with the patent data tool.

(mentor); van Beek, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Electric vehicles, electric cooking, heating installations running on electricity; the future is electric. This electrification creates a continuously growing demand of electricity. However, the electricity grid network is not able to transport these amounts of electricity and is facing problems. Part of the problem is created by charging electric vehicles (EV’s) which creates high peak demand on the local grid network. The challenge is to find better ways to charge these vehicles, especially in the future. This is what smart charging needs to do. Smart charging is adapting the time and or velocity of a charging session. <br/><br/>The main challenge addressed in this project is: How can Vattenfall offer a valuable smart charging proposition to enable EV drivers to use smart charging at home? <br/><br/>Three interesting scenarios of smart charging are found: simple scheduled charging using time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, charging to maximize local solar power production, or charging using Direct Load Control (DLC), in which the supplier of the solution can steer the charging session according to real-time data. <br/><br/>In comparison to other competitors in smart charging solutions, Vattenfall has the ability to influence energy tariffs, which was also something recognized by consumers during interviews. Also, there are currently no relevant TOU tariffs available. Therefore, the development of a smart charging proposition primarily focused on the design of new TOU tariffs. In addition, consumer preference towards all three smart charging scenarios is investigated. The challenge is to design an implementation roadmap that incorporates these various scenarios of smart charging. <br/><br/>Two interesting TOU tariffs were developed. Tariff Short Peak is a tariff with a peak price between 19h to 21h. The peak price should discourage people from using electricity during that time period - e.g. avoid to charge the car. The other tariff - called Daytime Plunge - offers a low price during the night and during the day from 11h - 17h, when solar power usually peaks and wholesale energy prices are usually low. Interviews to investigate desirability of both tariffs reveal that interest in these tariffs vary among consumers, and is partly determined by the financial advantage, but also by the type of consumer and their personal needs and routines. This variety in types of consumer and their preferences resulted in four different persona’s that show the diversity of people among EV drivers. The size of these persona groups and preference among these groups for one of the two tariffs give insight in the order and pacing in which these tariffs should be introduced. <br/><br/>Next to the development of new TOU tariffs, it was found that giving a financial incentive for the other two scenarios of smart charging, namely charging using DLC and using your own solar power, interests EV drivers. An implementation roadmap brings together the introduction of new tariffs, DLC and solar compensation, with the customer groups and plots them into three horizons. Each horizon introduces a vision relevant for Vattenfall to determine the focus of smart charging for that period. <br","smart charging; Electric Vehicle; electricity tariffs; Consumer Preferences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Commercially, various green energy technologies such as hydro, wind, solar, nuclear fission, etc. are being used to harness their stored energy and convert it into electricity. However, amongst these, the natural sources of energy are limited in the operation by their intermittent nature. This potentially leads to the instability of the power grid system. Hence, it is difficult to replace the existing conventional fossil-fired energy generation systems with their renewable counterparts, unless and until, flexibility is introduced to damp the intermittency<br/>of renewable sources of energy.<br/><br/>A Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (PTES) system, which uses a combination of a heat pump and heat engine to store electricity in form of heat and convert the heat back to electricity, could efficiently provide intraday to multiday flexibility. However, the literature reveals that this technology is not mature enough and requires enhanced research and experimental work.<br/><br/>The scope of this thesis includes a conceptual design, steady-state modelling, and optimization of a waste heat integrated PTES, alternatively called Compressed Heat Energy Storage (CHEST) system. Two configurations of the CHEST system were analysed: (i) CHEST with latent heat storage, and (ii) CHEST with sensible heat storage. A combination of R1233zD as a working fluid and sunflower oil<br/>as a sensible thermal energy storage medium was selected and a Phase Change Material (PCM) as a latent heat storage medium. Towards this end, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the effect of various design parameters on the performance of the system. It is found that CHEST systems are not suitable for high-temperature storage applications (&gt; 200°&#x1d436;). Further, the effect of superheating in a heat pump, and the effect of waste heat source temperature on system performance is investigated.<br/><br/>An optimization study is conducted on CHEST with a sensible storage configuration to use a single heat exchanger for the charging and discharging cycle during sensible heat transfer with a storage medium. A<br/>detailed comparison between the two configurations have been performed. Most notably a trade-off has to be set between the performance and economic viability of the system. <br/><br/>Finally, the integration of the optimised sensible heat storage configuration with a solar-powered alkaline electrolyser is evaluated. A 30 MW of heat from the electrolyser unit is considered to be recovered with the help of the CHEST system. Towards the end, a preliminary design of the CHEST components (heat exchangers and turbomachinery) is provided to estimate the overall sizing and performance characteristics of the components.","Energy Storage; Thermodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

Within the yachting industry, there is no consensus on whether these regulations can be fairly applied to yachts and there appears to be a research gap when it comes to auxiliary power consumption. The Yacht Environmental Transparency Index (YETI), currently under development by the Water Revolution Foundation, aims at attributing a score to a yacht according to its environmental impact and, for this, the calculation of auxiliary power consumption plays a large role. Due to the complexity of the dynamic behavior of the hundreds of electric consumers on board, predicting this electric power consumption becomes a demanding task. This research will analyze data from several yachts built at different shipyards in an attempt to find statistically significant correlations between installed power and certain sizing characteristics. The often subjective load factors included in load balances are kept in consideration and a possible reduction factor based on received feedback is studied. In the end, the goal is to arrive at an estimation of auxiliary power consumption for yachts between 30 and 180 meters in length.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, is an important predictor of CVD risk. In precedent work, carotid artery data was collected with ultrasound to estimate the PWV with a digital signal processing (DSP) pipeline. As a potential alternative to the DSP-based approach, this thesis studies the applicability of machine learning(ML) for the estimation of carotid artery motion (diameter, distension, etc.) and explores to what extent neural networks can exploit the ultrasound data to extract relevant biomarker information.<br/>Methods:<br/>This thesis proposes a ML pipeline that processes the ultrasound data in a different perspective than the DSP approach. The ML pipeline consists of four modules (neural networks &amp; post-processing) to: 1) segmentation based on cardiac cycle (CC), 2) detect the region of interest (ROI) of artery in the ultrasound data, 3) tracking the artery diameter and 4) post processing to estimate cardiac parameters e.g. pulse arrival time (PAT), an essential part of PWV estimation. Exploiting the features of the artery-lumen structure and time-evolving characteristics of collected ultrasound signal, the designed ML pipeline can acquire cardiac markers spatially and temporally with irregular kernels and sliding mechanism, decompose the complicated estimation into compact sub-modules.<br/>Results:<br/>The results show that the ML approach can successfully estimate the artery diameters and reserve important waveform features (max-slope moment) of the artery diameter, and can infer the CC markers without ECG data as a segmenting event for heart cycles. Thus, the PAT can be computed as the time difference of the max-slope moments of inferred artery diameter and detected CC markers. According to the numerical results, the PAT can be estimated on the average for an ultrasound data recording (120s), and the correlation coefficient of label PAT (computed from estimated parameters of DSP pipeline and ECG data) and estimated PAT (ML pipeline) is 0.8250. This indicates a good correlation and hence proves the effectiveness of the mean PAT estimation.<br/>Conclusion:<br/>In conclusion, the proposed ML pipeline can effectively estimate mean PAT, and demonstrate the feasibility to estimate PWV as a relevant cardiovascular marker using only ultrasound data of carotid arteries. Apart from the PAT, the heart rate can also be possibly tracked via intermediate results of the ML pipeline (CC markers). From the future perspective, the potential of phase information in the raw ultrasound data and further optimization are worth exploring, and the extension to hardware (e.g. chips, embedded system) can be implemented as a practical application.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-25","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

In urban areas of low-and-middle income countries, treatment of faecal sludge is often insufficient. On-site sanitation technologies can provide sustainable and more affordable sanitation solutions for urban areas, but only if functioning faecal sludge management is in place. As a first step for treatment, faecal sludge is dewatered, resulting in a solid stream and liquid stream. There are many existing technologies to treat the solid fraction. However, treatment technologies for the liquid are often insufficient and land-intensive. This liquid after dewatering of faecal sludge is called ‘supernatant’. The reason why treatment of this supernatant is difficult, is because the composition is prone to variability.<br/><br/>In conventional sewer-based wastewater treatment, attached growth processes have proven to be robust to influent variability. Those technologies do not take a lot of space, which is an advantage in urban areas. Attached growth processes are aerobic treatment processes in which the biomass responsible for treatment is attached to some type of medium. This research is a proof of concept whether an attached growth system, in this case an MBBR process, could be an alternative for existing supernatant treatment technologies in non-sewered sanitation. A 5000 people urban community-scale scenario is considered, covering variability in influent composition and intermittency in faecal sludge supply.<br/><br/>To prove this concept, there is looked whether COD and N removals can be achieved to certain discharge standards. <br/>First there is assessed whether the MBBR is able to run on one type of supernatant. After this, the variability in influent composition regarding COD/N ratio, salt ratio, and pH is tested by spiking the baseline supernatant. Intermittency in influent supply to the reactor is also tested. After these separate experiments, a realistic scenario is tested with supernatants from different types of sources, and intermittent supply over the weekend.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, the concept of using an MBBR for treatment of supernatant after dewatering of faecal sludge is proven for a community-scale scenario of 5000 people, and further research has to determine new outcomes like the possibility of pathogen reduction and phosphorous removal. After this, field tests need to determine the actual feasibility full-scale in non-sewered sanitation setting.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

At the same time, they are moving into the everyday world, where they need to operate in uncontrolled and cluttered environments. In order to extend the set of tasks that a robot can autonomously accomplish in such environments, we can equip mobile bases with a pushing skill. Possible use cases are delivering packages by pushing objects to a goal location, or clearing a path by pushing movable obstacles out of the way.<br/><br/>This thesis considers pushing with a non-holonomic mobile robot in cluttered environments. We develop a learning-based method, based on ensembles of probabilistic neural networks for learning the object’s dynamics. The models capture the inherent stochasticity of pushing from the variability of friction. In addition, the ensembles can capture the uncertainty that arises from a lack of data, so we can reason about which regions to avoid during the pushing and do not come into unrecoverable states.<br/><br/>The model is combined with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. Each timestep the controller optimizes for a finite time horizon, which allows us to recover from slight model inaccuracies. The MPPI controller is capable of handling complex cost functions, which allows us to include the estimated uncertainty from the model to avoid uncertain regions. For obstacle-aware pushing, we provide the MPPI controller with a costmap grid, that contains the free pushing space, which the robot and object can use to maneuver to the goal location. Both the robot and object are constrained to keep within the free pushing space, which is constructed using LiDAR measurements.<br/><br/>We verify the method in simulation and compare it to two baseline methods: the state-of-the-art adaptive pushing controller proposed by Krivic et al. [31] and a pushing policy trained with the model-free reinforcement learning baseline Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). All three baselines reach comparable success rates in simulation of 100%, 98% and 96%, respectively. Furthermore, the learning-based MPPI shows improvements of 50% and 23% in accuracy compared to the baselines. The results are consistent for pushing in cluttered environments, where we show an increase of accuracy by 43%, compared to Krivic et al. [31].<br/><br/>Lastly, we validate the approach in a real-world setting, where the robot and object are tracked with a motion capture system. The approach has an overall success rate of 94% and performs successful pushing in a cluttered environment.","Push Manipulation; Learning-based Control; Mobile Robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Das, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Recommender systems help users to find items they presumably like based on data collected on that user. Collaborative filtering is arguably the most common recommendation system technique. It uses collected ratings to compute similarities between users and recommends items based on those similarities. With that, a problem arises when there are few ratings available for a user, also called the cold start problem. An even stricter setting is where no ratings of a user are available at all, called the pure cold start problem. Graphs are a natural way to represent data in this domain and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in the domain of recommender systems over the past few years. In this work, we address this problem from a graph perspective. In the current literature, the problem is alleviated by turning to external information, such as demographic or social information. Although these methods work, they cannot be deployed in situations where this information is not available. However, our approach uses only rating data. As ratings are unavailable for pure cold start users, their connectivity to the graph is unknown. To overcome this, we use a stochastic attachment model to infer connectivity. This model is composed of a Bernoulli random variable with the corresponding probability value and edge weight for each existing user. In this work, we propose to learn the parameters of a graph convolution model through empirical risk minimization using the stochastic attachment model to attach users who previously attached to the graph and their ratings, and use it to predict the same for unseen users. Furthermore, we propose to learn the probability and weight values of the stochastic attachment model jointly with the parameters of the graph convolution model. We compare these methods to several graph based and non-graph baselines. Furthermore, we compare different methods such as graph filters, GCNNs, and kNN. The experiments show significant improvements of the graph approaches compared to the non-graph baselines. Furthermore, we show that training on stochastically expanded graphs improves accuracy compared to only testing on them by induction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

Then, less new material is needed and the amount of waste products is reduced. However, there are questions regarding the performance of asphalt mixtures with high RAP percentages, particularly in terms of potentially excessive high stiffness and a decrease in workability. In the Netherlands, a RAP content of 60% in combination with a softer binder is common practice, but an increase in RAP content means that rejuvenators are often required. <br/><br/>The research objective was to study the multi-scale material properties of hot mix asphalt mixtures with high reclaimed asphalt pavement percentages using micromechanics. At binder level, the DSR test was done and it was also used to select and reject the rejuvenators which are applied at mixture level. The chosen rejuvenators, Neomex HR and Cecabase RWI, were applied to the mixtures with 80% RAP. Besides that, a reference mixture was tested with 65% RAP and a reference mixture of 80% RAP. Further, the results were used to fit a modified micromechanical Hirsch model for RAP mixtures with rejuvenators. <br/><br/>Based on the material tests and comparing it with the reference (65% RAP mixture), it turned out that there is potential to implement 80% RAP mixtures. Both moisture sensitivity and the rutting resistance are improved when a higher RAP content is applied, while the total fracture toughness has remained the same. The stiffness of the 80% RAP mixture is substantially higher, but it is still applicable. The biggest concern is the fatigue resistance, because the fatigue resistance of the 80% RAP mixture without rejuvenator is worse for higher strains. <br/><br/>The application of the rejuvenating additives led to the properties of the 80% mixtures being more similar to the 65% RAP mixture and the workability is improved. However, it did appear that the dosage of the additives is on the high side. The stiffness is lower than the reference mixture, especially the mixture with Neomex HR. Also, the rutting resistance is lower than the reference mixture, especially the mixture with Cecabase RWI. Future research may optimize the dosage to improve results. <br/><br/>The micromechanical Hirsch model provided stiffness results with a reasonably accuracy, although this model used general model coefficients. The simplified Hirsch model with inclusion of the factor Pa could not be simply adopted when it is fit for other types of mixtures. The predicted stiffness for all three mixtures was much higher than it actually is. The adjustment of the fitting parameters, according to the laboratory results of the 80% RAP, led to accurate results making the simplified Hirsch model with inclusion of the factor Pa applicable to the mixtures with 80% RAP and a rejuvenating additive.<br","Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement; Rejuvenator; Hirsch model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A very promising line of research focuses in the development of Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) technologies; through which carbon-neutral liquid fuels could be synthesized. A great example of such technologies can be found in Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF), a dutch start-up currently developing a microplant capable of producing methanol from solar energy and ambient air. ZEF’s process involves the capture of CO2 and H2O directly from ambient air, the splitting of the captured H2O into its constituent<br/>elements through electrolysis, and the synthesis of methanol from H2 and CO2. The entire process is powered by solar energy, which makes ZEF’s methanol a carbon-neutral liquid fuel.<br/><br/>This thesis focuses in the capture of CO2 and H2O from ambient air, a process known as Direct Air Capture (DAC). ZEF’s DAC unit differs from industry standards by using a novel continuous chemical absorption process through the flow of an amine based sorbent between its absorption and regeneration systems, instead of using a conventional batch process through a supported sorbent. The work of this thesis pertains the build and experimental characterization of ZEF’s first full scale DAC prototype, referred to as the 10X DAC prototype.<br/><br/>The built prototype, a fully functional DAC unit working in a continuous process, was experimentally characterized in terms of its performance and energy efficiency for the environmental conditions of the Dutch summer (i.e. hot and wet conditions). The absorption process was found to be limited by the capture of CO2 when compared to the H2O capture process, and to be liquid side limited; which aligned with literature sources where CO2 capture is defined as diffusion limited in the liquid side. Overall, the 10X DAC absorption column has the capacity of capturing 0.52 kgCO2/m3·hr; which is higher than the reported capture capacity of a very well established company like Carbon Engineering. In the<br/>regeneration process, residence times in the stripper column as low as six minutes were enough for the sorbent to reach vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) loadings for a regeneration temperature of 120◦C. The overall 10X DAC process is capable of producing 0.21 kgCO2/hr with an energy demand of up to 33MJ/kgCO2; which is up to 6 times higher than the reported most energy efficient DAC unit in industry. Furthermore, the H2O:CO2 product ratio was found to vary significantly, with a dependence to absolute humidity in the environment.<br/><br/>Through the experimental results of the characterization process, a chemical absorption model was developed which, assuming a liquid side diffusion limited process, considers the effects of the selected sorbent’s characteristics and the environmental conditions in the absorption process. Through this model, and the use of previous developed regeneration models, a DAC cycle is presented through which the effects of varying dynamic conditions (i.e. absolute humidity and ambient air temperature) were determined. Overall, it was noticed that the performance of the absorption process was negatively affected by higher temperatures, while the regeneration process remained unaffected by temperature<br/>changes. Absolute humidity variations affected the H2O loading of the sorbent, which then affected the performance of the regeneration process; lower H2O loadings in the rich sorbent translated to higher CO2 lean loadings after regeneration. Furthermore, it was determined that the current sorbent in ZEF’s process favors cold and humid environments. <br/><br/>Finally, through the learnings and findings from both experiments and the developed absorption model, an optimized 10X DAC design is presented which focuses in meeting the CO2 production and energy demand requirements established by ZEF for its process.","Direct Air Capture; Experimental Characterization; Absorption; TEPA; PEG; CO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

This poses a risk to the coastal protection as well as rivers and lakes close to the coast. Solutions are needed to cope with this threat. The past decade, nature based solutions have gained significant interest. One of these solutions could be sandy foreshores. Due to the use of natural materials, sandy foreshores are a ‘nature-based solution’ opposed to a more traditional approach of dike reinforcement. For sandy foreshores to be a viable alternative to regular dike reinforcements, the order of magnitude of construction and maintenance costs need to be known. For this reason, it is necessary to be able to calculate a failure probability of a dike with sandy foreshore, to predict the required maintenance and to optimize the design based on life-cycle costs. <br/><br/>To improve the calculation method, a step-wise calculation of the failure probability for wave overtopping of a hybrid structure was developed. The calculation included an iterative process. The calculation methods consists out of calculating the failure probability for wave overtopping in Riskeer and a dune erosion calculation in Xbeach. In this research, overtopping was considered as the dominant failuremechanism. For the assessment, the dike was seen as an impermeable hard layer and the foreshore as a beach. Therefore, dune erosion could not erode the main structure and is considered a sub-mechanism of overtopping.<br/><br/>Next, a calculation was performed to predict the longshore transport along the beach in Almere Duin. The occurrence of different wind directions, together with a Delft3D model of the Markermeer, was combined to find the longshore transport. The LST was calculated with transport formula calibrated for coastal areas. The life cycle costs (LCC), including design and maintenance costs, were calculated for different strategies. The calculated alongshore transport together with cost estimates were used to calculate the LCC. Subsequently, the net present value of the maintenance costs was calculated to determine the LCC for each maintenance strategy. At the end the uncertainty and sensitivity of each strategy were analysed. <br/><br/>The time-varying protection level can be optimized by calculating the failure probability due to wave overtopping, with Riskeer and calculating the erosion of the foreshore, with Xbeach. To use this method, Riskeer and Xbeach should have the same design point and if the design point shifts, an extra iteration is necessary. For a 1/10 profile, only a 0.25 m lowering of the foreshore height was found and one extra iterative step was required to carry out the calculation. A maintenance strategy with a 100 year maintenance interval period was found to be optimal in this thesis and a Monte Carlo simulation, which included uncertainties, led to similar results. However, the total LCC were 21% to 34% higher, when uncertainties were included in the calculation. These findings suggest that it is not necessary, to carry out a probabilistic calculation, to find the optimal maintenance strategy. However, the models used, aswell as the local boundary conditions, such as the longshore transport and the cost of sand, were found to influence the life cycle costs significantly. For this reason, it is concluded that a location specific analysis is important to optimize the maintenance strategy. <br","Overtopping; dune erosion; Riskeer; XBeach; Probabilistic analysis; Lake; markermeer; IJmeer; Almere; Almere Duin; Low-energy; Fetch-limited; Non-tidal; Life cycle costing (LCC); longshore transport; Shallow water; Foreshore; sandy foreshore; sandy solutions; sandy; lake environment; failure probability; Maintenance; Building with Nature; IJmeerdijk; wave overtopping; nature based solution; Almere Duin Noord; beach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.351551115918625, 5.133842587441426"

The biological effect of FLASH is seen under ultra-high dose-rates conditions and is beneficial in the damage to healthy tissue. The FLASH effect could enable the clinical feasibility of definitive radiotherapy for low-risk early-stage breast cancer patients. Some of these patients can not receive surgery for medical reasons and definitive conventional radiotherapy carries a high risk of toxicities. FLASH proton therapy could be a viable option for these patients. The biological FLASH effect enables to reduce the risk of toxicities by sparing healthy tissue and proton therapy enables to deliver dose to the cancer cells effectively.<br/>This thesis proposes a pencil beam scanning (PBS) ridge filter simulation set-up to achieve ultra-high dose-rates. The ridge filter generates spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) beams that cover a broader depth of the tumor, avoiding the time-consuming energy switching of conventional PBS. An optimization is performed with intensity-modulated ridge filtered beams. SOBP beams with a width of 3 cm are implemented in the in-house treatment planning software Erasmus-iCycle to generate ridge filter treatment plans for two patients.<br/>In this study, the dosimetric feasibility is determined by comparing the ridge filter treatment plans to conventional intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment plans. The clinical acceptability of the treatment plans is assessed by dose uniformity and dose coverage. Furthermore, toxicity-model endpoints for fat necrosis and fibrosis are used to evaluate the treatment plans. The generated ridge filter treatment plans outperform the generated IMPT treatment plans for a FLASH enhancement ratio between 1.19-1.39 for one of the patients. The other patient required a FER in the order of magnitude of 2.0.<br/>The results of the study suggest that it is feasible to generate ridge filter treatment plans with the proposed set-up. However, the dosimetric feasibility comes with limitations in the tumor characteristics (size and position) and needs further investigation. More knowledge is needed of the optimal ridge filter, the optimization of SOBP beams, and the FLASH effect before clinically acceptable FLASH-compatible ridge filter treatment plans can be achieved.","FLASH radiotherapy; FLASH proton therapy; Proton therapy; Pencil beam scanning; Spread-out Bragg peak; Ridge filter; Definitive radiotherapy; Breast cancer; Treatment Planning; Intensity modulated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-24","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This research focuses on reliability-based, Bayesian updating of grout anchors’ bearing capacity. Firstly, grouted anchors are commonly used in practice, even though large uncertainties surround their bearing capacity. Secondly, every anchor must be tested on their working load for quality assurance. Because of the combination of those two factors, Bayesian updating on grout anchors yields large potential. The measurement data can be used in the design process, to reduce uncertainties. The main goal of this research was to establish how reliability-based updating can be applied in the context of grout anchor bearing capacity. The motivation to use such techniques is to increase the efficiency of existing structures, like in this case study for quay walls, or to adapt the design during construction, effectively cutting costs in both cases.<br/><br/>This research was conducted using measurement data from the HHTT quay wall at the port of Rotterdam, applying a recently developed analytical anchor displacement model, and the Bayesian updating technique ’aBUS-SuS’. The combination of both of these methods in this context is a novelty approach to the subject. The first step was to derive the soil parameters necessary to reproduce the measurements to prove firstly, that the model is capable to capture anchor behavior, secondly to get a better understanding of how the model functions in this context, and thirdly to establish a baseline of the parameters necessary for the estimation of prior distributions.<br/>The second step was the application of the Bayesian updating algorithm. There, the prior distributions, which are needed as an input, are generated using the results from the first step. The resulting posterior distributions are then related to failure limits of the critical soil parameters that were derived according to a common anchor failure criterion. This gives an indication of the anchor’s utilization and disposition to failure. <br/><br/>The results exhibited failure conditions for those anchors that were at failure, verifying that the novelty approach can be applied to the problem. Another finding was that depending on the soil parameter, conclusions can be drawn about the likeliness of the failure type. This means how brittle or elastic the failure might be.<br/><br/>The analyses showed that the studied procedure has potential and the anchor’s proneness to failure can be assessed. The underlying analytical model is suitable for the applied type of Bayesian updating because the results are in the same range as for the calibration, but on average slightly lower in their mean magnitude. Thus, additional information is obtained, and the overall uncertainty is reduced. Furthermore, the analyses of the suitability tests gave a quantifiable indication of the anchors’ reliability under failure load that was in line with measured failure indication under working load.<br/><br/>Even though the uncertainty that surrounds the anchor-design was reduced, limitations to the framework arose. The analytical model requires uncommon soil parameters as an input. Those parameters need to be specifically determined in laboratory investigations and cannot be tested for on site. The model in- and output needs to match the measurements to the failure criterion of the anchors, and in anchor design, advanced analytical models, like the one used in this research are scarce. The measurement always have certain errors inherent. These errors can lead to diffuse and noisy posterior distributions. Furthermore, a minimum amount of measurements must be available in the first place, otherwise the algorithm does not converge properly towards a solution.<br/><br/>This is why it is recommended to get detailed insight of the soil parameters at question also under higher stresses and strains than the anticipated working loads. This helps to give better estimations of the prior distributions and their bounds, and also gives larger confidence in the posterior distributions as a result. Furthermore, this also helps to establish precise parametric limits corresponding to failure, for which the reliability can be evaluated.","Anchor; Bayesian updating; Reliability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Mechanical effects of light pulses are exploited to spatially separate and recombine the wavepackets of cooled atoms, which, thus, interfere; by engineering 3D specific instrument configu<br/>rations, from the interferometer phase shift all elements of the gravity gradient tensor could be traced back, as well as the full spacecraft angular velocity vector. This performance is enhanced by the high common-mode rejection of noise, due to the differential nature of gradiometers’ measurements. Furthermore, in space, the microgravity environment prolongs the atoms’ interrogation time, improving the interferometer sensitivity. On top of this, CAI’s spectral behaviour features a very low flat white noise over the entire frequency range. Another advantage of these sensors is the absence of moving parts, making them drift-free and yielding no need for instrument recalibration, fundamental for deep-space payloads. In the current hectic scenario of exploration campaigns to Mars, the latter is deemed an excellent case study for a CAI-based gradiometry mission as refined gravity field models are required to further our understanding of the Red Planet. To this end, missions must be designed to sustain continuous monitoring of the target body and uniform global sampling, ensured by selecting an appropriate orbit (low and polar).<br/>Both analytic and numerical covariance analysis approaches are adopted to retrieve the Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients’ error spectra, for several CAI-based mission concepts with different orbit geometries. Compared to the latest gravity field model of Mars (MRO120F), with a maximum SH degree of 120, the treated missions can achieve degree strengths up to 390 for the static gravity field. At degree 120, the maximum SNR is about 10^3 with the most sensitive instruments. Exploiting these exceptional results, several scientific objectives can be addressed, regarding the crust and lithosphere structure, the planetary thermal evolution, the magmatism and diverse geological features, such as<br/>impact basins and quasi-circular depressions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Shortages in obstetric care mean that not all women and their partners receive the care they need before, during and after pregnancy. To counter these shortages, there are opportunities in technology and continuity in maternity care. <br/><br/>Erasmus MC has set up its own (online) care path for preconception care, Smarter Pregnant. This programme consists of online platforms for preconception screening and the outpatient clinic healthy pregnant (OCHP). OCHP is a counselling session for couples or individuals to make pregnancy as healthy as possible or to obtain the healthiest possible lifestyle to get pregnant. Most of the pain points occur when filling in and processing data in the Slimmer Zwanger's system. The current system of Smarter Pregnant is often not understood by patients and nurses have to process the data manually. This processing of data is perceived by nurses as monotonous - which is why nurses report that the work feels robotic. Moreover, there is less focus on delivering care and more on interacting with the system. As a result, patients have to search for more information on the internet, getting lost in the validated and non-validated e-health for conception. Therefore, the need for an authoritative and trustworthy source of information for the OCHP is great.<br/><br/>The specific focus of this study is on creating a trustworthy VA for OCHP. The dimensions of trustworthiness are leading for the interaction and thus the design of the Voice Assistant. There are three layers that were considered when creating the Voice Assistant for the OCHP; the user, the context and the technology. In the current context, trustworthiness is generated by taking responsibility and exuding expertise. Responsibility is something the nurse has to take on the word of the patient and partner. The trustworthiness of the nurse can be measured by his or her expertise. Expertise is considered a dimension of trustworthiness in existing models.<br/><br/>To decide what the VA had to look and sound like, several experimental prototypes were conducted during the context analysis and collection of existing theories and methods. These prototypes served both as validation of research, and to spawn further research. The results of these studies led to a final prototype.<br/><br/>Each test ended with a qualitative interview with the patient based on the dimensions of trustworthiness. To structure patients' responses to the VA, three research questions were formulated regarding; expectations, comparing human-to-human versus human-to-robot interaction and characteristics affecting trustworthiness. Because the context analysis revealed that in the context of OCHP, trustworthiness depends on expertise, this research question was reformulated specifically regarding expertise. <br/><br/>These themes helped accomplish and structure the overarching goal of the project: Forming principles on how trustworthy VAs can be designed for healthcare in the future. These principles form a set of pointers on how trustworthiness can be implemented in a VA for healthcare. <br","Voice Assistants; Healthcare; Trustworthiness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

As a counter measure, the government is aiming to increase the construction of new houses from around 70 thousand annually to 100 thousand annually, to achieve 900 thousand new houses by 2030. At the same time the world is facing a climate crisis and the Netherlands has pledged to decrease its emissions by at least 50% in 2030 in respect to 1990. The country must therefore reduce the impact of new built houses to be able to build more while reducing the total emissions. <br/>Currently most houses are built with reinforced concrete which is generally not seen as a sustainable construction method due to the carbon emissions related to cement production. Building houses with cross-laminated timber panels or lightweight steel frames are proposed alternatives with a lower expected carbon footprint. This study was set up to perform a life cycle assessment of a steel and a timber building to compare their impact and find out under which circumstances building with steel or timber is a more sustainable option. A case study was found of a timber building and a hypothetical alternative was designed with steel frames which were both studied under three scenarios. The scenarios represent the choices that could be made regarding material production and waste treatment, ordered from worst-case, to expected, to best-case scenario. <br/>When including the climate impact of construction, the treatment of waste, end-of-life benefits and carbon storage, the timber building performed better than the steel building in every scenario regarding global warming. However, waste treatment, end-of-life benefits and carbon storage are all dependent on future processes and emissions happening after 2030. When only the construction is included, the steel building outperformed the timber variant in the expected and best-case scenario. For this reason, building more houses with lightweight steelframes produced with at least 50% recycled steel would be the most beneficial for the Netherlands to reach its 2030 climate goals. When taking a longer timespan into consideration, timber buildings are the preferred choice due to the carbon storage effect, as long as the forests are replanted sustainably. <br/>Either alternative was found to be a better alternative than the current houses built with reinforced concrete. If all houses built before 2030 were made with the alternative production methods this could save at least 20 Megaton of CO2 emissions. Because the alternatives researched made efficient use of materials, no significant issues were found for the demand of wood or steel in the Netherlands. In fact, steel demand is likely to decrease due to the reduced need for reinforcement steel. Further improvement on both alternatives is possible by increasing the potential lifespan of the buildings and reducing the emissions related to energy use in the production of materials.<br/>The outcomes of this study may influence decision making depending on the weight the Dutch government gives to its climate goals of 2030 versus its total impact on climate change. Constructing steelframe houses may reduce construction emissions by 4% compared to timber by 2030 but would result in 64% more emission in 2100 due to the missed-out carbon storage. In general, the construction industry can improve a lot by increased use of low-carbon alternatives such as lightweight recycled steel and biobased materials.<br","LCA; Construction Materials; Sustainability; Life cycle Assessment; Cross-laminated timber; CLT; Lightweight steel frame; LSF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

This will increase the demand for raw materials used in batteries, such as graphite. Further, due to geopolitical risk and the need for sustainable sources, graphite mining is also of interest in Europe and nations like Finland. During the concentration and/or refining of ore, an enormous amount of waste is produced due to the low concentration of the desired element. Some of the material of interest ends up in these side streams, as for example, in the tailings. However, the waste can potentially be used as a secondary source of raw materials.<br/><br/>In this work the potential processing scenarios of graphite mine tailings were inves-tigated. The studied tailings samples originated from pilot metallurgical test work done in Canada with Aitolampi graphite ore. According to the analysis results, the tailings contain high concentrations of sulfidic sulfur and heavy metals, posing a potential risk of acid mine drainage. In this work, the potential strategies for harmful elements removal were studied and advantages and disadvantages were evaluated. This thesis work included magnetic and gravity separation test work done for tailings samples. Additionally, leaching experiments with varying acid molarity, temperature, and solid-to-liquid ratio were conducted.<br/><br/>Based on the results, with a low-intensity magnetic separator, 58–64% of sulfidic sulfur could be recovered. Additionally, the magnetic product is theoretically suitable to be used in sulfuric acid production. Further, with gravity separation, the grade of Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn could be increased by a ratio of two to three. By leaching experiments, the leaching orders of the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite were confirmed. However, the concentrations of Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the tailings were too low, and Fe was too high to be economically attractive, so that recovery utilizing only leaching would be economical. This suggests that low grade tailings will still require technological innovations to achieve concentrates suitable for state-of-the-art refining.","Circular economy; Graphite; Tailings; Sulfur; Metal recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-25","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","BATCircle 2.0",""

This deterioration is part of a bigger issue called planned obsolescence. Due to a ‘need’ to buy new products regularly, there is rampant consumerism which has created a decrease in raw-materials and an increase in the products and materials entering the waste streams. Therefore, it is imperative that this “cradle-to-grave” model is stopped. The EU and various governments in the EU have proposed legislation to transition from today’s linear economy to a circular economy. As part of that, there is greater emphasis placed on a product’s repairability, durability and product lifespan.<br/>Repair scorecards are used to evaluate products on those parameters. However, the current scorecards have abstract scores that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, this thesis proposes a quantitative tool that calculates the total cost of ownership (TCOO) and service life of a product by modelling product lifetimes using failure modes. <br/>This thesis begins with performing a literature study of linear economy and planned obsolescence, current scorecards, and their limitations. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted to understand what consumers wanted from a repair scorecard. The results from these were used to design the label and website of the TCOO tool. A system was created to facilitate the TCOO Excel tool, label, and website. <br/>The mathematical model to calculate the TCOO was built-in to an Excel tool, and sample data was used to iterate upon them. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the Excel tool. User tests were conducted to test if the Excel tool was intuitive to use and the flow of the tool iterated upon. User tests were conducted to refine the design of the label and the website. <br/>The main contribution of this thesis lies in presenting the factors of repairability, durability and product lifespan in terms of cost, modelling product lifetimes, and moving from a priority component-based calculation system to a failure mode-based system. Using this tool, consumers can make informed purchase decisions, and manufacturers get data regarding failure, and legislators get data to introduce new laws and mandates. <br","Cost of Ownership; Scorecard; Repairability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Observability analysis using differential geometry shows that the proposed CRL scheme can expand the observable subspace compared to other alternatives using only direct distances between the host agent and its neighbors. In addition, we apply the kernel-induced extended Kalman filter (EKF) to the CRL state estimation problem with the novel-designed Logarithmic-Versoria (LV) kernel to tackle heavy-tailed UWB noise. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of the fixed-point iteration involved in the estimation algorithm are also derived. Comparative Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed CRL scheme combined with the LV-kernel EKF significantly improves the estimation accuracy owing to its robustness against both the measurement outliers and incorrect measurement covariance matrix initialization. Moreover, with the LV kernel, the estimation is still satisfactory when performing the fixed-point iteration only once for reduced computational complexity.","Cooperative Localization; Relative Localization; Ultra-wideband; Kernel method; Kalman Filtering; Observability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

They translate innovative ideas into valuable products and services which in several cases also contribute to a more sustainable, convenient, and ethical world. Moreover, entrepreneurship is one of the most significant drivers of economic growth in a particular area. The entrepreneurship literature has shown that entrepreneurs are usually highly dependent on the environment in which they arise. Some sites show higher entrepreneurial activities than others, which is often due to the available resources and the interconnectedness between the involved actors in these areas. To comprehend the complex nature of these business environments, the term ‘Entrepreneurial ecosystem’ (EE) emerged, which systematically looks at the resources and interconnections between actors at a certain place. A successful EE is perceived as an area in which ventures cultivate and grow. Previous studies which explored how these EE emerge, particularly focussed on how public authorities position themselves. On the contrary, this research aims to shed light on the role of a private developer in shaping an EE. The data of this study is collected by reviewing the literature about EEs and the influence of private developers. This literature review formed the academic foundation of this study. Afterward, 16 in-depth expert interviews were conducted. Subsequently, the data from the interviews were thematically coded and analysed using Atlas.ti. Ultimately, comparison and discussion between the literature review and the interviews are conducted. The findings of this study indicate that developers exert their influence in different ways. First of all, they develop meeting places, to stimulate encounters. Secondly, they offer flexibility in terms of space to respond to the growth of the companies. And thirdly, they develop spaces that can be shared by multiple companies. Aside from these three physical design principles developers adopt in shaping the built environment, they also exert their influence in selecting certain end-users. The results demonstrate that putting a cluster of start- and scaleups, a small share of established companies, and academia closely together empowers the overall EE. Furthermore, a key takeaway is that developing an ecosystem goes beyond developing real estate. Needless to say, facilitating the needs of entrepreneurs supports them in growth. These needs are not only accommodation-related but also cover soft services (e.g, organizing events). Next, these needs also continuously change. This implies that a developer should be adaptable to quickly respond to these fast-changing needs. Over and above that, they could participate in the operations phase to ensure that they transfer the developed buildings whenever not solely the real estate, but the actual EE is finished. Evidently, this is not the core business of developers. Therefore, they could team up and invest in a collaboration with another party that is more specialized in real estate operations and soft service provision. Overall, this study added a chunk of new information to the existing body of knowledge about EEs. It shed light on what role and responsibilities of a private developer, and what influence they exert, and could exert in shaping an EE.","Entrepreneurial Ecosystem; Area Development; Influencing; Tactical management; Private sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Cao, Wen-Jun (mentor); van Bueren, Ellen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the acceleration of global urbanization, most of us will live in cities in the future. As the urban population grows, the shortage of residential buildings has become a more and more severe problem. In response to the rising demand for housing, more and more builders in Europe, East Asia, Australia and other places have begun to adopt a method called modular construction to build houses. By pre-constructing building components off-site, then combining them into a complete modular unit and transporting them to the building site for assembly, this approach can cut construction time in half and significantly reduce on-site labour costs (Hong, 2020). Modular construction is well suited for tall buildings due to its inherent topological modular form and increased number of repeatable modules (Thai, Ngo and Uy, 2020). <br/><br/>However, most builders currently do not consider the concept of circularity when producing modules, let alone how they will be dismantled and reused in the future. It is conceivable that in the end a large number of discarded modular units will be sent to landfills, creating a large amount of solid waste and consuming many resources to dispose of them, while the functionality of the module still can work to fit the demand. Suppose we can consider the concept of circular economy at the beginning of the project and design the modular units to be easily disassembled and reused, in that case, we will benefit not only economically, but also significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the project.<br/><br/>Based on the problem, it can be found that there is currently a research gap between circular economy and modular buildings. And there is still no tool for evaluating the circularity of modular buildings based on their characteristics. Therefore, this study aims to propose a method for circularity measurement based on the characteristics of modular buildings and modular construction.<br/><br/>A review of design strategies for circular construction reveals a number of recognised strategies. Depending on the characteristics of modular construction, design for durability, adaptability, disassembling and reusability can be selected as suitable circular strategies for modular construction. From a structural point of view, an evaluation method called Module Circularity Indicator (MCI) was developed. The method takes into account the structure, the connection method and the loading capacity of modules and assigns a weight to each structural factor based on the results of a questionnaire in order to evaluate the circularity of the modular unit on a numerical basis. Project owners and designers, especially structural engineers, can use this method to evaluate the circularity of modular projects in terms of four dimensions.<br/><br/>A study using student accommodation as a case was carried out to explore the economic and environmental impact of MCI. Through the case study, it was found that a higher MCI score does not lead to better economic returns and that investors need additional incentives to invest in more sustainable modular buildings. Furthermore, a higher MCI can reduce the environmental impact of a project to some extent, but the materials used in the modules are also important. In order to achieve a circular economy in the construction industry, MCI could be used as an indicator to subsidise highly circular modular buildings in order to encourage owners to invest in highly sustainable projects. This will allow the modular building industry to move towards more circular projects and reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry.","circular economy; Modular construction; modular building; Circular assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

In this transition, hydrogen is also predicted to play a key role, due to its ability to transport and store substantial amounts of energy. Previous studies have shown that for large offshore wind capacities and substantial distances from the shore, transporting the produced energy in the form of molecules (converting the electricity to hydrogen) via dedicated pipelines would be a more cost-effective option than using electricity cables and converting electricity to hydrogen. This transport could be achieved by developing new hydrogen-dedicated infrastructure or reusing existing natural gas pipelines, which is a cost-effective alternative.<br/><br/>This research study aims to determine the potential for repurposing existing gas infrastructure in the North Sea for hydrogen transport, taking into consideration that this infrastructure will still have to transport natural gas to the shore over the coming years. Redirecting an amount of this natural gas to other, neighboring pipelines creates the possibility for existing pipelines to be freed up for hydrogen transportation, and therefore achieve parallel transmission of green hydrogen and natural gas from the Dutch North Sea to the shore. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis project is to examine the geographical, technical, and economic feasibility of large-scale green hydrogen transportation (produced offshore with green energy from wind turbines), with parallel natural gas transport, via new and already existing gas infrastructure in the North Sea, by 2030.<br/><br/>The first aspect to be analyzed was the geographical configuration of such a system. For that purpose, different possible configurations for parallel transport of hydrogen and natural gas via existing North Sea infrastructure were examined. This analysis indicated that the most suitable scenario, considering the projected timeline and current circumstances, would be repurposing the NGT pipeline for 100% hydrogen transportation (produced from offshore wind search areas 7 and 3), and rerouting the natural gas to the NOGAT pipeline. Both NGT and NOGAT pipelines are parts of the North Sea offshore pipeline system, currently transporting natural gas to the Dutch shore. The next part of the study concerned the physical configuration of the hydrogen transportation system. A component analysis was done, highlighting the most suitable components across the entire system configuration, including the offshore hydrogen production by water electrolysis, its compression, and its transportation via the NGT pipeline among others.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a more elaborate analysis was done to determine the project’s technical feasibility, with emphasis being placed on the key aspects of hydrogen compression and transportation, evaluating its flow characteristics and compression requirements. The analysis results showed that transporting hydrogen via the NGT pipeline to the Dutch shore is technically feasible. Based on the analyzed scenario, the maximum hydrogen transport capacity was found to be 7.9 GW, and the total compression capacity 103 MW. During its transportation along the length of the pipeline (253 km), hydrogen experiences a pressure drop of 10.4 bar (65 bar to 55 bar). An economic evaluation of the system was also performed, indicating that the project is feasible from a financial standpoint as well. The LCOH transport for the proposed system, including hydrogen compression and NGT pipeline repurposing costs, was found to be 0.17 €/kg/1000km. The overall conclusion of this study is that reusing existing infrastructure in the North Sea for hydrogen transportation is a physically and technically feasible option, which can be achieved at a competitive cost.","Green hydrogen; Offshore Wind; North Sea; Hydrogen Transport; Natural Gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","53.976481, 4.087709"

Very little data is known about the intensities and precipitation amounts and the resulting river discharges. This research project firstly aims to gather as much data as possible on precipitation and river discharges that could cause the floods, it focuses on a small catchment in the city called the Mahiga catchment. Data is gathered by installing three tipping buckets and two trail cameras. The cameras were able to calculate the river discharges using an innovative open-source program called OpenRiverCam. Thanks to this program a hydrograph can be<br/>made of the river for each precipitation event. The used cameras were trail cameras of the Brand Bushnell. During this project it was concluded that, due to their unreliability, using trail cameras with OpenRiverCam is really not recommended. Security cameras with a Raspberry Pi are more suited. Due to bad luck with the weather and faulty material only three different hydrographs could be made during our time abroad (10 weeks). These hydrographs however remained useful for the second part of this research project. The second part consists of modelling the discharge of the Mahiga catchment to different<br/>precipitation amounts using HEC-RAS. HEC-RAS is a computer program meaning Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System. The model has been calibrated using the gathered precipitation data from the tipping buckets and the discharge results from OpenRiverCam. Graphs have been made about discharges and accumulated volumes and rating curves. The accuracy of the model is reasonable but should be improved using more discharge events. What stood out was the high infiltration rate and the fast response time of the Mahiga catchment. In section three, the results from the HEC-RAS model are used to understand the impact gabion dams make on reducing the peak flow in the Mahiga creek.<br/>The third part summarises the effectiveness of the gabion dams in preventing flash floods. Unfortunately there is no ’real’ flash flood event captured by the tipping buckets, so three precipitation events are used based on analog measurements of a tipping bucket nearby the catchment. The gabion dams are tested on a maximum precipitation intensity of 35 mm/h, 30 mm/h and 25 mm/h with a total amount of 40 mm. Higher amounts of total precipitation<br/>are realistic, but have a larger time duration and are not considered flash floods anymore. The volume that gabion dams can retain is too little for these large amounts of precipitation and are therefore not in the scope of this report. The results show that with at least five gabion dams, the peak flow reduces for all above mentioned precipitation intensities, but for the 35 mm/h it is getting less effective. The model also showed that the effectiveness is very dependent on the volume that can be retained by the dams. Maintenance of the gabion dams is therefore of crucial importance especially with the large amount of sediments and<br/>debris in the creek.","Flash Floods; HEC-RAS; openrivercam; Gabion dams; Cebu; Philippines; flood monitoring; flood preventing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Current research is focusing on areas related to artificial intelligence to solve complex planning and decision-making tasks, object detection, or simultaneous localization and mapping. <br/> <br/>However, training and testing these methods in the real world is rather unsafe and can be harmful to other road users. For that reason, the focus is set on developing such methods first in a simulated and controlled environment and then transferring the control strategy to the target domain. The issue with this approach is that the performance drops when the domain changes, a problem known as sim2real. In addition to this, certain methods cannot be deployed to real-time applications as the computational complexity of the techniques is too large to produce outcomes in a constrained time frame. <br/> <br/>To date, research on reducing the sim2real for autonomous driving gap has focused on domain adaptation or domain randomization techniques, however, none has combined them with a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model. This work aims to validate a safe transfer learning approach that reduces the reality gap in a zero-shot manner by combining the advantages of using simulated and real-world data, a digital twin of the vehicle, and a traffic scenario simulator. <br/> <br/>To test this framework reinforcement learning agents are trained to track different paths. Further evaluation includes the influence of using a high-fidelity model and real-world data. Furthermore, the effect of the reward function on the control strategy of the learning agents is also examined. The training process of this transfer learning framework starts with virtually generated scenarios, which are simpler than their real-life counterparts and noise-free. The motion of the learning agent is simulated with the digital twin and in every episode, its parameters are randomized. Moreover, noise is added to the control action. These randomizations are useful for the controller to operate under uncertainty and avoid overfitting to model inaccuracies. Once the performance saturates, real-world logged data is included so that the learning agent adapts to the target distribution, i.e. on noise levels and driving style. After the performance stops improving, the results are tested in Model-in-the-Loop and Vehicle-in-the-Loop with the SimRod, an all-electric drive-by-wire vehicle. <br/> <br/>The results of this study indicate that using this zero-shot transfer learning framework yields much better tracking accuracy (about 30% on average) in the physical world with respect to controllers trained only with lower-fidelity models or synthetically generated data. This study stresses that a combination of the three sim2real methods and synthetically generated and real-world data are necessary to reduce the reality gap. Additional results include the influence of the reward function design and using different reinforcement learning algorithms (proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic).","Learning and adaptation in autonomous vehicles; Trajectory Tracking and Path Following; Sim2Real; Reinforcement Learning Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-11-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","FOCETA",""

(Laura) (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to river training in the past centuries, the bed level of the Waal started and is still decreasing by several centimetres a year. Erosion of the riverbed causes problems for objects underneath the riverbed like cables, pipelines and foundations of structures. Furthermore, some parts of the river are eroding at a higher velocity compared to other parts due to a difference in the composition of the bed material. This can result in a jump in the bed level while the water level cannot follow this jump. This results in less available draught for inland vessels. If no mitigation measures are applied and the bed level keeps decreasing, more problems are likely to occur resulting in less transport over the Waal. A possible solution to reduce bed erosion inside the Waal locally is the use of groyne field nourishments.<br/>The objective of this research is to obtain more knowledge about the flow in a real-life groyne field and the effect of vessels on this flow. The research question formulated for this research is, therefore: \textit{what is the influence of vessels on the flow properties inside a groyne field and in what way do the characteristics of the vessels influence this?} To answer this research question a literature study is done first. Secondly, a measurement campaign is performed and finally, the results are analysed to investigate the effect of the characteristics of the vessels.<br/>The literature study is done to obtain more knowledge about the flow properties inside a groyne field. The distinction is made between emerged and submerged groynes and the scenario with and without vessels. The situation where the groynes are emerged is dominant for the erosion inside the groyne field. In this scenario, the flow inside the groyne field consists out of one or two circulation patterns. The first circulation pattern is a large eddy in the downstream part of the groyne field, referred to as the primary eddy. When the groyne field is long enough, a second eddy is present in the upstream part of the groyne field, the secondary eddy. This eddy has a flow direction opposite to the primary eddy and a smaller flow velocity. When a vessel passes a groyne field, the flow pattern inside the groyne field changes due to the primary waves created by the vessel. Firstly, the water level inside the groyne field is raised due to the bow wave. Secondly, due to depression in the water level caused by the primary wave the water level inside the groyne field is lowered. Finally, the water level inside the groyne field is increased again due to the stern wave.<br/>To investigate the effect of vessels on a groyne field, a measurement campaign is performed. The flow direction, flow velocity and water level inside the groyne field are measured with the use of several measurement instruments for two weeks. The obtained data by the measurements is analysed and visualised. The results show that the primary eddy remains partly intact when a vessel sails past the groyne field. Since the primary eddy remains partly intact, the water is guided towards the upstream part of the groyne field. In the upstream part of the groyne field, the secondary eddy does disappear and the flow is directed out of the groyne field. This results in the water, and sediment, flowing out of the groyne field mainly in the upstream part of the groyne field. This has resulted in a scour hole present in the upstream part of the groyne field.<br/>In this research the effect of multiple vessel characteristics on the water level and flow velocity inside the groyne field is investigated. The vessel characteristics investigated are the draught, the sailing speed, the vessel length, the vessel width and the distance of the vessel towards the measurement instrument. The effect of vessels on the water level and flow velocity inside the groyne field differs for each vessel. Information about the vessels has been obtained by using AIS (Automatic Identification System) data. During the processing of the AIS-data, irregularities and errors were found and mostly removed from the AIS-data. According to the final results, the draught of a vessel does not influence the water level and flow velocity inside the groyne field. An increase in the sailing speed of a vessel and a decrease in the distance of a vessel towards the groyne field does have an enlarging effect on the water level difference and the flow velocity inside a groyne field. The combined effect of increasing the length and the width of a vessel also has an enlarging effect on the water level difference and the flow velocity inside the groyne field. It should be noted that the results show a large variance and it is impossible to predict the effect of a single vessel based on the vessel characteristics.<br/>The measurement campaign showed that a constant water level fluctuation is present inside the groyne field even when no vessel is affecting the flow inside the groyne field. Multiple explanations for this fluctuation are given with transverse oscillations between both riverbanks being the most likely.<br/>The measured flow pattern inside the groyne field without vessel is according to the literature. When the flow is affected by a vessel, the flow pattern differs from the flow pattern described in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of a vessel is likely not only depending on the characteristics of a vessel but also on the flow mechanism inside the river system such as the helical flow, the angle of the groyne field with respect to the main channel and the constant water level fluctuation inside the groyne field.<br/>This research adds to the already existing knowledge about the flow in groyne fields. To investigate the effectiveness of groyne field nourishments, a pilot is planned where the actual nourishment will take place at the same location as the measurement campaign. Therefore, this research can be used to better prepare the planned nourishment pilot to investigate the effectiveness of groyne field nourishments. Furthermore, this research contains data about the flow pattern inside the groyne field without nourishment which can be compared to the situation during and after the nourishment pilot. In the end, this research can be a part of the answer to whether groyne field nourishments can reduce or stop the erosion inside the Waal river. ","groyne field; vessel; flow patterns; AIS data; ADV; RBR; Flow velocity; Flow direction; water level","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Currently, one of the preferred treatments is breast conserving surgery (BCS), but its success depends on the correct identification of tumor margins during surgery. A promising optical intraoperative margin assessment technique is diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). However, the DRS instrumentation is complex, since it uses dedicated broadrange lights and sensors. In addition, the system is expensive and voluminous. Thus, a simpler alternative is desired. A possible approach is to probe the tissue’s optical response at only a few relevant wavelengths.<br/><br/>This thesis, developed within an ongoing collaboration between TU Delft and Philips, represents a first proof-of-concept study towards the development of a multi-wavelength hand-held probe for real-time tumor detection during BCS.<br/><br/>A multi-wavelength sensor was developed for testing based on an existing prototype, able to measure with an infrared photodetector the optical response from two independent light emitting diodes.<br/><br/>The working principle of the detection system was based on the known differences in fat/water-ratio between healthy and tumor tissue. It was investigated whether the optical response of tissue-mimicking phantoms with different fat and water content, measured with infrared LEDs in a transmittance-based configuration, could provide a means to quantify the composition of the phantoms. A measurement method was proposed based on the linear relationship observed between the percentage of fat in the phantoms and the ratio of transmitted light intensity measured at 970 nm or 1300 nm, and 1200 nm. The test was repeated with new phantoms, and it was found that the parameters of the fat-intensity relationship varied between the experiments. The scattering parameter was identified as the main cause of this variation.<br/><br/>To demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the system in a hand-held device, the sensor was tested with optical fibers in a reflectance-based configuration. Infrared lasers were found to be suitable light sources to detect differences in reflected light intensity depending on the probing wavelength and phantom composition. However, the wavelengths of the available lasers were not significant for tissue discrimination, so the working principle of the measurement system was not tested in this configuration. <br/><br/>Overall, the results demonstrated that it is possible to use multi-wavelength optical measurements to detect differences between healthy and tumor tissue based on the fat and water concentrations. Further investigation is required to determine a robust method which allows to exactly quantify the tissue content based on the measured reflected intensity. Furthermore, following miniaturization and optimization, the sensor is suitable for integration in a hand-held surgical instrument. Despite the limitations, this study reveals the potential of multi-wavelength optical devices for tumor detection in breast, and encourages further research for their integration in the surgical practice.","intraoperative margin assessment; multi-wavelength spectroscopy; breast tumor discrimination; Surgical Instrument","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Most digesters in the EU have internal heating for process stability. Unheated reactors could potentially lower costs, but have decreased kinetics due to low operational temperatures, especially in winter. This raises the question how seasonal temperature fluctuations effect biogas production. If this effect could be incorporated in current models such as the Anaerobic Digestion Model no.1 (ADM1), scenarios could be compared to investigate when heating is worthwile. In this thesis, an extension is created to the ADM1 in Python to predict the operational temperature and its effects on the anaerobic digestion process. To lower the stiffness of the ADM1, different pH calculation methods were compared. These methods and the used Python version of the model were validated by digestion of the Benchmark Simulation Model 2 (BSM2) ADM1 influent. It was found that the combination of the Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) with the Radau numerical solving method produced the smallest errors with the lowest computational burden. A heat-transfer model was included, which calculates bulk liquid temperature as a function of weather data, digester design and some operational factors. A One-At-a-Time (OAT) sensitivity analysis showed the dependence of yearly temperature fluctuations on several design and operational parameters. The calculated operational temperature is coupled to the ADM1 through several temperature inhibition functions for biochemical processes. Furthermore, the dependency of the liquid-gas transfer coefficient was investigated. It was found that this last step in biogas production could potentially become rate-limiting at temperatures lower than 30 °C, but this result was not validated. The coupled heat transfer - ADM1 model is used to study the case of an unheated fixed-dome reactor for the co-digestion of spent wort and Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) of the La Trappe brewery in the Netherlands. The influent substrate concentrations were determined by a biochemical fractionation procedure, and the model was able to simulate methane production curves found in Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) experiments. Simulations of digestion for the La Trappe case showed seasonality in biogas production, increasing in summer and decreasing in winter. The extent of the effect was found to be dependent on substrate composition, with lipid-rich substrates being affected more than carbohydrate- or protein-rich substrates. Furthermore, the simulation showed seasonality in rate limiting step, with hydrolysis in summer and methanogenesis in winter. This caused the pH to lower with winter, and it was found that higher base dosage is needed in colder winters to prevent acidification. Higher influent temperatures improved process stability, lowered amounts of base needed and increased biogas production. Furthermore, the relation between temperature and volume showed that washout of methanogens and consequent VFA accumulation is dependent on the absolute temperature inhibition function for acetoclastic methanogens. Simulation of the digestion of BSM2 influent showed that the maximum Organic Loading Rate (OLR) increased with temperature till 30 °C, but decreased above this point as free ammonia inhibition starts to limit methanogenic metabolism. For La Trappe, OLR determines the needed base dosage, allowing smaller volumes if more base is added. Lastly, internal heating with the produced biogas was investigated, and optimal heating for biogas production was found. The found results from the model were used to asses the costs and benefits of several design and operational options for the digester at La Trappe. This digester will be used in future research for validation of the model.","Temperature dependence; Heat transfer; anaerobic digestion (AD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/amoradvandi/adm1-ht Source for code","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Unlike new technology developed in commercial firms, technology-based startups go through a process of transformation from a non-commercial to a commercial environment. In this process, they may lack knowledge, network, or resources and face different critical junctures. In recent years, emerging startups have been confronted with difficult changes in their business environments. The life spans of the business models are drastically shortened by technological advancements and shifting patterns of client demand. Companies must continuously examine their established routines and procedures if they want to survive and grow in such unsettling environments. Therefore, in order to succeed, the technology-based startup may require market testing and business model adaptation.<br/>By combining insights from the literature, this paper presents a comprehensive framework that conceptualizes business model dynamics. The framework includes different origins of business model change and different types of business model change as well as the growth stages and junctures. Following the conceptual framework's construction, the effectiveness of the framework is evaluated using explorative case studies of six Dutch technology-based startups. <br/>The results indicate that all startups changed their business model often in the credibility juncture. In the early stages of development, the changes are often forced and caused by external factors, and when the startup matures, it has more freedom to make strategic decisions, particularly in credibility and sustainability junctures. Startups with lower market, managerial and entrepreneurial knowledge changed their business model frequently in a response to challenges, like resource constraints, while startups that were able to acquire knowledge were able to grow faster, access resources, and seize opportunities effectively. Finally, first movers to a specific market confronted technological challenges and changed their business model more often than other startups.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The system is able to classify digits 0–9 written in the air by detecting the dynamic hand shadow using a 3×3 array of simple photodiodes. A novel TinyML system is developed by transforming LightDigit from a Raspberry Pi 4 single- board computer to an STM32H743 microcontroller. This transition is burdened with a significant reduction in computation power while having the goal of creating a more robust and adaptable system. To achieve this, a new photodiode array is designed to overcome the saturation issues of the photodiode array developed for LightDigit. A preliminary analysis is performed to investigate the performance of three deep learning models on the microcontroller: a tiny convolution neural network (CNN), a tiny long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a tiny Conv-LSTM hybrid. For the final system evaluation, the tiny CNN and ConvLSTM models are chosen which provided the best performance in the preliminary evaluation. In order to test the system’s robustness, three different indoor setups and one outdoor setup are created. These setups are created to be reproducible and serve for the verification of the system in different ambient lighting conditions and light intensities. Shadow patterns are recorded for each of the setups and are compared to explain the digit recognition results. The tiny CNN model results in an average accuracy of 84.6% with a maximum of 97.0% and a minimum of 77.8% accuracy across the four different test setups. The tiny ConvLSTM model achieves an average accuracy of 82.4%, with a maximum of 89.3% and a minimum of 72.4%. The tiny ConvLSTM model outperforms the CNN model in the outdoor setup but is generally outclassed by the CNN in all indoor setups. The CNN model is the lightest model with 792 ms inference time and a total size of 138k parameters, which translates to 147 kB. The tiny ConvLSTM model is larger with 446k parameters at 494 kB and 947 ms inference time. For the real-time inference time on the STM32H743 microcontroller, both the tiny CNN and ConvLSTM models remain below 1 second, which is fast enough for real-time applications.","TinyML; Embedded Deep Learning; Touch-Free Interaction; Gesture Recognition; Air Writing; Visible Light; ARM Cortex-M7; TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers; CMSIS-NN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The experiments were conducted in a flow cell electrolyzer using carbon fibre and Ni-foam as the anode, with another Ni-foam electrode employed as the cathode for all experiments. Synthetically prepared effluent and real municipal effluent obtained from the Harnaschpolder water treatment plant effluent was used with potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the supporting electrolyte. The composition of the synthetic effluent was prepared with 23.0 ± 2.1 mg O2/L humic acid (Sigma Aldrich) as the primary organic pollutant. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of electrolyte concentration ranging from 0.01M -1M KOH and the effect of applied current density ranging from 25 A/m2, 50 A/m2, 100 A/m2 and 150 A/m2. Further experiments were conducted to assess the effect of humic acid concentration ranging from 23.0 ± 2.1 mg O2/L to 90.0 ± 0.7 mg O2/L. This was subsequently investigated under potentiostatic conditions at an applied cell voltage of 1.5V using the carbon fibre anode and under galvanostatic conditions for the Ni-foam anode. Regarding the Ni-foam anode, the current density was calculated based on the concentration using the relationship for limiting current density of humic acid oxidation. The investigation focused on assessing the performance of the electrolyzer in terms of volumetric hydrogen production rate and energy efficiency of hydrogen production. The performance data was also compared with conventional alkaline water electrolysis using Ni-foam as the anode and cathode in 1M KOH solution. In addition, the extent of humic acid oxidation was also assessed in terms of COD removal efficiency, TOC removal efficiency and changes in the spectral scans obtained via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. <br/>The performance data revealed that the energy efficiency of hydrogen production was lower for both synthetic and municipal effluent compared to alkaline water electrolysis; this was evident for both carbon fibre and Ni-foam anode. Further, the energy efficiency was also higher when the Ni-foam anode was used compared to the carbon fibre anode. For the electrolysis of municipal effluent, a maximum energy efficiency of 75 ± 2.7% was obtained for the carbon fibre electrode, whereas for the Ni-foam anode, the maximum energy efficiency obtained was 83 ± 3.0% at an applied current density of 12.55 A/m2 with 1M KOH as the electrolyte. Despite this observation, the volumetric hydrogen production rates were not significantly affected because the rates converged closely to their theoretical values; this was also evidenced by the coulombic efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which exceeded 90% in all the experiments.<br/>Concerning the extent of humic acid degradation, the Ni-foam anode was able to oxidize some of the humic acid molecules during electrolysis, and a maximum COD removal of 24.6 ± 8 % was observed after electrolysis of synthetic effluent at an applied current density of 100 A/m2 with 1M KOH as the supporting electrolyte. In contrast, the carbon fibre anode was not able to do so. Instead, the humic acid molecules tended to adsorb on the surface of the carbon fibre anode, evidenced by the increase in COD and TOC after electrolysis. Similar behaviour was also observed for the carbon fibre anode when the effect of humic acid was investigated under potentiostatic conditions, whereas under galvanostatic conditions for the Ni-foam anode, oxidation of humic acid was evident. The extent of oxidation was dependent on the duration of electrolysis, i.e., humic acid concentrations of 49.8 ± 0.98 mg O2/L and 90.0 ± 0.7 mg O2/L required a duration of 6 hrs and 8 hrs to achieve a COD removal efficiency of 43.5 ± 5.0 % and 60.4 ± 4.2 %, respectively. Additionally, the possibility to integrate an electrolyzer with an aerobic treatment plant to supply high purity oxygen was investigated. The comparison was done using BioWin simulations with a standard aerobic bioreactor for a flow of 10,000 m3/day under two conditions: 1) with atmospheric O2(baseline) 2) with high purity O2(95% purity). The investigation revealed that combining a 1 MW electrolyzer with the aerobic wastewater treatment plant would provide sufficient amount of oxygen for the proper functioning of the high purity O2 plant. In addition, the flow requirement to produce the required amount of oxygen was only 0.03% of the discharged effluent (i.e., only 3.1 m3/day of the discharged 9708 m3/day).<br/>Further, the use of high purity oxygen in the aerobic wastewater treatment plant was accompanied by energy savings of 1.2 kWh (4320 kJ) due to reduced load on the air pumps<br","Carbon Fibre Anode; Nickel- Foam Anode; Alkaline Electrolysis; Humic Acid Oxidation; Municipal Effluent; Hydrogen Production; Hydrogen; Water Reuse; Anodic Oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Consequently, using a battery as a power source for this miniaturized IMD is inhibited as it occupies huge space. A good alternative for the battery as the power source is the Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) method. Among the WPT techniques, ultrasound (US) has seen increasing popularity in the past decade owing to its unique advantages such as better resolution, lower propagation attenuation, better health benefits etc. Ultrasound WPT methods involve an ultrasound transducer that converts ultrasonic energy into electrical energy to power the IMD. One such transducer is the Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT). As the name suggests it is a capacitive ultrasound transducer that is micromachined on silicon substrates. Accordingly, this technology offers advantages such as the ability to integrate with CMOS technology, larger bandwidth and the ability to fabricate large arrays of these transducers. Previous research in CMUTs has proven that the CMUTs can be used to efficiently harvest US energy at depths of more than 100 mm. Consequently, this paves the foundation for miniaturized US-based implants that can be placed deep inside the human body, using CMUT technology. Building on this foundation, this thesis work explores the next steps in realizing a CMUT based implant. Two research questions are the main focus of this work: 1. How can we locate such small sized deep implants in order to transfer power efficiently? 2. How can we communicate with this device using ultrasound waves? Addressing the first issue, a Time Reversal beamforming based tracking algorithm is developed that is able to track CMUTs occupying a surface area of about 6.3 mm2 moving at speeds up to 1.25 mm/s in water. Addressing the second issue, a communication protocol is formulated to establish ultrasound communication. This protocol makes use of the focused US beam achieved during tracking to communicate while offering simultaneous power transfer. A data rate of 2 kb/s is achieved using this protocol when the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) are separated by a distance of 130 mm with a phantom filling up the gap. US based IMDs can be built to occupy only a few mm2 of area, especially when using micromachined transducers such as CMUTs. This work, the tracking algorithm and the communication protocol further provide proof of concept for reliable localization of CMUTs and low power data communication, hence providing good prospects for CMUT applications in the field of Implantable Medical Devices.","Ultrasound; CMUT; time reversal; data communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Zuurmond, A (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The “Wet open overheid” or Woo is a law that facilitates access to government information for Dutch citizens and states that “everyone has the right to access government information without having to show an interest in it, subject to the limitations provided for by this law.” This law is the Dutch embodiment of a Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. Facilitating citizens with access to government information is an essential promotor of an open and democratic society. Furthermore, it allows citizens to hold their governments accountable for their actions and make informed political decisions. The proper execution of this right to government information is essential, however, it was found that processing the information requests directed to Ministries of the Dutch Government takes an average of 161 days, where the law states a maximum handling term of 42 days. This delay impedes the citizens’ access to government information and should be addressed. While previous research has been performed towards improving “Woo-request processing,” there is little known about the process itself, nor what the direct causes of delay are. Information management is suggested as a possible culprit. Yet, there is little known about its effects, which are likely to be noticeable in the information search process (ISP) that is part of Woo-request processing. Therefore, the objective of this research is to identify how the existing Woo-request ISP is executed at Ministries of the Dutch National Government and what influences it in order to define improvements for said process in relation to its facilitation of an open and transparent government. <br/><br/>This research concludes that the Woo-request ISP is a complex process that is influenced by many factors. Whereas the ISP described by academic literature portrays multiple iterative steps, the Woo-request ISP hardly portrays any iterative steps in relation to an improved definition and understanding of the information problem. As a result, the requestor cannot learn from the search itself and the information found throughout it. Combined with a possible lack of prerequisite knowledge of the requestor, this means that requests are likely to remain broadly defined and vague due to a fear of missing out on information caused by the requestor’s distrust. Therefore, this research suggests that through increased informative interaction between the requestor and the handler, supported by search and content experts, specification of the requests should be facilitated, which is expected to improve the search process. This also builds a relationship of trust between the parties involved, which is expected to increase the chance of a requestor’s cooperation. Furthermore, the Woo-request ISP as it is does not guarantee completeness nor traceability of the search performed. Therefore it is suggested that the information locating phase makes use of a metadata-based centralized search tool that is operated by experienced and trained personnel who are able to access all information applicable to the Woo.<br/><br/>Whilst the suggested improvements are likely to have a positive influence on the existing process; there are large hurdles to be overcome. It must be noted that some problems or dependencies might in fact never be overcome. For example, the realization of a centrally accessible archive might never see the day of light, as it conflicts with government tasks and values other than openness and transparency. Additionally, it must be noted that the existing “document definition” used by the Dutch government is incredibly broad. This broad definition encases that if the government is to adhere to its laws, almost all currently produced information must be searchable by Woo-request handlers. Especially in a government where a policy rarely stands on its own, it can be challenging to define the end of relevance to a request. Lastly, it must be noted that some requestors might never be pleased with the outcomes of their Woo-request.","Freedom of Information; FOI; Information Search Process; Open Government; Transparency; Process modelling; ISP analysis framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The optical Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is commonly used to monitor crop greenness as an indicator for biomass, but it is limited by clouds and signal saturation. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which is not hampered by clouds, can be used to complement the NDVI. The Biomass Proxy (BP) combines the NDVI and SAR data, but spatial biomass estimations still strongly depend on the NDVI and therefore face the same limitations. <br/>This study aims to assess the potential value of spatial SAR data to approximate the in-field biomass distribution. The SAR signal from Sentinel-1 and the NDVI signal from Sentinel-2 were analysed temporally and spatially for fields of maize, barley, oat, and spring wheat in the Dutch province of Flevoland. It was assumed that consistent SAR patterns in the spatial signal correspond to biophysical changes in the monitored crops. A framework to detect these patterns and include them in the BP was created based on combining cluster detection with spatial autocorrelation. The components of this framework demonstrate that backscatter intensity, phenological stage and crop type influence the probability of consistent patterns and that consistent patterns could not be observed from the spatial NDVI signal. Moreover, it was found that the BP’s sensitivity to the input signals depends on crop type. With the knowledge of when and where consistent patterns occur, targeted research can be done to understand the spatial SAR signal better and, thereby, optimally use all available information.","Remote Sensing; Microwave; Agricultural monitoring; NDVI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

It is found that with the exception of Suryasentana &amp; Lehane (2014), alle models are more accurate at large- than at small displacements. Furthermore, the models are generally conservative at a groundline displacement of D/100 and unconservative at a groundline displacement of D/10. The latter is likely related to inability of the models to adequately capture the ultimate soil resistance. The strongest found correlation with prediction accuracy is a negative one with pile rigidity at small displacements. The models from Dyson &amp; Randolph (2001) and Li, et al. (2014) generate predictions with the highest mean accuracy, though all models perform relatively poorly when compared to a benchmark from Burd, et al. (2019).<br/>The aforementioned CPT-based p-y models are tested further through a number of new instrumented pile load tests in the TU Delft geotechnical centrifuge and the experimental methods for these tests are evaluated. Image analysis of CT scanned sand samples shows that though there is substantial non-uniformity present in samples prepared through hand raining, this method yields acceptable results and is preferable to preparation using a sand raining machine. Secondly, though soil disturbance does occur as a result of pile installation at 1g, this is not likely to greatly impact the results. A comparison of the load-deflection predictions generated with the p-y models (including API) for these load tests supports the notion that the initial response from the API (2014) model is far too stiff and that it is therefore unconservative in the prediction of the limit states. Furthermore, a modified 5th order polynomial fitting method is found to adequately fit discrete bending moment data and in turn p-y curves are produced. These show that the pu from the models Suryasentana &amp; Lehane (2014;2016) is only reached at shallow depths and does not match the measured ultimate resistance. Finally, at all except the shallowest depths the CPT-based p-y models strongly overestimate p though the resulting prediction of the load-deflection response is more reasonable.<br/>As mentioned previously, the CPT-based p-y models do not perform optimally for the studied experimental cases, especially at small groundline displacements. This can likely be attributed to the fact that they were generally developed from test data on long and flexible piles. Additionally, rigid piles under lateral load develop moments and shear forces at the base that are not taken into account by methods that rely solely on lateral soil resistances (Peralta 2010). To solve these problems the PISA model with additional soil reaction terms was developed and it has been proven to provide better displacement predictions than traditional methods relying on lateral soil resistance (Byrne, et al., 2015a). However, this model is more complex and may not be the most convenient method to use. A less complex alternative has been proposed which uses a simplified rotational pile-soil interaction model to capture the load-displacement behaviour of perfectly rigid piles of varying diameter, stress level and loading eccentricity. Numerical simulations by Wang, et al. (2022) have shown this to work and in this thesis these results are validated using experimental data. The unification of the pile responses is found to work, but is not as successful for the experimental data. This may be due to several factors, the most likely of which are variations is sand density and imperfect rigidity of the model pile. However, the results support use of methods based on the aforementioned simplified rotational pile-soil interaction model, such as the rotational spring model proposed by Wang, et al. (2022).<br","lateral pile displacement; Sand; p-y curves; Centrifuge modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

As the field increasingly moves from “scale-up” to “scale-down” philosophy, in which such heterogeneities are included from the start of process design, accurate modelling of the biomass response to these varying conditions is essential. Euler-Lagrange (EL) simulations provide a means of modelling the microbial lifelines of cells traversing heterogenous conditions of a bioreactor. Lapin et al. were the pioneers of EL simulation in their 2004 paper where a metabolic model of glycolysis is coupled to a Lagrangian biomass phase. This BSc thesis focusses on reproducing their model using modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. Specifically, by using a dynamic Lattice Boltzmann Method using Large Eddy Simulation model for CFD as opposed to a frozen-flow Finite Volume Reynolds Averaged Navier- Stokes model. The resulting differences in the overall behaviour of the cell metabolism through the lens of glycolytic oscillations are discussed. In addition, possible pitfalls in model validity such as grid dependence, the effects of heterogeneous particle distributions and the effects of particle numbers were explored. The synchronisation and desynchronisation of glycolytic oscillations as observed in Lapin et al. 2004 were able to be reproduced.","CFD; lattice boltzmann method; Euler-Lagrange methode; Glycolytic oscillations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

Where currently, this interaction is mainly visual and auditory, Tactile Internet (TI) also allows for remote kinesthetic interactions. With the devel- opment of TI, a paradigm shift is on the horizon where the current internet evolves from content delivery to a skill-set delivery network. Imagine the possibilities when specialists in whatever field can, in real- time, apply their skills everywhere in the world from within their living room. To make this a reality, TI applications have to be able to provide feedback to the user with ULL. The speed of light, however, constrains the extent to which TI can be used at large distances. This thesis hence takes a closer look at the problems that arise when long-distance TI is to be used and tries to tackle them. These problems are tackled by building a system based on Model-Mediated Teleoperation (MMT), where lo- cal simulations of the environments are used. A local feedback loop is instantiated through these local simulations, which lowers the system’s dependence on the network performance. The former control loop, including the network, now becomes a corrective loop to prevent mismatches. This thesis focuses on the part where the local simulation is corrected by the real-life data received over the network. The question is how real-time dynamic environments can be captured and kept track of for use in MMT. We identify accurate tracking of objects in the environment as the critical building block enabling MMT with dynamic objects. Consequently, the first 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) tracking application designed for use in TI applications is created and evaluated. Through this research, the first steps are set towards a full-blown MMT system that can capture the remote environment successfully.","Tactile Internet; Model-Mediated Teleoperation; Object Tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

The Internet today presents people with abundant choices to choose from. Recommending choices with an emphasis on people's preferences has become increasingly sought. Grundy (1979), the first computer librarian Recommender System (RS), provided users with book recommendations. Growing volumes of user data in the '90s saw increased usage of commercially available RS for e-commerce, music, movies, books, and social networking services. Due to their effectiveness in providing recommendations, Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are predominantly used to build these RS. However, traditional CF algorithms adopting Matrix Factorization (MF) and Nearest Neighbor (NN) methods suffer from handling sparse data or model scalability. With exponentially increasing sparse data, building scalable and accurate RS models is of focus.<br/><br/>This thesis uses tensors and graphs to represent available data. Emphasis is given to capturing higher-order interactions present between the data. The use of tensors is motivated as matrices cannot capture data with higher-order relations, such as variation of user ratings to items with time. The transition to using tensors has been promising with the development of efficient tensor decomposition methods and powerful machines. Graphs can capture the correlation between different entities, providing additional information intrinsic to the underlying graph structure. A Graph Regularized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (GRCP) tensor decomposition model framework is proposed in this thesis. The thesis highlights how to graph Laplacian regularizers (GLRs) benefit CP tensor decomposition methods to build RS. The model framework is evaluated with the MovieLens data set. The model records lesser Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) values than those reported in the literature.

Simulating the unsteady non-linear aerodynamic interaction between a maneuvering aircraft and the surrounding flowfield poses serious challenges. High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, based on the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, can in general provide accurate solutions but at a computational cost that is often unfeasible for many applications that require real-time evaluation of the aerodynamic responses over a large range of conditions.<br/>Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are methods that can alleviate the computational burden of performing High-Fidelity simulations while providing accurate solutions over a wide extent of parametric variations.<br/>In the context of unsteady aerodynamics simulations, most traditional Reduced Order Models are limited to the prediction of integral loads and do not scale well for the treatment of high-dimensional systems.<br/>Recently, within the Science and Technology Organization work-group of NATO, a data-driven ROM based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Neural Networks (POD-LSTM) has been proposed for the prediction of the unsteady pressure fields on the UCAV MULDICON aircraft configuration, showing good potential in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability compared to the previously developed ROM based on end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks.<br/>The POD-LSTM model is limited by the linear modal decomposition method that shows a slow convergence rate, in terms of latent space dimension, to the full-order solution. The high-projection error, localized in specific regions of the parameter space, translates into a consistent inaccuracy in the prediction of integral loads.<br/>In order to overcome these limitations, two main methodologies are proposed to replace the Global POD basis with modal bases localized in i) the computational space or ii) in the parameter space, yielding the development of Local ROMs.<br/>The first methodology is based on a Domain Decomposition strategy and aims to reduce the projection error in specific regions of the wing surface.<br/>The second methodology, the Cluster-POD, focuses on partitioning the parameter space in relevant flow regimes and constructs Local Reduced Order models on each cluster.<br/>The choice of surrogate models, for latent dynamics modeling, is also discussed and Machine Learning methods based on the Long Short Term Memory Neural Network, Multi-layer-Perceptron, and Gaussian Process Regression are tested and compared.<br/>Results show that Local ROMs can improve the efficiency of the global latent representation, by generating sets of modes with more localized information content. The proposed Cluster-POD-based ROM, in particular, can be developed using a systematic procedure that automatically detects the parameter space partitions based on an a-posteriori error indicator. It is also briefly shown, as a proposal for future research, how Gaussian Mixture Models can be used to generate overlapping clusters, that solve some of the limitations of traditional Cluster-based ROMs based on the K-means clustering.<br/>Furthermore, improvements in the prediction of integral loads are demonstrated by including the loads coefficients directly in the Machine Learning surrogate models targets, in order to remove the projection error emerging from the use of a reduced order basis.","Reduced Order Model; Machine learning; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Flight Dynamics; Aircraft design; Clustering algorithms; Domain Decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Automation in this domain increases on-time deliveries and strengthens the E-commerce firms’ competitive position. However, such decisions involve experts’ knowledge, discussions among planners, and complex thought processes. Therefore, it is necessary to involve planners’ inclinations and preferences to automate their decisions. This paper proposes the Behavioural Artificial Intelligence Technology (BAIT) to automate expert decisions in delayed line haul deliveries. BAIT uses fundamental Discrete Choice theory under the hood to capture expert preferences effectively, and incorporates these into a decision-making tool.

Using component- to element-based transport allows for numerically stable equations.

The most popular prevention method for shoulder-related WMSDs are passive shoulder exoskeletons, as of their light weight and ease of use. Yet, due to their static force-angle characteristic, passive shoulder exoskeletons show a limited load reduction effect for dynamic tasks. Active shoulder exoskeletons show better performance in the reduction of loads for dynamic tasks, but are not accepted in industrial environments due to their high weight and complexity. In this study, the advantages of both passive and active shoulder exoskeletons have been combined in the design of a mechanism that can actively alter the force-angle characteristic of the Skelex 360-XFR passive shoulder exoskeleton, increasing its load reduction performance, and hence making it a more effective prevention method to WMSDs. By experiments using a prototype, it has been shown that a drivable parallelogram linkage capable of inducing angular changes between an in-going lever arm link and an out-going link to the user’s arm, can effectively induce proportional phase changes of the conventional force-angle characteristic, and that the model predicting the optimal stiffness of the spring used in the implemented force-balancing mechanism is reliable. With the experimental findings, recommendations have been made regarding the minimum capacity in output torque of the actuator, 0.38 Nm, and the stiffness of the balancing spring, 1752 N/m, to end up with optimal weight, size, and power consumption of the semi-passive shoulder exoskeleton.","Semi-Passive; Exoskeleton; Shoulder; Industry; Injury; Upper limb","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Although hard structures were built in the past to prevent for flooding, nature based solutions are preferred more recently. For the application of nature based solutions, a better understanding of the coastal processes is desired. Dry sand is transported towards the dunes by aeolian processes, whose bedform development is understudied while knowledge on this is important. One of the most visually clear bedforms are organised dry sand over a moist beach, referred to as sand strips. In order to improve the knowledge on sand strips, this study focusses on sand strip properties and occurring environmental conditions during their presence at the Noordwijk beach, using data of a terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) device.<br/><br/>Sand strips are detected with the Fourier transform. Since surface moisture can be derived from the reflectance intensity of the TLS-data, and due to the different moisture content of the sand strips compared to the surrounding beach, the Fourier transform is applied on the reflectance intensity. Sand strips are detected based on the energy in the variance density spectrum for a wavenumber-range corresponding to sand strips. The detected sand strips were oriented alongshore to oblique-alongshore with a mean wavelength and height of 13.2 m and 4.0 cm respectively, which is in correspondence with similar sand strip-related studies.<br/><br/>According to sand samples of the beach the grain size varies in transverse direction of the sand strips, comparable with the grain size variation of aeolian sand ripples. The coarser grains were located at the crest and the finer grains at the lee-side. Additionally, the samples also showed a significant difference in gravimetric moisture content between the sand strips and surrounding beach, as expected due to the reflectance-based detection. At the sand strips, the maximum moisture content was 5.3%, while the minimum determined moisture content at the surrounding beach was 6.0%. The mean values were equal to 2.6% and 9.4% for the sand strips and surrounding beach respectively.<br/><br/>In addition, sand strips mainly occurred during (almost) alongshore wind events with a wind velocity in excess of 8 m/s. However, the threshold wind velocity for sand strip formation is determined at 10 m/s. Due to the significant height difference that can remain present during precipitation events, these events are not necessarily restrictive factors for sand strip development, although the reflectance intensity suggests different. Furthermore, sand strips mostly formed during falling tide and they were mostly destroyed during rising tide.<br/><br/>The one life cycle of the sand strips that is analysed showed dynamic sand strip behaviour. The migration rate of the sand strips varied over the width of the beach, causing more inland oriented sand strips. This dynamic behaviour cannot be related to weather conditions since they remained constant, however it could be related to topographic steering caused by the dune. Nevertheless, the results of the dynamic properties are only indicative and encourage further study of dynamic sand strip properties.","Aeolian transport; Sand strips; terrestrial laser scanning; Fourier Transform; environmental conditions; coastal processes; Point cloud; reflectance intensity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","CoastScan","52.24182, 4.425429"

This paper aims to determine whether optimizing flight trajectories can reduce the environmental impact of aircraft during the climb and descent phases. It addresses the research gap in sustainable flight trajectory optimization by combining state-of-the-art research on optimization techniques with research on aviation’s climate eects. A genetic algorithm is created for the climb and descent phases to minimize the impact of gaseous emissions; the objective function entails the climate and air quality costs of the emission of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and water vapor. OpenAP is used to evaluate the emissions of aircraft. The optimization includes variable mass and speed, wind, departure and arrival procedures, and airspace constraints. The optimization considers both the vertical and horizontal flight paths simultaneously. The model was tested for more than 22,000 flights in June 2018 at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. It has been found that an average reduction in environmental costs of 8.6% and 18.6% is achievable for departing and arriving flights, respectively. The reduction depends on the aircraft type, weather conditions, and whether the aircraft departs or arrives. The open-source optimization model can be used for further research, for instance, evaluating the reduction possibilities at dierent locations. The research shows that the aviation industry can reduce its environmental impact considerably by optimizing departing and arriving trac trajectories.","trajectory optimization; environmental impact; genetic algorithm; aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Subramanian, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent decades, fibre-reinforced polymer composite structures have seen increased aerospace applications. A typical composite structural element widely used in primary load-bearing aircraft components is the T-joint, which is formed when two orthogonal laminates are joined in a T-shaped arrangement to enable out-of-plane load transfer. Under tensile loading, the structure tends to fail by the separation of the horizontal and vertical laminates at the joining interface. The incorporation of an interleaf, i.e. a thin layer of material with good interfacial bonding properties, may prevent or delay the failure event. A potential interleaf material is the carbon nanotube (CNT). In the literature, its addition as a reinforcing phase in interleaves has been shown to improve fracture toughness in standard coupon tests, but the technique has yet to be tested on a structural element level. <br/><br/>This thesis research investigated the effect of CNT interleaves on the mechanical behaviour of composite T-joints. Manufacturing processes were developed to produce test samples consistent in quality. T-joint samples with CNT-modified interleaves were manufactured alongside neat samples with zero CNT content. The joints were formed using custom-built tools and co-cured in an autoclave. Tensile tests were carried out and the T-joints were loaded until failure. Load-displacement data were acquired and further supported by results from a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system. <br/><br/>Data analysis suggested that CNT interleaves modified the mechanical behaviour of T-joints by delaying the failure of the structure. While their stiffness and ultimate strength were largely unaltered, the CNT-modified T-joints were able to undergo higher displacements and absorb higher strain energy before failure compared to the neat samples. The delay of failure was enabled by extensive crack development within CNT interleaves preceding the final rupture. In comparison, the neat samples failed abruptly after very limited damage evolution. Observation of the crack surfaces revealed evidence of tortuous crack paths through CNT interleaves. The finding suggests that CNT interleaves are capable of improving the failure resistance of the T-joint structure in a targeted fashion.","Composite Material; Carbon nanotubes; T-joint; CFRP; Interleaf; Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To this end, a predict+optimize formulation of the 0-1 knapsack problem is used, which is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This formulation was chosen because it has many real-world applications where the constraint parameters are uncertain. In this instance, the challenge is to predict the weights of knapsack items based on feature data and then use these predictions to solve the knapsack problem. The key is that the item weights are uncertain<br/>and thus must be estimated, but the quality of the solution is evaluated with respect to the true weights. This uncertainty in the weights can lead to infeasible solutions when evaluated on the true weights. Standard predict+optimize techniques do not account for such infeasibility of candidate solutions, which makes them mostly inapplicable for solving problems with uncertainty in the constraint parameters. To<br/>overcome this shortcoming of standard predict+optimize techniques, several correction methods for the evaluation of infeasible solutions during training are compared. Crucially these correction methods can be varied between training and evaluation. By penalizing infeasible solutions linear in the weight of the overweight items during training, predict+optimize is able to outperform standard prediction-error-based techniques. This performance increases to an extent with increased penalization factors, leading to more stable, more optimal results on the validation set.","predict+optimize; Combinatorial Optimization; Knapsack problem; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Mass sensing of cells and subcellular components is typically performed with resonant microstructures. Recently such microstructures were fabricated using an emerging 3D printing technique called two-photon polymerization (2PP) contrary to conventional lithography-based fabrication. The suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) is such a resonant microstructure with an embedded fluidic channel for buoyant mass sensing, which has not yet been fabricated using 2PP. This work aims to 3D print an SMR with a sufficient mass resolution to detect the buoyant mass of E. Coli bacteria (175 fg in water). It was realized by first characterizing the damping in 3D printed polymer microbeam resonators for a better understanding of dominating damping sources. Followed by maximizing their quality factor and fabricating a prototype 3D-printed SMR. The characterized devices set a record-breaking standard for damping of polymer microbeam resonators: Cantilevers and bridges approached quality factors of 1000 and tensile stressed narrow bridges achieved a quality factor of 1819. These polymer resonators were dominated by bulk friction damping, but still had a mass resolution advantage over similar silicon-based devices when working in lower quality factor (Q &lt; 1000) conditions, due to the low mass density of the polymer. Subsequently, prototypes of the suspended microchannel resonator were fabricated with multi-scale 3D printing containing a plug-and-play connection to fluidics and measurement equipment. Their theoretical mass resolution was estimated to be ≤ 60 fg, which is sensitive enough to detect E. Coli bacteria and compete with conventional fabricated SMRs. This paves the path towards actual biosensing 3D printed SMRs with the capabilities of lithography-based fabricated devices but with additional design and fabrication flexibility.","Suspended Microchannel Resonator; 3D printing; Two-photon polymerization; Polymer microbeam resonator; Damping; Quality factor; Mass sensing; Mass resolution; E. coli bacteria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

The feasibility research is done by appointment of two entrepreneurs on the island of Bonaire. The report will give an answer to the research question: Can an offshore floating platform, aimed at fast watersports, be built as sustainable as possible within the context of Bonaire? This research question can be divided into multiple sub-questions, being: 1. What is the context of Bonaire? 2. What is, for this report, the definition of sustainability? 3. What facilities are needed on the platform? 4. How can 100% renewable energy be generated for the platform? 5. What would such a (conceptual) platform look like? To answer these questions, the method as described in Kossiakoff (2011) is used. This method gives structure to the design of a system that has not been used before, but tries to combine older systems in new innovative ways. From this method, three important stages in the design process have been identified: The needs analyses, the concept exploration and the concept definition. This report follows that structure, starting with the chapter: Needs analyses. In this chapter, the report answers the first two sub-questions. The context of Bonaire can be described as: an island with opportunities for every-one, but the local environment suffers from the exponential growth of people and tourists that visit the island. For the second sub-question the definition of sustainability has been placed within this context of Bonaire, leading to a specialized definition of sustainability. This definition combined with the requirements of the clients has lead to a valid need for the platform. The concept exploration, gives options to answer those needs. It does so by researching a broad range of possible facilities for the platform. This broad research eventually leads to a morphological map from which 3 realistic and 1 futuristic concepts are designed. In the concept definition these 3 realistic concepts have been tested by an MCA resulting in one concept that has been worked out for various components, thus answering sub question 5. From this worked out concept, a conclusion is written in where the main conclusion is that an offshore platform aimed at fast water sports van be build sustainable within the context of Bonaire if the clients are able to make some consensus in there plans and the way they will use the platform. Finally, considering the sustainability of the proposed platform, it can be concluded with current technologies it is hard to build a platform without emissions, negative effects or any hidden impact. However, if the schedule and plans of the clients where to change towards a more ’nature dependent’ schedule (so taking peak energy generation into account). The platform could set an example and can even be a global ’first’ when it comes to making the practice of watersports more sustainable.","Sustainability; Floating; Watersports","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Association of Dutch Municipalities (Vereniging Nederlandse Gemeenten) deems citizen participation as important because it enables a comprehensive consideration of interests and perspectives. Moreover, it is expected to prevent delays of juridical procedures in the realisation phase of a project. However, the implementation of the new Environment &amp; Planning Act is the responsibility of the government authorities. One governing body struggling with the implementation of citizen participation is the Dutch province of Utrecht, together with its municipalities. The province of Utrecht wants to develop public transport nodes (PTNs). To be able to help municipalities with citizen participation the province has the desire to understand how citizens can best be involved in the development of public transport nodes (PTNs). Scholars studied the participation preferences of citizens, but two shortcomings were identified for the case of PTN development. Firstly, these studies took place in a different context than the context of PTN development. Secondly, these studies examined how citizens themselves want to participate, not how citizens think the government should let citizens participate. Both factors were expected to influence the participation preferences of citizens.<br/>This problem background, the corresponding scope, and knowledge gap lead to the main research question of this study: How do citizens weigh different attributes of citizen participation regarding the policy-making process by the province of Utrecht in the context of public transport node development?<br/><br/>The main method to answer this research question is a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Firstly, literature research was conducted to identify relevant attributes of citizen participation. This resulted in five attributes: the Participation Moment, the Participation Selection Method, the Mode of Participation, the Extent of Influence, and the Costs. The literature research also established the preliminary levels of all except the Costs attribute. Secondly, to establish the final levels semistructured interviews were conducted with nine policymakers and civil servants. To establish the levels of the Costs attribute market research was conducted. Nine companies specialised in citizen participation were contacted. Ultimately, the levels of the Costs attribute were based on the information of one company but were verified by public sources and interview results. Thirdly, the information from the literature research, interviews, and market research was synthesised. Furthermore, for all except the Costs attribute, level descriptions were developed which explained the level and, if applicable, suited it to the case of PTN development. Fifthly, a survey was developed which included an opening statement, an introduction to the attributes and levels, ten choice sets with two participation scenarios and one No Participation scenario, and eight closing questions about demographics. In the choice sets, respondents were asked which participation scenario they would prefer for the province of Utrecht to choose...<br/><br","citizen participation; public participation; discrete choice experiment; Participatory Planning; Public transport nodes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In the analysis, the author briefly describes the origin and development of the notion of aging through medical, social, and cultural lenses. How the negative narrative around aging has hamstrung the innovation for older people is presented by enumerating three types of design pitfalls identified in today’s mainstream gerontechnology. Drawing on a body of literature (e.g. the ‘successful aging model’ and the ‘personhood turn’ in the ‘care model’) and projects, the author shows new voices attempting to overturn this negative narrative. The Capability Approach (CA), especially Nussbaum’s capability theory which provides a concrete and substantive normative foundation for probing into older people’s lives is introduced (chapter 3 prologue). Interviews are conducted to obtain in-depth understanding of people's needs, wants, and challenges (chapter 3). Based on the literature research and empirical studies, a gap between the real needs and wants emerging in the aging process and what is provided by current mainstream gerontechnology is identified (tension 1) (chapter 4).<br/>Informed by several inspiring design frameworks or theories (e.g. design for appropriation, end-user development, ambiguity in design, meta-design), the author proposed design for openness as a potential design strategy to address the first tension (chapter 5 prologue). What is so powerful about ‘openness’ in design is its potential to satiate various needs over time, in the meanwhile, promote autonomy in users. A theoretical model is theorized to provide firm design handles (chapter 5 prologue). Next, co-speculation sessions are conducted to gather situated knowledge and to experiment with the idea of design for openness (chapter 5). Findings from the sessions reveal the potential risk of leaving the design completely open: ineffective appropriation caused by misalignment between use and design (chapter 5). How to lower the seemingly paradoxical misalignment between design and use while still maintain the openness in design becomes the focus of the rest this research (tension 2) (chapter 5).<br/>A concept artifact is crafted as an explorative attempt to address the misalignment between use and design (chapter 6). Next, the evaluation of the concept artifact is conducted which results in rich design implications (chapter 7). Insights from the evaluation sessions also help further develop the theoretical model (chapter 8). An alternative design process that's different from the traditional one is put forward and limitations are discussed and directions for future research are sketched out (chapter 8). The report closes by reflecting on the whole project and summarizing the main contributions of this project (chapter 9).<br","gerontechnology; openness in design; human-technology relationship; Capability Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Vendors that utilize collaborative filtering generally exclusively use their own user-item interactions, but the accuracy of the recommendations may improve if several vendors share their data. Since user-item interaction data is typically privacy sensitive, sharing this data poses a privacy challenge for the collaborating vendors. In this work, we study the use of matrix factorization with multiple vendors under a differential privacy guarantee. Since differential privacy incurs a trade-off between privacy and utility, one obstacle is that the utility loss of the privacy-preserving measure may be greater than the utility gain of collaboration. We show that the empirical evaluation of this property in existing work is questionable, and that these works do not solve the problem. We also demonstrate that in a common experiment setup, the upper bound on the utility gain that can be achieved by collaboration is limited, which places a hard limit on the acceptable utility loss due to privacy preservation. This limit is small enough that even the utility loss in the current state of the art in differentially private matrix factorization in general exceeds it.

The global advent of the COVID-19 virus made the world painstakingly aware of the impact a pandemic can have on all levels of society. To combat the spread and impact of a pathogen, policymakers turn to specialized tools to craft policy. One of these tools is mathematical modeling and simulation. By using the agent-based modeling paradigm, it is possible to evaluate the impact of policy measures on the viral spread and healthcare burden. An agent-based model always contains a set of agents. Agents are the digital representations of a studied entity, for example, a person, but agents can also be an organization or a vehicle. One of the characteristics of agent-based modeling is the reliance on data to create a valid agent population. However, data on the level of individual people, also known as microdata, can be difficult to acquire and work with due to GDPR regulations. Aggregated population data, also known as open data, may serve as a substitute for microdata. Both open and microdata may be used to synthesize a population of agents, this process is known as synthetic population generation. Although both of these forms of data can be used to synthesize an agent population, it is currently understudied how the results of the agent population synthesis process are affected by the type of used population data. This research project focuses on this gap in knowledge and systematically analyzes the differences between an open-data-based and a microdata-based agent population. The populations that are synthesized are part of the HERoS model. The HERoS model is an epidemiological agent-based model that maps the spread of COVID-19 in the city of The Hague. The agents in the HERoS model are digital individuals, each characterized by a set of attributes. These attributes define the behavior of an agent within the model. Examples of agent attributes in the HERoS model are age, household size, and social role. Two agent populations for the HERoS model are synthesized, one using a sample-free algorithm that uses open data, and one using an algorithm that converts microdata to an agent population. The differences between the agent populations are quantified by introducing two new metrics, the modified Freeman-Tukey statistic, and agent matching. It was found that the agent populations show similar characteristics on a city level, but show significant differences at the neighborhood level. Furthermore, it is shown that the quality of an agent population is both dependent on the number of attributes that are synthesized, as well as the type of attributes. Moreover, the relationship between the quality of an agent population and the outcome a model produces is also understudied. This relationship is investigated by using the open-data-based and microdata-based agent populations as input for the HERoS model. The model outcomes are then compared on a global and neighborhood level, using phase comparison and the quantification of the precision of the model. It is found that the effect of using open data instead of microdata is multifaceted. The model outcome curves show similar characteristics, albeit they differ in a numerical sense. Using open-data increases the number of hospitalizations, ICU occupants, and deaths in the HERoS model. Furthermore, the precision of the model decreases when open data is used. Finally, it observed that neighborhoods that significantly differ in input population also significantly differ in model outcomes, showing the importance of the quality of an agent population for smaller resolutions. Conclusively, this research project shows that open data can serve as a viable alternative to microdata when it comes to synthesizing agent populations for epidemiological agent-based models.","Agent-based modeling; agent population; open data; microdata; Population synthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","Health Emergency Response in Interconnected Systems","52.078663, 4.288788"

Since the kite has distinct operational phases, i.e., reel-out and reel-in phase, the airfoil design must take into account the different design objectives for each phase. The airfoil is first optimized for reel-out or production phase and it is then adapted for the reel-in or return phase requirements by modifying its flap setting. The optimization is performed through a multi-objective genetic algorithm coupled to MSES as the aerodynamic solver. Once the multi-element airfoil has been optimized, its aerodynamic performance is verified through CFD RANS simulations, computed with OpenFOAM. The resulting airfoil offers a satisfactory performance for production and return phase; and the CFD verification shows a fairly good agreement in terms of lift coefficient although the drag has been significantly overpredicted by MSES.","Airborne wind energy; Multi-element airfoil; Aerodynamic design; Genetic algorithm; Optimization algorithms; CFD; MSES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Finch Floating Homes aims to repurpose the permanently flooded ricefields in Hagonoy into flood-proof, typhoon-resilient, affordable housing. The floating neighborhood will serve as storm-resilient living and have an educational purpose on circular living and recovering resources. The pilot floating home is equipped according to current sanitation practices, a septic tank. The septic tanks are usually emptied in drainage fields or surface water. With the aim of circularity in mind, an alternative sanitation had to be designed. <br/><br/>The neighborhood aspects and social implications were analyzed after which a set of eight design criteria were drafted. With the design criteria a framework was set up for selecting a flexible sanitation system that fits a range of desired effluent qualities. The framework offered treatment compartments that can be combined depending upon the location and effluent requirements. Three different treatment scenarios were compared based on the effluent qualities and costs. Scenario 2 containing a UASB-septic tank as primary treatment and a polishing step with water hyacinths, was found to be the most cost-effective. A final effluent concentration of 3 g/L COD, 0,05 mg/L NH3 and between 53 and 134 mg/L P was reached. And based on the die-off of E.coli, a pathogen removal of 5 log units was achieved. <br/><br/>Next, the conceptualization was laid out. The platforms on which the houses float, were made up of standard modules that were prefabricated and assembled on-site. Rainbarrels in wooden frames provided floating ability. The UASB-septic tank had similar dimensions as the rainbarrels, meaning no specialized treatment platform had to be built since the reactor could take the place of a rainbarrel. The disinfection tubes are placed on top of the platform and could be added at any time if the effluent quality demands a low pathogen level. <br/>The final polishing pond was constructed from locally sourced materials and can be built in any shape that suits the neighborhood as long as the surface area is 17 m2.<br/><br/>The treatment system also offered possibilities for resource recovery in the form of biogas, irrigation water, fertilizer and reuse of the plant mass (food, extra COD, fabric raw materials). The residents could benefit from the biogas in the form of a communal kitchen suitable for social gatherings. The fertilizer and irrigation water were applied in communal gardens. Communal areas aided in improving relations between neighbors which created a pleasant environment. <br/><br/>The final treatment design was a scalable, affordable and sustainable treatment system with a range of resource recovery possibilities. <br","Sanitation; Floating; Anaerobic Digestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

It is being used by cities all over the world. CityJSON is an encoding for a subset of the OGC CityGML data model. It is a JSON-based data exchange format for digital 3D models of cities and landscapes, and it is easy for various operations. Due to the uniqueness of its structure, it is necessary to design corresponding data models to store CityJSON files in the database, to make querying and updating data within the database easy and convenient.<br/><br/>There are already some open-source solutions for storing CityJSON files in the database, 3DCityDB is one of them. 3DCityDB can store, manage and visualize data well, and it is open source. But the database design is very complex: for a tile of 3D BAG data, 3DcityDB uses a total of 66 tables to store data. The structure of the data model results in difficulties for database users to understand the imported data, and potentially leads to non-optimal operation performance when retrieving data for urban applications.

New projects will be proposed for waters in which floating (sea) ice is a common occurrence in winter. Currently, projects remain limited to regions with mild ice conditions, such as the Southern Baltic Sea, but projects further north are expected. In preparatory work for this thesis, performed at Siemens Gamesa Renewable<br/>Energies, it was shown that (edgewise) blade loads increase significantly for Northern Baltic sites when compared to Southern Baltic sites due to ice induced vibrations.<br/><br/>The phenomena of ice extrusion and rubble loads are expected to provide added damping to an ice-structure interaction system. This added damping may lead to less severe structural vibrations, and thus blade loads for an offshore wind turbine, than for a system with only intact ice crushing. VANILLA is the leading ice crushing model in the industry to evaluate the effects of ice induced vibrations for vertical offshore structures such as wind turbines, but the model<br/>currently does not (explicitly) consider ice extrusion and rubble loads. Therefore, the aim of this work is to investigate the phenomena of rubble and ice extrusion in crushing and propose a modelling approach.<br/><br/>Following a literature study, a rubble model and an extrusion model are proposed as extensions of the VANILLA ice model. The rubble model shows to be consistent and compute plausible rubble loads for model and full scale, while the extrusion model only predicts reasonable extrusion loads at full scale. Forcing and dynamics found from using the Standard and Adjusted VANILLA model with simplified global bending mode shapes of the SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine were compared.<br/><br/>Rubble loads were found to be small in magnitude and of negligible influence on the dynamics. The loads stemming from extrusion introduce additional damping to the system when the relative velocity between the structure and the ice increases, such that (i) the immediate load drop to zero after a failure event observed in Standard VANILLA is omitted, (ii) initiation ice drift velocities for IIV regimes become lower, (iii) dynamic amplitudes reduce, and (iv) a positive force-velocity gradient arises in the CBR regime.","Offshore Wind Energy; Ice-structure interaction; Ice extrusion; Ice rubble","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

Landfilling organic waste not only has a large impact on the environment, but also leads to the loss of the value embedded in organic waste, such as nutrients and energy. In this regard, anaerobic digestion emerges as a potential waste treatment alternative that supports energy generation and nutrient recycling, while avoiding landfilling emissions.<br/>Although AD is a relative mature and widely applied technology for the treatment of a variety of feedstocks (e.g., sewage sludge and animal manure), urban AD systems using biowaste are still in a preliminary stage. Therefore, the present research aims to evaluate the economic performance and the carbon footprint of this technology in CABA in the context of two case studies, where biogas is used to produce bioelectricity (C-1) and bio-CNG (C-2). <br/>The case studies were assessed using a plant design which consisted of a biogas facility treating 23 thousand t/y of substrate, a mixture of OFMSW and recycled liquid fraction. Once biogas is produced as a result of the digestion process, a CHP and a membrane unit are used to produce bioelectricity and bio-CNG, respectively. Moreover, digestate, the material remaining after anaerobic digestion, is pasteurized for its utilization as biofertilizer on land.<br/>The results of the economic analysis suggest that, under defined conditions, a positive NPV, IRR, and payback period can be obtained for both case studies. Nevertheless, there are high chances that the economic performance becomes negative, especially when changes are simulated that directly impact the amount of revenue the project makes. <br/>The results of the carbon footprint indicate that both case studies could lead to substantial carbon savings, given that the avoided GHG emissions are substantially higher than the emitted ones. Large savings are obtained from avoiding the landfilling of organic waste, and replacing conventional energy, fuel, and fertilizers. The results of the carbon footprint are less sensitive to simulations performed, given the margin of avoided emissions over the emitted ones. <br/>The analysis concluded that while both case studies are very likely to present environmental benefits, the economic constraints might impose a drawback for its implementation. Therefore, the support of the government is crucial to promote the adoption of AD, considering all the benefits that are associated with this technology.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

As a result of this, the multirotor has found a large variety of different uses. Testing new algorithms using real-life flights is costly in terms of time and potentially in terms of materials in the case of a crash. Simulators have quickly gained prominence as a tool in algorithm development. The accuracy of these simulators is vital to ensure the step from simulated flights to real-life testing is as small as possible. Current simulator models are held back due to a lack of properly identified multirotor coefficients. Often, the coefficients from a different multirotor are used, even if the new multirotor is vastly different in shape and size. Additionally, most researchers do not have a sufficient overview of which parts of the simulator are most important in providing an accurate simulator environment.<br/><br/>This research will give an overview of the different parts that influence the simulator results. The simulation of the motor controllers and rotor aerodynamics is identified as a major contributor to inaccuracies. The coefficients used in these two components will be found by performing a system identification process of the NXP HoverGames quadcopter. This identification process entails determining the mass, dimensions, inertia, motor response and thrust, torque, rotor drag and rolling moment coefficients. Experiments will be performed to find the correct coefficient values and to evaluate the impact that each effect has on the simulator's performance. A focus is put on ease of repeatability, such that other researchers can use the same process for their specific multirotor.<br/><br/>The theoretical background behind each effect in the motor controller and rotor aerodynamics models is discussed. This theoretical knowledge is used to perform experiments to find the coefficients for each effect and validate them. As a result, new coefficients for the motor controller simulator, thrust, torque and rotor drag were found. Additionally, this process showed that the rolling moment is much smaller than the errors currently existing in the model and this effect has, therefore, been ignored. The motor controller simulation is identified as the largest cause of inaccuracies in the current model. This simulation maps the motor commands to the output rotational velocity of the rotor and simulates the time response of this system. The formulas currently used for this do not provide a sufficient model of real-life behaviour. An analysis is done to gain a better understanding of what variables influence motor behaviour.<br/><br/>Finally, the new coefficients are put to the test in a variety of different trajectories to compare the trajectory tracking performance with the old model. This comparison consists of two parts. In the first part, a qualitative analysis is used to understand the difference in simulator behaviour. In the second part, a set of metrics are defined to quantify the difference in accuracy.

The process to decide if a person already has an account at the service where they seek to authenticate themselves is called identity matching. Regulated and public Dutch Relying Parties and the Dutch government are not always able to assess whether a citizen authenticating themselves has a pre-existing record at the Relying Party or in the Dutch national registry. Moreover, the current dependency on the Dutch central identity matching service creates a Single Point of Failure. Besides these reliability problems, privacy issues such as profiling data minimization must be accounted for. To this end, this research proposes three possible solution directions for solving these problems: a government-centric, wallet provider-centric, and a hybrid solution direction. The design of the solution directions follows a design science research methodology. The possible solution directions are evaluated by experts in focus groups to elicit the benefits and the barriers which these experts identify as relevant factors for accepting a solution direction. These factors are categorized using the TOE model, which is adapted to suit the current context. Expert evaluations during the focus groups have resulted in factors which relate to the organizational, technological, and external environment of the solution directions. The evaluation uncovered tradeoffs which the Dutch Ministry of the Interior must make to choose between one of the proposed solution directions: reuse of infrastructure at the cost of citizen privacy, or more privacy for citizens at the cost of additional logic requirements needed for the identity wallet. Based on the privacy and reliability requirements and the objective of the Dutch government to give citizens more control over their personal data, the wallet provider-centric solution direction is the most fitting choice of the three proposed solution directions. The explication of the problem, requirements, and solution directions can be used as a starting point in the exploration of new solution directions for the identity matching problems.

The numerical results indicated that the membrane thickness and material are vital. As an increase in thickness and young's modulus results in an exponential increase in switching force. These numerical results and the end-effector production method determine the final dimensions. The prototype is then used to perform a set of experiments to validate the numerical model.<br/>The measurement results on the deformation of the end-effector membrane confirm model results. However, production inaccuracies and the application method of the membrane resulted in inconsistencies in the dimensions and its performance. The force measurement results indicate that the force created by the end-effector is heavily impeded by the sealing performance of the suction-cups. Improving the sealing performance resulted in values in accordance with the numerical model. The pick-and-place experiment indicates that a substantial force is created by the suction cups, capable of pick-and-placing rigid laminates. For the transportation of flexible laminates (thinner and/or smaller young's modulus), smaller forces are created due to the compliance of the laminate, therefore more accurate production and a thinner and more flexible membrane is required. Depending on the laminate material and shape, certain design guidelines are in place. A larger force can be created on more rigid laminates, allowing for the application of a less flexible membrane. For thinner laminates the switching force is reduced, and therefore the membrane needs to be very flexible and thin. For a more complex shape, smaller and more suction cups are required, impacting the other variables. Additional guidelines for various laminate materials and shapes are found at the end of this report. <br/>In conclusion, an end-effector based on the membrane induced pressure differential is a design path which is worth investigating further for pick-and-placing thin laminates. Depending on the application and thus the target laminates, certain design guidelines are set up at the end of this report. These can be used for further research to pick-and-place geometric intricate laminates of various materials.<br","Additive manufacturing; Metamaterial; Multi-Material; Prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

The goal of this research is to evaluate the extend to which ground granulated blast furnace slag and calcined clay-based alkali activated concrete can be utilized in concrete revetment applications with equal performance in freeze-thaw and sulfate attack resistance and lower environmental impact compared to blast-furnace slag cement concrete. This research uses a combination of ground granulated blast furnace slag and calcined clay as precursor blend which is combined with sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide activator solution. An upscaling methodology is used such that differences in material behavior between each upscaling step (paste, mortar, concrete) is explained. Mix designs are developed with the Taguchi method.The alkali activated concrete mix designs develop good compressive strength, where both mix designs reach over 12MPa after 24 hours of ambient curing and over 37MPa after 28 days of ambient curing. It fulfills the requirement for revetment products and outperforms cement concrete.The water absorption is on the high side. It does not fulfill the requirement, but the high value is attributed to non-optimal compaction as the concrete phase uses a special vibration and pressure compaction machine, which does not represent the compaction enabled in a factory process as the reference concrete also fails to meet this requirement.Freeze-thaw performance of the alkali activated mortar is sufficient as 5 of 9 mortar mix designs meet the requirement from the CDF test. Inclusion of calcined clay and the effect of the modulus clearly results in worse freeze-thaw performance due to more difficult compaction, higher absorption and more interconnected pores resulting in more scaling as the de-icing solution can penetrate further in the specimens. Freeze-thaw of the alkali activated concrete and reference concrete is insufficient with large amount of scaling at the end of the test, partially attributed to compaction. However, the retarding scaling behavior of alkali activated concrete indicates good long term performance.Sulfate attack performance is tested at mortar level where specimens are exposed to 10 % MgSO4 solution for 14 days. No degradation is visible in terms of scaling and compressive strength. Slight formation of ettringite is observed, thus it is recommended to extend the testing period.LCA is performed on product level and does not consider service life and recyclability. The alkali activated concrete mix designs show the potential to reduce the milieukostenindicator with 48 % to €5,72 and reduce the CO2 emissions with 63% towards 48kg per m3 produced concrete. These are significant reductions, but for full validation of environmental footprint performance of alkali activated concrete, service life and recyclability should also be involved in the calculations.The research proves that alkali activated concrete is a very interesting alternative for cement concrete in revetment products where the saturated Dutch GGBFS market can be alleviated partially by substitution of calcined clay. However, to apply the alkali activated concrete in revetment products, more research should be carried out with regards to durability, curing methods, recyclability and service life.","Alkali; Activated; Concrete; GGBFS; CC; calcined clay; ground granulated blast furnace slag; geopolymer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Pena Martinez, Juan Jose (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To accelerate the growth of offshore wind power, its Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) must be reduced. A means of reducing the LCOE of offshore wind power is by mitigating the adverse wake effect by employing Wind Farm Control (WFC) for power maximization. A recent WFC technology is the helix approach, which uses Individual Pitch Control (IPC) to initiate early wake mixing. Research regarding the helix approach is scarce, yet early results suggest that significant power gains are achievable. Simultaneously, increases in wind turbine loads are expected. To aid future researchers in making a trade-off between increased loading and performance, an extensive load analysis is conducted, aiming to analyze and quantify the load impact of the helix approach on the SG 11.0-200 DD offshore wind turbine.<br/><br/>A sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of the helix parameters on the load impact on the wind turbine tower, blades, main bearing and pitch bearing. It is found that the load impact on all components is mostly sensitive to the pitch amplitude. Most components show some sensitivity to the Strouhal number as well, except for the main bearing. For the blade pitch bearings, an upward and downward trend can be observed for Counter-Clockwise (CCW) and Clockwise (CW) helix directions, respectively, which are related to the pitch frequency.<br/><br/>The helix approach is part of the plans for the Hollandse Kust Noord (HKN) wind farm. For this reason, a lifetime fatigue analysis is conducted to quantify the load impact on a wind turbine at the HKN wind farm over its full lifetime for several helix implementations. The fact that the helix approach is only employed under certain conditions is taken into account. It was found that the load impact on the pitch bearings is significant. The load impacts on the tower and main bearing become considerable for helix implementations with a large pitch amplitude. All other components are mildly affected.<br/><br/>Finally, the load impact of the novel concept of Closed-Loop Helix Control (CLHC) is compared to conventional helix. This approach considers asymmetric loading on the rotor (caused by e.g. wind shear and tower shadow) when employing helix. Results found that CLHC reduces blade loads with respect to the helix approach. However, since the blades are mildly affected by the helix approach in general, choosing CLHC over conventional helix is not imperative.","The Helix Approach; Wake Mixing; Wind Farm Control; Individual Pitch Control; Fatigue; Damage Equivalent Loads; Closed-Loop Control; Spectral Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The production and consumption of electricity need to be balanced at all times. Due to the ever-growing shift towards renewable energy generation, this poses an increasingly difficult challenge. Currently, supply is regulated to maintain balance. However, there is potential to improve reliability and save costs by shifting the balancing to the demand side, known as demand response. The flexibility of water systems can play a role in this, thereby benefiting from cheaper price fluctuations and reducing operating costs.<br/><br/>This research investigates the IJmuiden pumping station, which drains water from the Noordzeekanaal-Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal system into The North Sea. The primary focus of the control of this system is ensuring safe water levels as it runs through areas of high economic value. The flexibility of the range of safe water levels allows costs to be minimized by selecting favourable moments to consume electricity. This simultaneously contributes to the stability of the electrical grid. This research explores the potential for a Reinforcement Learning controller for such an optimization problem, as there are some drawbacks to the Model Predictive Control methods that are currently widely used. The research objective is formulated as follows:<br/><br/>To optimize the control of the IJmuiden pumping station using Reinforcement Learning while complying with local water level restrictions and compare it to the state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control methods in terms of constraint violation, energy costs, and computational speed.<br/><br/>The Reinforcement Learning controller will use a deep Q-learning algorithm that chooses the most cost efficient control in IJmuiden while respecting the water level restrictions. To do so, the model makes decisions based on electricity prices and details about the state of the water system for the current time step as well as a forecast of 48 hours ahead. This data is provided as an input to the model.<br/><br/>The inputs of the model consist of historical data, meaning that the associated uncertainties are not included. The water system that the model can interact with is represented by a linear reservoir model. Therefore, the water system is influenced dynamically by the actions taken by the model. The possible actions are determined by the state of the water system.<br/><br/>The trained model was tested on 2 years of unseen data (data that was not used during training). Using the same test data, control plans were generated using Model Predictive Control. The Reinforcement Learning model was very successful in ensuring safe water levels. However, this did result in approximately 50\% higher energy costs. The use of the gate was close to optimal but the pumping was not clearly correlated with favourable prices and power consumption. The trained model was robust, with consistently accurate results with regards to respecting the water level constraints.<br/><br/>The most significant difference with the Model Predictive Control was the computation time. The Reinforcement Learning model was able to create a control plan approximately 300 times faster. This opens doors for further development of the model and increased complexity. A more accurate model of the water system can be used to take into account temporal and spatial effects and individually representing the six pumps in IJmuiden.<br/><br/>There are still many steps before such a model can be used for operational control, but the method has potential for such an application. Many aspects of the model can be improved as well as making adjustments to increase the usability for control operators.","Reinforcement Learning; Demand Response; Pumping station control; IJmuiden; Tensorforce","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Flipse, S.M. (graduation committee); Abraham, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Like many cities in sub-Saharan Africa, Kumasi, Ghana is facing greater groundwater demands in part due to rapid urbanization. However, currently Ghana does not systematically monitor groundwater, which poses a challenge in management and implementation of science-based policy. Additionally, coordination among stakeholders in Ghana’s water sector has been described as inadequate by the National Water Policy which results in greater obstacles in water resource management. In order to simultaneously address these issues, value sensitive design is implemented to synergize diverse stakeholder perspectives to develop groundwater management and monitoring strategies. Value sensitive design provides a theoretical basis for explicitly incorporating values into innovations. In order to address the goal of the study, 46 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Kumasi water sector were conducted as well as literature and policy reviews. <br/>The first research question aims to identify key stakeholders and their role in groundwater management. The results identifed over 40 stakeholder groups in the Kumasi water sector. However, the most well-known groups are Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) and the Water Resources Commission (WRC). In addition to these government organizations, technical experts, specifically affiliated with Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), were cited as necessary to involve in the development of a groundwater monitoring technology. <br/>The second research question seeks to identify practical considerations for groundwater monitoring. Here, there was a general negative view of groundwater management with challenges including limited regulation, lack of awareness for groundwater issues, and limited collaboration among groundwater stakeholders. To address these challenges, the most cited design requirement mentioned during the interviews was the need for mass education on water related concerns. Lastly, there were significant concerns among many of the interviewees about borehole drilling and the importance of informal communication between drillers and neighbors to ensure safe and sustainable access to groundwater. <br/>The third research question uses value sensitive design protocols to create value profiles for each of the stakeholder groups. The values incorporated in this study are economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, safety, social equity, participation, reliability, and trust. Respondents were asked, through a token allocation activity, to indicate what values are important for groundwater monitoring. Although the value profiles between stakeholder groups were not statistically different, the anecdotal evidence from interviews suggests that participation is connected to other values. This indicates that participation contributes to achieving other values in the implementation of a groundwater monitoring program.<br/>The last research question sought to identify communication tools to incorporate considerations derived from the research questions, case studies, Ghanaian water policy, and a theoretical framework based on participatory design. This resulted in the recommendation of three parallel strategies: a) multi-stakeholder involvement, b) technology development and c) a water education campaign. The programs are designed to operate in a cyclic manner based on a social learning model specific to water management. This will enable a groundwater monitoring technology to be developed (b) alongside a water education campaign (c) in the community where water will be monitored. Implementation of a multistakeholder advisory board to coordinate these efforts and facilitate collaboration will ensure a participatory process. The next steps are to disseminate findings to key stakeholders in the Ghana water sector and continuously adapt the action plans as new information is identified.","Value sensitive deisgn; Communication; Groundwater; Ghana","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-15","","","","Applied Sciences | Communication Design for Innovation","",""

A special emphasis is placed on the role that the ego plays in producing, via the consecration of authorship, the figure of the contemporary architect as a major obstacle for the productive and democratic proliferation of spatial knowledge, as well as one that perpetuates the extractivist and exploitative systems of economic and social production. This will lead to the proposal of an alternative construction of human subjectivity and, by extent, of the architect, that rejects the omnipotence of the architectural hero and embraces the notions of serendipity and the accident as the most important methodological drivers of sensible, suitable, and successful architectural interventions. By virtue of placing the accident in the foreground of architectural praxis, both the architect and its knowledge are liberated from the authorial chains of the ego, maximizing the proliferation of spatial strategies and the activation of local agents and communities, allowing for a collaborative, collective, inclusive and structural approach to any spatial conflict, which is much harder to provoke through traditional praxis. Lastly, a new partial axiomatic system based on a triple embodiment of presence is developed from within the subjectivity of the accident.","agency; architect; authorship; difference; ego; power; psychoanalysis; subject; Roma; Fascism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","42.66488291783986, -2.019660934280533"

Therefore, hydrogen has been seen as an energy carrier to provide integration amongst the various sectors of energy generation, transportation, household heating and industrial use. The use of hydrogen as a fuel for re-electrification and power production can be done via IC engines, gas turbines and fuel cells.<br/>This thesis is interested in the possible applications of re-electrification of hydrogen using a system consisting of an SOFC and a gas turbine. It aims to design a small lab scale, test-setup of such a power cycle. The setup<br/>would consist of a small gas turbine and a solid oxide fuel cell.<br/>To that end, this thesis introduces the importance of hydrogen as an energy storage medium followed by the advantages of the SOFC-GT systems in providing higher thermal efficiencies. This is followed by the introduction of the H2-O2 power cycles, namely the Graz and the Toshiba cycles. From previous research done at TU Delft, a basic schematic of the system has been shown, consisting of an SOFC, a combustor, and gas turbine, heat exchangers and an ejector for re-circulative cooling of the SOFC. This is the setup that has to be<br/>designed and so the theory behind the components is presented.<br/>Firstly, the theory behind solid oxide fuel cells, and their modelling is presented. The cooling of the SOFC has been looked into in greater detail. This is followed by the theory of combustion and turbulence modelling.<br/>Two combustor types, a swirl based and a micromix have been considered. Out of these the micromix has been chosen because of its superior mixing capabilities. Finally, the theory behind ejectors, heat exchangers and<br/>sizing of turbomachinery is presented. This concludes the theoretical background of the study. A 0-D model of the SOFC is made based on the Sunfire/Staxera Mk-200 ISM with the 3YSZ KeraCell 11 by Kerafol. This model is then used as a basis of design for the entire thermodynamic H2-O2 cycle. The designed thermodynamic cycle has an overall efficiency of 67.28 %.

A conceptual micromix geometry is presented following which, 2 different configurations are scaled and designed using the theory of jets in cross flow. The two configurations are compared after performing a CFD analysis using the k−ε model with equilibrium chemistry for combustion. The comparison is based on mixing performance, pressure drop and temperature contours. Following the design of the combustor, the supplementary components such as the heat exchangers and the<br/>ejector are designed. The turbine is selected as a small radial turbocharger with a pressure ratio of 8 and is sized using the Balje diagrams. material recommendations are given for the combustor and high- temperature<br/>heat exchangers. The final H2-O2 thermodynamic cycle is presented with the updated component designs. The final thermal efficiency is found to be 64.09 % LHV.<br/>Finally, a basic control scheme is developed for the system and the start-up procedure is briefly discussed.","Hydrogen; Oxygen; Gas Turbine; Solid oxide fuel cell; Combustion; Energy; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

The kernel machine optimization problem is solved in the primal space, such that the complexity of the problem scales linearly in the number of samples as opposed to scaling cubically in the dual space. Product feature maps are applied to transform the input data. The weights are constrained to be a CPD, so the number of weights scales linearly in the number of features. The CPD introduces a nonlinearity, so nonlinear optimization must be applied. <br/>It is studied in which situation it is more advantageous to apply iterative all-at-once opti- mization compared to Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to solve the CPD constrained kernel machine problem. Specifically, all-at-once gradient descent methods are studied. An efficient analytical algorithm for the all-at-once gradient is derived. Furthermore, it is shown that automatic differentiation (AD) can also be applied, but it is found to be slower than the analytical method. <br/>The selection of a step size is found to be challenging. It is shown that the magnitude of the gradient of the mean squared error (MSE) term decreases for an increasing number of features. As a result, selecting the step size becomes more difficult for more features. To overcome this, the Line search and the Adam method are studied. A general expression for the exact line search solution is derived. It can be applied to compute the optimal step size for any step direction and any number of features. However, the Adam method performs better in terms of loss after training, convergence and the training run time. The mini-batch Adam method is used to evaluate the performance of all-at-once optimization for large scale learning. <br/>It is found that the Adam method no longer performs well for data sets with around 16 features or more, likely due to the decrease in the magnitude of the gradient of the MSE term. On large scale data sets with fewer features, the Adam method outperforms ALS in terms of run time until convergence while achieving similar training and validation losses. The Adam method reached convergence on a data set with 11 million samples within ten minutes. Furthermore, it is shown that the scaling of the run time of the Adam method in terms of the feature map order and the CP-rank is more than an order lower than the scaling of ALS when the methods are run on a GPU. This makes to Adam method more suitable for more complex models.","tensor decomposition; Canonical Polyadic Decomposition; Optimization; feature mapping; all-at-once optimization; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/ewoudvm/all-at-once-cpd-learning GitHub repository of thesis","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The true values of these parameters were measured using traditional hand measurements to evaluate smartphone-based SfM-MVS-derived parameter estimates.<br/><br/>The results show that the estimation of the linear parameters of the mangroves generally achieves high accuracy (RMSE of tree height, canopy diameter, stem diameter and thick branch diameter are all lower than 15%). There were significant negative biases in the estimates of tree height and crown diameter, and no significant biases in the estimates of stems and branches. The results of linear regression show that there is a strong positive correlation between the estimated values of all parameters and the true values. There are large errors and negative biases in the estimates of the frontal area at different heights. Overall, RMSE of frontal area at a certain height is 45.58% with a bias of -38.83%. This result showed that the SfM-MVS model resulted in a large underestimation of the frontal area at each height. A series of analyses showed that the main reason for the large error in the frontal area at a certain height was that the terminal branches with the lowest branch order (smallest diameter) were difficult to visualize in the SfM-MVS model. And this part of the branches actually occupies a large proportion of the frontal area.<br/><br/>This study demonstrates that smartphone-based SfM-MVS is capable of estimating mangrove tree height, canopy diameter, stem diameter, and thick branch diameter. Its accuracy is comparable to other existing methods such as TLS, ALS, camera-based SfM-MVS. However, the resolution is insufficient for very thin branches (&lt;=5mm), which makes the method inaccurate in estimating the frontal area at a certain height. Factors such as photography distance and ambient lighting can affect the accuracy of the model. Compared with the currently used remote sensing technologies such as TLS, the smartphone-based SfM-MVS has the advantages of low cost, high flexibility, and low difficulty for those who lack professional knowledge or training, which makes it an alternative with great potential.","wave damping; Mangroves; 3D Modeling; Parameter Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Offshore wind turbine structures, typically supported by a tubular monopile foundation, are increasing in size to meet the increasing human demands. In the constant ongoing debate in search of a balance between design accuracy and efficiency, general consensus is yet to be found in search of accurate yet simplified representation of soil-pile interaction. A Winkler foundation principle has shown to be a good compromise regarding this discussion but current knowledge is mainly based on (pseudo-static) small soil-strain inducing wind- and wave load-cases. Adopting this principle, the soil-structure interaction mechanism is represented by local lateral soil reactions (springs with distributed stiffness in mechanical formulation). Strong ground shaking induces shearing and volumetric variation of the soil particles. Through hysteresis the soil material exhibits energy dissipation: hysteretic damping. Accounting for hysteresis is considered computationally more demanding than when the soil continuum is assumed elastic but this is an assumption which only holds when soils undergo very small soil strains.<br/>This thesis explores the amount of energy dissipated as a result of hysteresis during seismic response of an offshore wind turbine and the applicability of such damping in a local linear visco-elastic manner. In order to obtain insight in this nonlinear energy-dissipation mechanism associated with the hysteretic offshore wind turbine model under seismic excitation, a Python code was developed that calculates the energy dissipation of each load-cycle separately. The developed energy dissipation assessment algorithm is effective in application of arbitrary hysteretic response and unloading-reloading rules.<br/>The hysteretic nature of the soil-pile interaction springs in question are calibrated against the widely applied API p-y, force-displacement curves. Unloading-reloading rules are specified to define the load-cycles. Boulanger et al. describes such unloading-reloading rules for pile application under seismic loading. The applicability of these backbone curves and unloading-reloading rules remains questionable in application of rigid monopile foundations. Despite not representing the accuracy of true soil-monopile interaction, obtained results in this research may support the exploration of innovative unloading-reloading rules.<br/>The developed energy dissipation algorithm is proven to be a powerful tool in identifying the amount of energy dissipation over a total timeseries. Reasonable agreement in peak (maximum observed), Ultimate Limit State, deflection and bending moment seismic response at mudline and tower top has been found between a hysteretic supported model and equivalent elastic models using a single (load-dependent and depth-dependent) equivalent damping coefficient in parallel with each soil spring. Representing the hysteretic energy dissipation mechanism using viscous dampers with constant damping coefficients has therefore proven to be an effective modelling strategy to account for the damping mechanism of plastic unloading-reloading rules without accounting for hysteresis. The effectiveness of an equivalent elastic modelling strategy reduces when the response undergoes substantial permanent plastified displacements. A typical property which is unable to be simulated under the application of an elastic modelling strategy.","Offshore energy; Offshore wind; Offshore wind turbine; Monopile; Foundation; Seismic; Earthquake; soil; soil-structure interaction; pysimple1; Hysteretic damping; hysteresis; equivalent viscous damping; equivalent hysteretic damping; API; soil-pile interaction; nonlinear soil; 1D Finite Element Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This leads to severe threats to our environment. However, a large amount of e-waste is not waste at all. They could be well refurbished and then reused by the next owner because most are obsoleted before their fully functional lifetime. In addition, many consumers are willing to purchase those pre-owned electronic devices beyond their up-to-date time. Therefore, Valyuu, a Dutch-based circular electronics start-up, is one of the retailers that work in this field.<br/><br/>Valyuu is currently seeking to grow its seller market, by attracting more customers to sell their EOU devices to it. However, there is a big challenge that most consumers are not managing their EOU devices properly but simply storing them at home. In order to solve this challenge and achieve Valyuu’s seller market growth, the research questions were derived, and this project was initiated.<br/><br/>Firstly, the context analysis was conducted to understand the contextual elements that influence consumers’ behaviors. Then, Valyuu’s competitive environment in its related market field was briefly scanned. At the same time, the literature review formulated a theoretical foundation to progress this project further. Afterward, instructed by the conclusions from the literature, consumer research was conducted, which is the core activity in the research phase of this project. After that, all of the conclusions in the first 5 Chapters were integrated and taken into consideration when assessing and selecting the target group, lazy ignorers, and forming the design brief. <br/><br/>Till then, the research phase was wrapped up and the ideation phase started. After conducting the co-creation workshop, the design opportunities and guidelines were specifically proposed, which instructed the development of initial concepts.

The mechanisms and magnitude of global blockage effect are not yet fully understood. Models to simulate upstream blockage to improve efficiency estimates and better understand global blockage have thus far not been refined. The aim of this research is to investigate the sensitivity of upstream blockage to the numerical configuration of CFD simulations to improve model accuracy and understanding of global blockage. <br/><br/>RANS simulations are executed under steady state conditions with a k − ϵ turbulence model. A neutral stability, pressure-driven atmospheric boundary layer is modelled with fully developed uni-directional flow. Wind farms are modelled as actuator discs with 5 rows of turbines on flat terrain. Streamwise and spanwise spacing is set to 7 turbine diameters (D) and 5D respectively. Global blockage is measured against the induction of a single turbine at 2.5D upstream. Variables investigated include the domain height, lateral extent, inlet and outlet distances from the wind farm.<br/><br/>Domain heights ranging from 5D to 25D are investigated for change in magnitude and scale of upstream blockage for a laterally infinite wind farm. A clear trend of increasing blockage with domain height is observed. At domain heights of less than 15D, upstream velocity is increased by a maximum of 0.18% (5D). Larger domain heights produce a maximum velocity reduction of 0.23% (25D). The shape of upstream blockage is independent of domain height.<br/> <br/>A finite wind farm of 5 columns and lateral extents ranging from 2.5D to 20D on each side are utilized to investigate the impact on blockage. Wider domains of 5D to 20D display increasing blockage with width, while a domain of 2.5D exhibits behaviour similar to a laterally infinite wind farm. Blockage ranging from 0.13% (10D) to 0.31% (20D) reduction in velocity is shown to be highest at the center column of turbines and decreases toward the outer columns.<br/><br/>Inlet and outlet distances ranging from 15D to 100D are modelled. Upstream blockage for inlet distances of 50D to 100D produce consistent upstream blockage magnitude and extent of 0.22% and 30D respectively. Shorter inlet distances result in decreased upstream blockage with a minimum of 0.12% (15D). The shape of blockage remains consistent through all inlet ranges. Outlet distance have no identifiable impact on upstream blockage magnitude and extent.<br/><br/>Changes to the numerical configuration show a clear correlation of increased blockage with cross sectional area of the domain. Constraining the domain in the vertical and lateral directions constricts flow resulting in reduced blockage. Blockage becomes independent of inlet distances at values of 50D and higher. Outlet distance has no identifiable impact on upstream blockage. Choosing a numerical configuration with adequately sized domain boundaries is pertinent in producing realistic upstream blockage.","Wind Energy; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); RANS; Upstream Blockage; Global Blockage Effect; Neutral stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The required system parameters as spring stiffnesses and element lengths are obtained by optimization with a genetic algorithm. In addition to the standard optimization case, the effects of prestressed springs with contact release, nonlinear springs, optimizable initial configuration and an extra segment on the approximations are studied as well.

(graduation committee); Janssen, Joey (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Cold-bent insulating glass units (IGU) have the potential to be one of the answers to current needs and wishes of modern and sustainable architecture. Curved glass is stiffer against out-of-plane loads and therefore the structural behaviour of cold-bent IGU’s is different compared to flat IGU’s. Structural behaviour of flat glass in buildings is assessed using standards such as EN 16612 and NEN 2608. Within these norms, isochoric and load sharing cavity pressures are assessed using simplified analytical equations. In case of cold-bent IGU’s, the additional assessment of increased stiffness, permanent cold-bending stresses and optical distortions are of importance. Currently, no standards are available for building envelopes containing curved glass elements. Methods from current standards have proved to be sufficient to quantify the complex role of cavity pressure in flat IGU’s. The goal of this research is to develop an analytical method to determine the effect of cavity pressure on the structural behaviour of cold-bent insulating glass units. <br/><br/>For the structural assessment of cold-bent IGU’s three stages are defined: ’Bending phase’, ‘Fixation moment’ and ‘Use phase’. Numerical models are developed to gain insights into the structural behaviour of cold-bent glass plates. Insights are then used to derive and validate simplified analytical methods. <br/><br/>The bending phase is numerically modelled with a geometrically nonlinear analysis in which curvatures are realized by prescribed displacements along two opposite edges of the plate. Results show that maximum cold-bending stresses are independent of plate size. By defining a tensile bending strength, insights are gained into the maximum radius of curvature of a plate with a specified thickness. A closed form equation is derived, which is used to calculate cold-bending stresses considering plate thickness and radius of curvature as input parameters. Resulting principal stresses have an average accuracy of 99.1% compared to numerical outcomes. Validity of the cold-bending stresses is limited to linearly fixed plates, up to a size of 6x3m, with equivalent plate thicknesses ranging from 4-20mm and design radii ranging from 3m to 25m.<br/><br/>Numerical results from the fixation moment show an anticlastic double or triple (w-shape) curvature in single curved plates, that cause optical distortions. The extent and shape of anticlastic bending depend on the Poisson’s ratio, plate thickness, radius of curvature and plate size. Based on regression between the parameters of influence, a result-based approach is developed to determine anticlastic bending displacements at the centre of curved plates. The approach is simplified to a curved plate with a sinusoidal anticlastic bending curvature. The displacements are expressed in a parameter for the radius at midspan and are calculated using tabulated coefficients with an average accuracy of 99.3%. Validity of the radius at midspan is limited to the previously mentioned boundary conditions. <br/><br/>For the use phase, the calculation of cavity pressures depends on the volume of deformation per pane of a linearly supported cold-bent IGU. Interaction between the panes is modelled using pressure loads derived from Boyle’s law. Using numerical models, volumes of deformation (v) from curved plates subjected to pressure loads (p) are presented in P-V diagrams. These diagrams are used calculate cavity pressures ranging from -1 to 1 kN/m2, considering plate sizes up to 6x3m, plate thickness of 8, 10 and 12mm and design radii up to 8m. Due to the increased stiffness of curved IGU’s, a higher load is shared by the pane onto which an external pressure is applied. Furthermore, as a result of anticlastic bending, a permanent isochoric pressure is present inside cavities of asymmetric IGU’s, which increases as curvatures increase. <br/><br/>A simplified analytical method to calculate effective cavity pressures is derived from shell theory. Load sharing pressures of symmetric IGU’s are calculated with an average accuracy of 95%, compared to results from the numerical P-V diagrams. Load sharing pressures of asymmetric IGU’s (91% accuracy) are summed with isochoric pressures due to cold-bending (92% accuracy) to calculate combined effective pressures with an average accuracy of 87%. <br/><br/>The equations are summarized in a guideline, which is complemented by an interactive calculation tool. The developed analytical method is effective in calculating effective cavity pressures and can be used to quickly explore various design options in a wide range of cold-bent IGU’s. <br","Cold-Bent; IGU; Glass; Analytical; FEM Analysis; Built Environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

The CRMs, are functional materials that meet current challenges and future demands in information and communication technology (ICT). The extraction and processing of CRMs are highly concentrated, mainly outside the European Union (EU). The EU is dependent on import supply. Due to growing demand, an increase in primary CRM mining is expected shortly. Moreover, research showed that primary CRM mining significantly impacts human rights abuse. The increased CRM demand and supply can have an increased effect on human rights challenges. A greater focus is being placed in the EU on preventing and mitigating human rights violations in the global value chain. However, there is limited research in the telecommunication industry on managing human rights in the context of primary CRM supply. The growing demand in CRMs for telecommunication products and technologies highlights the importance of incorporating strategies to secure their business within the telecommunication sector. Therefore, this research aims to answer the following question: What strategies can telecommunication companies deploy in response to human rights challenges in primary critical raw materials supply? The methodology is mainly based on a qualitative approach. The research includes scientific and grey literature reviews, expert interviews, internal documents, and expert workshops. Research data is analysed using the framework on human rights in primary critical raw material supply development. <br/><br/>The research provides an overview of human rights in primary CRM supply. It shows the drivers and barriers for KPN in how to deal with this changing environment. The main focus is on human rights in the context of Conflict Mineral (CM) supply instead of the EU CRM list. Companies don’t have a fixed strategy in place to manage human rights challenges in primary CRM supply. Secondly, a case study is performed on cobalt extraction in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The general finding was that many human rights challenges occur in primary cobalt mining in the DRC. Various human rights challenges occur in artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) as well as in large-scale mining (LSM). Furthermore, among telecommunication companies, there are different levels of advancement in human rights due diligence practices in CRM supply. However KPN has an emergent strategy on the topic, the company is behind their peers in the level of advancement. At last, a strategy is developed for managing the human rights challenges in primary CRM supply. Experts validated the strategy. <br/><br/>The thesis concludes that becoming a responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) member and implementing the OECD framework would be a decent start. The RMI provides tools and resources to advance on the topic. Having limited resources and capacity and dealing with complex mineral supply chains makes that a suitable option for KPN. In the medium term, KPN should explore additional actions, which should be the building blocks to advance on the topic and strengthen the company's position. <br/><br/>Further research could focus on exploring case studies CRMs in relation with human rights challenges, and understand the interaction of the system in depth. Moreover, develop schemes and guidelines for responsible supply of all minerals in LSM and ASM sector that are linked to human rights challenges. This is important in order to ensure that companies have a strategy in place. A strategy were human rights challenges are well managed and ensure responsible CRM supply. <br","Critial Raw Materials; Human Rights; Telecommunication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-11","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Solar energy is an important renewable energy source that is already generated by millions of solar panels attached to building roofs throughout The Netherlands. Whether a roof is suitablefor solar panels relies on its type, orientation and whether it is put in shadow by a neighbouring object. This means, the higher the solar potential of a roof, the better.<br/><br/>A solar radiation model is used to determine the solar potential of a roof. Well-known Geographical Information Systems, such as ArcGIS and GRASS GIS provide solar radiation models for raster data. However, raster data does not model the 3D urban environment accurate enough. Vector data is better capable of representing 3D buildings models, but solar radiation models for vector data are not widespread available and are computationally inefficient, because of the shadow casting step.<br/><br/>This research aims at providing an efficient solar radiation model for processing large-scale 3D city models. The 3D BAG data set, containing all the buildings in The Netherlands as vector data, is taken as use case. Their building models are stored in CityJSON format, subdivided into smaller tiles based on the spatial extent. The implemented model in this research, called SolarBAG, takes one or multiple tiles as input, processes the building geometries to compute the solar potential, and outputs an enriched CityJSON file where each building roof consists of yearly solar potential values. Within the process, the building geometries are stored in an Rtree to allow fast retrieval when filtering neighbouring buildings that potentially cast a shadow over another building. The roofs of buildings are sampled into a grid of points to account for the variable solar radiation values on a roof surface caused by shadows of neighbouring buildings. A ray-box intersection method is used to find the neighbouring buildings casting a shadow on another building.<br/><br/>To assess the quality and scalability of the implemented solar radiation method, experiments are conducted. For the quality assessment, the solarpy module used to compute the beam solar radiation, is compared to ground truth values, and the solar radiation model is compared to the solar radiation tool in ArcGIS. For the scalability assessment, the solar radiation model is tested for an increasing number of tiles. Based on the assessments, it can be concluded that the implemented solar radiation model can successfully enrich building roofs with solar potential values for one or multiple CityJSON files. However, there are still some bugs and inconsistencies present in the solar radiation model, and performance gains could still be achieved by neighbour filtering improvements.","Solar potential; 3D BAG; Shadow Casting","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/robinjo78/solarBAG","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Daniilidis, Alexandros (mentor); Barnhoorn, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This research describes how thermal fractures impact the near-wellbore (NWB) region of a depleted gasfield in a carbon sequestration project. As CO2 is usually injected in its supercritical phase, the injection fluid is injected on high pressures and low temperatures. This is in high contrast with the depleted gasfields, which have a low reservoir pressure. The increase in pressure and decrease in temperature causes a thermoporoelastic response, resulting in a reduction of stress inside the reservoir. Once the fracture initiation stress, the so-called fracture stress, is reached, thermal fractures form.<br/><br/>Thermal fractures form only due to extensive cooling of the reservoir. The fractures impact the NWB region; due to opening of fractures there is a drop in pressure in the bottomhole pressure (BHP). This increases the reservoir's injectivity. This research uses CMG GEM to model this. The simulation uses a homogeneous box dual permeability model with the model being initialized as a generalized depleted gas reservoir in the North Sea. To model the fractures, the Barton Bandis model is used. This model changes the permeability in a fracture cell once fracture conditions are met.<br/><br/>From this model, the moment of fracturing (fracture time), the fracture halflength and the injectivity of the reservoir is researched by performing a sensitivity analysis on key parameters. It is found that the thermal fractures propagate conform to the propagation of the coldest part of the thermal front. The thermal front propagates further once the fracture conditions are met sooner due to fluid highways or when the pressure build up in the reservoir is slower. <br/><br/>The sensitivity on the geomechanical parameters showed that only the stress conditions in the reservoir changed, causing the injection constant to change and thus a different fracture time. The way the reservoir reacted to the initiation of fractures was the same; the injectivity was improved similarly for each parameter.<br/><br/>The effective permeability (thickness and permeability) determines, together with the injection rate, the way the pressure builds up in the reservoir changes the increase of injectivity due to fracturing slightly. Increasing the reservoir volume causes a slower pressure build-up inside of the reservoir, allowing the thermal front to propagate further and thus longer fracture lengths. <br/><br/>Lastly, the sensitivity on the thermal effects showed that a higher difference between the reservoir and injection temperature causes the fracture to be less dependent on the increase of pressure to fracture, resulting in earlier fracturing and longer fracture halflength. The pressure build-up is not changed, so the injectivity remains similar to the basecase scenario.<br/><br/>All in all, this thesis gives an insight on how key parameters impact thermal fracture behavior. It also shows what range of parameters can be expected. Combining these two gives an insight on what parameters the focus should be on to better describe the behavior of thermal fractures, to economize the operation by leaving out or including extensive data collection on key parameters. This helps to improve the injection strategy with CO2 injection projects in depleted gasfields.<br","thermal fracture CCS NWB injectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bertipaglia, A. (mentor); Happee, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis presents a new MPC controller which integrates path tracking and stability control into one controller. Previously these tasks were done by separate controllers, where one controller handled the path tracking while another controller ensured the vehicle was kept in the stable operating region. A drawback of this method is that the controllers have opposing objectives. The path tracker could require a higher steering wheel angle to follow the path, while the Vehicle Stability Controller (VSC) might require a lower angle to keep the vehicle stable. By integrating these two controllers into one controller, the new controller is able to take both tasks into account and optimise the control output such that both objectives are satisfied. This is achieved by implementing two extra yaw rates into the MPC model. These are the expected yaw rates based on the steering wheel angle and lateral acceleration of the vehicle. By comparing these two yaw rates to the actual yaw rate, the stability of the vehicle can be determined. The MPC controller is then able to prioritise path tracking or vehicle stability. This is achieved by actively varying the weights in the cost function depending on the vehicle state. To compare the new MPC controller, 8 benchmark controllers have been created. These controllers can be divided into two groups of four controllers. The first group is able to use differential braking in the control output, while the second group can only output an equal brake torque for all wheels. The benchmark controllers use different methods for path tracking and stability control, to get an understanding of the performance benefits of each method.<br/>These different methods include: adding an extra target yaw rate based on path curvature and speed for tracking, adding constraints to ensure vehicle stability and using a separate stability controller to stabilise the vehicle. All controllers are evaluated using the industry standard Moose test as well as a double lane change in simulations. These manoeuvres are used in industry to evaluate stability and can also be used to evaluate path tracking. Furthermore the robustness of the controllers was evaluated by changing various parameters. These variations include: changing vehicle speed, adding extra weight to the vehicle, lowering the road &#x1d707; level and performing a lane change where each lane has a different &#x1d707; level. The results were evaluated using objective Key Performance Indicators regarding tracking performance and vehicle stability. The results show that the new MPC controller with the combined path tracking and stability control improves performance in both objectives. The new controller improves path tracking by 8% compared to the pure path tracking controller. While the stability is improved by 11% compared to the controller with a separate VSC. Furthermore the new controller was able to keep the vehicle stable at higher speeds and was more robust to varying conditions.","Model Predictive Control; Vehicle Stability Control; MPC; Path Following","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

This has in turn resulted in major outflows of waste electronics (WEEE) that are usually not properly dealt with. This is especially the case for low to medium grade printed circuit boards (PCBs) which unlike higher grade electronics such as computers are currently not profitable to recycle. Therefore this thesis, as a part of the Peacoc project, investigated the low energy separation methods roll sorting, magnetic separation and magnetic density separation to concentrate the precious and critical metals found in the components of these discarded PCBs. The resulting secondary material flows were then evaluated on their impact in the EU from a material and energetical perspective.The roll sorter was able to significantly increase the concentrations of the precious metal rich target components (Central processing units, IC chips and transistors, MLCC + Ta capacitors, Small transistors and IC chips and Connectors of plastic with golden pins). The machine sorted the feed into multiple width sizes (&lt; 3.0, 3.0 - 5.0, 5.0 - 7.0 and &gt; 7.0 mm) of which all except &gt; 7.0 were used for further processing, increasing the overall grade from 18.66 to 42.61 wt%. This was further increased by the magnetic separator (lightly and non magnetic fractions for &lt; 3.0 mm and only the non magnetic fraction for 3.0 - 7.0 mm) to 53.69 wt% and magnetic density separation (only for non magnetic 5.0 - 7.0 mm)to 66.23 wt%. Recovery for all target categories was near 100% with the exception of Connectors of plastic with golden pins as these were too large for the roll sorter to sort.The thesis also took a broader approach by employing a dynamic material flow analysis to determine the low to medium grade PCBs and their accompanying precious metal flows in the EU. The expected metal flows were low (∼4%) compared to the EU’s overall demand in 2020 and expected to decrease over the years due to miniaturisation (decreasing size and weight) of the components. Furthermore, only around 36.68 wt% of the maximum precious metal flows were expected to be captured due to low collection rates of WEEE and small loses in separation and metallurgical recovery. Nonetheless, a sizeable fraction of the EU’s electronics sector’s demand (over 10%) could be supplied. These results were confirmed by modelling different future scenarios, a Monte-Carlo uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the model.Lastly, the thesis explored the topic of critical raw materials (CRMs) and the direct energy requirements of Peacoc’s recovery system. It was found that beryllium, antimony, platinum and palladium were the only CRMs that had any significant potential to supply the EU (9.13% for beryllium, 1.58% for antimony,1.32% for platinum and 4.02% for palladium). If only looking at the electronics sector this was also the case for cobalt and vanadium. The newly captured secondary precious metals were shown to require significantly less energy to produce, around an order of magnitude, compared to primary production but were similar to other recycling pathways. Furthermore, the majority of energy was required during metallurgical recovery showing a potential for further mechanical concentration during separation.In conclusion it can be stated that the separation technologies (roll sorting, magnetic separation and magnetic density separation) are effective methods for separating the components of low to medium grade PCBs. However, their impact on the circularity and energetical footprint of the whole EU are expected to be small.","WEEE; Waste Electronics; Roll Sorting; Magnetic Separation; Magnetic Density Separation; Material Flow Analysis; Critical Raw Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Peacoc",""

As a result, new modalities emerge and stations are getting busier which can lead to a narrow design focus on the nodal function of the station, neglecting other aspects of the station. ""<br/> Due to the fact that many stations are located at central locations within cities, they have a strong influence on the quality of city life around them. Traditionally, the station has been seen solely as a node (connecting all the different modalities efficiently; moving people). Nowadays paradoxically, the station is seen increasingly as a place in its own right as well (by being an active part of the city; inviting people to stay). By diminishing the station’s barrier-effect and by implementing public functions within the station’s realm, the station can be integrated better within its surrounding city, creating an urban station that enhances city life. <br/> The evolving role of the station has been the subject of many recent studies. However, the research mostly remains to be theoretical. More practical design principles and requirements may help in achieving the ambitions regarding creating an integrated urban station. Literary research was performed into the multiple facets of station design, which led to the formulation of six design principles for contemporary urban station design. The main research question is as follows: <br/><br/>“Are the six design principles: multimodality, functional mix, connectivity, spatial quality, visibility &amp; flexibility apt contributors to the integration of an urban multimodal station within its surrounding cityscape?” <br/><br/>In recent years, many stations have been redesigned with special attention to this node-versus-place-paradox, focusing more on the station as a place. This research aims to analyse seven important international multimodal railway stations in The Netherlands and Belgium to see how these stations handle their complexity and aim to integrate within their surrounding city. <br/> The aim is to test the proposed design principles via the analyses of these seven chosen stations: Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam Centraal, Antwerpen Centraal, Utrecht Centraal, Arnhem Centraal and Amsterdam Zuid. The analyses are drawn on Nolli maps, in order to gain insight into the public realm surrounding the station and the connections between the two. <br/> As the results point out, the chosen design principles appear to be fitting for creating a well-integrated urban station. However, six design spaces have been formulated in addition to the design principles, each accompanying respectively one principle. The spaces act as an addition to the programme of requirement as provided by the commissioner, embodying the different design principles into explicitly formulated spaces. Further research is advisable. Especially multimodal station from France, Germany or England can give crucial new insights as the stations are generally larger and their urban surroundings are often more densely populated. <br/><br/>Further research into the airport city concept can also prove worthy, as the development in airports is a few years ahead on the developments around urban stations, airports can provide valuable examples and case studies.","Station design; Living station; Urban station; Station integration; Public space; Modalities; Multimodal hub; Public transportation; Spatial configuration","en","master thesis","","","","","","First, let me introduce myself: my name is Robin. I am a 26-year-old freshly graduated architectural student from the Master of Architecture at the TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. I have a great love for public transportation and train stations and chose to graduate on designing one. My graduation consists of two parts: an academic research into the integration of the station within the city and the design for the New Amsterdam Zuid Hyperloop Terminal, or The Whale. For the first part, I performed a literary research into the position of the station within the city, how the role of the station is changing. The literary research led me to define six design principles, that I analysed using several casestudies into international multimodal hubs in The Netherlands and Belgium. These casestudies confirmed my initially proposed design principles and supplemented them with six design spaces, providing an attainable way of implementing the design principles. The research into the integration of the station within the city helped me with designing the new station for Amsterdam Zuid, which is in dire need of integration as the current station creates a barrier within the area. On the other hand, the design project has been informed by the hypothetical emergence of hyperloop. If a hyperloop terminal where to be placed in The Netherlands, Amsterdam Zuid would be a very logic place as it is a fast growing area with increasing importance and great connectivity to other parts of Amsterdam and the Randstad. Also, the area is already facing major reconstruction works, so this would be the right time to implement this future modality. As the renovation works are sheduled to be finished around 2037, chances are that hyperloop is already being developed as a transportation system. Hence, I anticipated on this by already integrating the hyperloop terminal within my new design for the Amsterdam Zuid station. The design for The New Amsterdam Zuid Hyperloop Terminal is characterized by a large vide with an impressive steel arched roof that spans over it. In order to remove the barrier effect and allow for the creation of high quality public and green spaces around the station, all infrastructure has been placed underground. The vide is the central space of the station that enables daylight to come into the underground spaces and helps in creating orientation within the complex. Most transfers happen through this central space. The large roof creates visibility for the subterranean complex, helps in creating a sense of place and acts as a water manager and renewable power plant for the area. Crucial in this new design has been the widening of the Minerva concourse in order to better connect Zuidplein and Gustav Mahlerplein on both sides of the station. Four new concourses have been designed parallel to the Minerva Concourse and help in removing the barrier effect of the station. The ground floor of the complex is filled with retail and amenities for both travellers and citizens residing, working or recreating in the Zuidas. The complex has been topped off with the Dokdakpark, an important green infrastructure that provides an East-West corridor for pedestrians and cyclists. Station are becoming more than just transfer hubs: the revitalize neighbourhoods, shape urban centers and create new public hotspots. Accordingly, the New Amsterdam Zuid Hyperloop Terminal will be the heart of the Zuidas.

The research shows that the people who have mixed feelings about the neighborhood indicate that this is, because they feel unsafe in the neighborhood. By tackling the unsafe areas and getting the residents more involved with each other and the neighborhood, presumably more people will start to feel good about the neighborhood. This can be done by improving visibility, atmosphere, and the liveliness of the street.

This research aims to show how companies can use operational data to increase the operational efficiency of workboats and decrease emissions.<br/>The main question of this research is, how can operational data be used to improve the operational efficiency of workboat operations? This question is answered using the data Onboard collects and will use Business process management (BPM) tools to analyse the data. Few papers write about BPM in the maritime industry, and even less about workboats and BPM. The novelty of this study relies on the operational data-based approach, using BPM to increase the operational efficiency of workboats.<br/>The newly collected data collected by Onboard is from workboats. The collected data includes location, time, distance, speed, and fuel consumption. The collected data is time series data. When the crew selects an activity, the time series data until the next activity starts as part of that activity, and all activities are grouped into voyages. To the voyages and activities, the crew can add logbook data.<br/>BPM strategies are reviewed to find a way to use the operational data and optimise the workboats’ operations. The BPM strategies are compared on the use of data, how it matches with the operational workboat data, how the focus of the BPM strategies aligns with the research, and what literature states about the methods in comparable situations. The best fitting strategy to optimise a workboat operation turned out to be Lean Six Sigma (LSS). LSS can contain many tools and has a DMAIC structure: Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control..","Maritime industry; Workboats; Business Process Management; Operational Efficiency; Data; IoT data; Lean Six Sigma","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Bottger, A.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","High entropy alloys (HEAs) are new potential materials for hydrogen storage applications which could help with the transition towards sustainable energy sources. The rate of hydrogen kinetics is one of the material properties that is important for the storage and other hydrogen related applications. One of the limiting factors on the rate of hydrogen kinetics is hydrogen diffusivity. Thus far, there has been no reports on hydrogen diffusivity for HEAs in relation to hydrogenation kinetics.<br/><br/>Therefore, this project investigates hydrogen diffusivity in equimolar TiVZrHfNb and the influence of hydrogen concentration on hydrogen diffusivity to gain better understanding of hydrogenation kinetics. The selected HEA has been found to absorb the highest amount of hydrogen (2.5 H/M) among other HEAs.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The investigation was done by a computational approach using ab initio molecular dynamics. BCC and face-centered cubic (FCC) supercells with different hydrogen concentrations (H/M = 0.2, 0.8, 1.4, 2, 2.4) were simulated at a temperature range of 773 – 973 K. At the same time, experimental electrochemical hydrogen charging using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry was performed in order to compare computational and experimental values of hydrogen diffusivity.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The electrochemical hydrogen charging did not result in hydrogen absorption, most probably due to the passivation of the sample surface.<br/><br/>From the simulation results, the values of activation energy and pre-exponential factor were estimated to be in the range of 0.26 – 0.48 eV and 0.73 – 2.95 x 10-7 m2/s, respectively. Hydrogen diffusivity was found to be higher in BCC than in FCC. In BCC the hydrogen diffusivity slowly decreases linearly with increasing H/M. In the case of FCC, the hydrogen diffusivity was found to be the highest at 2.4 H/M while at 2 H/M the diffusivity was the lowest. The analysis of hydrogen occupation at 2 H/M shows that most of the hydrogen atoms are trapped inside tetrahedral sites. It is possible that the hydrogen occupation in the tetrahedral sites results in the optimum hydrogen distribution where the repulsive interaction between hydrogen atoms is the lowest. At concentrations above 2 H/M, an additional repulsive force between hydrogen atoms seems to contribute to the increase of hydrogen diffusivity.","Hydrogen storage material; High Entropy Alloys; hydrogen diffusivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mouter, N. (graduation committee); Chorus, C.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the history of pension funds, the goal of their investment policy was capital growth within a limited investment risk. This goal was part of their fiduciary duty, the legal responsibility to act in the beneficiary's best interest. In recent years, the purpose of pension funds has shifted to aim for long-term social gains in addition to focusing on financial returns. Pension funds have increasingly integrated social, environmental, and ethical considerations in their investment process. This has been attributed to various factors, including the positive correlation between ESG and financial performance but also external pressures from non-governmental groups fuelling public opinion through the media and actions to act more responsibly. The participants must support decisions relating to a responsible investment policy for the pension funds. However, pension fund beneficiaries' preferences for integrating responsible criteria have not been sufficiently investigated.<br/><br/>The aim of this study can be split up into three parts. First, to understand the preferences on the sustainable criteria from the beneficiaries of ADP. Secondly, based on research findings and interviews, find a suitable approach to implementing this in the investment strategy of ADP. Lastly, recommendations will be made on other stakeholders' steps for a successful SRI implementation. <br/><br/>First, this research sets up a choice experiment. It then uses discrete choice modelling to determine participants’ preferences and willingness to trade financial profits against SRI goals using Random utility maximisation (RUM). With this method, we find that participants are willing to contribute part of their pension income to implementing SDGs. Furthermore, we can see that participants think it is especially important that pension funds focus on reducing inequality. There are several motives for integrating ESG into the decision-making process. However, the execution of policy is different per motive. When participants want to integrate ESG to achieve higher returns, the implementation differs from when the motive is to impact the world positively. Therefore, additional analysis has been executed.<br/><br/>To determine whether the participants consider an equal contribution between the step from no attention to do no harm and do no harm and do good. The utility contribution of each attribute level is also measured; we can observe that for most SDGs, there is little willingness to put in extra money to make a positive contribution to the SDGs, except for reducing inequality. The RUM model is very good for calculating the weights given to the attributes that best fit all participants' answers. However, the model does not reflect whether there is heterogeneity in the population. Therefore, interaction effects on individual characteristics are estimated; this method allows heterogeneity between different groups based on their characteristics. However, when using this methodology, an issue could arise. Observable covariates may not produce some heterogeneity. Therefore, latent class analysis was also used. <br/><br/>Through the analysis of interaction effects, we find that there are already many differences in preferences based on individual characteristics. In the latent class analysis, we see three distinct groups. In these classes, we find a large group that gives little utility to pension income and finds all the SDGs important. The 2nd and 3rd groups are smaller, containing about 18% of the population. Group 2 especially finds retirement income very important, and group 3 finds reducing inequality very important. In this analysis, we find that the strong preference of groups 2 and 3 greatly impacts the RUM model. From these analyses, we find that there is heterogeneity in the population. We can use this input when we look at how participants’ preferences can be implemented in the investment policy.<br/><br/>By first analysing the factors and stakeholders involved, we can find which obstacles to overcome when implementing policy. When analysing stakeholders, we find three different groups. First, we find the societal actors; these mainly influence the shaping of policies. Secondly, we find the political actors who influence the rules of the game. Lastly, we find the economic actors who influence the policy's implementation. In this analysis, several challenges have been found. <br/><br/>Lastly, we have looked broadly at options for implementing participants' preferences. In conclusion, the analysis shows that there are different ways in which a pension fund can develop an SRI policy. This can be done differently, depending on the participant's wishes and preferences and the pension fund's contract form. The pension fund first needs to develop a vision of how they want to achieve a sustainable world. After this, they can create an investment strategy and investment mandate. Policymakers also have a role to play in changing the financial sector. Besides implementing policies to improve transparency, they could also implement financial incentives so it will be more financially attractive to adopt ESG practices.<br/><br/>We can conclude that participants are willing to contribute part of their pension income to the implementation of SDGs. Furthermore, we can see that participants think it is especially important that pension funds focus on reducing inequality. Based on the latent class analysis results, we can see that different groups within the population have other preferences. This is important to take into account when formulating policies. <br/><br/>The model results and our analysis are subject to limitations. The model could be improved by allowing participants in a choice experiment to allocate money between different investment options, including policies only focusing on returns. Furthermore, the results could be influenced by self-selection and the population focus. Therefore, we recommend studying a more diverse population with participants from different pension funds. Lastly, we focused on how the results could be implemented and what tools the pension fund could use to accomplish an impact, as most of these recommendations are based on qualitative research. It may be interesting to conduct a quantitative analysis of the established objectives based on implemented policies.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Amazon proposed a challenge to learn a delivery route planning strategy from historically driven routes and thus incorporate this tacit knowledge.<br/>In this thesis, we will tackle the challenge using data-driven inverse optimization to learn the zone sequencing patterns of drivers. The zone sequences of expert drivers are assumed to be the solutions to a traveling salesman problem (TSP) in which the weights represent the preference of a driver to use a certain edge. The values of the weights will be learned through inverse optimization.

Scientist knew of its existence for several decades, but only recently has the perception of it shifted from a solely environmental problem to a matter of international security. Climate change is thought to impact the likelihood of extreme weather events, intensity of droughts, rising sea levels and more. In this way climate change contributes to ongoing conflicts around the world by destroying resources or forcing people out of habitats, creating tensions among groups of people.<br/><br/>As the impacts of climate change are being felt more directly, calls for bolder climate action are getting louder. At the same time, there is also resistance by climate skeptics in industry, government, and among voters. Although most people appear aware and concerned with the development of climate change, the attitude towards climate action is extremely broad. Political rhetoric and disinformation in the media compound the disagreement on climate change, causing polarization. Although some polarization is beneficial for democratic deliberation and for mobilizing voters, if polarization divides the electorate into mutually distrustful groups, it can trap societies in a stifling gridlock or gradually erode democratic institutions. These pernicious effects are what necessitates closer study to monitor societal polarization, prevent conflict and improve climate action efforts.<br/><br/>Social media offers huge amounts of textual data to study discourse on climate change, which this study leverages to make first steps in understanding what topics make up the public discourse, how it<br/>varies across linguistic regions (English, German, Dutch) and how it changes considering climate-related events, namely floods and a climate protest. Using both topic modelling and sentiment analysis<br/>on Twitter data, it could be identified that activity spiked around major events: namely the 2019 Climate Strike and the 2021 Flood in Western Europe. However, reaction to events appears to be<br/>mainly regional with reaction to floods seen only in the Dutch and German tweets. The English Twittersphere seemed to be mainly skewed towards events in America. Polarization appeared low as<br/>most tweets were neutral. Examining only tweets with high sentiment, a different behavior was detected in terms of news coverage as there existed more high negative sentiment tweets, but almost<br/>no high positive sentiment tweets. During the 2019 Global Climate Strike, extreme sentiment tweets went both positive and negative, possibly indicating more intense discourse and a more polarized<br/>atmosphere.<br/><br/>Overall, results show that conflict-triggering climate events are very likely to be domestic events. Thus, from a security perspective, it suggests on the short-term to focus on the monitoring of domestic<br/>actors. On the long-term however, policies need to be implemented which address underlying factors that make society susceptible to polarization, such as socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion,<br/>disinformation in media or corruption. Lastly, from an academic perspective, more research on other dimensions of polarization needs to be conducted. Polarization is a complex phenomenon, whose full<br/>implications cannot be captured by the sentiment metrics. Thus, research moving forward should strive towards a more refined multi-method approach to further investigate climate change polarization and its conflict potential. A better understanding could benefit practitioners in many areas such as security and social policy, for strategic planning regarding climate change.","Climate Change; Polarization; Topic Modelling; Sentiment Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Because of this, municipalities have become more active in creating middle-segment housing, but most Dutch municipalities have few land positions which has urged them to create middle-segment housing in developments with no or low municipal landownership. The so-called passive land policy. However, this has proved difficult as there no longer are extensive national housing plans which were used in the past. In addition, Dutch municipalities do not have much knowledge on creating more middle-segment housing in developments with a passive land policy. Therefore, this thesis asks what land-use instruments exists in the Dutch passive land policy to create more middle-segment housing and how successful these instruments are in creating middle segment housing.<br/><br/>The passive land use instruments are within their relative typology the regulatory minimal percentages and eternal land lease, stimulating by anterior agreements, and communicational means by policy documents. When analysed it was found that these instruments are more often used in combination with each other. So, in implementation, this meant that some regulatory pressure was given on a developer to make them negotiate with the municipality. After this, the municipalities used stimuli to help create a financially feasible project with middle-segment housing and gave permits or sold (small portions of) land. Moreover, the policy documents were used more in advance to let any market party know what conditions were necessary to make the municipality cooperate with a plan.<br/><br/>Dutch municipalities thus influence the amount of middle-segment housing made by the passive land-use instruments used. Therefore, the municipality negotiated with market parties on projects in a context to create an agreement that is possible. In this several factors and actors played an important role. Most important for the agreement were the financial feasibility and the gaining of permits. The procedure for the permits started after the negotiations and the financial feasibility would be reached through the negotiations in which the municipalities stimulated in kind, by lowering other requirements, or by lowering taxes. The context could also play a role through an abundance of social housing in the area, political will, or land positions. There also seemed to be a correlation between more regulative instruments and less trust or a more strained relationship between the municipality and the developer in the network.<br","middle-segment housing; passive land policy; municipal housing policy; housing policy; wicked problem; governance network; land-use instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Making production plans for all these different products is challenging. One of the challenging aspects of making these production plans is choosing the right sequence of machines, to produce the desired intent. This is challenging due to three aspects: the large number of interdependent variables in the problem instances, the variability of machines, and the search for the best solution from a large set of valid solutions. In this thesis, we implement and evaluate the use of a domain-specific language (DSL) called RSX (Routing Space eXploration), to assist in choosing a sequence of machines. We do this together with an industrial partner. For RSX we use a model-driven approach, and it can be used to model the devices, production steps, and product properties of the digital printing domain. It transforms those into a constraint model described in the MiniZinc language, which is used as input for a constraint solver. We present the implementation of the RSX language and MiniZinc constraint model, and we evaluate the language coverage, accuracy, and performance. From these evaluations, we conclude that RSX can be used to model a number of cases, which were characteristic in the context of our industrial partner. Furthermore, we conclude that RSX can compile and solve the evaluated cases in the order of a few seconds and that the implementation is accurate, such that it can be used as a proof of concept.<br","digital printing systems; domain-specific language; Constraint Programming; Case Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Demand for housing has grown sharply in recent years. In the last two years, the housing market issue has been high on the political agenda again. In it, the issue of starters regarding home ownership occupies a prominent place.<br/>The importance of first-time buyers and the benefits of home ownership has therefore not remained underexposed. The inflow of ‘new’ households into the owner-occupied housing market not only stimulates movement but also provides the necessary liquidity. Partly due to quantitatives shortage, the position of first-time buyers is said to have continued to deteriorate. In the formulated housing policy, the quantitative housing demand is therefore emphatically central. Being able to realise the stated policy objectives - suitable and affordable housing for starters - depends on the demand exercised. Such policy requires accurate knowledge about the position occupied by first-time buyers in the (owner-occupied) housing market.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the (changing) position of first-time buyers in the Dutch housing market. The research question answered in this respect is: What is the position of first-time buyers in the Dutch housing market and how has this position developed from 2009 to 2021?<br/><br/>To arrive at this position, an insight needs to be gained into how first-time buyers operate on the housing market. For this, the ‘housing market’ needs to be explored first. Therefore, this research firstly discussed the background developments prior to the data analyses.<br/>The data research is divided into three parts. Firstly, the concept of ‘first-time buyer’ is explored in more detail whereby various profiles are identified. Next, the various distinct households are researched with respect to the demand for owner-occupied housing. Finally, a model-based analysis of housing market accessibility and success rates for these households is provided. The research results conclude to five main findings. Firstly, whereas the absolute market entrance declines lightly, the relative influx decreases sharply. The total demand for housing from both aspiring first-time buyers as well as homeowners has grown sharply. Secondly, the most current houses are not current, meaning the demanded housing is scarcely available in the most demanded regions. Thirdly, the results show that it is increasingly the high-potential households that find their way into the market. Fourth, the position of first-time buyers has been increasingly determined by the total competition, as the affordability seems not to be the issue. This is mainly rooted in low interest rates. Lastly, the general succes rate among first- time buyers decreased while the diversity among these households has increased.","first-time buyers; housing market; Netherlands; affordability; accessibility; succes rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); van Dam, Sonja (graduation committee); Aartsma, Yael (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","95 % of all the buildings in the Netherlands rely on natural gas for heat. But in just 30 years, all of these 7 million homes must have said goodbye to gas forever. A complex project, since the alternative to gas, is not a one size fits all solution. There are several options and their feasibility is highly dependent on the neighborhood context. Therefore, municipalities became responsible for the Dutch energy transition. In the earlier energy transition from coal to gas in the 1980s, there were clear economic benefits for residents. Now, despite the record-breaking gas prices, the long-term returns on investments are uncertain while there are many short-term inconveniences. <br/><br/>The technical side of the energy transition tends to overshadow the social dimension. The technical challenges are clear and the path to work on the viable solution is familiar since the municipalities have been in charge of similar infrastructure projects. The social transition, however, is highly dependent on the local situation and requires time. The municipalities have to become the spider that holds the web of stakeholders together to make this complex process work. To help municipalities stay in charge of the energy transition, Stroomversnelling developed Wijkkompas: a process management tool that guides municipalities from ‘Transitie Visie Warmte’ to ‘Wijk Uitvoerings Plan’. Wijkkompas helps municipalities balance the social and technical side of the transition. <br/><br/>On the social side of the transition, participation is a well-known factor that municipalities already take into account. The goal of participation is to make informed decisions together with residents through representation. However, through participation alone municipalities will not be able to reach all seven million households. Therefore the goal of this thesis is to effectively apply the social contagion method to the Wijkkompas tool since social contagion is a process in which the network in the neighborhood will take on the task of activating residents themselves. <br/><br/>Social contagion theory teaches us both information and behavior can be transmitted in a network. Each has its optimal way of traveling through the network and thus has an optimal seeding strategy. For the energy transition, the transmitting behavior with the snowball strategy can be very valuable. Holistically it would be best to separate the participation from the social contagion approach and run a parallel process. However, for the social transition, we rely on volunteers who are busy and scarce. Therefore we propose a six-step model that adequately combines both techniques for a successful neighborhood transition. <br/><br/>The biggest impact can be made when municipalities find the courage to try out this new activation method. The Lopend vuurtje box, designed in this project, uses the principles of social contagion to spread the method through the inter-municipal network. The box invites its receivers to try out the method for themselves through personal assignment, a small experiment, an educational flyer, and by becoming part of the Lopend vuurtje network by sending the box further along its journey through the Dutch municipal network.","Energy transition; Social contagion; Strategic Design; Built environment; Behaviour Change; Toolkit; Neighbourhood","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

To combat money laundering, banks use transaction monitoring models with particular thresholds to detect unusual transaction behaviour. However, it is a challenge to determine and evaluate the suitability of a threshold level to ensure that the risk of misclassification of transactions falls within the bank’s risk appetite. In the threshold tuning process, the suitability of a threshold level can be evaluated with a sample of the transactions below or above a threshold level which are reviewed by an analyst. One problem is that the review process of transactions during the threshold tuning process is timeconsuming. In addition, banks want to be able to quantify the risk of misclassification of transactions to determine whether this falls within their risk appetite. This underlines the need to develop a threshold tuning strategy to accelerate the threshold tuning process in which the risk of misclassification of transactions can be quantified to determine whether it falls within the bank’s risk appetite. To accelerate the threshold tuning process, a framework was developed and five threshold tuning strategies were established which evaluate the suitability of different threshold levels with a given strategy. In addition, several methods to determine a confidence interval were examined to quantify the risk of misclassification and to ensure that it falls within the bank’s risk appetite. The threshold tuning strategies were compared and evaluated on the required amount of reviews of transactions and the difference between the found and true threshold level using synthetic data sets. Overall, the bisection threshold tuning strategy is recommended, since this strategy resulted in the lowest number of required reviews of transactions and resulted in a small difference between the found and true threshold level. The results of the synthetic data sets were promising, but more experiments with preferably real transaction data or other distributions are required to further evolve and fully validate the framework and proposed bisection strategy. The work presented in this thesis contributed to a more risk-based approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the threshold tuning process of transaction monitoring models.","Sampling; Confidence intervals; Thresholds; Transaction monitoring models; Anti-Money Laundering; Back-testing; Sample size; Bootstrapping; Confusion matrix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Lantsoght, E.O.L. (graduation committee); Korswagen, Paul A. (graduation committee); Brok, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the rising demand for renewable energy sources the amount of wind turbines which are built on land are growing rapidly. Because of the repetitive nature of the foundation small design improvements can add up to large savings in material usage and building cost. The most critical part of the foundation is the connection between the metal mast and the concrete foundation. This connection is made by implementing an anchor cage. The application of an anchor cage results in complex multiaxial stresses in the surrounding area. Confinement plays a large role in the compressive strength of the concrete subjected to the partially loaded area created by the anchor flange. The main goal of this thesis is investigating the best way of modelling the concrete surrounding the anchor cage at confinement levels being present in the wind turbine foundation. This is done by investigating the theory regarding confinement and the effects of it. But also the way this is captured by analytical models. To make a comparison between DIANA and the analytical models the present stress situation in the wind turbine foundation is analysed. Looking at the stress distribution and the confinement levels. Next a comparison of the ideal case of confinement is made. This is later expanded to a larger scale model, to compare the effects of confinement. The confinement present will enhance the concrete strength and strain properties. The concrete specimen can resist larger loads and reacts more ductile. These properties are captured in analytical confinement models, these are compared to the way DIANA approaches confinement. The anchor rods between the anchor flanges are prestressed, this prestressing results in a permanent stress situation. Within this stress situation there is a small part beneath the anchor flange subjected to confinement. With increasing pressure, originating from the moment load which results from the wind on the tower and it’s blades, the confined area increases to the top half of the foundation. With significant confinement in the pedestal. Comparing the DIANA compressive behaviour models with the analytical confinement models and experimental data within a one element model. It is seen that compressive behaviour models do react on the confinement. Although they show a lower peak strength than the analytical models. A larger difference is noted in the underestimation of the peak strain. This difference in outcomes is the result of the different approaches between DIANA and the analytical models. As well as some assumptions that DIANA makes concerning the strength and strain increase factor. The Parabolic compressive curve is most suitable for modelling the confinement in this ideal case. A case study is conducted to further investigate how the confinement is represented in a total non-linear model. Modelling the top part of the foundation and checking the effect that confinement has on this model. For this model the prestressing of the anchor rods is increased until failure. Without confinement the concrete elements directly beneath the anchor flange fail in compression. Running the model with confinement it is noticed that the underlying weaker concrete is failing in compression first. This is the result of the confinement being present surrounding the anchor flange. The model with confinement is also able to resist a 30% larger load than the model without confinement. The parabolic compression curve is the most suitable curve currently available inside the strain based crack model for modelling the effects of confinement. Overall DIANA is able to capture the effects of confinement well enough to see the positive effects in the case study. Due to limitations in the analyses performed and in their interpretations, it is not possible to give an unequivocal answer on the effect of confinement within the foundation of the wind turbine.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

The main problem with this approach is that these types of additional information have poor coverage of the data being analyzed.<br/><br/>I propose to use a type of information that I call <i>dataset domain terms</i>. These are terms, or data values, that represent the domain of a dataset.

The problem of poor coverage can also be mitigated by only discovering datasets for the domain represented by these dataset domain terms.

The accuracy of the dataset discovery technique is also shown to be comparable to state-of-the-art dataset discovery techniques, though its precision is lacking.<br/><br/>This makes it highly suitable to filter datasets before other dataset discovery techniques can be performed on them. The data from these filtered datasets should also have a limited range of domains.

Instead, they move forward by sending travelling deformations along their soft bodies. Inspired by these animals, we present a soft robot that uses a sequence of deformations for locomotion. This sequence of deformations is driven by a row of vibrating actuators that vibrate with the same frequency but a phase shift between each consecutive actuator. The metachronal wave arising from this vibration pattern offers efficient locomotion due to the continuous movement of the robot. The top speed achieved in this research was 5 mm/s for both forward and backward locomotion. Our study shows how the robot’s locomotion capabilities are affected by its material and how the robot's velocity depends on the mechanical design and the properties of the metachronal wave and provides a next step into soft robots that can efficiently move almost anywhere.","Soft Robotics; Locomotion; Metachronal Waves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The three primary light colours and a volume diffuser will be used to detect the edge of an object levitating on an air-bearing table. One building block of a bigger system is used that consists of one receiving fibre in the centre surrounded by three transmitting fibres, with each transmitting one primary light colour. Various experiments were executed to find a range where the object edge can be detected. The transition range for horizontal and vertical movement is found. The backscattering of light within the volume diffuser turned out to be much larger than thought. This backscattering causes a small light intensity range. Also, some disruptions in the emitted light caused no logical transition ranges. A model is made to see what happens to the transition ranges when the disruptions are eliminated. The red transmitting fibre is investigated to see the individual contribution to the light intensity received in the receiving fibre. The transition range got from that measurement is translated into the transition range for the green and blue transmitting fibres. Through interpolating the ranges, a total measurement range is found where the object edge can be detected at whatever angle the object is positioned.

It has been shown that the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm can achieve robust control of a CS-25 certified aircraft and has the generalization power to react to failure scenarios. Traditional DRL approaches, such as the state-of-the-art SAC algorithm struggle with inconsistent learning in high-dimensional tasks and fall short of modelling uncertainty and risk in the environment. In contrast, distributional RL algorithms estimate the entire probability distribution of rewards, improve the learning characteristics and enable the synthesis of risk- sensitive policies. This paper demonstrates the improved learning characteristics of distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC) compared to traditional SAC and discusses the benefits of risk-sensitive learning applied to flight control.

Model-based control requires an accurate model description of the dynamical system to reassure the performance of the controller. Conventionally, this model description is retrieved from first-principles modelling which can be problematic if the system consists of high-order and/or time-varying dynamics. In these applications, ML methods may benefit because of their promising potential to model complicated system behaviour from data. In the field of ML methods for the modelling and control of dynamical systems, Gaussian processes (GPs) form an interesting opportunity. The ability of GPs to directly learn nonlinear system dynamics prevents huge costs and/or efforts when modelling complex systems. GP dynamical models are capable of accurately predicting the behaviour of dynamical systems while also measuring the confidence level of the prediction. For making predictions, GPs do not require huge amounts of data which benefits them over other ML methods.<br/><br/>The powerful model predictive control (MPC) and the fully data-driven dynamical modelling capabilities of GPs makes their combination an interesting candidate for sophisticated control systems. MPC has advantages over other control methods since the controller allows operational constraints that provide freedom in controller design or prevent the system to be steered in an infeasible direction, and, the controller is easily extendable to nonlinear and multivariable control. Next to this, an MPC controller is naturally modified to incorporate GP dynamical models (GP-MPC). The GP-MPC controller exploits the GP dynamical model for making predictions over the prediction horizon while it is also possible to incorporate the confidence of the predictions for increased robustness of the controller. Whereas GP-MPC is studied extensively as an augmented model for other modelling techniques, fully data-driven GP-MPC approaches are also deemed to be promising.<br/><br/>This thesis considers the use of GPs for learning and modelling dynamic systems for incorporation in a realtime MPC application. The dynamic system studied in this thesis is a double pendulum system in both a simulation and a real-world environment. The simulation provides initial insights into the problem and allows the rapid development of an algorithm. Eventually, the proposed realtime GP-MPC algorithm is tested on a physical laboratory-scale setup. The results show that the realtime data-driven controller is able to track a reference with high accuracy, while also being robust to disturbances. These promising results on GPs for realtime nonlinear control might be a step for GPs to be incorporated into future control systems.","Machine learning; Gaussian processes; Control; Model predictive control; Dynamical systems; Realtime control; Stochastic models; Double pendulum; Stochastic control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Moreover, methods are proposed to suppress cardiac activity from electrical impedance tomography and esophageal pressure recordings.","Mechanical ventilation; PEEP; EIT; Esophageal pressure; Empirical Mode Decomposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The dilemma: simply ramping up housing production fails to solve the problem, as common methods of construction and project development repeatedly prove to be socially and environmentally unsustainable. <br/><br/>Transit Village explores a variety of approaches that rethink the status quo and integrates them into a sustainable neighborhood development at the “Rail Junction East Arnhem”. The centrally located site remains largely untouched by city planning and is characterized by its transitional use through diverse groups. Rather than relocating these groups to make space for development, a Community Land Trust gives community members and future residents agency to develop land according to shared values. The result is an urban framework, that builds new connections to the city fabric and nature areas, that creates recreational spaces for the city population, and whose walkability enables a circular neighborhood economy. Within the urban framework, residents can even make use of building plots before building operations are carried out.<br/><br/>Buildings are co-created with a circular building system that embraces change. A high grade of prefabrication and remountability reduces construction and demolition waste and speeds up production and assembly. Modularity facilitates a gradual transition from low to high density and allows density adjustments in the future. A catalog of flexible partition and facade components empowers residents to customize apartment size and function according to their current needs. In this way, buildings can adapt to changing resident requirements, and building lifespans are considerably extended.<br/><br/>Refurbishment and recycling of unused building components are handled by a locally run Material Hub that creates work opportunities in the district of Presikhaaf, which has a high unemployment rate. The resulting circular material ecosystem is fueled by a new financial model where residents subscribe to apartment configurations instead of renting a predefined apartment, thereby financing maintenance and circulation of materials in small monthly installments. <br/><br/>To evaluate which design choices would lead to building components with high performance in such a Product as a Service environment, a decision-support tool for designers was developed in the Thematic Research Paper. Therefore, Residual Value Forecasting models from the car leasing industry were analyzed, and design parameters were extracted that can make statements about the residual value of different interior partition wall types. The parameters were organized in a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis that is capable of ranking designs regarding their grade of durability and remountability. The tool seeks to help designers choose component designs that will create low maintenance costs, that are in use longer, and where the residual value of materials becomes accessible at the end of their useful life.<br","Co-ownership; Circularity; Remountability; Design for Disassembly; Residual Value; Product as a Service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","51.98303889998031, 5.934885202897618"

(mentor); Mai Van, C. (graduation committee); Rutten, M.M. (graduation committee); Bos, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Sea level variations and storm surges are expected to increase as a result of climate change. 570 cities and some 800 million people are by 2050 estimated to be exposed to these phenomena when emissions do not decrease (UCCRN, 2018). It is, however, deeply uncertain if and to what extent emissions will decrease. Additionally, the effects of climate change are not fully understood due to its complexity, resulting in a wide range of uncertainty. Flood risk measures can be implemented to reduce flood risk. The economic evaluation of such measures is affected by other factors of uncertain nature such as economic growth. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach has been identified as an approach capable of identifying and implementing effective flood risk strategies under uncertain conditions (Haasnoot et al., 2013). This approach aims to provide decision-makers with insight into what action to take when. Simultaneously, the approach focuses on ensuring flexibility which facilitates adjustments to unforeseen conditions. Within this approach, so-called adaptation pathways need to be developed. These pathways describe a sequence of actions over time required to ensure a minimum level of flood safety. The DAPP approach has been applied to simplified cases in previous research, but not yet to more detailed master-planning for which the creation and economic evaluation of pathways is a not straightforward process. This results in the main research question of this thesis:<br/><br/>How can the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach be used to create and select effective flood risk strategies under highly uncertain conditions?<br/><br/>This research question has been addressed by developing a framework capable of creating adaptation pathways and evaluating them with an incorporated scenario-based economic evaluation. This framework is supplemented with a probabilistic assessment that evaluates the performance of pathways in the full range of possible but uncertain futures. The use of these tools has afterwards been validated by applying them to a fictive case and a case study along the South East Coast of Singapore. The framework can be used to assess the sensitivity of uncertainties. Additionally, it can be used to obtain the conditions for which a different pathway turns out to be more effective. Damages corresponding to certain water levels are required as input and are used to build the damage function of a specific project area. These damages can be modelled with damage modules like the Global Flood Risk Tool (GFRT). The damage function and other basic information like dimensions and characteristics of the project area are used to perform an economic optimisation of individual measures. A selection of adaptation pathways (consisting of combinations of measures over time) is made based on prerequisites and a scenario-based evaluation. The scenario-based evaluation is supplemented with a probabilistic assessment as the use of scenarios might lead to cognitive biases and does not cover the full range of future possibilities (Hoffmann, 2017). This probabilistic assessment is conducted by means of a Monte Carlo simulation and can be used to evaluate the robustness of pathways in the full range of possible futures. A pathway can afterwards be selected and trigger values that should initiate the implementation of subsequent measures can be obtained via the framework. <br/><br/>The developed method has first been applied to a fictive case. A small area with a standard damage function was assumed for this. After the framework had been validated, the input-conditions were altered to assess the individual influence of each uncertain input value. The outcome turned out to be dependent on the characteristics of the project area and the assumed conditions. An increased area resulted in a pathway with a flood wall instead of a landfill as first measure being most effective. Out of the uncertainties, the discount rate and socio-economic growth rate turned out to most significantly affect the Net Present Value (NPV) and Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR) of flood risk strategies. Especially, low discount rates and high socio-economic growth rates resulted in pathways built up of individual measures with lifetimes exceeding the technical lifetime of measures. To prevent this, and to ensure a flexible approach, the lifetimes of individual measures were restricted. A flexible approach enables one to adjust to conditions other than those that have been assumed. Measures with a long lifetime ahead lead to bigger investment costs and these are irreversible when the conditions turn out to be less severe than anticipated. The contrary also turned out to be possible. These short lifetimes corresponding to measures with practically infeasible low heights were prevented by setting a minimum height at which the linear relationship between the height and costs of measures starts. The probabilistic assessment was conducted after a pathway was selected. Increasing the range of uncertainty for this pathway logically led to a wider range of possible outcomes. This wider range of outcomes can be a reason not to select a certain pathway as the probability of a low NPV is higher. The fact that this difference could not be observed in the outcome of the framework underlines the need for this probabilistic assessment. Finally, trigger values were set for the selected pathway of the fictive case. The trigger values were initially set for the planned subsequent measures. However, it could be observed that the obtained trigger value for the planned subsequent flood wall increment did not result in sufficient time to implement a storm surge barrier without dropping below the required minimum level of flood safety. Therefore, trigger values corresponding to the next planned subsequent measure could potentially lead to the exclusion of other possible subsequent measures. Instead of setting trigger values for the planned subsequent measures, trigger values should provide enough time for all possible subsequent measures to forestall the exclusion of possible measures and ensure flexibility.<br/><br/>The findings from the fictive case led to adjustments of the framework to ensure practical feasibility and flexibility. The adjusted framework was afterwards applied to a real-life case along the South East Coast of Singapore characterised by a narrow water level distribution, i.e. a relatively small difference (∼15 centimeters) between water levels that differ a factor of 10 in return period. A storm surge barrier turned out to be a factor of 10 more costly than alternative solutions, irrespective of the assumed sea level rise scenario. Therefore, it was concluded that the storm surge barrier was not the desired flood risk reduction measure for the project area and the area was subdivided into smaller areas to further optimise the flood risk reduction strategy. The framework was used to create flood risk reduction strategies. No measures turned out to be required until 2092 for the assumed conditions. The sensitivity analysis of this case study showed that assuming a more severe sea level rise scenario (an additional 58 centimeters in 2100) and accounting for additional storm surge caused by climate change, could result in measures being required over 50 years earlier. Without taking this into account, two pathways turned out to satisfy the safety standards until 2200 for the assumed conditions. One pathway solely consists of a flood wall and subsequently flood wall increments (AP10) while dryproofing is the first measure of the other pathway and subsequently a flood wall and a flood wall increment are implemented (AP33). The costs of AP10 turned out to be slightly higher in the full range of futures than that of AP33 but the probability of obtaining a higher NPV than obtained from the framework was also higher (58% vs. 51% of the outcomes higher than the NPV of AP10 obtained in the framework). As the differences between the probabilistic assessments of the pathways are not substantial, the preferences of local stakeholders are even more important. Dryproofing can lead to inundation of the land for high water events with a return period lower than the safety standard while Singapore has set the goal to protect its coastlines and prevent inundation of the land. Therefore, the pathway consisting of a flood wall and flood wall increments turns out to be the most suitable solution for the project area.<br/><br/>This research contributes to the existing knowledge related to the DAPP approach as it smooths the not straightforward process of creating and evaluating adaptation pathways under uncertain conditions. It showed how to economically optimise individual flood risk reduction measures and build adaptation pathways out of those measures. A framework has been developed to automate this process and instantly evaluate the effectiveness of such pathways for set conditions. This study also showed how a probabilistic assessment of these adaptation pathways could be used to select a robust flood risk strategy. This developed method can further be fine-tuned by including transfer costs that reflect the costs of maintaining flexibility in the face of deep uncertainty. Additionally, flexibility can be incorporated within the probabilistic assessment to enable alteration of type and/or height of subsequent measures for conditions different than assumed. This would result in a more accurate assessment. Automating the integration of the probabilistic assessment within the framework can eventually lead to one complete tool which enhances the applicability and allows for the probabilistic assessment of all pathways instead of just a selection of pathways.","Uncertainty; DAPP; Flood risk; Sea level rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The results showed that the optimal pre-treatment for the fine glass dust was a heat-treatment at 600∘C for 1 hour combined with a grinding treatment of 1 hour. The heat-treatment was efficient in removing the organic compounds from the fine glass dust and the grinding treatment was efficient in reducing the particle size of the fine glass dust. The second part of this thesis investigated the influence of different cement replacement percentages by pre-treated fine glass dust in cementitious mixtures. Results showed that higher FGD percentages resulted in a reduction in compressive strength. However at longer curing ages (between 28 and 90 days) a small increase in strength development was observed. This could be attributed to the pozzolanic activity of the fine glass dust, which caused secondary strength development at later curing ages. It was also shown that significant amounts of secondary products were formed in the mixture with 25% FGD, which caused volume instability of the mixture. For the mixture with 10% FGD no volume instability was observed. The third part of this thesis investigated the suitability of pre-treated fine glass dust for 3D Concrete Printing using the set-on-demand printing technique. For the mixture with 50% FGD in the cementitious mixtures it was found that a superplasticizer (SP) dosage of 0.4% was sufficient to develop a pumpable cementitious mixture. For the mixture with 20% FGD, this SP dosage was found to be 0.35%. As a combination of cementitious mixture with an accelerator slurry with 10% and 8% CaCl2, Mix FGD50- SP0.35-Acc10% and FGD20-SP0.35-Acc8% provided promising results in terms of fast stiffness and strength development. Due to volume instability of the FGD50 mixture, only mix FGD20-SP0.35-Acc8% was tested on printability. This mixture proved to be printable with a nozzle moving speed of 3600 mm/min and a time interval between layers of 18.8 seconds. Therefore a 20% replacement of Portland cement with fine glass dust could be used to develop a printable cementitious mixture for 3DCP. The fourth part of this thesis discussed the applicability of the developed mixture in practice. A concrete bus shelter was used as a case study and it was shown that the mixture developed enough strength to withstand the stresses of the designed structure. The developed mixture FGD20-SP0.35- Acc8% was promising for implementation in 3DCP in terms of sustainable development of the concrete industry and as a new utilization of a byproduct from the glass recycling industry","3D concrete printing; Sustainability; Circularity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A Variational Autoencoder is trained to generate new mesh tessellations and a Surrogate Model is used to predict the structural performance of the decoded designs. Finally, a Gradient Descent Algorithm searches the latent space of the Variational Autoencoder for optimum solutions. <br/>The results show that the proposed Artificial Intelligence workflow is able to generate novel and structurally better performing solutions that those existing in the training dataset.

Without the Rhine, the Ruhr area and the port of Rotterdam wouldn’t have developed into the economically leading industrial regions they are today. The economic power of the Rhine comes forward from the ability of humans to control the river. By rectifying and canalizing the river and constructing dams and locks, the ships’ ability to navigate the river increased. This focus on economic development has caused critical environmental problems. Floods, droughts, and pollution are the most notable environmental threats to humans. This is intensified by climate change as extreme rainfall events and periods of drought will become more severe. Our current paradigm in flood risk management tells us to endlessly keep heightening our dykes, which is not a sustainable path to deal with flood risk. Heightening dykes also leads to shifting the problems elsewhere. If a river is not given space to flood its natural floodplains, it is forced to flow downstream more quickly, leading to a higher peak water level and potential floods downstream. <br/><br/>This master thesis introduces the concepts of socio-ecological symbiosis and clearance as means to improve water safety, the connection between humans and water, and the natural habitat. The central question of this research is: How could water safety downstream be supported by upstream design interventions in the Northern Upper Rhine Valley, based on methods in which socio-ecological symbiosis and clearance are central? As upstream water management strongly influences the downstream water safety, design exercises are executed in the Northern Rhine Valley with the goal to improve the water safety both downstream and locally. Three typological design exercises are set up which together form the proposed future water management strategy of the whole Rhine Valley.","Socio-ecological symbiosis; Clearance; Upstream-downstream interdependencies; Rhine basin; Water safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","",""

The economic advantages of transporting hydrogen in its original, molecular form via pipelines rather than relying simply on the electric transmission grid are connected to the amount of energy that needs to be transported – the pipeline transportation usually requiring larger upfront investment but operating with lower unit costs.

Simply balancing and offering more space for fauna and flora in the cities, the biodiversity can take its path of growing again, not only that, but combining a set of strategies could likewise be used to improve the life quality in the cities, managing weather and lessening the weather stress, and by that, mitigating the effects of the climate changes. <br/><br/><br","nature based solutions; Nature inclusive design; Sustainable development; Climate Design; climate adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

This sensorial overstimulation brought and still brings potential unsustainable health and well-being effects on its urban participants. <br/><br/>This research explores the redefinition and mapping of city intensities and follows the process of creating an urban sensescape through different scale levels in London. The root of the problem lies in the experience of city intensities as perceived by the senses of its drifting participants. It appears that there is an imbalance between vibrant public spaces and more tranquil public spaces in the contemporary city of London. This disparity in space, together with the ocular-centric view of society, will result in an imbalance in the sensory systems of its drifters and thus a disregard for their bodies and senses. This research is guided by the following main question:<br/><br/>How can the design of a sensescape in the urban public realm evoke an inclusive, embodied, and multi-sensory experience for its participants, achieving balance in the perceived city intensities?<br/><br/>The implementation of a sensescape in the urban public realm could create an inclusive, embodied, and multi-sensory experience in order to curate a balance within the vibrant and tranquil public spaces on the spectrum of city intensities. The design recommendations made through the different scales will constitute a critical reframing of architectural design concerning an user experience (UX) centered society within the urban public realm of London or other large cities in economically developed countries. This will allow the overemphasis on the intellectual, aesthetic, and conceptual aspects of architecture to disappear, making room for the tactile, sensual, and embodied essence of architecture to emerge. The knowledge gap between the built environment and its impact on society is being narrowed by designing for the balance between vibrant and tranquil public spaces with a sensorial and empirical design approach.<br/><br/>The foundation for future research and design into the interdisciplinary link between psychology, urban design, and inclusive sensory architecture is laid by this thesis in which the city intensities of London are being curated with and for the senses.","City intensities; Multi-sensory stimuli; Public realm; Embodiment; Inclusive; Urban rhythm; Drifting; Ocularcentrism; London","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.504338, -0.092244"

(mentor); Hansen, B.L. (mentor); Parravicini, M. (mentor); Rosbottom, D.J. (mentor); De Vocht, S. (mentor); Pimlott, Mark (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the pressing issues that arise from a society driven and measured by flow of capital and wealth, the future of the National Bank of Belgium and its role to society is questioned as most of its functions are becoming digital or being relocated. A monumental building, representing an institution in an extremely relevant capital, presents itself as a great case study towards establishing and strengthening social relations, communities and identity in a city. Thus the project of redeveloping the National Bank of Belgium has taken a much wider scale. It is not only concerned about the working spaces and architectural quality within the bank building but most importantly, it focuses on what the National Bank of Belgium brings to the citizens of Brussels, opening up as an institution that welcomes the city. <br/><br/>After investigating the city of Brussels from its urban aspect, demographics and turbulent history, the location of the National Bank of Belgium appears as a void when compared to its surrounding areas: it is not inhabited by its citizens (in fact it was taken from them) but by empty buildings and offices. <br/>The project thus deals not only with the brief of the office and the renovation of the bank, but with the meaning a National Bank can have towards the city it resides in, changing the urban fabric by welcoming a new public in a rather segregated block, contaminating it and allowing for inhabitation to take place. <br/>However, before dwellings can be built and the neighbourhood inhabited, there has to be infrastructure. <br/>In addition to the urban investigation that pointed at the relevance of educational and cultural buildings in residential areas, the case studies of the Kanal Pompidou and the sportshall Amal Amjahid, both in the city of Brussels, strengthen the argument of how those specific public functions can be used to contaminate areas that have become a void in the city. It is by framing and supporting social interaction among a diverse mix of users and programs, the buildings with cultural and educational functions act as a beginning of urban change. <br/>Nevertheless, it is not only a matter of programmatic change. Introducing public life in a building that was made to intimidate and keep outsiders away requires a constant switch between all the scales and alternating between design and research.<br/>Thus the main point of the project was to change the message of the National Bank of Belgium towards its citizens, becoming a provider of knowledge through education and culture, and most importantly, playing a main role as the beginning of urban change where the block would transition from being a void in the city to an inhabited neighbourhood. <br/>This transition was done by taking into consideration three instruments: social, organizational and representational.<br/>The social instrument: Before inhabitation can take place, publicness has to be perceived, therefore it was important to add porosity and vulnerability to the bank building, opening up for new users. Although each part of the building has a very specific use, the way that people are distributed and oriented through the building has no hierarchy, with all the different target groups circulating in the same way, through a periphery that goes through the building.<br/>The organizational instrument: The idea of periphery comes from the German architect Fritz Neumeyer who argues that every public space should have a center and a periphery, thus allowing for passive public life to take place, where people are allowed to simply observe. <br/>The representational instrument: Nevertheless, this was done by respecting the current language of the bank and not diminishing the building. Although completely new functions are added, the main architecture approach is to destroy as little as possible, reusing most of the building and simply direct the users, changing the current circulation and adding a periphery zone to the building.Finally, all those ideas culminate at the end of the building, where a new exhibition hall is added, showcasing to the city not only what the new National Bank of Belgium is capable of, but who the new groups of people that are inhabiting it are. <br/><br/>All those points were taken into consideration in every scale, ranging from programmatic decisions to changes to the façade, reinterpreting objects and following the language of the tiling material found in the building. <br/>The framework of the studio where the conciliation between research and design, urban to interior could not be more appropriate to such a complex project, adding a sense of reality that is usually absent in other academic projects. Nevertheless, perhaps it was exactly this complexity and lack of time that proved to be extremely overwhelming at some points. It is not only a tremendously large building but actually three different characters that are put together in one block and now have to change completely. This made me wonder many times whether this project would have been better if done in groups of 3 students, perhaps this way it would have been possible to think through all of its complexity. <br","Renovation; Brussels; bank; Public interior; Educational architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","",""

(mentor); Aguilar Lopez, J.P. (graduation committee); Rikkert, S.J.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Under the current climate change projections, droughts and extreme rainfall events are becoming more common and intense. During sustained droughts, soil cracks can develop in the topsoil of a dike. These soil cracks can enhance the infiltration and drainage of the dike, affecting the dike stability. This study’s main objective is to better understand the potential influence of cracks on the hydrology and dike stability of canal dikes. A finite element model (FEM) was built to study the hydrological response and stability of a canal dike due to rainfall infiltration through a uniformly distributed cracked top layer. This model included the fast hydrological response of the fractures and their exchange with the soil. A surrogate model (a simplified data-driven machine learning model) was built using training data generated by the FEM to reduce the computational burden and allow for a sensitivity and stochastic reliability assessment. An evaluation of important model features, such as the connectivity among cracks and soil swelling, revealed that the cracks have a very localized influence on the infiltration and drainage of water through the dike. Water drainage in the toe of the dike is restricted by soil swelling resulting in a larger decline in dike stability. The sensitivity analysis found that the cracks facilitate more infiltration than drainage before the crack parameters, such as the crack aperture and the amount of cracking, reached a threshold. Above this threshold, drainage provided by the cracks is greater than the infiltration. The failure probability was calculated for a variety of different rainfall patterns. A pattern where the rainfall intensity incrementally increases over time results in the highest failure probability. The main conclusion from this study is that soil cracks influence the stability of the dike by enhancing infiltration and drainage under rainfall. Under low-intensity rainfall, the cracks in the toe facilitate more water to drain out of the dike than rainfall to infiltrate, stabilizing the dike. However, in the absence of cracks in the toe, the cracks provide more infiltration than drainage resulting in a lower dike stability. Under high-intensity rainfall, cracks in the crest and the inner slope of a dike advance the wetting front resulting in a larger decline in dike stability than a dike without soil cracks. Rainfall infiltration and drainage in a cracked dike depend on both rainfall characteristics, such as the average rainfall intensity, duration, and pattern, and the crack features, such as the crack width, amount of cracking, and the connectivity of the cracks. Since this study was not validated with observations, it is recommended that further studies aim to validate the observed influence of the cracks by conducting field experiments.","Cracks; Macro-stability; Dikes; Droughts; Safety assessment; Surrogate model; Preferential flow; Rainfall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-11-07","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This report proposes a strategy to develop a circular business model for Feelou, a company that has worked on a sustainable pregnancy bra. The circular business model aims to improve the lifespan of the bra and reduce resource usage. This report consists of a research phase and a conceptualisation phase. The research phase explores the current industry and the challenges for the resource flows in the circular business model. The conceptualisation phase aims to solve the challenges that are found in the research phase, resulting in a roadmap for development of a circular business model.<br/>The main challenges for a sustainable company in the current clothing industry are competing with greenwashing companies and finding sustainable alternatives for currently common practices, as the industry is a long way from becoming sustainable. Three paradoxes describe the dilemmas that Feelou faces in launching a circular business model for their bra.<br/>Firstly, the Business model paradox shows that a sales model would be easier for Feelou and the customer. However, it would be less sustainable than a lease model, in which Feelou would keep ownership of the product. Secondly, the Perceived hygiene paradox is an important challenge for the reuse of bras: many women find pre-loved bras unappealing, however this is influenced by familiarity with the previous owner. Finally, the Circular impact paradox considers the scale versus quality of impact. Doing it perfectly mostly means doing it on a smaller scale, which affects overall impact. To grow, concessions need to be made.<br/>The Butterfly Diagram (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013) inspired the Resource flow diagram (RFD), a model that was used to explore possibilities for a circular business model. The analysis showed that Feelou should focus on the inner loops as this is where Feelou has a direct influence. The main challenge in the inner loops lies in the Perceived hygiene paradox. As a lease model creates many additional challenges, a sales model is pursued in the conceptualisation phase.<br/>The conceptualisation phase started with a co-creation session with the target group. Many solutions were provided by the participants, noteworthy findings include: accompanying the product by a letter that describes the ideal life cycle of the bra, emphasising the value of sustainable behaviour as the reward itself and a focus on positive communication. <br/>The RFD exploration and brainstorm provided enough material to fill in the service blueprint, providing an overview of the circular business model and its components. An interesting insight of the service blueprint is that Feelou can inspire customers to treat the bra sustainably on three different moments: during sale, during use and after use. <br/><br/>The business model canvas provided insight into the main challenge for the selection of the target group and value proposition: the dual focus on comfort and sustainability in the branding of Feelou. Further exploration through the brand DNA shows that this dual focus actually provides a competitive advantage. The comfort aspect focuses on the individual, while the sustainability aspect focuses on society and the planet, resulting in a branding strategy that is more resilient than comfort or sustainability alone would be.<br/>The final deliverable, a roadmap helps to put all ideas and sides of the circular business model into perspective over time. It splits the development into the startup phase, the scale up phase and finally the ideal model. It provides a toolbox of resources that can be used to set up the circular business model and let it grow towards the next phase.<br","Circular economy (CE); Circular Business Model; Sustainability; Clothing; Startup","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is portrayed by the amount of complaints that the Nationale Ombudsman received about municipal actions which have increased with 15% in 2021 in comparison to 2020.<br/><br/>An opportunity to make room for the citizens’ perspective is to apply the design expertise in the policy-making process. Since design has shifted towards Human-Centered Design in combination with co-creative practices, it has become highly suitable in addressing the challenges that municipalities face (Norman, 2013; Camacho, 2016). Consequently, Human-Centered Design has become valuable in the context of policy-making, because of its tools and methods which can carefully consider the human perspective throughout the policy-making proces. <br/><br/>Together with the municipality of The Hague, a project was set up to research how the design team contributes to human-centered policy-making in collaboration with policy and policy execution experts. The research revealed that some challenges arise within the collaboration between designers and experts. Among these challenges are the fact that the working procedures of designers and experts are diametrically opposed to each other, and that the true value that design offers is not entirely seen within the municipality. Therefore, the design vision for this project is that before designers can take on a larger role in policy-making and add human-centered value to policy-making at the municipality of the Hague, policy and policy execution experts need to truly understand and see the added value of applying design.<br/><br/>The insights from the research have led to the design of the Ontwerpwijzer, a conversation tool which aims to build a bridge between the two worlds of design and policy-making and to guide the collaboration in its early stages. The Ontwerpwijzer is used during the intake meeting, in which the details of the project and potential contributions of the designer are discussed. Consequently, this forms an interesting opportunity to show why, what and when design has something valuable to offer to the policy-making process.","Human-Centeredness; Policy-making; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, research has given contradictory statements about the effects of such a reduction of trust on the human’s trustworthiness, i.e. human’s characteristics that make them more or less reliable to the automation. As such, this study investigates how automation failure in a human-automation teamwork scenario affects the human’s trust in the automation and human’s trustworthiness towards the automation. We present a between-subjects controlled experiment in which the participants perform a simulated task in a 2D grid-world, collaborating with an automation in a “moving-out” scenario. During the experiment, we measure the participants’ trust and trustworthiness regarding the automation both subjectively and objectively. Our results show that automation failure negatively affects the human’s trustworthiness, as well as their trust in and liking of the automation. Learning the effects of automation failure in trust and trustworthiness can contribute to a better understanding of the nature and dynamics of trust in these teams, foreseeing undesirable consequences and improving human-automation teamwork.","Artificial intelligence; human factors; Trust development; Trustworthiness; trustworthy AI; trust in technology; human trustworthiness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","",""

Massive new amounts are planned to be built in the face of the climate and energy crisis. The current state-of-the-art type-4 Wind Turbines (WT) uses a Fully Rated Converter (FRC) to decouple the rotor speed from the grid frequency. In recent years this type of WT has been involved in so-called sub-synchronous events. The Grid Side Converter (GSC) of the FRC is very similar to other Inverter Based Generation (IBG) such as: Photovoltaics (PV), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and HVDC-links. As this research is focused on the GSC, it is very relevant to the integration of other Renewable Energy Resources (RES) as well.<br/>This thesis investigates Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction (SSCI), a relatively new phenomenon. The GSC interacts with the grid, which can cause a Sub-Synchronous Oscillation SSO, an oscillation below the system's fundamental frequency. This oscillation can lead to damage, increased components wear or triggering protection systems. After different facets of SSCI are discussed, a new solution is put forward in this thesis. By feeding wide area Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU)-based measurements into the control system of the WT, an algorithm is constructed to mitigate SSCI. This algorithm is tested on the ability to mitigate sub-synchronous event risks.<br/><br/>First, a WT model is selected in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory software to recreate sub-synchronous behaviour. This model is tested in the weak radial grid. The influence of the different control parameters on the sub-synchronous behaviour is investigated and comped to literature studies. Different tools are used for this research. PowerFactory is used for small signal analysis to obtain a linear dynamic model of the system. RMS-time simulations are used to test the oscillatory behaviour of the system. These results are further analysed using eigen-analysis on the linear model and Fourier and Prony analysis on the time simulations.<br/>Then, the same WT-model is implemented in a modified IEEE-39 bus system to see the behaviour of SSO propagation in a transmission network. The results are compared to an analytical method to determine voltage oscillations based on mode shapes. However, as SSCI has a fundamentally different driving force, this method is not valid in this case. In the same transmission network, the influence of grid operations is tested. Different variations are tested: the connection point, power output of the WT, grid loading and disconnection of nearby connections. As all these features can vary during normal operation, it is vital to understand better which circumstances increase the risk of SSO event.<br/><br/>At last, using the knowledge obtained, a new control algorithm is proposed. This algorithm uses wide-area voltage angle measurements. These measurements can be provided by PMUs. A remote signal is fed into the control system. Minimal modifications are made to the control system for this. Additional damping is performed on the local voltage reference angle depending on the movement of the remote signal. This prevents the initialisation of SSCI. This implementation of a WAMC is tested using eigen-analysis and time simulations and shows promising results.<br/><br/>The results of this thesis research are also modelled in the NextGen GridOps Framework of DNV. The framework aims to stimulate a fast deployment of the finding of this thesis research in the field. This is accomplished by sharing knowledge in an accessible, structured environment. This allows taking the findings into consideration for solving the complex problems encountered by transmission and distribution system operators.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-07","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","wind",""

(mentor); van Keulen, A. (mentor); den Besten, J.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to the growing quest for renewable energy, wind turbines grow in size. This means that higher demands are posed on the transporting structures, also called tower grillages, which brings its challenges for their design. The fact that the structures considered in this thesis are placed on a ship makes the design even more complicated. Therefore, a procedure is developed in this thesis that is able to optimize a tower grillage, while keeping the underlying ship intact. This tool is based on a combination of size and shape optimization.<br/><br/>The optimization is performed with the dual annealing algorithm. The objective is mass reduction, with the stress in the grillage, and stress and buckling in the ship as constraints. These constraints are taken into account by a penalty function. The design variables are the angles at which the radial supports attach and the thicknesses of the radial supports and the other elements of the grillage. The main question that is answered in this thesis is how this optimization procedure can help in the design of a tower grillage, where the underlying ship structure is implemented as a boundary condition.<br/><br/>First, a single layout is optimized with the ship modelled as a rigid boundary condition. Next, a model of a section of the ship is made and used as the boundary condition on the tower grillage. A comparison between these models showed that the main differences in stress between the two optimization results<br/>are seen in the largest parts of the grillage: the sides, the flanges and the can. The maximum stress in the latter two elements is larger, which also results in larger thicknesses in the optimization with the ship. This affects the average mass in the ship, which is increased with 5.7% when compared to the grillage on the rigid constraint.<br/>After that, a full grillage is optimized. A first attempt demonstrated that the stress in the ship could only be decreased a little with the initial settings of the optimization. That required a slightly different model, to make sure that the stress in the ship remains acceptable. With that model, a mass decrease<br/>of 32 tons could be obtained, which is a decrease of 9.1 % compared to the original design by Vuyk Engineering.<br/><br/>From the different optimization steps became clear that the main factors influencing the optimal distribution of radial supports are the lengths of the supports, and the location of the outer brackets. The compliance of the ship changes the stresses in the grillage, and therefore the optimization result. The<br/>stress in the ship can be reduced only to some extent, so the effect of a stress violation in the initial design is that a new bracket design needs to be made. The results show that the stress is governing for the current optimization, and buckling is not.<br/>The conclusion is that the current procedure can help in the design by providing a global image of lighter layouts which avoid stress and buckling constraint violations in the ship. However, the limitation of the research is that the result is only a global image. It is therefore considered not worth the effort and<br/>time to apply the current method in an engineering environment. It does however show the potential of this method, so future enhancements can make the procedure suitable for engineering.","Structural optimization; Size and shape optimization; Tower grillage; External constraint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In this, it has been realised that due to its easy liquefaction, proven transport at scales and matured production process, ammonia can be an excellent energy carrier. Currently, ammonia production accounts for more emissions than any other chemical and to achieve net-zero targets these emissions must be reduced ∼ 25-fold.

In the system, the hydrogen feed was sourced from an<br/>electrolyser powered by renewable energy. Hence, it was imperative to study the sensitivity and the response of the synthesis loop to the fluctuations in hydrogen feed. For the dynamics model, different scenarios of ramp-up and ramp-down were tested for two control structures to evaluate the response of various system parameters to these deviations. Therefore, the feasibility of these control structures was assessed and some of their potential limitations were identified.<br/><br/>The objective of this work was achieved with three simulation models. A steady-state model was employed to study the equilibrium conditions of the ammonia synthesis loop. A second more extensive model included reaction kinetics, heat integration and a chemisorption operation. The widely applied Temkin-Pyzhev rate equation was modified into LHHW form to fit this application. With the selected ZA-5 iron-based catalyst the operating pressure was established at 130 &#x1d44f;&#x1d44e;&#x1d45f; to avoid overheating the catalyst. The simulation resulted in the reactor dimensions to attain the maximum possible conversion of 22.1% under these conditions. For the third model, the inputs from the two models were translated<br/>into the a dynamic model. The latter was used to study the behavior of the system parameters when subjected to fluctuations in the hydrogen feed flow.<br/><br/>Three scenarios were tested with respect to the hydrogen variations: a (step and linear) reduction in the hydrogen feed of 10%, 25% and 50% of the initial value. With the default control system, the pressure varied by 16 bar with only a 10% step reduction of the hydrogen feed. This necessitated the development of control strategies to control the pressure deviations in order to eliminate metal<br/>fatigue in the equipment. The first control structure compensated the lack of hydrogen by adding more nitrogen into the system. The second control structure reduced the recycle flow rate to decrease the ammonia production rate in the reactor.<br/><br/>Both control philosophies were successfully applied to control the system pressure for the 10% and 25% H2 ramp-down/up scenarios. The greatest pressure range measured during transient state in a linear 25% H2 reduction scenario for control philosophy 1 and 2 were 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively.<br/>The effects of the variations and the control strategies have also been studied. In this research the nitrogen supply was assumed to be infinite, therefore a nitrogen buffer must be present. In addition, the use of a hydrogen buffer is required for a gradual decrease and dampens rapid changes in the hydrogen supply in order to minimize pressure variations.<br","Ammonia synthesis; Green ammonia; Renewable energy; Dynamic behavior of a small-scale ammonia synthesis process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pertijs, M.A.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Quantum computers exploit the quantum behavior of quantum bits (qubits) that are typically operated at cryogenic temperature. Qubits require an electronic control interface. Nowadays, such classical electronic controllers use bulky instruments operated far fromthe qubits outside the cryostat. To run practical quantum algorithms, thousands to millions of qubits are required. Using bulky instruments to scale up to this number of qubits becomes increasingly challenging, especially due the the large amount of wiring from the roomtemperature controller to the cryogenic qubits. CMOS electronics operating down to 4 K allow closer system integration, enabling the scalability of the quantum computer of the future. Since the cooling power in the dilution refridgerator at 4 K is limited, the power dissipation of the cryogenic electronics should be optimized. Therefore, a dense array of temperature sensors becomes fundamental for power management. Commercially available cryogenic temperature sensors, such as platinumresistance sensors, thermocouples and diodes can achieve high accuracy. However, the thermal resistance between the sensor and the sample introduces uncertainty in the measurement. Moreover, they consume significant power and area, which makes scaling the temperature sensor dense array more difficult. To mitigate the thermal resistance and fully integrate the sensor with the cryo-CMOS qubit controller, a CMOS temperature to digital convertor (TDC) can be used. A TDC is an integrated system that consists of a sensing element, bias circuitry and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Integrated TDCs have found widespread use due to their low cost, power and area, while keeping good levels of accuracy. However, to the author’s best knowledge, no TDC has been reported to reach a temperature range below 203 K, which is far away from the target 4 K operating temperature. The main challenge to design cryo-CMOS TDCs is the lack of foundry device models outside of the military range (218 to 398 K) and the reduced temperature sensitivity of the sensing elements. The goal of the project is to build the first ever integrated CMOS temperature sensor operating over the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K. This thesis discusses the feasibility of traditional sensing elements and studies the accuracy of few characterized sensing elements down to 4.2 K. For exploratory purposes, different sensing elements can be multiplexed, such that any of them can be selected to be digitized by the ADC. Subsequently, the thesis explains the system level, schematic and layout design of a second-order discrete-time feed-forward delta-sigmamodulator ADC. Simulations of the TDC presented in this work give a temperature reading every 10 ms, and consumes less than 1μJ per conversion at room temperature. The output accuracy is limited by the sensing element, if an external reference is used and 2-point trimming is applied, the accuracy is expected to have a 3σ = ±1.4K in the temperature range of 4.2-300 K, based on available measurements. Through the presented TDC, the understanding of the devices at cryogenic temperatures will be improved. This will allow better cryo-CMOS qubit controllers to be created, which, in turn, will pave the way towards scalable quantumcomputers.","Cryo-CMOS; Cryogenic electronics; Temperature Sensor; Quantum Computing; ADC; Sigma Delta; Integrated circuits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-11-07","","","","","",""

Current BNNs use latent real-valued weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs, however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay, which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay, which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary weights. <br/>In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for improved accuracy.<br","Deep Learning; Binary Neural Networks; Hyperparameter Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

Since stiffened shell structures are widely used in the space industry, it was chosen to change the problem to a stiffener layout optimization based on the ground structure method. Numerical issues of modal and thermal topology optimization combined with ground structure based stiffener layout optimization are investigated. The Frequency Dependent Weights (FDW) objective and moving RAMP (mRAMP) interpolation are developed and combined with traditional methods to resolve the issues and successfully optimize the multi-physics objectives. Compared to traditional methods, the FDW achieve a 1.8% increase in multi-physics performance, while mRAMP has decreased performance between 0 and 4%. A human interpreted design of the optimization result, yields a 10% increase in performance compared to a traditionally optimized design, while requiring an equal amount of effort.","topology optimization; Modal analysis; thermoelastic; spacecraft; Multidisciplinary; stiffener layout","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Structural Optimization and Mechanics","",""

Instead of expanding the network structure, we rely on external capabilities such as backward motion, frame stacking, and behavioral reward design to improve performance while preserving transferability. By convention, these methods have been largely disregarded in previous works on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation. We analyze the effect on performance in simulation of different off-policy algorithms with hyperparameter and reward function configurations.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Geographic Information (GI) has proven its value with its ability to be used in various fields, which left numerous questions about how this data should be stored, used, and managed. To facilitate the sharing and reuse of spatial data, Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) emerged in the last decades and with the increase in Open Data, the belief emerged that not only the public sector should be involved in SDIs, but also companies and citizens should be included as part of the Open SDI. To evaluate its value and the success of open GI in relation to the participation of users and communities in open SDI is still a challenge. The possibility to improve user participation in open SDI, such as OpenStreetMap, needs to be assessed. This research used preliminary web-based surveys and semi-structured interviews as per Schmidt [2004] with users of the OpenStreetMap, as well as qualitative analyses and combined quantitative approaches, to explore the factors that foster user participation in the community of an open SDI, using a methodology that adapted motivational factors from Budhathoki [2010]. The selection of fundamental intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors were used as indicators in user participation in OpenStreetMap, for both the survey and the semi structured interviews. Surveys showed that participants in this research were mostly heavy contributors, that primarily who are extrinsically motivated to participate mostly because they believe in the main goal of OSM, they value the community and the development of the platform, and trust the system and its users. Moreover, the users have intrinsic motivations to also participate for fun, instrumentality, altruism, to meet their own needs, alignment with the unique ethos and for learning. One of the conclusions that was drawn from this research is that OpenStreetMap is perceived as an Open Data Ecosystem among its users, yet some diving opinions to the perception about Open Spatial Data Infrastructures. Future development points for OSM are the need for stricter standards and safeguards against hostile commercial or external takeovers if OpenStreetMap wants to effectively engage both the public and private sector. Applying a stricter standard for the metadata of datasets that are used by governmental and external parties should guarantee<br/>further re-use and provide sustainability for OSM. This includes an increase in their outreach through better marketing for the relevant potential users and provide further support systems for a new users. Furthermore, the expansion on different spatial data is also desirable, as well creating linked or integrated data with external open data providers. Current government or private SDIs that are in the process of transitioning into user-centric or open SDIs can apply these factors from this research into their own decision making processes if increasing user participation is their end goal.","Open Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI); OpenStreetMap; User Participation; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI); Motivational Factors; Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has become one of the exemplary models of macro-regional practice in the European Union (EU) context.

Since the<br/>first initiatives of the Helsinki Commission for integrated Baltic sea management around 1980, many strategies and organizations have been developed. Also, the spatial vision for the Baltic Sea Region is being updated. Indeed, the BSR has entered a new chapter of development with a new generation of Interreg projects. <br/><br/>However, the planning of the BSR is pictured as the highest authority conformative planning.

On the other hand, the linkages between the strategic documents and their local implementation could be stronger and more visible in a surrounding environment. <br/><br/>The project aims to carry out the planning framework for the BSR. The patterns for cooperative planning, design and principles inform what systemic solutions and actions are required to achieve the region’s performative, integrated, cross-scalar planning. The framework is applied in 4 scales: district, city, regional and macro-regional strategies and visions. The emphasis is given to the ports, cities and their regions as the main catalysts for cross-border cooperation. These units are crossed by sustainability, manufacturing and shipping lens. Here the macro-regional planning meets local target design and implementation. <br/><br/>The framework of Meta-territory is introduced as a synthesis between theories of soft space and territoriality. Meanwhile, strategic-spatial planning frames the project, so these theories inform the cooperation framework. Moreover, a mix of scientific methods has been used to determine the complexity between different scales, time-frames and society. The exploratory research is based on semi-structured, static, dynamic and proactive methods. Finally, the method of pattern language defines the cooperation framework. <br/><br/>The project is expected to inform and inspire planners, decision makers or citizens about their capacity to act and the necessity of complex and integrated planning. Nevertheless, geopolitical uncertainty might occur if the macro-regional planning practice is sufficient enough to ensure the presence of public goods and safety and sustainable development simultaneously.","soft space; meta-governance; neo-medievalism; port cities; macro-region; sustainable development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

In conventional conceptual hydrologic models the evapotranspiration is partitioned into evaporation and transpiration by a combination of the potential evaporation and the availability of water. This way the seasonal differences in vegetation dynamics are not taken into account. These vegetation dynamics represent the presence of transpiring leaves in summer, changing to an almost complete absence of transpiration in winter for some vegetation types. Including information on these vegetation dynamics could potentially improve the way streamflow and evaporation is modelled by conceptual hydrologic models. To investigate the impact of a phenology model on conceptual hydrologic models the FLEXmodel is adjusted with a phenology model based on the ’Kc-ETo’ approach of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the UN. With the conventional FLEX-model and the FAOadjusted FLEX-model, 28 catchments from the USA are simulated in terms of streamflow and transpiration. The 28 catchments differ in terms dominant vegetation type and climate indices. The conventional model and the adjusted model are calibrated with streamflow observations and transpiration data from NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) both separately and together. The conventional FLEX-model and the FAO-adjusted FLEX-model are compared to each other in order to determine under what climate conditions and for which vegetation types the phenology adjustment improves the performance of the model in terms of the ability to simulate streamflow and transpiration and the predictive capacity of the model. The streamflow simulation of the FLEX-model does not improve by the FAO-adjustment. The FAO adjustment does cause an improvement in the mean seasonal sum of the discharge in the spring months, which is structurally underestimated by the conventional model due to an overestimation in spring of the transpiration caused by the lack of information on vegetation dynamics. However the transpiration simulation of the FLEX-model does improve drastically by the FAO-adjustment. The large overestimation of the transpiration in early spring by the conventional FLEX-model is solved by the FAO-adjustment, improving the NS- and NSlogefficiencies for all catchments, regardless of their vegetation type of climate conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The government encourages homeowners to make their home more sustainable by providing subsidies for insulation and sustainable heating technologies such as heat pumps. Heat pump manufacturers are seizing their opportunity by developing online heat pump decision-making tools that allow homeowners to check whether their home is already suitable for a sustainable heat pump system, said they do this mainly out of their own interest to sell more heat pumps. In addition, there are also independent organizations that develop online heat pump decision making tools, they do this more out of interest for the climate. But it’s not clear whether these tools provide all the information and advice a homeowner needs before engaging an installer to install a heat pump system. In addition, it is not clear whether existing tools provide right advice to support the energy transition. Therefore existing online tools are analysed and reflected on through literature and additional research in order to develop a better tool. Therefore the main research question in this thesis is:<br/><br/>How is a heat pump decision tool for homeowners with limited technological knowledge designed, which gives an advice that contributes to the energy transition of the built environment and which provides an advice on which heat pump system and additional measures a homeowner should consider before engaging an installer?<br/><br/>First a literature study is conducted into the energy problems related to space heating in the Dutch built environment. Possible sustainable sources and heat pump systems with a high contribution to the energy transition are defined. These sources and systems are then included in the newly designed heat pump decision making tool.<br/><br/>Existing online heat pump decision making tools are then analysed in order to function as a basis to define all aspects a homeowner should consider before purchasing a heat pump system. A review is made on the basis of the literature study carried out earlier in which areas the advice of the existing tools is lacking. These shortcomings are addressed in the new tool.<br/><br/>Thirdly based on an example home, it is investigated which measures during an energy renovation that a home ultimately uses less energy, emits less CO2, is heated sustainably and has an higher indoor comfort. These findings are included in the new tool.<br/><br/>The new heat pump decision making tool is then developed on the basis of flow diagrams. All decision moments are based on the findings from the various conducted studies. These flowcharts are eventually converted into a digital online heat pump decision making tool. With this new tool, the homeowner is provided with all the necessary research-based information before engaging an installer to purchase a heat pump system. This assures the homeowner of correct advice without the involvement of an installer, which leads to a major contribution to the energy transition, better indoor comfort and lower heating costs.<br/><br/>Overall it can be concluded that: insulating the home first as described in the tool (minimum label B according to the insulation standard) leads to the highest contribution to the energy transition and a higher indoor comfort. And that the choice of the heat pump systems depends on the home-specific aspects, and the wishes of the homeowner.","Heat pump; Energy transition; Decision Making Tool; Home owners","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Within EPC companies, there are quite some ambitions at the strategic level to integrate sustainability into project procurement, but implementation at the project level is still quite limited. Additionally, existing literature focusing on sustainable procurement or sustainability within supply chains (i.e., suppliers/(sub-)contractors), in the domain of EPC companies in the oil, gas and petrochemical industry is also quite limited. This research study thus aims to develop a strategy on how EPC companies in the Energy &amp; Chemicals (E&amp;C)/Process industry can integrate sustainability into their project procurement practices, thereby adding to academic literature and practice. To achieve this objective, this research study was conducted in three main phases. In phase one, a thorough literature and document review was conducted, resulting in a conceptual sustainability framework that could be integrated into an EPC company’s project procurement practices such as prequalification and supplier/(sub-)contractor selection. The sustainability framework consisted of a set of sustainability criteria and performance indicators which can be used to assess the sustainability level of an EPC company’s suppliers/(sub-)contractors. In the second phase, semi structured interviews were conducted to understand views from practice regarding the topic of sustainable procurement. Main insights gathered included understanding the enablers and barriers encountered by EPC companies during implementation of sustainability into procurement, the prioritization of the identified performance indicators, incentives to stimulate sustainable procurement and suggestions for improvement. The third and final phase synthesized all the findings gathered so far, to propose a strategy or solution for EPC companies to integrate sustainability into their project procurement practices. This research study concluded by providing a holistic set of recommendations to all actors involved in executing a project, such as clients, EPC companies and supply chain actors on how sustainability can be effectively and efficiently integrated into project procurement practices.","Sustainability; Procurement; Supply chain; EPC; Sustainable procurement; Process Industry; Framework; Triple Bottom Line","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

They are flexible, lightweight, easy to shape and cheap to produce. These properties allow EAPs to be used as actuators or sensors in applications such as soft robotics, metamaterial structures, or other future technologies where the use of traditional transducers might not be feasible. Past research has mainly focused on the actuation property of EAP materials, while their sensing property has received less attention. For the implementation of EAPs as sensors in future technologies, detailed characterisation of their sensing performance is essential. The sensing characterisation in current literature was found to be of poor quality. Most of the studies that investigated the sensing performance of EAP materials did not accurately describe the deformation imposed on their samples and focused mainly on a narrow window of frequencies for dynamic characterisation. The aim of this thesis is to address this gap in the literature and develop a method to obtain detailed sensing characteristics of EAP cantilever samples during bending. This is done by designing a bending characterisation setup that can bend EAP cantilever samples in their first bending mode for a range of different frequencies.<br/>This setup is then used to characterise the sensing performance of an IPMC sample by obtaining the sensitivity, phase delay, coherence, signal-to-noise ratio, repeatability and stability, for a frequency range of 0.1 to 20 Hz. These characteristics were determined for both active and passive sensing methods under identical conditions, which allowed these methods to be directly compared. It was concluded that the quality of the measurements was good as the coherence and SNR values were higher than those of previous studies. The successful characterisation of the IPMC sample demonstrated that the bending setup can be effectively used to compare the performance of new samples in the future.","Electroactive polymers; EAP; IPMC; Sensing characterisation; Bending transducer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-04","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); Langelaar, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","High performance machines rely on fast moving parts and generally avoid resonance for improved accuracy. To improve the dynamic properties of these high performance machines, their parts are optimized via a lengthy iterative process. Topology optimization for vibrations problems could shorten this time consuming design process and provide a more optimal design compared to the manual iteration process.<br/><br/>In the field of topology optimization for vibration problems there are various methods to solve a given problem. The two most commonly used methods in recent research are the density approach and the level-set approach. The characteristics of the density and level-set approach are well understood in context of topology optimization for vibration problems, however a direct comparison between these two methods has not yet been conducted. Several crucial aspects of topology optimization for vibration problems will be investigated, such as localized eigenmodes, mode multiplicity, grey areas and efficiency for practical applications. Additionally, the applicability of these aspects will be tested in the academic and industrial field to determine their values when applied in industry. This thesis provides an extensive study of various design cases in which the density and level-set topology optimization approaches are compared on their ability to solve vibration problems. These design cases are based on frequently used design cases in literature which are generally seen as benchmark problems. <br/><br/>For this thesis it is opted to have as many similarities between the density and level-set approach as possible, to ensure a fair comparison between the two methods. To accomplish this, the level-set approach uses a density based mapping in combination with material parameter sensitivities and the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) to update the design variables. Furthermore, the level-set function is parameterized with compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBF). This leaves the difference that the density approach uses element densities as design variables, whereas the level-set approach uses expansion coefficients as design variables.<br/><br/>The design cases indicate that the density approach is versatile as it is able to solve a wide variety of problems. Additionally, there are less parameters, which makes this method easier and faster to work within an industrial setting. Furthermore, the method produces well-performing designs even with more difficult tasks, such as a coarse mesh.<br/>Although occasionally localized eigenmodes occurred whilst using this method, they do not seem to interfere with the final result. Thus, the density approach is less time consuming to setup and needs less tuning of the method specific parameters. <br/>On the other hand, results from the design cases also indicated that the level-set approach is able to produce designs with an improved objective function at the cost of possibly more tuning of method specific parameters. Furthermore, the level-set approach is able to solve all the design cases without the occurrence of localized eigenmodes. Although the level-set approach is less optimal for coarse meshes, it outperforms the density approach at more refined mesh sizes. Additionally, it features a crisp geometry description by the zero level-set contour. Thus, the level-set approach is able to produce more optimal designs without the occurrence of local eigenmodes at the cost of more complexity and possibly more tuning of the method specific parameters.<br/><br/>To conclude, both approaches have unique properties to be able to solve vibration problems. The density approach is more applicable as a standard approach in an industrial setting due to it being more robust and the method is less time consuming. However, the level-set approach should be opted for more complex vibration problems due to the crisp geometry definition of complex geometric features and its ability to outperform the density approach.<br/>A practical application has been solved with an optimization run, where the use of a set of predefined parameters that solved the benchmark cases has been used. Additionally, an optimization run where all parameters are optimized for the specific design case was performed to see the ultimate performance. The level-set approach was able to outperform the density approach in the predefined parameter case, whereas the ultimate performance case gave usable results for both methods. The differences came down to a more improved objective function for the density approach, or a more simplistic and lighter design for the level-set approach.","Topology optimization; Vibration; Density; Level-set; comparison study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Structural Optimization and Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Vizcaino, M. (mentor); Katsman, C.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Floating ice shelves regulate Antarctic ice sheet mass loss by buttressing land ice discharge toward the ocean. Next to basal melting, iceberg calving following the propagation of rifts has the potential to reduce this buttressing effect. However, rift propagation is largely unpredictable and generally not resolved in coarse climate models. The sub-shelf ocean circulation is believed to play an important role in rift propagation as it is closely related to ice shelf melting and freezing. Previous work suggests that the sub-shelf circulation of an intact ice shelf is altered by the presence of km-wide basal channels. As it could impact freezing and melting, the potential effect of basal channels on a rifted Antarctic ice shelf should be explored.<br/><br/>In this study, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model was applied to explore for the first time the potential effect of basal channels on the melting and freezing of a rifted Antarctic ice shelf. To this end, four simulations were performed with a high-resolution ocean model for the domain of an ice shelf cavity with idealized boundary conditions. These simulations correspond to a cavity with melt channels, a prominent rift close to the ice shelf front, both, and none of them. The effects of channels, a rift or the combination of both on melt, freezing and ocean circulation in the cavity were assessed through a comparison of these four simulations. Following previous research, results show that basal channels decrease ice shelf basal melting. We found that the addition of only a rift does not change the melt intensity or pattern. In addition, it was found that basal channels increase the freezing inside a rift. A sub-shelf boundary current on the Coriolis favoured side of the domain without channels is reformed to a clockwise circulation in each channel, resulting in an adjusted flow pattern inside the rift from one single large clockwise return flow to a smaller one behind each channel. Hence, buoyant cold shelf meltwater does not only enter the rift in the boundary current but after every topographic incision, and the thermal forcing is increased. Furthermore, the multiple return flow pattern enlarges the average frictional velocity inside the rift, which is positively related to the freezing rate intensity. In an offline calculation, it was found that the contribution of the thermal forcing to the total freezing amount is approximately three times larger than the friction velocity.<br/><br/>From our simulations, we conclude that the presence of basal channels in a rifted ice shelf decreases basal melting at the grounding line and increases freezing inside rifts. Previous work on rift propagation suggests that these results imply that marine ice accretion inside the rift could increase, and fracture propagation could be reduced. Given these connections between ice shelf processes, this study stresses the importance of including basal channels and rifts in ice shelf cavity models to robustly reproduce Antarctic sub-shelf circulation and basal melt.","basal melt channels; rift; ice shelf; Antarctic Ice Sheet; cavity circulation; MITgcm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

With the recent advances in intelligence, sensor technology, wireless technology, and computation power, we are inching ever closer to realising full autonomy in a vehicle. We are nowhere near the end of the line, however. Automated vehicles will have to interact with static obstacles like pavements, dividers, and poles and dynamic elements like pedestrians and other vehicles. This opens up a range of sub-topics on privacy, safety, and decision-making. While driving on the road in the presence of other agents(human or autonomous), safety constraints and collision avoidance are of paramount importance. Even with this achieved, we need a good performance in the latency of processing each iteration; we need constraints to be followed and, of course, ensure minimal errors in our control. <br/><br/>Through this thesis, we introduce automated driving, its general pipeline stack, and industry standards for autonomy. We then get ourselves up-to-date with the latest trends and advances in motion planning, decision-making, and control of automated vehicles. Once that is covered, we narrow our focus towards using a scenario-based approach to safe trajectory planning. We delve in-depth into safety constraints guaranteed by this approach and discuss previous results obtained by using this method with pedestrians in an urban setting.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to extend this previously used scenario-based planning method to a multi-vehicle implementation. Two methods of modelling scenario distributions(assumed to be Gaussian) are proposed, implemented, and compared using evaluation metrics like computation times, safety, and time taken to reach the goal. The first method models each obstacle vehicle as a series of obstacles linked together by the vehicle constraints. Thus, each vehicle is represented by multiple collision regions corresponding to each obstacle. The second method models the vehicle as having a single collision region with multiple scenario distributions. This extension's safety/risk guarantee is shown both theoretically and experimentally. Experiments are conducted in simulation on an urban straight road and at a T-Junction with multiple obstacle vehicles, and performances are compared, not only between these two methods but also with each obstacle modelled as a single disc, which is the baseline implementation. Conclusions are then made based on the performance metrics, and further improvements are proposed. It is shown that modelling the vehicle as a series of linked scenarios improves over the baseline method and the multiple obstacle discs implementation in terms of safety and computation times respectively.","Stochastic Optimization; Motion planning; Scenario Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The reason for building such plants is that using floating turbines allows them to move to deeper waters, reducing visual and environmental impact and allowing footprint reduction, with the downside being an increase in the total installation costs.<br/><br/>Because shared mooring lines create couplings between neighbouring turbines, the use of shared mooring lines adds complexity to the design and modelling of offshore floating wind farms. So far, these systems have been investigated and analysed using either quasi-static or fully dynamic models. With the goal of using a method that can be more accurate in terms of dynamic behaviour of the mooring lines than the quasi-static one and less time-consuming than the fully dynamic one by using a system with less degrees of freedom, this project seeks to further explore the idea of shared mooring lines within a quasi-dynamic model. <br/><br/>A quasi dynamic system is not as complex as the dynamic model but more rigorous than the quasi-static one because it includes terms related to the drag and inertia of the mooring lines. Inertial loads on mooring lines can alter the tension of the mooring line at the fairlead, while drag forces on mooring lines will dampen platform motions, especially for slowly varying motions. These are the two reasons why it is critical to include these effects in the model. In this case inertial terms have not been considered, focusing mainly on including drag terms for both the anchor and shared lines together with the geometric and elastic stiffnesses. <br/><br/>To begin with, the quasi-dynamic model has been applied to a two-turbine system, constrained to move only horizontally in surge as a model assumption. The model has been implemented in Matlab as a two-degree-of-freedom system. <br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research is to see if this approach can be used instead of conducting a thorough dynamic analysis. As a result, in addition to the Matlab model, an equivalent system in SIMA has been built to perform a full dynamic analysis and allow comparison of the two models' findings.<br/><br/>Based on the model results, it appears possible to obtain good accuracy for both motion amplitudes and tension values in a shorter amount of time than a full-dynamic analysis. Indeed, some correlation has been observed between the results obtained with the quasi-dynamic model and the full dynamic one, especially at lower forcing frequencies.","Offshore Wind Energy; mooring system; Floating Wind Turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Offshore and dredging engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

Such implants are referred to as Free-Floating Neural Implants (FFNI), as the small size and untethered communication allow them to be scattered throughout the cortex. Nevertheless, the plethora of proposed interfaces have failed to mention and act against the potential security implications that may arise in highly-constrained FFNIs even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently acknowledged the possibility of short-/long-range attacks on wireless Implantable Medical Devices (IMD). Hence, in this project, the existing threats in FFNIs are revealed, followed by the proposal of a memristor-based lightweight security approach to secure intracranial electromagnetic transmissions whilst considering the anticipated physical limitations of these constrained topologies. More specifically, a consolidated envisioned system is highlighted for which a read-only GIFT cipher is implemented. This lightweight encryption block primarily consists of a One-Transistor-One-Memristor (1T1R) crossbar structure for carrying out operations such as Substitution, Permutation, and addRoundKey, without destroying the resistive states and by only performing ‘read’ operations to maintain low power operation. With a footprint of 0.0034 mm2 the 1T1R-GIFT cipher reaches an average power and energy consumption of only 60.38 µW and 241.52 pJ, respectively. However, the performance does not exceed a CMOS-based implementation yet, whose footprint is similar but has roughly half the average power and energy consumption. This can be attributed mainly to the immaturity of the memristor technology. This work demonstrates that only after further advancements in memristor logic gates, crossbar topologies and fabrication processes, highly-constrained FFNIs can fully benefit from the scalable memristor-based security paradigm.","Free-Floating Neural Implant; IMD; Security; GIFT; Encryption; Cipher; In-situ; in-memory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Structure-preserving or mimetic discretisations are a class of advanced discretisation techniques derived by employing concepts from differential geometry. Such techniques can attain specific conservation properties at the discrete level such as conservation of mass, kinetic energy, etc when applied to conservation laws. However, like traditional techniques, they are not entirely robust in specific multiscale cases such as under-resolved simulations which are often encountered in industrial applications. This ties into the concept of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of which an enticing approach is the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method. Both Mimetic methods and VMS approaches have been extensively studied independently, however, their combination offers the potential of achieving a favorable robust solver capable of handling complicated industrial problems. Moreover, the extension of the Hybridised variant of the Mimetic methods towards advection-dominated problems is an interesting avenue yet to be explored. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the extension of the Hybridised Mimetic method and its combination with the VMS theory. The said combination is tested on simple linear equations, namely the advection-diffusion equation in both steady and unsteady cases. Additionally, the Hybridised Mimetic method is studied in more complex test cases such as the Burgers' equation and the incompressible Euler/Navier-Stokes equations.","mimetic spectral element methods; variational multiscale method; hybridisation; polynomials; advection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Topics within these themes that play an important role in the success of a project are developing parties with the required knowledge and skills, the presence of suitable legislation, an appropriate location and a bank willing to provide mortgages. The preconditions as they are now make the development of floating urbanisation in the Netherlands possible. Improving these conditions will make it easier to develop more floating urbanisation projects.

After World War II, it was governmental policy that pushed the transition to intensive farming by giving out subsidies. These developments have also had an impact on the province of Friesland, where agriculture has a long history and is thereby embedded in the province’s landscape identity. However, years of scaling up have caused a loss of small-scale structures in the landscape. The result is not only the disappearance of a historic cultural landscape but also the rapid decline of a biodiversity. Fertilisers and pesticides are the two biggest polluters of Dutch surface water, both secondary effects of intensive agriculture. Today, the balance between ecology, the landscape and intensive agricultural practice is lost.<br/><br/>This thesis has two main objectives. First a study, to understand the agricultural developments that have taken place since World War II in the Netherlands and specifically Friesland. This study will examine the effects these developments have on ecology, social structures, and the cultural heritage found throughout Friesland. Secondly, a research-by-design assignment aims to find a solution to how a new balance between agriculture, ecology and the landscape can be found through design. Three strategies are developed which are emphasising cultural-historical structures, strengthening ecological values and working with the vernacular. <br/>The strategies are implemented on a regional scale in Friesland and on a local scale in dialogue with a local farmer.<br/><br/>Through various scales, ecological corridors are strengthened in the area by introducing nature-friendly banks along waterways. These ecological corridors will connect routes on both land and water with cultural-historical structures in the area. In addition, a small-scale farmers’ nature network is implemented. On a local scale, a water-purifying helophyte field will be constructed which filters agricultural water run-off before it discharges into a local waterway. <br/><br/>This project can serve as a reference to how we can move towards a newfound balance between ecology, the landscape and agricultural practice in the Netherlands.<br","nature-inclusive agriculture; social structures; northern Friesland; cultural heritage; ecological corridors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","53.309306, 5.906260"

The building is partially transformed into an educational cluster, to house study facilities for students, a library and public archive and the banking museum. Two central courts are created within the building: the auditorium court and a public courtyard. Both of which respond to the direct urban context by bridging the height difference between the banking hall, the main entrance of the building, and the Governor’s Hotel, the most historical building part. The banking hall is transformed into a public interior square which functions as the main entrance for all users and as a foyer and lobby space for the auditorium court and the courtyard. A public route is constructed from the banking hall to the entrance of the Governor’s Hotel, which redraws the boundary between the public and private functions in the building. The design of the intermediary space, the space between the public and private functions, responds to the reconfiguration of the publicly accessible space within the building. By incorporating workspaces and social facilities within the design of the intermediary space, the relation between public and private functions is emphasized. This way, the appropriation of the building and the interrelation of its different users is manifested architecturally on the user-level.","Brussels; National Bank of Belgium; Auditorium; Courtyard; Public route; Public versus Private; Intermediary space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","","50.848917,4.359806"

Citizens are subject to their government’s decision-making, which is crucial when they transact, as examining the transaction’s rightfulness is executed by the same government. Thus, control and monitoring are evident, which are increasingly applied through AI-supported tools (Hoekstra et al., 2021). It is deemed socially unacceptable when government falsely accuses their citizens of unrightful transactions. Vice versa, it is also deemed unacceptable when criminals taking advantage of public money are exonerated. The citizens whom are trapped in these systems, like the benefits system, are often vulnerable and have low incomes. The Dutch government wrongly accused 20.000 parents of fraud, resulting in major con-<br/>sequences. Therefore, research is crucial for both a better functioning government and protecting the safety of vulnerable citizens. Scientific relevance is emphasised by the narrow understanding of how harm of next similar case is prevented, as such systems are barely researched holistically. Limited<br/>understanding of the relations within and between socio-technological contexts and the safekeeping of citizens lead to the main question:<br/><br/>“How can citizen’s safety be safeguarded in governmental AI-supported decision-making?”<br/><br/>Design science is the main methodology, consisting of three cycles: the rigour cycle, relevance cycle, and design cycle (Hevner, 2014). The method allows for innovative thinking and combining empirical (relevance) and scientific (rigour) knowledge toward exploring a new solution, in this research, safeguarding citizen’s safety (design). Additionally, it allows for a system’s approach required to understand the relationships of different decision-making components and for combining empirical and scientific insights (vom Brocke et al., 2020). Combining this with a holistic perspective, the research incorporates strategical, tactical, and operational challenges and specifically including the political dimension; more than factors and actors. Insight is created between the different context, which are all crucial in establishing a well balanced system.<br/>In seeking an answer to the main question, three parts are crucial: the system of AI-supported decision-making, the concept of citizen’s safety and how both can be integrated. The system and its boundaries are discovered through scientific and empirical exploration, serving as a framework. The definition of citizen’s safety and its implications are discovered by relating to the system and its characteristics. With these two parts, the influence of the system on citizen’s safety is explored and leads to the third crucial part, validated by a serious game. All parts use different sub-methodologies to obtain<br/>the required knowledge for the design science methodology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

That’s a doubling of the urban environment. The most extensive of this construction, and especially housing projects for the coming decades, will take place in emergent and developing countries. We, as architects, engineers, developers, and government officials, have the opportunity and important responsibility to give shape to our future. But our decisions not only impact the environment but also our social well-being, economic vitality, our sense of community and connectedness. In Africa, the number of urban dwellings will triple from 400 million to 1.26 billion by 2050. If we zoom into sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of these buildings are not yet built, compared to 30% in Europe. Therefore, I see this project as an opportunity to use the knowledge and lessons we have learned over the past to give these countries a head start in developing their cities. Today’s choices will have an impact on the decades to come. <br/>With the continuously rising temperatures due to climate change and already elevated outdoor temperatures, the current housing situation in Benin is battling elevated indoor temperatures. They strongly affect the thermal comfort and, generally speaking, the well-being of people. With the rapid growth of cities and the shortage of currently available housing stock, builders and developers focus on quantity rather than quality. Many housing projects that are being built do not consider the specific climate conditions. Too often, they follow the occidental low-income housing model (Plattenbau, HLM) and battle temperature variations with mechanical cooling systems (air conditioning) and standard universal amenities. The needed urban infrastructure to supply these new dwellings with the necessary services is expansive and takes time to build. The existing networks are overloaded, and water and electricity supply interruptions are commonplace, even in the cities. Proper waste disposal and garbage collection are mainly non-existent, and landfills are the final waste destination. <br/><br/>Therefore, a sustainable building approach in Benin and in general in countries with a hot and humid climate is not only a way to have a positive impact on the environment, but instead, it is a fundamental means that allows lower energy use and lower long-term costs of use while improving the thermal comfort and quality of life. People want a modern, hygienic and spatially sophisticated living environment and housing of the same standard while keeping a sense of cultural and social identity. Those social and cultural patterns must be considered a “compass” during the design process at all scales.<br","Benin; Sustainable housing; Water harvesting; Energy Harvesting; Social patterns; West Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","6.372601173204716, 2.3987792062806053"

Hydrogen has been gaining interests, as green energy carrier, which is included in the energy transition plans of not only the Netherlands, but worldwide. Due to its physical characteristics, large scale storage of hydrogen requires volumes that can only be provided by porous media in the subsurface. Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) in depleted gas fields is a large scale storage possibility that is generating attention and increased research. However, it is currently in a Low Technology Readiness Level, meaning that more research, and especially field scale projects are necessary. There is very few literature that tries to use alternative gases as a cushion gas for a UHS. Therefore, this investigation is relevant for the future development of UHS. This investigation will use CMG GEM, a commercial compositional reservoir simulator to model the fluid interactions in the subsurface when hydrogen is stored in depleted gas fields. This will be done by means of a sensitivity analysis, where the hydrodynamic behaviour between hydrogen and possible alternative cushion gases, such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are studied. Apart from the technical analysis, a simplified economic evaluation is used to calculate a levelized cost to store hydrogen, which will allow for an economic optimized selection of cushion gases in an UHS. The two main constraints for an UHS system are the purity of the extracted hydrogen and the rate at which it is extracted from the subsurface. The results of this investigation show that the mixing of hydrogen with an alternative cushion gas will change drastically based on the degree of the reservoir heterogeneity and the location of the perforated interval. This ever-increasing mixing will have an effect on the capability of the system of delivering pure hydrogen for the expected time.<br","Underground hydrogen storage; Dispersion; Subsurface Flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

In order to test the hypothesis, I conducted a workshop with a group of MSc architecture students. The students were asked to engage in two design conditions: where they sketch with analogous tools and where they sketch with digital tools. The comparison of these two conditions was based on an EEG and protocol analysis. The results indicate that the use of analogous sketching tools led to a ‘richer’ and prolonged ‘design flow’ experience that was non-tool focussed. The study provides insights into why analogous sketching is an essential activity during conceptual ideation and why it should be emphasized as a tool in design education going forward. <br/><br/>The second part is the design project and is titled &lt;&lt;A Living Lab for Flow&gt;&gt; where the design thematically focuses on the notion of flow in the emerging context where creativity and working deep have become the most valuable skill sets in our society.

The Dutch housing market is under a lot of pressure due to scarcity, high demand in housing and rising prices and this has led to problems. One of these problems relates to the rental segment. Due to the current tensions in the rental segment the existence of so called ‘strange conditions’ within contracts lead to attention of lease conditions. These conditions have led to the topic of this thesis as to what are considered to be fair rent- and contract conditions and how to improve them. This is done for both landlords and tenants and aims to have an analysis from multiple angles.<br/><br/>Main research question: How can fairness be improved for rent- and contract agreements for landlords and tenants in the Dutch rental housing market?<br/><br/>Methodology: For this research a qualitative method is used.

The semi-structured interviews complement this hypothesis aiming to collect data from practice to test the feasibility of the hypothesis as well as welcoming and contributing new ideas.<br/><br/>Conclusions: The definition of fairness in this thesis is considered to be within the range of the legal framework. This framework is derived from the legal documents that state the conditions within which must be remained to remain fair. The legal framework is presented through a categorisation of rent- and contract conditions that discuss each category separately and is supported by legal definitions and substantiations of what is and is not permitted by law. Contract- and conflict analysis point out that the fairness in the Dutch rental housing market is not in complete coherence with the legal framework. This is the case for the perspective of both tenants and landlords. In order to improve fairness different initiatives are already presented and those are taken into consideration in this research. The analysis of the problem, contracts, conflicts, initiatives and other documents in combination with interviews have led to the formulation of three instruments. The instruments that are considered are creating a New standard lease, using tools leading to a proactive government and introducing a landlord and lease register. These instruments have a specific objective to tackle a problem and are derived from the analysis throughout this thesis. Moreover, the instruments do point out that further actions are needed and suggest what those are. In addition, using the instruments separately impacts specific topics and is more vulnerable in their feasibility and impact. However, combining the different instruments and making their implications and tools work together strengthens the implications and impacts and mitigates their risks aiming at a more holistic approach to improve fairness of rent- and contract conditions.<br","legal framework; instruments; conflicts; standard contract; proactive government; register; preventive; reactive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); de Looijer, Stijn (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Labour shortage in the logistic sector and the poor work conditions as a baggage handler are a major and highly relevant problem for airports around the world. A solution is provided by Vanderlande Industies: a baggage loading robot. Since the efficiency of the stacking process is sufficient, operators that overlook the robot must intervene often. To minimise these interventions, better packings have to be made. To make better packings, Vanderlande Industries can adapt the sequence in which the items are presented to the robot. However, literature and the company are not aware of the effects of sequencing. Thereby in this thesis, we conducted research into sequencing items in various ways for the Multiple Container Loading Problem (MLCP). We attempted to find out which methods enhance the fill rate of the packings. In order to understand the academic background of the MCLP, we first looked at the literature. Additionally, state-of-the-art techniques have been investigated. A trip to Schiphol has been undertaken to observe the real robot that is resolving the MCLP as a pilot project for Schiphol in order to put the issue in its proper respective. From this research, we concluded that there are various methods for solving the MCLP, however, sequencing methods applied to so far are mostly kept simple. Moreover, in practice, baggage items are placed in the order where size and weight are decreasing. The knowledge gap found was that sequencing for the MCLP is not researched. We presenttwo different types of algorithms to provide a well performing sequence. The first algorithm, the genetic algorithm, makes use of multiple generations to optimise the sequence. The other algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, makes use of a set of rules. The resulting packings formed with different sequencing methods show to be different. According to the simulation performed, the heuristic sequencing strategy produces the best results for the main scenario in terms of the layer fill rate. The performance of the packings can with the heuristic sequencer be increased by average with 11 % in comparison with packings generated with a random item sequence. Additionally, the heuristic sequencer’s packings are fairly consistent because it consistently manages to place 8 items in one layer of the container. Results in this study point out that sequencing the items with size decreasing performs worse than the packings formed from non-sequenced items, with a mean fill rate of 0.71 for the size decreasing items and 0.87 for the heuristically sequenced items. The alternate scenario produces fewer evident outcomes, but we can point out that simple strategies, such as sorting the items by short side, perform effectively. The results from this applied method: an increase of 7% in comparison with non-sequenced item packings. We assume the simple sorting approach worked well since it grouped all similar shaped objects, resulting in tight packings. The genetic algorithm produced slightly better results, with average outcomes being similar (0.87), but much more consistent packings showing a lower standard deviation of 0.00917 (GA) versus a standard deviation of (0.01747). The results from the heuristic algorithm were the least efficient. This demonstrates that sequencing using a heuristic is effective, but it is not a reliable strategy in all circumstances. The genetic algorithm, in comparison, generates generally worse results, but it can adjust to various situations and configurations. Although the results seem to be convincing, there rise discussion points. One of the major drawbacks is the fact that in this study, simulations are only done in two dimensions. This results in a few assumption regarding stacking behaviour. Thereby, a significant point of future work can be done by introducing the sequencing algorithm to three-dimensional simulations.","Bin Packing; MCLP; Sequencing; Genetic algorithm; heuristic; Optimisatiom; Baggage Handling System; Simulations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","On-demand ridesharing might be an effective solution to reduce traffic congestion and, as a result, reduce emissions to mitigate environmental issues. However, travel times are more uncertain in ridesharing services compared to non-shared transit services due to their shared nature. For example, at one moment, the users are informed that the travel time takes five minutes, a moment later, a request is added to the trip and the users are now confronted with a travel time of ten minutes instead. This uncertainty in travel time is called unreliability. Unreliability is perceived as inconvenience by the users and it has a negative impact on the users' travel habits regarding ridesharing service.<br/><br/>Therefore, this research provides a novel solution to deal with this problem while mitigating the negative effects on the other quality-of-service indices, e.g., waiting time, rejection rate, and delays. This is achieved by providing two indicators to each new user: (1) the possibility that an additional request will be added to the trip that negatively influences the trip duration of the user; and (2) a prediction of the magnitude of a possible delay for whenever the case occurs that a new request will be added to the trip. These indicators are based on predictions, created by shareability shadows which determine the number of requests that might be added to the trip, and implementing a simple time-series demand forecasting method named exponential smoothing. The shareability shadow makes predictions by confining the regions of ridesharing opportunities by analyzing the travel constraints of the involved users. The solution is validated using a state-of-the-art routing and assignment method and a test case of Manhattan, New York City. With the formulated measure, on average, 58% of the requests receive a correct prediction about the possibility of a negative change, 17% receive an indecisive prediction, i.e., a prediction stating that the possibility of a negative change is ""medium"", and 25% of the requests receive an incorrect prediction about the possibility of a negative change. Moreover, the measure successfully provides a predicted magnitude of the travel time increase with a 95% confidence interval. ","reducing; unreliability; ridesharing; shared mobility; uncertainty; ridesplitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","",""

Examples of these in physical products are automatic soap dispensers and airport body scanners. The digital era has appeared and there are still digital products excluding users of different ethnicities and race, for example, dating apps and algorithms used to find racism and discrimination on social media. Therefore, both physical and digital products continue to cause exclusion among users, mainly caused by the designer’s implicit biases. Yet, the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) at TU Delft has a scarcity of resources and courses available to integrate an inclusive design perspective for its students and staff. This project aims to raise awareness for inclusivity and set an example for the type of tools needed to carry out an inclusive design perspective in the IDE faculty.<br/><br/>The Delft Inclusive Design (DID) platform was designed to bring together inclusivity resources available in the IDE faculty. To learn how to carry out an inclusive design approach, the DID platform offers resources and guidelines created by the IDE faculty members. These resources focus on creating awareness about inclusivity and how personal experiences shape our designs and guidelines, to carry out inclusive design practices. With a questionnaire among 13 students and interviews with 2 staff members, the DID platform proved the significance of the topic and contents of the DID platform. It also proved the student and staff interest in the topic of inclusivity, the effectiveness of the platform and its envisioned content, and the willingness of students and staff to contribute to the platform. As part of the DID platform, an awareness activity was designed for students to reflect on the influence of implicit biases in their design work. This awareness activity was tested in 3 sessions to grasp the knowledge acquired in short-term, medium-term, and long-term effect. Each session was carried out by 6 student participants and took place every 2 weeks. The outcomes show that a 3-session process is essential when creating awareness as session 1 creates new knowledge that students need to grasp, session 2 ‘reminds’ students of their learnings and by session 3 students are able to recall the information learned in session 1. Additionally, a guideline to inclusive imagery was created to aid students and staff when selecting inclusive imagery. These guidelines proved useful and provided knowledge to all 6 student participants and 4 staff participants. The awareness activity and image guideline set an example to how these can take form, in order to promote inclusive design perspectives at the IDE faculty.<br","Inclusivity; Inclusive design; race; Ethnicity; Design; Education; Designer bias; Implicit bias","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Most fluid-controlled actuators have valves integrated into the cylinder systems and require complex manufacturing steps, making these systems expensive. A cost-effective production method for these complex actuator valve systems is 3D-printing. The goal of this research is to study the possibility of creating a pneumatic and hydraulic cylinder with integrated valves using 3D-printing and evaluate their performance. A 3D-printed pneumatic cylinder with integrated valves was designed, manufactured and tested on static and dynamic leakage for different pressure levels on a designed test rig. To evaluate the performance, the leakage data was compared with the performance of a commercial pneumatic cylinder. A 3D-printed hydraulic cylinder was designed and built according to the earlier design insights. The 3D-printed hydraulic cylinder was tested on hysteresis and internal and external leakage in open and closed valve mode. Overall the commercial pneumatic cylinder performs better on static and dynamic leakage. In static leakage, a maximum pressure loss of 0.0095 MPa was measured at 0.6 MPa starting pressure after 20 minutes in the 3D-printed pneumatic cylinder. In dynamic leakage tests, a larger pressure difference of 0.035 MPa is measured at 0.5 MPa after 20 minutes in the 3Dprinted cylinder. The higher leakage profiles of the 3D-printed cylinder are caused by a difference in roughness and clearance of the sealing seatings causing movement of the seals. The 3D-printed hydraulic cylinder did not work as expected with 20 N force for moving the cylinder over its stroke, internal leakage of 0.007 MPa at a 0.01 MPa dynamic test and an average external leakage of 8.7 mL after 20 minutes. The tests gave important insights into sealing selection, which was not optimal for the hydraulic application. All in all, this study shows that it is possible to create functional 3D-printed pneumatic cylinders for static applications. Thereby it gives important design insights into improving the performance of 3D-printed pneumatic cylinders for dynamic applications and 3D-printed hydraulic cylinders.","3D-printing; Pneumatic actuators; Hydraulic actuators; Fluid-controlled actuators; Lower extremity prostheses; Fluid-controlled prostheses; Integrated valves; additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/BvanderWindt/3D-printed-fluid-controlled-actuators Github with all available data and scripts","","2023-11-02","","","","","",""

When they turn 18, they have to wait for new care because of the transition from youth care to the adult social domain. This is why they are referred to as the W18 (waiteen) in this report.<br/><br/>Besides waiting time, this study outlines four other problems that make this transition difficult: (1) Budget deficits in the social domain and a sharp drop in the young person’s budget after the transition from youth care to WMO; (2) There is a different human view (mensbeeld) per law and organisation, complicating transitions between services; (3) If a citizen has a complex problem, more domains, laws and counters are involved and (4) The W18 do not understand why the system is so complex, which leads to distrust towards the government.<br/><br/>The research question of the thesis is: How can the municipality of The Hague improve its interaction with mentally vulnerable young adults around the life event of turning 18, using proactive design principles?<br/><br/>The research was conducted from the human-centred design perspective. Six needs were defined from interviews with W18’ers. <br/><br/>They need:<br/>1. Someone to help and guide them;<br/>2. Information on what to expect;<br/>3. Customised contact; <br/>4. More room to make and fix mistakes; <br/>5. A positive approach with a focus on what they can do;<br/>6. To be treated as human beings by the system. <br/><br/>The design goal is to improve the perspective of young adults with mental health problems by creating clarity in their interaction with the municipal service. A journey of the current interactions was made. In examining the current journey, it was visible that the intake interview in particular evoked many negative feelings. <br/><br/>As a result, the IMprint was developed: a matrix that can be used as a conversation tool and indication tool during intake interviews (Figure A). A score from 1 to 5 can be given on 5 life areas:<br/>- Social support,<br/>- Housing,<br/>- School and work,<br/>- Income,<br/>- Well-being.<br/><br/>In addition to the IMprint, the MIrequest website has also been designed for making a notification or application for care (Figure B). All notifications for care and support can then be made through one digital portal. On this portal, the young person can do a kind of self-test. The result is a completed IMprint. Based on the score in the 5 areas of life, the young person is referred to the appropriate counters and facilities. This ‘self-test’ could also be the start of a single file that grows with the young person over the years.<br/><br/>The IMprint could be implemented in the current system as a conversation tool at an intake interview of the WMO or youth care, or at a cross-domain special case manager for the 16-23 years target group. The next implementation step is to start using the digital portal. Per area of life, the young person can find facilities. In this way, they can search by type of age, life area and problem for facilities.<br","Proactive Public Services; User-Centered Design; Design; Interaction; Municipality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Preferential Attachment models offer an explanation for why power laws are so common in real-world data. In these models, we start out with an initial network and add nodes one at a time. For each new node, we make m connections to existing nodes and if we define the attachment probability of attaching to a vertex to be proportional to its degree, we have defined the Barabási–Albert (BA) model. The tail of the degree distribution of the vertices of this model decays like a power law, offering an explanation for why power law behavior is common in real world data. The BA model can be adjusted by letting the probability of attaching to a vertex depend on its degree and an additional parameter for each vertex called fitness, that we randomly assign from a fitness distribution. If we adjust the attachment probability by multiplying with fitness, this model, the Bianconi–Barabási (BB) model, shows three qualitative behaviors. For flat distributions, the model behaves as the BA model, the old get richer; if fitness values differ, the exponent of the sublinear growth of the expected degree is larger if fitness is larger; if the tail of the fitness distribution is light enough, we find that a larger than expected proportion of half-edges connects to vertices with very high fitness values—condensation. In this thesis we compare qualitative behaviors of various preferential attachment models. Chiefly, we concern ourselves with models with vertex fitness. For these models, we study how the fitness distribution affects qualitative behaviors, such as condensation. First we review known results about the degree distributions of the graph. Degree distributions are an accessible and understandable property that is related to the topology of the network. We do this for the model without vertex fitness, for multiplicative fitness and for models with additive fitness and define the regimes of their qualitative behavior. For these results, we give clarification of the behavior and highlight the principles employed to derive their proofs. In doing so, we gather the commonalities of these proofs and provide intuition about their underlying principles by accenting the recurring themes.","Networks; Probability; Graph Sequences; Preferential Attachment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Linear guides are often used to establish this highly accurate and highly repeatable motion. The amount and variation in preload play an important role in the total motion errors. The objective of this paper is to investigate the relation between preload and repeatability for both the ball linear guide and the cross-roller linear guide by performing experimental tests. Three preload cases at three positions are investigated and both longitudinal repeatability and rotational repeatability are measured. In the first case, the preload will be applied uniformly by adjusting two adjustment screws on one side. In the second case, only one screw will be adjusted and therefore generates an angular preload. In the third case, an additional mass is added resulting in external preload. The experiments are performed at 0-25mm, 25-50mm, and 50-75mm, in which zero represents the position both rails are in one line. Performances of the roller guide have a smaller spread at different positions compared to the ball guide. Also, after averaging the different positions for both rails, the repeatability of the roller guide tends to be generally lower than the ball guide, suggesting that the performances of the roller guide are better than those of the ball guide. For the ball guide, the longitudinal repeatability has an optimal point for uniform applied preload, while for the roller guide the performance slightly improves as the preload increases. The longitudinal repeatability generally increases for both the ball and roller guide with the angular applied preload, with the exception of an adjustment of 10 degrees for the ball guide. The longitudinal repeatability stays constant with the external preload. The rotational repeatability decreases for both the ball and roller guide with both uniform and angular applied preload. The rotational repeatability remains constant for both the ball and roller guide with external preload.","Linear guide; Repeatability; Preload; position controlled","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

To forecast congestion on transformer stations, with the goal of mitigating it, the Dutch DSO Stedin uses machine learning models with standard loss functions for regression. These fall short in predicting congestion peaks, as loss functions like MSE are unaware of the prediction goal, which is minimizing the cost associated with the congestion. Without knowledge of this goal, a loss function will not put any extra importance on finding congestion peaks and is more likely to miss them.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the use of a a custom loss function is explored, which incorporates the different costs associated with congestion mitigation. This function aims to improve upon existing congestion forecasts by having a loss function in line with the congestion forecasts goal. For this research, the case of substation Middelharnis is used. This substation encounters congestion due to connected wind parks and distributed photovoltaics. The congestion encountered will be solved by grid expansion in 2024, but until then will have to be mitigated using the redispatching market GOPACS. <br/><br/>A custom function was generated using two cost components: a congestion fee, which needs to be paid if wind parks are disconnected and GOPACS costs, which are the price of buying flexible power on the redispatch market. The function takes into account two-time horizons: costs associated with buying GOPACS power day-ahead acting on a prediction of the load, and the resulting cost on the day itself if any remaining congestion was resolved via the congestion fee. The contribution of this function is that it depends on the difference between the costs of the prediction and the cost of the realization, instead of the cost of the difference between prediction and realization. <br/><br/>Four models were trained, each with a different loss function: MSE, Pinball, and Cost. The cost model is trained twice and for each model, a different value for GOPACS cost is used. The results show that the cost models outperform the Pinball and MSE-trained models, when the performance is evaluated on the final cost metric. However, if the GOPACS price is high, the cost model becomes conservative in predicting congestion peaks. It is not expected that this will be an issue in the future, as with more renewable energy, the energy price and subsequently the GOPACS price will be lower.","Machine Learning; short term load forecasting; Custom loss function; XGBoost; Congestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These investments would comprise out of renewable energy generation, higher energy efficiency alternatives and electrification of end uses. Although climate mitigation has become an ever growing societal concern since the ratification of ""het klimaatakkoord"", progress in the industrial sector has been seriously lagging in the Netherlands. In 2021 the reduction of CO2 emissions in the Netherlands stagnated and the emissions of the industrial sector actually slightly rose. So too in the Port of Rotterdam, where the chlorine cluster is not showing any significant CO2 reductions. There are several potential explanations why there is a gap between what should be invested and what actually is invested. They define the gap as, ’the apparent reality that some technologies that would pay off for adopters are, nevertheless, not adopted’. So, why do decision makers under invest in zero emission technologies? The explanations of fall into two broad categories:<br/> •Market barriers<br/> •Behavioural barriers<br/> <br/> Following the problem situation, this thesis focused on researching to what extent market &amp; behavioural barriers contribute to the investment gap in the Port of Rotterdam Chlorine cluster, by incorporating both market and behavioural barriers in a quantitative investment model. The incorporation of these barriers in the model result in a range of investment types, some of them non-optimal and varying in perspectives on valuing the future. By simulating technology adoption under the assumption of this range of varying configurations of market and behavioural barriers, it is possible to determine the effect of those two categories of barriers on technology adoption at the PoR chlorine cluster. The obtained insights of this research feed into the larger study of quantitative decision models for the industrial sector. Where the following main research question is answered:<br/> What is the effect of market and behavioural barriers on zero emission technology adoption at the PoR chlorine cluster?<br/> <br/> To answer the main research question, the model represents the PoR chlorine cluster on a highly detailed level and bases it's technical system's configuration on a thorough plant-process-product &amp; zero-emission technology inventarisation. These two inventarisations give the current and possible future configuration of the PoR chlorine cluster's technical system. Consequently, this makes it possible to explicitly model the technology stock at the chlorine cluster and determine technology adoption on an asset level. The market &amp; behavioural barriers are represented by 8 evaluation types. These evaluation types represent 8 varying configurations of the market &amp; behavioural barriers. Consequently, a scenario analysis was conducted with the model.<br/> The scenario analysis resulted in transition pathways, total CO2 emissions and total cash flows between 2022-2050. The model results show that the incorporation of market and behavioural barriers lead to postponed adoption of zero emission technology adoption. This is reflected by the lower number of years that these alternatives are installed between 2022 and 2050. The lower adoption lead to an increase of 288% total CO2 emissions between 2022-2050, compared to the optimal solution.

This project does research backpack repair, especially home repairs by users. Backpacks are generally easy to understand in their construction, as the seams and patterns are visi- ble. Still, repairing is not common because of different factors. User behavior plays an essential part in this! therefore, the thesis focused on user behavior for re- pair.<br/>The research question to answer in this project was how self-repairing a backpack could be made more accessi- ble and motivating for users. This plays into addressing the issue of user behavior for repair and the problems they face regarding backpack repair.<br/>The literature search showed that research in repair had been done on clothing, but there is a gap in back- pack repair. This project also attempts to contribute information to that gap.<br/>Either way, clothing or backpacks, there are several reasons why users do not engage in repair. Known fac- tors that negatively influence engagement in repairing are financial aspects, the lack of skills/knowledge, the missing resources, the time it takes, or the low emo- tional relationship people have with a product. That means the underlying factors can make the efforts to engage in repairing a backpack currently too high. While individual repairs in textiles are not that common for most consumers, that can be caused by companies actively trying to prevent users from repairing, by bad product design, and by consumer behavior.<br/>Talking with experts provided more in-depth informa- tion on the current methods and state of repair for backpacks. In addition, it gave information on the dif- ficulty of providing glue solutions, the complexity of backpack assembly, and sewing as the most accessi- ble technique.<br/>Research on backpack damages was conducted to get specific information on the field.

The research departs from an ongoing tension in master planning – how to assess and determine optimal qualities of urban form to enhance resiliency of public spaces. The research aims to define, spatially assess, and explore the relationships of factors influencing public space resiliency in central Dar es Salaam using a combination of a transdisciplinary literature review, geospatial quantitative analysis, ethnographic observations, and in-depth interviews. To inform a more resilient public space in the redevelopment masterplan, the research urges approaching resiliency in terms of ward-based identities and typologies. It recommends improving resiliency through the creation of space by enabling polycentricity, designing for wider conceptions of public space and strategically densifying through the creation of new urban forms. The research opens up possibilities for strategic interventions given further local investigation and site-specific acceptability by residents in Dar es Salaam.","public space; Resilience Assessment Tool; Space Syntax; street network; Urban form; Urban Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

Proton therapy results to less side effects since healthy tissues surrounding the tumour receive less radiation dose. This results from the proton’s specific depth-dose profile with its Bragg peak.<br/>To further reduce the effect on surrounding tissues, major improvements should be made in understanding the biologic response to proton therapy which will eventually lead to enlarging the therapeutic window. Here in vitro analysis with DNA damage repair inhibition or increasing proton dose rates can be performed to assess which DNA repair pathways repair radiation induced DNA damage and to assess the effect of proton dose rates on biological tissues. This will be investigated in vitro, while in vivo experiments are necessary as well. However, currently most mice are irradiated with protons in the plateau of the Bragg curve instead of the Bragg peak. Therefore, a dosimetric pipeline should be designed to allow for accurate placement of mouse tumours in the proton’s Bragg peak.<br/>In this thesis, the osteosarcoma- and HNSCC-derived U2OS and FaDu cell lines were incubated with non-homologous end-joining or homologous recombination inhibitors during x-ray and proton irradiations. We have shown a radiosensitising effect of the non-homologous end joining inhibitor AZD7648 on FaDu cells during x-ray irradiation, but an effect during proton irradiation could not be proved nor neglected. The homologous recombination inhibitor B02 could not effectively inhibit homologous recombination and was shown to not affect clonogenic survival of FaDu during X-ray irradiations. The observed radiosensitising effect of the non-homologous recombination inhibitor AZD7648 can be exploited in patient selection based on already existing DNA damage repair deficiencies in the tumour. Furthermore, combination therapies could be used of photon irradiations with AZD7648 targeted to the tumour to artificially enlarge the therapeutic window.<br/>Besides this, the HNSCC-derived FaDu cells were irradiated with varying dose rates to assess induction of a FLASH effect. This FLASH effect is usually observed after irradiations of &gt;40 Gy/s resulting in a reduction of normal tissue complications while tumour control is maintained. In our analysis, small differences in low dose rates did not have any impact. The experimental set up for proton FLASH irradiations of cells was prepared and though we performed the first set of experiments no definite conclusion could be drawn due to the level of biological variation we observed.<br/>Of course, differential effects between tumours and tissues like the FLASH effect should be investigated in vivo. Therefore, a set-up should be created to irradiate the mural tumour with Bragg peak protons. To reach this, two micro-CT scanners were calibrated to link Hounsfield units to stopping power ratios. The proton range in mice was determined and a 3D-printed mouse-like phantom was irradiated. In this thesis, determined stopping powers of all CIRS phantom inserts except for lung tissues were accurate with a maximum deviation of 2% or 6.5% after calibration with QuantumGx or VECTor micro-CT scanners. Larger deviations were observed for CIRS lung inserts or Gammex inserts. The irradiated gafchromic films inserted in the murinemorphic phantom showed dose distributions visualising the mouse’s anatomy, yet the dose was too low due to irradiation in the distal edge of the Bragg peak. The latter was confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. This dosimetric set-up to place mice tumours in the proton Bragg peak should thus be slightly improved and can then be of great value for in vivo experiments of proton therapy. This enables execution of many new experiments with DNA damage repair inhibition and FLASH irradiations, potentially leading to an increase of the therapeutic window in proton therapy and less side effects for HNSCC-patients.","Proton Therapy; Head and Neck Cancer; Radiobiology; Dosimetry; DNA damage repair; FLASH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Nanobiology","","51.910258,4.468893"

The goal of this study was to quantify each of the sources of error of an IMU. An optoelectronic system was used as a golden standard. Rigid marker clusters (RMCs) were designed to construct a rigid connection between the IMU and four markers. This allowed for the separate quantification of each of the sources of error. Ten subjects performed nine different trials, varying both in type of movement and in movement intensity. The error of the definition of the body frames (11.3-18.7 deg RMSD), the STA (3.8-9.1 deg RMSD) and the error of the orientation filter (3.0-12.7 deg RMSD) were all quantified separately. Furthermore, the type of movement, movement intensity and body segment were found to have a significant influence on the errors.

These developments are relevant to formal driving test organizations for the use of sensors in the assessment of driving behaviour. However, no guidelines exist about the exact use of sensor-generated data for driving assessment purposes, such as the driving exam. Relatively low-cost and easily implementable sensors such as accelerometers (g-force sensors) could be used to assess driving behaviour during the driving exam to distinguish between desired and undesired driving behaviour. Earlier studies have already investigated the use of accelerometers to distinguish between driving styles using threshold values, but do not agree on the most optimal threshold to do this. <br/><br/>In this study, thresholds were created based on scripted driving exams driven by professional driving examiners, who portrayed driving styles commonly observed at the driving exam. These rides were driven over a period of three weeks at the Dutch driving license organisation (CBR) in Leusden, The Netherlands, where scripted exam rides are part of the training for new examiners. Using the accelerometer of an iPhone X, the accelerations generated during 21 rides were measured supported by a dashcam recording the road ahead. The experimenter drove along all rides and registered driving events, including turns, speed increases/decreases and lane changes to relate the measured accelerations to these specific events. The rides included in the dataset were divided into four different driving styles: aggressive, desired, overcautious and negligent, from which the first three were analysed due to their direct link with accelerations. The obtained acceleration data was analysed using 63 initial features which describe the amplitude of the acceleration signal through the various events, speed zones and acceleration directions.<br/><br/>It was found that accelerations differ significantly between aggressive and desired driving styles, whilst the difference between overcautious and desired driving is less apparent. The thresholds determined in this study were able to classify the created dataset between desired and undesired driving behaviour with accuracies varying from 50% to 83% (M = 69.1, SD = 11.4).<br/> <br/>The results show that using acceleration data obtained during the driving exam can aid the examiner during the driving exam by giving insight into how well a candidate performed in terms of smooth driving through traffic. Concomitantly, a recent report from the Dutch government (Roemer, 2020) addressed that the CBR should investigate the possibilities for using sensor-collected driving data to give more insight to a driving exam candidate as to how to improve his/her driving behaviour after failing the driving exam, giving further rise to researching the use of driving data for practical use.","Acceleration; Driving behaviour; Driving exam; Human-Robot Interaction; Threshold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Over the last two decades, the size and capacity of (container) vessels calling port at the Port of Rotterdam have increased considerably. To moor these huge and heavy ships safely at the quay, fenders are frequently installed. The present guidelines for the “Design of Fender Systems”, which were established in 2002, are due to be updated in 2023. Part of the update of these new guidelines for the design of fenders by working group 211 of the Permanent International Commission for Navigation congresses (PIANC) consists of the verification and validation of the hull pressure criterion, taking into account the recent growth of (container) vessels. Obtaining a generic criterion is challenging due to the enormous diversity in vessel sizes and structural layouts. In addition, fender dimensions and types may also have a significant influence on the fender-induced load. This leads to the following research question: “How can critical fender-induced loads acting on the parallel side hull be quantified, accounting for the diversity of vessels and fenders?” <br/><br/>In this research, parallel hull sections are used in numerical simulations to investigate the allowable load of fenders and to derive the influence of panel size and dimensions (tall or wide). Including detailed parallel hull sections for a representative group of vessels, makes it possible to look beyond simplified geometries, such as stiffened panels, and specific case studies. First, the structural response and corresponding governing failure modes were studied. In addition to existing failure modes described in fender-induced loads, tripping of stiffeners as a possible governing failure mode was included. A modification to available analytical formulations was made to describe the critical tripping pressure of stiffeners with a flange under patch loads more accurately. The proposed critical tripping pressure induced by a fender is underestimated by the analytical model in comparison to the numerical simulations of the parallel sections. When the rotational restraint of the web frame attached to the tripping stiffener is considered, a closer correlation between the analytical results and the numerical simulations of the parallel hull is foreseen. For the numerical simulations, a parametric approach was adopted, where different impact locations and contact areas were applied for several vessel types and sizes. The lowest steel grade of vessels currently applied in shipbuilding was implemented to obtain the lower limit of allowable fender-induced loads. <br/><br/>The key finding of this study is that allowable fender-induced loads are largely influenced by the vessel's structural dimensions, such as web frame spacing, and the size of the fender panel with respect to the ship's geometry. The constant hull pressure criterion currently used by PIANC can be maintained but should be limited to a total allowable reaction force, because, for large panels, it overestimates the capacity. Furthermore, it has been shown that for large ships, wide panels outperform tall panels because they activate web frame(s). Making panels much wider does not necessarily yield more capacity because the stress concentration remains in the web frames. For small vessels, the trend is less clear, as the web frame is activated at an earlier stage (less far apart) and the capacity does not increase exponentially with the width. In addition, high panels on small vessels sometimes lead to the activation of a deck and thus increase the allowable load. The overall conclusion of this research is that the PIANC criterion should be limited to a total reaction force. Furthermore, by correctly sizing fender panels, more efficient use of the vessel's capacity can be ensured, as web frames provide more capacity. The findings of this research can be used to allow small and large vessels to safely berth onto existing facilities.","Berthing loads; Fender-induced loads; Structural response; Ultimate limit state; Tripping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The course is centred around a novel mindfulness exercise: ‘closure practice’. It aims to explicitly integrate two opposing processes of cognition that are central to the mechanism of insight: “scaling down” and “scaling up”, which are isolated in traditional meditation and contemplation practices, respectively (Vervaeke and Ferraro, 2016).<br/><br/><b>Design outcome</b><br/>The course to teach designers this exercise was embodied as an online podcast, The mindful designer. It first introduces the relevance of mindfulness for designers and then moves to separate exercises that tackle several aspects of closure practice. The goal of the podcast is to teach the listener to perform closure practice in absence of the podcast with the use of an auxiliary bracelet, similar to the traditional use of the rosary, tasbih, and mala.<br/><br/><b>Key findings</b><br/>The podcast was evaluated with a mixed-methods approach with respect to the design goals. Participants (n = 3) filled in online questionnaires. They agreed that mindfulness is useful during creative problem solving, to a greater degree post-study, than they did pre-study. Feedback suggested that ideas and insights occurred as an effect of the exercises, although the guidance of the narrations was problematic at times should be improved to suit design projects better. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis on the response texts also indicated that the practice had cognitive effects in line with the design intent.<br/><br/><b>Recommendation</b><br/>Feedback throughout the project strongly suggested that experienced mindfulness practitioners found utility in closure practice, but that less experienced or naive practitioners did not, because they lacked the skills necessary to derive the benefits from the practice. I recommend the development of a course to teach design students or professionals the basic skills of mindfulness spanning several months and eventually the performance of closure practice, which might be recognised as more valuable by then.

It is important to study the hybrid work setting. Based on the findings in the existing literature it is found that little research has been done on the effect of the hybrid work setting on individual employee performance. In the current research this is investigated by looking at the relationship between the balance between office and remote work and individual employee performance, as well as the influence of six employee behaviors on this relationship. In addition, the ideal balance between office and remote work in the hybrid work setting is studied. To find an answer to the objectives of the study, the following research question is studied “How is the balance between office and remote work related with individual employee performance in the manufacturing industry?”. The research question is supported by two sub questions (1) “How do employee behaviors affect the relationship between the balance of office and remote work and individual employee performance?” and (2) “What is the ideal balance between office and remote work in the hybrid work setting?”. Answers to the research questions are found by conducting a quantitative self-administered survey. The conceptual model of the survey is based on a literature review. The model consists of an independent variable – remote work percentage, mediating variables – attitudes towards remote work, work engagement, well-being, job satisfaction, communication, and trust relationship, and a dependent variable – individual employee performance. The target population of the study consists of employees, with a hybrid office job, working at companies operating in the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands. The data of the survey is analyzed with SPSS. Sub-question one is answered by looking at the findings. Based on the findings it is clear that the six employee behaviors are based on this study not significantly affecting the relationship between the balance of office and remote work and individual employee performance. For employees working for companies in the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands. Sub-question two is answered by looking at the preferred balance of the employees with regard to office and remote work. Based on the findings, the preferred balance is two days remote work in a four- or five-day work week and one day remote work in a two- or three-day work week. The main research question is answered by looking at the findings. Based on the findings it is clear that the balance between office and remote work is not affecting individual employee performance significantly direct or indirect. One possible reason for the relation not being significant is that there is still a lot unknown about the true effect of the hybrid work setting in comparison with the established work settings in the manufacturing industry. Based on the findings, companies in the manufacturing industry are recommend to start with making new work agreements based on the hybrid work setting. This, because the existing work agreements are based on office work. A good starting point for the agreements could be involving the employees in the decision-making process of the new agreements. By looking not only at their preferred balance of office and remote work, but also taking other insights of the employees with regard to hybrid work into consideration. In addition, the companies should pay attention to the role of communication in the hybrid work setting, because communication is key when employees have to work together remotely with other colleagues.","hybrid work; employee performance; employee behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Furthermore, even with a successful implementation of the Battery Regulation, the contribution of circularity strategies to increase supply and reduce demand is limited in the short term. It is therefore recommended to improve the prioritisation of lifetime extending strategies and to give extra focus to decreasing the material intensity of our economy.","lithium; circular economy; policy analysis; exploratory modelling; system dynamics; lithium-ion batteries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""
