(mentor); Alle-Jan, V. (mentor)","2009","In oil and gas exploration, seismic arrays are deployed by geophycisists to image the subsurface. For passive seismic applications, the data recorded by the sensor array may contain velocity and angle information of the propagating seismic wave. This information can be used to infer the properties of material in different earth layers. In order to find the velocity and arrival angle, beamforming algorithms are applied to estimate the wavenumber-frequency spectrum for the seismic signals. The propagating seismic wave field consists of body waves and surface waves. In some applications, surface waves are interpreted as noise, thus filtering is required to remove the surface waves before or during the implemention of beamforming algorithms. In this thesis, we first introduce a data model. Then several beamforming algorithms based on the data model are discussed, and the performance of the different algorithms is evaluated. Capon beamforming as adopted in seismics has limitations. Robust Capon beamforming which can overcome these limitations is explained in the thesis. For filtering of the surface waves, we propose to first reconstruct the irregularly sampled spatial signal into a uniform array, then design a velocity filter to remove the unwanted low-speed noise (surface waves).","seismic; spectrum; estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Cognitive Radios are currently a big challenge for the telecommunications industry. Many efforts are in progress to make communication radio systems as adaptive as possible such that they are aware of their environment and they are self configurable. An ultimate adaptive radio with the specified features is used to be called a Cognitive Radio. A cognitive radio can sense its operating environment's conditions and it is able to reconfigure itself and to communicate with other counterparts based on the status of the environment and also the requirements of the user to meet the optimal communication conditions and to keep quality of service (QoS) as high as possible. In this research a design of a stand-alone (non-centralized) cognitive radio system will be approached. The heart of the cognitive radio is the cognitive engine. The problem of having a cognitive engine to start a non-cooperative communication with other cognitive radios within its range and meeting the QoS requirements imposed by the application, is addressed in this thesis and it is discussed how, by using spectrum holes and adjusting the radio parameters accordingly, this goal is reached. More specifically, a bootstrapping protocol is proposed for the initiation of communication among cognitive radios in the network after which both transmitter and the receiver are configured on the same frequency and tune on the same settings \eg modulation and coding. The other modules discussed in the cognitive radio design are the policy engine, the spectrum sensor and the SDR transceiver. These modules are not part of this research, however, they are included in the design.","Cognitive; Radio; CR; SD; Wireless; Network; Reconfigurable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Embedded Systems/Networking","",""

(mentor)","2009","Fixation of uncemented implants is known to be more problematic than cemented implants as the proces relies on the growth of bone into the porous implant surface. This bone growth determines the fixation of the implant and has been the subject of many investigations [1-6]. A literature survey [7] revealed that these models are either a highly detailed simulation of a small section of the interface between bone and implant or a more generalized simulation of a complete implant. This thesis is aimed at bridging the gap between the two. An investigation of the bone ingrowth model by Andreykiv [1] revealed possibilities of accelerating this simulation. Furthermore a feasibility study was performed to apply computational homogenization in order to upscale the results of the detailed microscopic model to a higher level. Investigation of the bone ingrowth model showed that it cannot be simplified. All elements of the model are essential in predicting the tissue growth within the system. A 65% gain in speed of the simulation was obtained by optimizing the code of the subroutines (written for MSC Marc). Furthermore the feasibility study on computational homogenization shows that the implementation in a commercial code leads to extremely long computing times. In light of these results it is concluded that homogenization is not the method to bridge the gap between the detailed microscopic simulations and the simulations of the complete implants. Recommendations are given on the continued research to use the results of the detailed simulation on a higher level.","bone ingrowth simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Beavern, R. (mentor)","2009","Coastal zones are highly vulnerable to climate change and its variability. Future projections of global climate change suggest that relative sea-level rise and increased storm frequencies could lead to significant increases in coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. Associated with this, it is likely that coastal hazards can have the potential to disrupt landfill sites located in dynamic coastal areas. This could be a determining factor in an accidental release of hazardous contaminants which may cause pollution risks to the local environment. The objectives of this research, thus, were to better understand how coastal landfill sites might interact with coastal hazards and to investigate associated current & future risks, and their implication on future environmental and shoreline management issues under climate change. The first step was to develop a source-consequence flowchart using Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence approach to investigate how the different pathways, associated with coastal hazards at a case study area of Pennington, contribute to the risks of contaminant release from waste sites. Then attempt was made to identify and quantify sites at risk of coastal hazards. Linked to this, saltmarsh change and sea defence performance analysis were performed. Finally, possible mitigation measures were investigated to address the issues. It was identified that the risks associated with erosion and flooding happen to be more relevant. Results also reveal that the eroding saltmarshes could only provide a declining natural defence and will completely be lost by 2085, if not sooner. This leads to significant increase in wave action on the seawall which may eventually lead to breaching; as it was designed assuming it is fronted by sufficient width of saltmarshes. It was estimated that, under a 1-in-20year storm event most sections of the seawall will experience significant overflow and wave overtopping and it is more than 75% likely that the highest seawall section will breach before 2055 by which realignment option is proposed. This leads to seawater flooding significant portion of the landfills. This may arise high implication on future environmental & management issues, unless measures are taken. The study suggested that abandoning further waste disposal and relocating existing waste out of vulnerable sites seems reasonably sustainable and cost effective than protecting it. However, it was recommended that further studies on the determination of risks and its future implications based on a wide range of climatic, environmental and socio-economic scenarios would give a broader picture of the issues involved & to be able to address them for a better future environment and shoreline management.","coastal landfill; climate change; sea-level rise; erosion; flooding; saltmarsh; sea defence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-03-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Stouffs, R. (mentor); Mooi, H. (mentor)","2009","Architectural Engineering is a discipline concerned with design, planning, construction and operation in architecture. In order to have a proper transfer of the AE principles, there should be a methodology clearly defined; which has not been properly documented in the literature related in this field yet. The objective of this thesis is to describe and analyze the Architectural Engineering Design Process and to explore the advantages and tradeoffs that this approach presents to the project realization over the traditional Architecture Design Process. In order to analyze and describe some of this process in relation to the architectonic project it is necessary to use project management tools and concepts. It is also necessary to explore some of the explored concepts in a design project that has been developed in parallel to this research. The main difference between Architectural Design Process and the Architectural Engineering Design Process is the use of diverse tools and Building Performance Simulation software in order to assess the design. This alteration from the traditional ADP helps to implement innovation in design projects; from performative simulations and scenario exploration; which are later reflected in other decision assessment tools from PM. Creativity and innovation can be limited in the design of a project since most of the time they are associated to risk and exposure in the construction process. However, a careful exploration of the AEDP methodology as the one proposed in this thesis could orientate the project towards an efficient implementation of innovative technological concepts. Implementing the AEDP has some tradeoffs from the traditional process; time and money invested in the design stage of a project could produce savings or a surplus in the final project, not to mention the incremental innovation in technology through the continuous insertion of new concepts in the market. In this thesis this process is explored in two aspects from the design: the structural optimization and a new technology implementation in design. The advantages of the use of AEDP in regards to these examples are illustrated comparing these results to common mistakes in projects. The awareness of the tradeoffs is necessary to implement the AEDP in traditional projects and firms. In the last part of this report there is a chapter related to DSS that reflect the constrains caused by diverse subjects of the design. This would locate some of the aspects explored in the holistic description of the project, and allowing total approach in the design decisions. A good design exploration with the AEDP structures and produces improvements and added value in architectonic design that can ensure the success of the project.","Architectural Engineering Design Process; Design Methodology; Decision Support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Van Hal, J.D.M. (mentor); Verweij, S. (mentor); Kuitenbrouwer, P.A.M. (mentor)","2009","Duurzaamheid is steeds vaker in het nieuws (3.1.1). Het besef dat het anders moet is aan het groeien, ook in de bouw. Echter blijft de beschikbare kennis over duurzaam ontwikkelen beperkt, vooral de proceskant blijft onderbelicht (3.2.1). De informatie die beschikbaar is, richt zich voornamelijk op technische oplossingen of financiële kosten-batenanalyses. Dit onderzoek heeft ten doel inzicht geven in de problemen en de succesfactoren in het ontwikkelproces van kantoren met hoge duurzaamheidsambities. Om vervolgens de effecten van de succesfactoren te analyseren in de praktijk, ten einde advies te kunnen geven aan de opdrachtgever om dergelijke ambities eenvoudiger haalbaar te maken (3.2.3). Stapsgewijs worden de problemen en mogelijke oplossingen verkend (4.1). In de open interviews wordt de kennislacune erkend. De professionals zijn eenduidig over de problemen, deze doen zich voor in het gehele proces (5.1.1). Men geeft de mogelijke succesfactoren aan om eenvoudiger in het proces de hoge duurzaamheidsambities te kunnen bereiken (5.1.2). Literatuuronderzoek bevestigt deze succesfactoren (5.2). In de volgende stap wordt aan de hand van elf casestudies gekeken wat de duurzaamheidsambities zijn en hoe men de succesfactoren heeft toegepast (5.3). Vervolgens worden de cases vergeleken en gekeken of de mate waarin aan een succesfactor is voldaan van invloed is op het resultaat (5.4.3). Dit onderzoek slaagt er niet in om het verband tussen succesfactor en resultaat hard te maken. Verschillende oorzaken liggen hieraan ten grondslag: beperkte transparantie duurzaam resultaat, groot onderscheid in de persoonlijke en commerciële projecten, het beperkte aantal casestudies en het te maken hebben met veelal zachte waarden als betrokkenheid of teamwork (5.4.4). In de expert meeting zijn deze bevindingen besproken en is er op gewezen dat het doel van het onderzoek is kennisontwikkeling: Inzicht geven in het ontwikkelproces van kantoren met hoge duurzaamheidsambities. (5.5.1) De meerwaarde zit hem daarom in de case omschrijvingen (5.3) en de checklist voor toekomstige duurzame projecten (6.1) met advies voor opdrachtgevers (Bijlage H). Daarin is het onderzoek geslaagd. Om in de toekomst harde uitspraken te doen over het verband tussen de succesfactoren en het duurzame resultaat zijn er een aantal aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek gedaan (6.3): - Er moet een eenduidige meetmethode voor duurzaamheid komen. Dit maakt onderling vergelijken beter mogelijk. Momenteel is er een verscheidenheid aan meetmethoden op de markt die niet nauwkeurig te vergelijken zijn (3.1.2). - Het meten van duurzaamheid moet door een onafhankelijk partij gebeuren. De percepties over duurzaamheid van betrokkenen in het algemeen stroken vaak niet met de realiteit. De betrokkenen schatten de mate van duurzaamheid over het algemeen positiever in (5.4.1). - De mate van duurzaamheid moet op verschillende momenten in het proces getoetst worden. In de processen is regelmatig sprake van doelaanwas en doelerosie bij duurzaamheidsambities. (5.3) Door meerdere meetmomenten in het proces te hebben is een nauwkeurige analyse van de duurzaamheidsambities in het proces mogelijk. - Een schaalvergoting is noodzakelijk, meer projecten dienen getoetst te worden. Door het grote aantal variabelen in het ontwikkelproces naar kantoor met hoge duurzaamheidsambities is een grotere steekproef nodig om statistisch harde uitspraken te kunnen doen. - Projecten die lage duurzaamheidsambities hebben moeten ook worden meegenomen in het onderzoek. Zo kan er een betere vergelijking gemaakt worden tussen wel of geen hoge duurzaamheidambities. - De succesfactoren moeten per project worden gedocumenteerd om deze te kunnen koppelen aan de prestaties. Momenteel wordt het ontwikkelproces van gebouwen met een hoge duurzaamheidsambitie onvoldoende geevalueerd (3.2.1). - Data centraal moet centraal worden opgeslagen of in ieder geval centraal beschikbaar zijn. Er wordt veel gesproken over kennisdeling, maar weinig aan gedaan. Kritiek op het eigen proces is moeilijk boven water krijgen. Geannonimiseerd beschikbaar stellen is een oplossing. Met de toepassing van deze aanbevelingen is het in de toekomst wel mogelijk harde uitspraken te doen over de effecten van de succesfactoren in het ontwikkelproces naar kantoren met hoge duurzaamheidsambities. Dutch Green Building Council heeft al aangegeven de intentie te hebben het vervolgonderzoek uit te voeren.

Polarization is common throughout the entire city always because of economic rather than social emphasis of development . Pockets of wealth contrast with wastelands of uniformity, homogeneity, and mono-functionality, nevertheless infrastructure keeps hierarchical poly centric city structure intact, despite the fact that it mostly serves the central municipality of Santiago. New developments are mostly profit-driven and in most cases cause faster or slower gentrification, non-directly cornering the poorest to retrieve to less favorable areas. Neo-liberal economy where market deregulation, decentralization and privatization makes on of the driving concepts in the country, it distorts time and space compression map to disadvantage of the least fortunate, as 2 hour commutes become an everyday reality, and up to 30% monthly income expenditures on transportation. Uneven distribution is also evident analyzing facilities, connectivity, quality, accessibility etc., and socioeconomic segregation as an outcome of that. Quantity of houses is sacrificed over quality and integration, as of cheap land on which they are developed; despite all the pitfalls it remains rather affordable. Inadequate and structurally unsound urban structures occupy vast areas of Santiago naturally sharing quite similar issues. Social, cultural, and naturally, economic poverty because of lacking basic facilities. All in all, excellent connectivity, strategic position on metropolitan scale, lacking social cohesion and economic pressure of the surrounding projects (Bicentenary plan in the old airport, park Aguada) without a doubt are the most powerful factors leading to inevitable gentrification of the area. Even though this process brings better quality, it also causes local population to be displaced by higher income groups. Considering the history of displacement and current trends where least fortunate metropolitan dwellers relocate themselves towards the outskirts of the city – is not the goal to strive for. Improvement of the quality with a price of displacement does not solve the problem, but postpones/relocates it to somewhat different location. The project tries to envision an alternative solution that would enable the community to climb social steps hand in hand with rising pressures.","Santiago De Chile; Relational Strategy; Lo Valledor; Pedro Agruirre Cerda; PAC; Public Space; Gentrification; Connectivity; Morphology; Local Modes of Production; Segregation; Homogenity; Integration; Permiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

This study answers the question how the biofilms achieve the stabilizing effect and what processes make a biofilm shear off. For that, it combines the research to the effects of transport on boundary layer turbulence with the study to the stabilizing effects of biofilms under flow. Artificial biofilms were used in order to obtain repeatability in the experiments. The choice for the artificial biofilms was based on previous research done to the properties of biofilms and resulted in the choice for the materials sodium and calcium alginate. To study the effects of transport and biofilms on the turbulence, flume experiments have been performed using a LDA. For studying the effects of sediment transport on turbulence, coarse sediment with a D50 of 2mm and fine sediment with a D50 of 0.5mm have been used. The biofilm experiments have only been performed in combination with the fine sediment. Results showed that the influence of bed load transport on the turbulence intensities depends on the ratio between the particle size and the length scale of the turbulence. Biofilms smoothened the bed decreasing the turbulence intensities and the bed shear stress. It was found that in order to make the biofilm shear off, sediment particles under the biofilm have to be set in motion. Failure was found to occur when sand ripples eroded the sediment in front of the biofilm, allowing the flow to come under the biofilm.","Biofilms; EPS; sediment; transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Schott, D.L. (mentor); Verbraeck, A. (mentor)","2009","Odfjell is a leading company in the global market for transportation and storage of chemicals and bulk liquids. Odfjell consists of two separated profit centers of which Odfjell Shipping (OS) is responsible for the transportation of chemicals with Odfjell parcel tankers, and Odfjell Terminals BV is responsible for the storage of chemicals. The terminal in the port of Rotterdam is called Odfjell Terminals Rotterdam (OTR). Odfjell parcel tankers also transship chemicals at terminals of other companies in the port of Rotterdam. OTR handles, besides Odfjell parcel tankers, also tankers of other companies. In 2008, each tanker spent an average of 8 days in the port of Rotterdam to transship its chemicals at an average of 4 different terminals. Average costs for a single tanker in the port amounts to circa 1.250 euro per hour, depending on the size of the tanker. A unique way of cooperation between the different profit centers could exist in the realization of a drop and swap concept for Odfjell parcel tankers at OTR. Odfjell wants to explore the possibilities of implementing such a concept. With a drop and swap concept, Odfjell parcel tankers can discharge and load aU chemicals at OTR and leave the port without visiting other terminals. Barges, which are much cheaper, wiU be used for transportation of the chemicals from OTR to other terminals and vice versa. However, extra transshipment costs and loss in revenues, due to the use of deep-sea berth capacity and storage capacity, are realized too. Using the database (port tracker 2008) of Odfjell and a model, build in Microsoft Excel, a case study, analyzing the implementation of several drop and swap alternatives, has been executed. OdfjeU wants to explore possible drop and swap alternatives and analyze if, and in which way, extra profit can be realized for Odfjell with these alternatives.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-01","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

(mentor); Lagendijk, R.L. (mentor)","2009","Detecting and tracking of objects by a tracking device can be considered a breach of privacy when an unauthorised party can associate certain tracking information outputted by the tracker to the identity of an individual. Therefore, when this privacy-sensitive information is stored in a database, it is desired that this is done in a secure manner. A commonly used approach to achieve secure database storage is the application of access control mechanisms. Access control mechanisms prevent unauthorised parties from accessing the database in a conventional manner. In this work it is argued that, while helpful, access control mechanisms alone are not sufficient and that the use of encryption is a helpful next step in achieving secure storage of privacy-sensitive data. In this work, secure database storage of the combination of an identity and its associated tracking information is investigated. In particular, this work introduces and explores Hierarchical Query Mechanisms (HQMs). HQMs allow an authorised party to perform hierarchical queries over an encrypted database, without leaking any information related to the contents of the encrypted database to an unauthorised party. Several cryptographic protocols that support a HQM are designed and their relative merits and flaws are discussed. The protocols discussed in this work support HQMs through the use of key extraction and searchable encryption mechanisms. The protocols are implemented to examine their practical performance. Finally some recommendations for future work are proposed and discussed.","Hierarchical Query Mechanisms; Searchable Encrypted Databases; Information Security; Privacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-07-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","ICT Group","","","",""

(mentor); Geerts, F. (mentor)","2009","Problem statement: Historically, water had been extracted from some of Cuba’s major aquifers at a higher rate than they were recharged, but in recent years the pace of water extraction appears to have intensified. Surface waters diverted into man-made reservoirs can interfere with the natural recharge of aquifers. High evaporation rates from tropical region reservoirs can have adverse environmental impacts by increasing the concentration of minerals in irrigation water. Surface waters have been contaminated by industrial wastes and by the chemical runoff associated with the use of increasing amounts of chemical pesticides and herbicides. Scant water distribution management, alarming condition of infrastructure together with high contamination of water resources constitute a scenario, where the need of establishing elementary infrastructure for water treatment opens possibilities to reformulate the image of infrastructure as a by-product of settlement and to relate it to its public role and use, as well as to the whole ecological process. The area of Puentes Grandes district in Havana character calls for fully specified design; sufficiently open to integrate recreational dynamics of natural ecosystems. Goal: The intention is to design beyond the polarized situation where architecture and landscape can be included as systems in an urban design. In the city scale the design solution should aggregate the development of neighbourhood of river Almendares banks and enforce its natural ecosystems. In the more local scale, design intention is to develop a formula capable of fusing previously separated morphologies of industrial production, hydrological infrastructure and public, green, recreation area. Method description: Finding self-referential accommodation in a landscape that has lost its coherence; examining the site in order to discover possible rules for intervention; rediscover the landscape with its critical properties. Use landscape as both structuring element and medium for rethinking urban conditions, to produce everyday urban spaces and architectural solutions. Relevance: Take the floor in discussion concerning the issue of how dense urban forms emerge from landscape and how urban ecologies support performance spaces. Search for new basis for emergence of form geared to the technological and ecological realities of the contemporary city.","architecture; landscape; Havana; baths; park","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-10","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

In total 1,2% of the energy consumption was therefore renewable. The objective of the cabinet to get 20% of the energy from renewable energy sources will therefore be a major challenge. All available means should therefore be employed to reach this objective. Tidal energy did not seem feasible for the Netherlands, as the tidal difference is relatively small. After research done for a tidal power plant at the Brouwersdam it turned out that production of tidal energy could become attractive when combined with other social interests, such as improving the ecology of the area. On the 11th of March 2005 the Netherlands signed an agreement about the Western Schelt. This agreement said that Hertogin Hedwigepolder should be given back to the estuary. This had to be done to compensate nature loss due to deepening of the Western Scheldt as a result of shipping requirements. By combining the desire of the cabinet for more energy production from renewable energy sources with the plans to compensate for nature loss in the Western Scheldt the idea came to gain tidal energy from polders. Because of this new function of the polder it is called the energy polder. The aim of this study is to research the economical and technical feasibility of a tidal power plant along the Western Scheldt. The attention in this study lays on the design of the structures needed for the tidal power plant. With this design a good insight in the costs is obtained. A design, a hydraulic model and an economic model were made to obtain insight in the cost benefit ratio. It turned out that the energy price needed for this plan is equal to that of offshore wind energy.","Tidal; Energy; Western Scheldt; Feasibility","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The goal of this research is to gain insight into the factors that provide a successful or unsuccessful sale or lease out of a residential tower. In an exploratory research an image has been formed of the factors that contribute to the success. This leads to four factors: product attributes, promotion, economic climate and competitive supply. In order to study the factors ‘product attributes’ and ‘promotion’ in depth, three case studies have been conducted to residential towers in the urban centre of Rotterdam. The findings have been translated in an advice to a developer. This advice has the outline of a step-by-step plan, which describes how a developer should deal with developing a residential tower in order to reduce the high risk. The step-by-step plan consists of 9 steps: Step 1: Analyze the location on: view and distance to amenities Step 2: Form a design team with high-rise expertise Step 3: Make a temporary design and focus attention on the view Step 4: Get public parties involved in the project Step 5: Determine which should be rental and which owner-occupied apartments, but be flexible Step 6: Launch an exhaustive promotion Step 7: Make an inventory of feedback on the design and actual interest Step 8: Start construction and sale or postpone it Step 9: Continue the promotion after sold out This step-by-step plan concentrates on the aspects that are different in developing residential towers with respect to low-rise residential buildings. It creates the possibility to reduce the risk on interest loss and the risk on poor sale and lease out.","residential tower; succesful; sale; lease out; high-rise; product attributes; promotion; development","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

In this study the time-dependent three-dimensional ﬂow around an impulsively-started fruit-ﬂy wing is investigated at a Reynolds number of 256 and a constant angle of attack (α = 50◦). Both the forces on the wing and the ﬂow-ﬁeld structure are studied from an experimental and a computational point of view. On the experimental part, the work presented in this thesis is a ﬁrst application of a new tool to determine ﬂuid dynamic forces in three dimensions. Experimentally obtained velocity-ﬁelds around a dynamically-scaled robotic wing, with the previously mentioned kinematics, are provided for the purpose of this study. Pressure-ﬁelds are deduced from these velocity-ﬁelds, by means of a new tool, called the planar Poisson approach. The forces on the wing are obtained by the momentum approach, using both the velocity and the pressure-ﬁelds. These forces are in good agreement with the forces that were directly measured by a sensor mounted on the robotic wing. Excellent agreement is found in the steady part of the stroke, where the relative diﬀerence with the measurements is within 13%. For the computational element of this study, the Navier-Stokes equations around the insect wing are solved using OpenFOAM as a framework. The incompressible ﬂow is solved on a dynamically moving mesh, which deforms based on Radial Basis Function interpolation, which is a new mesh deformation tool. The forces obtained from the computations are also in good agreement with the measurements, in the steady part of the stroke, the relative diﬀerence with the measurements in the steady part of the stroke is within 22%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","A study is presented of the cover song retrieval problem, in which multiple performances of the same musical work are sought. The problem is considered in the context of content-based audio retrieval. In order to gain more insight into the current state-of-the art in cover song retrieval research, several existing approaches to cover song retrieval are studied in a modular way. Modules from different approaches are systematically recombined and each resulting combination is tested on several designated datasets. The modules have been chosen such that they reflect general and independent system decisions, while the datasets were constructed to each pose a specific and known subset of the broad range of cover song types and similarity challenges. For the experiments that are carried out, we depart from cover song system combinations that use the conventional approach of representing songs as absolute chroma vectors over time. Additionally, we transform these representations into a statistical meta-representation and also study the influences of using relative first-order time-differential information. In the results obtained, several critical choices in system modules influencing the overall performance can be identified. Our work is presented by first discussing the cover song retrieval problem in a top-down way, starting from the general musical and technical issues posed that form the inspiration for our choice of considered system modules. Subsequently, we continue by discussing the existing approaches that were studied in more detail. After explaining our experimental setup and evaluation methodology, the results of our work are presented. Finally, considering the results of our work, several suggestions for future directions in cover song retrieval research are made that especially focus at gaining more understanding in the relation between high-level aspects and technical solutions.","cover song retrieval; content-based audio similarity; music information retrieval","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Heuvelhof, T. (mentor); Verlaan, J. (mentor)","2009","The subject of this study is on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Vietnam, which has emerged and recognized recently. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) in Vietnam was recognized by first BOT Decree in 1993 after the Government amended the Law on Foreign Investment to make way for ""Build Operate and Transfer"" (BOT) projects in 1992. Various revisions were undertaken in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The prevailing legislation governing PPP practices in Vietnam is Decree No. 78/2007/CP enacted by the Government on the 11th of May 2007. This current BOT Decree is a generic law, stipulating the sectors, conditions, procedures and incentives applicable to infrastructure development investment projects through the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO) or Build-Transfer (BT) contracts. Therefore, Decree No.78 could be regarded as a key legislation related to PPP in Vietnam. Since PPP has introduced in Vietnam, there have been many problems in real-life practice. However, the Government and practitioners have still been vague about explaining its success and failure. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to clarify the problems with current BOT projects in Vietnam with insufficient assessments and explanations and find out what actors and factors (the iceberg) impede the good PPP practices in Vietnam, as well as come up with definite solutions to break these obstacles in order to live up good PPP performance in the future. The first part of this research is to review international literatures in order to get the insights on PPP topic by mastering its concept, various kinds of PPP, PPP project phases and its motives. Then, the theoretical framework of critical success factors (CSFs) of PPP infrastructure projects (called fishbone) is developed. There are 71 subfactors for the successful PPP project in the fishbone, which are classified in 12 main critical factors. Two main factors with various subfactors in each phase play as a cause for the successful effect in this phase and the successful effect in every above phase will live up the fruitful PPP project’s expectation. From the fishbone framework, we will figure out the most impeding factors to hinder good PPP practice in Vietnam. Also, This framework will be verified by a case study, BOT Phu My 2-2 energy project in Vietnam, so that we can show its potential application, observe its variation in order to improve it in the future. The second part of the study is to analyze the most hindering factors for PPP good practices in Vietnam, namely its financial market and PPP policy, whereby we improve the research of World Bank conducted for Vietnamese Government on these issues. For financial aspect, we investigate various financial resources of Vietnam for infrastructure investments. We found that Vietnam financial market is nascent and cannot be affordable for long-term and huge-capital-consuming PPP projects. As a result, we formulate recommendations for its future development to meet the requirements’ PPP projects. Also, we propose solutions to achieve financial arrangement at operational level. With regard to PPP policy, we assess what is good and what is bad in the Decree 78, and we claim that Decree 78 is not a good law governing PPP practices in Vietnam. Also, we suggest recommendations to improve many specific bad points in the Decree. The third part of this research presents state-of-the-art of PPP practices in Vietnam so as to observe how these weaknesses influence on the PPP opportunities and PPP projects in various sectors of Vietnam infrastructure and how actors deal with these obstacles. We have observed that the private involvement in Vietnam lags behind the comparators such as China, Indonesia, and Philippine due to a number of reasons. As looking closure to a number of real-life projects (2 real BOT cases and 10 domestic cases), the whole picture of actors’ behaviors and the conditions building up these behaviors are depicted. We found that the conditions for PPP practices in Vietnam are not favorable, thus actors cannot act in the right ways to which they are suppose to do in respect of institutional failures, nascent financial market, restrictions in specific sectors. In fourth part of the study, we analyze and explain the success or failure of BOT Phu My 2 phase energy project in Vietnam (PM2.2 or Phu My 2-2) to both verify fishbone framework and withdraw learned lessons for some findings of previous chapters as well as future PPP in Vietnam. Through the assessment on various phases, from exploration to 3-year operation and maintenance phase (1996-2008), based on the propositions of fishbone framework, BOT Phu My 2-2 project was quite successful until recently because it satisfies many CSFs of fishbone. Therefore, we conclude that CSFs fishbone framework is rather fit to apply for evaluating the successful factors of PM2.2 even though there are some adjustments and new factors needed to add. As a result, we add four new factors to update the fishbone for its potential application in the future. In addition, based lessons learned from PM2.2, we improve the finding about financial arrangement at operational level; we correct for the failure cases (2 real BOT cases and 10 domestic cases); and we propose short-term and long-term strategy to facilitate Vietnamese PPP in the future. Finally, we present many problems posed in the course of conducting this research for PPP in Vietnam and PPP in general. From these arisen issues, we generate six research questions for Vietnamese PPP and four research questions for PPP on the whole, which can be conducted in the future.","Public-Private Partnership; Vietnam; Critical Success Factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Constrution Management and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Neerincx, M.A. (mentor); Jonker, C.M. (mentor)","2009","Rationale Currently, there is an increasing demand for research concerning robots which can interact in a social and natural way with humans. Presently, there is still a gap in knowledge about how socio-cognitive robots with the ability to show intentional behavior can be developed. Research Question The goal of this research is to develop a platform involving the use of an iCat robot, which can be used to research natural interaction with child participants. Another goal is to find out how these children assess and rate this socio-cognitive iCat robot. Method A prototype has been developed for this research, which will be referred to as the socio-cognitive iCat. This iCat behaves socially and takes the mood of the child into account. In order to find out how children rate this robot, another robot has been developed which will be called the ego-reactive iCat. As opposed to the socio-cognitive iCat, this robot does not take the mood of the child into account. To test how these two robots are evaluated as compared to each other, a scenario has been developed. Children play a simple card game called “Kwartetten” in Dutch, which is similar to Go Fish, against each iCat. In this scenario, the behavior of the socio-cognitive iCat is also determined by the score of the game. Result The children were asked to fill in questionnaires about various topics before, during and after the experiment. The differences in results between the two iCats were small, probably due to a ceiling effect. However, the results of the observations revealed a lot more results. Afterwards, the valences of the children were rated, which indicated that children looked happier when interacting with the socio-cognitive iCat than with the ego-reactive iCat. Furthermore, the socio-cognitive iCat additionally tried to help the children out by giving small hints if they were losing. Due to this, the time that the children had the upper hand during the game while playing against the socio-cognitive iCat increased significantly as compared with the ego-reactive iCat. It is important to note that giving hints did not influence how often an iCat won or lost during the game. Conclusion The platform has been successfully applied as a research platform, and can be used for a multitude of socio-cognitive research. Currently, the social or intentional behavior is separate from the game behavior, so it is possible to enhance the game with multiple players or use a different game all together, as long as the socio-cognitive part is informed who is winning and what the mood of the child currently is.","intentional; social; iCat; Go Fish; experimental design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","This research deals with the problem of the enormous amounts of data that is streaming from the ‘sensor web’ into our computer systems. This data is useless to us unless it is properly stored, queried and presented by means of computer systems. These are typically databases, query engines, applications and user interfaces. In particular the manner how data is stored in a database determines what information you can retrieve from the system. This is widely known when it comes to traditional relational databases, however when complex data structures such as spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal structures are involved the user of sensor data simply lacks an understanding of this issue. This thesis work addresses this problem by designing a prototype of an expert system that automatically makes the selection of an appropriate technical solution based on information entered by the user of sensor data. For the design of this prototype, techniques coming from Geo Information science are combined with those from Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. The Artificial Intelligence techniques used are the building of an ontology and the use of a reasoning system and rule engine. These techniques, called semantic techniques, are typically useful for storing concepts and relations, querying them and drawing conclusions from them. These techniques are compared with one modelling method commonly used in software engineering, namely UML. The prototype that was built enables the user to enter requirements for the question to be posed upon the sensor data, as well as information about the structure of the data set used. The prototype also contains knowledge of existing technical solutions as well as features of space, time and space-time. A logical component then decides which technical solution is selected based on the information entered by the user. For the logical component two different semantic technologies were possible. One is the use of a reasoner. The other solution is a rule engine. Both solutions were implemented and this resulted in two prototypes, the JessTabDemo and the ReasonerDemo. The capabilities of the two prototypes were evaluated against the predefined prototype requirements. The conclusion was drawn that neither solution satisfied every predefined requirement. For reasons of comparison an imaginary solution based on UML was envisioned. This solution also did not satisfy every predefined requirement. This research concludes therefore that the envisioned instrument can best be built with a combination of UML and semantic technologies. It remains a challenge for the future to combine static solutions, such as databases, with dynamic ones such as ontologies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","GIMA","",""

One way to respond to it is to extract prosodic features from speech which are relevant in emotion research and feed this to a machine learning algorithm. This thesis discusses the encoding, decoding and inference processes of emotional sentences. These sentences were simulated by 3 actresses and 4 actors. Each person simulated 10 sentences with each sentence being performed in three emotional levels (neutral, fearful and very fearful). In total, the dataset consisted of 208 speech samples. Three decoders, two psycho-therapist and one speech-language pathologist rated each sample into the three emotional levels. Out of the three, two were highly correlated when the samples were presented randomly. Their ratings were used to code the samples. The formants, F1, F2, F3, F4, F0 (fundamental frequency) and the intensity were extracted from each sample and were given as input to a machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Machine (SVM). Due to the ordinal nature of the samples, SVM was used as the base learner of a meta classifier called OrdinalClassClassifier which exploits the ordering properties of the attributes. This algorithm served as a classifier analyzing the data from the samples. The results showed that the performance of the combination SVM and OrdinalClassClassifier was not significantly better than when the classifier SVM was only used. After doing a selection process with six different features, intensity and F0 were found to be the most relevant.","Machine learning algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Media Knowledge Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Huidige methoden voor het observeren van de conditie van dijken zijn niet altijd even efficiënt en nauwkeurig. Het bedrijf ‘Alert Solutions’ biedt een vernieuwde, meer betrouwbaardere en efficiëntere methode aan om de conditie van dijken te meten. Het is nu nog noodzakelijk om hiervoor een kabel in de dijk te graven. Graafwerkzaamheden in dijken zijn echter aan strenge regels gebonden. Het is dus wenselijk om deze kabel te vervangen door een draadloos communicatiesysteem. De sensoren worden verticaal aan een kabel ingegraven in een dijk en blijven enkele jaren in de dijk aanwezig. De meetdata van de sensoren worden verstuurd naar een knooppunt vlak onder het grondoppervlak. Het knooppunt zal de meetdata naar de netwerkcontroller versturen, die het weer doorstuurt naar de organisatie die de dijk onderhoudt. Er is bekeken of de draadloze communicatie met huidige technologieën kan worden gerealiseerd. Het blijkt dat er geen bestaande oplossing bestaat. Daarom zullen enkele opties worden geëvalueerd om de gewenste functionaliteit te realiseren. De eerste optie is de knooppunten onder het grondoppervlak geplaatst en de netwerkcontroller bovengronds geplaatst. Binnenin deze optie zal worden gekeken naar twee mogelijke technieken die gebruikt kunnen worden, de ISM band en het GSM netwerk. De vereiste afstand die moet worden overbrugd is ongeveer 300 meter. De tweede mogelijkheid is om laagfrequent ondergronds te gaan zenden zonder enige bovengrondse structuren. De afstand die dan overbrugd zou moeten kunnen worden is 100 meter. De te verwachten verliezen van beide methodes zijn vervolgens in kaart gebracht evenals de nadelen en voordelen van beide opties. Uit de analyse van beide opties blijkt dat de eerste optie, met gebruik van de ISM -banden, de beste resultaten oplevert. Deze optie heeft beduidend minder verliezen en geeft een veel betere mogelijkheid tot standaardisering van het ontwerp. Het gebruik van het GSM-netwerk blijkt financieel onhaalbaar te zijn. De eerste optie wordt verder uitgewerkt en de keuze voor de componenten wordt gemaakt. Met deze componenten ontstaat een hardwarematige realisatie. Met dit ontwerp zijn enkele veldtesten ondernomen om te kijken of de eisen worden behaald. Uit de resultaten van de veldtesten kan de volgende conclusie worden getrokken: De meetdata uit de sensoren kan via draadloze communicatie verzonden worden. Een aanbeveling voor toekomstig gebruik is om eventueel bij dit systeem gerichte antennes te gebruiken.","dijk; draadloos; netwerk","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

As such, it is perpetually involved in furthering technological advancement in the interests of society. In line, the Faculty of Architecture wants to be an international leading (designer’s) education for students and scientists all over the world. As a logic result, the faculty wants to be involved in – and contribute to – the quality of the urban and rural areas in our country. In the densely populated country of the Netherlands, and especially in the western ‘Randstad’-region, there is an ongoing challenge to accommodate numerous kinds of functions. This challenge is coupled with the wish to preserve green areas outside of the urban sprawl. As a result, the demand for (development) sites is provoking increasing interest in inner-city (re)developments. In the Dutch cities, road- and railway-infrastructure occupies a significant area. This fact, in combination with environmental measures, health-related issues and expansion of the infrastructure network, assured that the road- and rail-related areas could count on an increasing level of interest in the last few years. The combination of infrastructure and other functions in one integrated project is sometimes unavoidable and can be beneficial because of several spatial, environmental and financial reasons. The combination of infrastructure- and real estate-development hereby results in high-quality areas in which to live and work. The latest projects (Leidschendam-Voorburg, Maastricht, Delft, Dieren, Amstelveen) also show this vision is more and more supported by public and private actors and can result in appealing projects. Despite the technical and spatial aspects involved, those integrated projects are not not only the field of expertise of the civil engineers or the urban designers. This is, because these kind of developments also need a sound financial and legal base to provide not only in a state-of-the-art technical design and spatial plan, but – even more important – also in a realistic and feasible project. To do so, this present thesis examines combined projects of infrastructure- and urban development with a focus on both the financial and legal aspects. This is done, because we know that by making the right decisions now, the Dutch urban and rural areas will be able to preserve and improve their quality and attractiveness, even when the future may bring something unpredictable","Infrastructure; Real estate development; Feasibility study; Case Spoorzone Delft; Contractual flexibility; Multiple use of space","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","","",""

(mentor); Nygan-Tillard, D. (mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor)","2009","To measure roughness a number of traditional measurement methods have been developed such as linear profiling, compass and disc clinometers. Although these measurement methods have been widely used, they are time consuming, and labor intensive. The accuracy of the local measurements depends heavily on expertise and measurements are limited to places that are accessible. Therefore, the demand for ways of acquiring roughness information quickly and with a high spatial resolution and accuracy for surfaces out of human reach is increasing. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a data acquisition technique promising to fill all these needs. However, data acquired by terrestrial laser scanner devices always contain noise. Therefore, using the raw laser data for roughness characterization can cause inaccurate and unreliable results. In order to confirm that terrestrial laser scanning technique can replace the traditional measurement methods for roughness characterization it is essential to remove noise present in the data as accurate as possible without distorting the detailed features underlying the original data. The research presented in this thesis focuses on analyzing the influence of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) instrument noise on rock surface roughness characterization. To characterize roughness the roughness length method is used. Linear profiles are generated on the rock surface and from these profiles roughness data are obtained using both terrestrial laser scanner data and manual measurements. The manual measurements are used as reference for the evaluation of the results from the laser scanner data. From the profiles the fractal parameters are obtained to quantify roughness using the roughness length method. Both raw data and denoised laser scanner data are used to obtain fractal parameter values. With respect to the selection of the most appropriate threshold value to distinguish the original data from the laser range noise, an experiment was performed using the wavelet denoising approach. In this experiment, the threshold values were changed incrementally until the fractal dimension values approached the values of the reference data. If the selected threshold value was too small to remove noise then the denoising procedure resulted in the noise being underestimated (e.g. 0.001m for our case). In contrast, if the threshold value is too high then the denoising procedure resulted in the noise being overestimated. The results clearly showed that the selection of threshold values in denoising procedure play a significant role in changing the values of the fractal dimension. However this method was only used to see the effect of the threshold value on the fractal parameters. It was concluded that the best approach is to first estimate the noise level in the laser data and then determine the threshold values. For this reason two methods were applied to determine the noise level (Donoho-Johnstone’s and Menenti-Ritchie’s methods), and then they are used in different threshold estimation methods. In total 10 different thresholding methods, including the hard and soft modes, were performed on the wavelet coefficients obtained separately from discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packets. Donoho-Johnstone’s, Fixed form, hard thresholding method and Birge-Massart’s, Penalized medium soft, thresholding methods when applied to the coefficients of wavelet packets resulted in very close fractal dimension values to the reference values in x directional laser profile.  However, for y directional profiles Birge-Massart’s Penalized medium hard thresholding method resulted in the closest value to the reference data. In this research it is showed that noise can be successfully eliminated to such a degree that accurate measurement values can be obtained from laser scanned data for rock surface roughness characterization.","terrestrial laser scanning; de-noising; roughness; wavelet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Geomatics","",""

However, this tempting decrease in the time complexity cannot be achieved without several platform specific tricks and optimizations. Therefore, in order to harness the power of parallel systems for reduction operations two major steps should be taken. First, a single standard model should be defined for such operations. Second, the model should be easily converted to different parallel platforms without any or with small changes to the underlying model.

On the other hand, integration of many functions such as digital, memory, RF and analog circuits is necessary in near future. Scaling is one of the solutions to increase density of memories and functionality of integrated circuits. However, the increase of leakage current, process complexity and process variation of parameters limit scaling. This limitations force us to think about new dimension in integrated circuits. Three dimensional integrated circuits can solve some of the problems. They can give us low power, high density memories and high functionality circuits in same area of planar ICs. Different technologies can be merged in different layers of 3DIC to finally make a high performance system. In this thesis we realize SRAM cells in 3DIC to increase the capacity and performance of them. In chapter 2 we will introduce different memories and particular case SRAM. The principle of operation and design metrics are discussed in this chapter. Then in chapter 3 we talk about 3DIC and its advantages and disadvantages. Heat generation is main issue in 3DIC. New 3DIC fabrication technology called µ-Czochralski Process is introduced. Next in chapter 4 we design SRAM cells using analytic approach and we confirm the design by circuit simulation tools. Different SRAM cells and sense amplifier and output buffers are designed in this chapter. To fabricate design circuits we need layout for SRAM cells. In chapter 5 we extensively look to the design rules for SRAM circuits in one layer and two layers of silicon. Using double gate and H-Gate transistors to increase the performance of SRAM cells are discussed in this chapter. Then in chapter 6 we show fabrication process flow of one layer and two layers single grain silicon devices.

In this thesis, we propose a new network coding based communication algorithm called Network Coded Flooding (NCF) which is related to network wide broadcast. This designed algorithm is an integration of network coding and one of the commonly used broadcasting techniques in wireless networks. In this thesis, we choose Probabilistic Flooding Algorithm (PFA) to integrate with network coding since it is a simple and robust flooding algorithm; it can be used in random wireless networks; it can work without any network topology information. As with PFA, NCF has a parameter of rebroadcast probability that controls packets’ rebroadcasts when receiving innovative packets. During the process of designing NCF, we also consider the issues how efficient network coding can achieve in a random wireless network even if the system process ability is low and available memory space is also limited. Therefore, the idea of generation is used and we also propose a specific generation management method in this thesis that is able to let system occupy little system memory space while good network performance (such as successful packet delivery, low packet delay and great energy savings) and relatively low system process complexity are guaranteed. NCF is a practical network coding based flooding algorithm that can be used in random wireless networks; that does not need any network topology information; that huge amount of data is allowed to be transmitted during the communication process; that the requirements of buffering and network process ability are at a relatively low level. We simulate such algorithm in Network Simulator 2 (NS2), and the simulation results show that NCF can realize the benefits in terms of reliability, working efficiency and energy saving if related parameters (such as generation size or maximum number of generations per node has ) of NCF are set accurately. In addition, reasonable trade-off schemes are also given through analyzing the obtained simulation results, which give general ideas about how to accurately use and change the related parameters of NCF in order to efficiently balance the relationship between network requirements and network performance.","broadcasting; flooding algorithm; generation management method; network coding; wireless networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Telecommunications","","","",""

TenneT TSO b.v, being the Dutch Transmission System Operator and the administrator of the national transmission grid is responsible not only for the continuity of the electricity supply, but also for the reliability and security of the grid. The growing demand for electricity and the liberalisation of the energy market have both contributed to a higher demand for transmission capacity. Energy is being transmitted over longer distances and existing power lines are deemed insufficient. To retain the current reliability and availability, investments have to be made. One of these investments is the project Randstad 380, which aims to ensure the supply and availability of electricity to the most densely populated region in The Netherlands, called the Randstad. In conjunction with government bodies and interest groups, TenneT has decided to implement 20 km of this connection using an underground cable. The study analyses the effect on the local steady-state voltage profile and reactive power balance for a partial implementation of the Randstad 380 project using an EHV AC underground cable system. The study also serves as an introduction to the Randstad 380 project, with a focus on the technical considerations and concerns related to the steady-state operation of underground cables at extra high voltage (EHV) level.

UAV Photogrammetry is a potential answer for contractors. Photogrammetric measurement processing should be automated in order to reach its full potential in speed and obtainability. Automatic extraction of reliable point correspondences between stereoscopic images is still difficult. This research presents a solution to obtain reliable point correspondences between multiple images. The approach is to use Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to automatically extract point matches. These point matches are not reliable. SIFT Tracking is a new method that tracks SIFT features in a sequence of images with very high overlap. SIFT tracking, in combination with a motion constraint and a unique matching constraint, extracts reliable point matches. SIFT tracking is tested in road construction image sequences with 99% overlap between consecutive images. SIFT extracts approximately 30 reliable point correspondences over 40 images, such that there is 60% overlap between the first and the ast image of the sequence. These point correspondences can be used to compute a reliable digital terrain model of the road construction site. SIFT Tracking is an improved version of SIFT that can be used to extract reliable point correspondences between photogrammetric images. It fills the last gap in automating photogrammetric measurement campaigns.","Scale Invariant Feature Transform; UAV; Videogrammetry; Photogrammetry; SIFT Tracking; DTM; Road Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-25","Aerospace Engineering","Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","","","",""

At a certain angle of attack the adverse pressure gradient becomes so strong that the ow can no longer follow the surface of the airfoil and separates, resulting in a decrease in lift and an increase in drag. This maximum lift coefficient can be increased by using high-lift devices like trailing edge aps. However, ow separation still remains the limiting factor. Flow separation control is a solution to this problem. By adding momentum to the boundary layer ow separation is postponed and higher lift coefficients can be reached. In this research active ow separation control by means of a vibrating surface element, a so-called fliperon, is investigated. Both the effectiveness and the efficiency of this flow control method are investigated for the NACA-0015 airfoil at 20 angle of attack and for the NLR7301 airfoil-flap configuration with ow separation from the 35 deflected flap. This research is performed completely numerically with the ow solver Fluent 6. For this research the RANS equations are closed with the k-E turbulence model. Because the fliperon is oscillating during the simulation, the dynamic mesh model is used to rotate the fliperon and to keep the grid quality at a sufficient level. The fliperon was located at a distance of about 20% (flap) chord length ahead of the ow separation point. The length is chosen such that the maximum amplitude of the fliperon tip equals the local boundary layer thickness. Further the shape of the fliperon is equal to the curvature of the airfoil at that location. If the fliperon oscillates above a cavity, the shape of the cavity will also influence the generated vortices. The best results were obtained with a round cavity shape that increases the blowing effect in tangential direction and reduces the amount of additional vorticity that is generated. The performances of a fliperon oscillating above a cavity with a sharp trailing edge and a springboard type fliperon were less promising. The most important parameter of the fliperon motion is the frequency. The frequency influences the size and the strength of the generated vortices. It is important that the generated vortices are sufficiently strong, because they have to travel towards the trailing edge and interact with the vortices that existed there due to the ow separation. Only then the total circulation is improved and the lift coefficient increased. In case of the NACA-0015 a dimensionless frequency F+ of 1.2 turned out to be very effective, while the most effective frequency on the NLR7301 airfoil-flap configuration was 6.0. The fliperon motion should be defined such that the maximum amplitude of the fliperon tip is equal to the boundary layer thickness. Larger amplitudes did not lead to an additional improvement of the lift coefficient, while too small amplitudes did not improve the lift coefficient at all. On the NACA-0015 airfoil the maximum increase in lift coefficient obtained by the application of a fliperon was 20% with respect to the uncontrolled situation. The corresponding momentum coefficient was 0.016, which makes the fliperon both an effective and an efficient method of ow control in this case. On the NLR7301 airfoil flap configuration the maximum increase in lift coefficient was 21.2%, with a corresponding momentum coefficient of 0.144. Although the fliperon is still effective in this case, the momentum is now used less efficiently compared to other types of active ow control. Here the advantage of the fliperon is that it is less complex than several other ow control methods. There are many ways in which the current research can be continued. In future numerical research it would be interesting to perform a large eddy simulation to investigate the influence of the cavity shape on the produced vortices in more detail. Further it is recommended to investigate the effect of different fliperon motions. Since the current research has shown the effectiveness of the fliperon as ow control device, the risk of a wind tunnel experiment is reduced. In such an experiment the simulations can be validated, and the optimal frequency and amplitude ratio can be determined more accurately. Also the influence of 3D effects can be investigated. Furthermore the efficiency of the fliperon can be determined more accurately by measuring the required power.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); De Rouffignac, E. (mentor)","2009","Carbonated water flooding (CWF) is an enhanced oil recovery method where an oil reservoir is flooded with water containing dissolved CO2. The CO2 is then transferred into the oil phase leading to the swelling of the oil and to the reduction of its viscosity. This method was proven by several field trials but did not reach the status of a routine application. Its main limitation, in comparison to plain CO2 flooding or Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG), is its delayed response in oil production. Low frequency EM heating, has been applied in the field since the 1960’s and could be used to precondition the reservoir and accelerate the process and possibly increase the recovery factor. This thesis investigates the potential of combining CWF with electromagnetic (EM) heating to enhance the recovery of heavy oil reservoirs. Several scenarios involving the EM heating of the reservoir for several months few months prior to operating in commingling with CWF have been considered. The reservoir simulations show that an appropriate selection of the EM heating strategy leads to well-distributed temperatures increase in the reservoir. This leads to a more uniform decrease of the oil viscosity. Combination of EM heating increases appreciably oil production due to synergistic effects of heating and CO2 transfer into the oil. Earlier response in oil production can be achieved by an optimized CO2:water slug size and temperature. An effective scheme for EM heating and best CO2:water slug size are recommended to achieve highest recovery and better economics.","Electromagnetic heating; carbonated water flooding; simulation in STARS; heavy oil recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

The study focuses on optimization of design parameters and climate-based indoor temperature standards. Previous studies in the energy efficiency in buildings in hot and humid climates used the PMV-Fanger Model as a reference for the indoor thermal comfort but field studies have shown that it does not adequately satisfy the requirements of thermal comfort in these regions. Field study results for the thermal comfort in hot and humid climates based on the Humphrey’s equations were applied for comparison of energy efficiency and used to define the indoor thermal comfort limits for both free-running (FRB) and air-conditioned buildings (ACB). Parametric models were generated and used to investigate the influence of various design parameters in terms of the indoor thermal comfort and cooling energy demand. Comparative analysis was done with both Nicols/Humphrey’s and ATG (Adaptive temperature limits) method. The study shows that, design parameters have a potential of keeping the indoor thermal comfort of a FRB below the maximum limit of 80% acceptability for 90% of annual office working hours and reduce the annual cooling energy demand by 13% to 18%. Further analysis shows that the indoor thermal comfort of a FRB is inversely proportional to the total thermal transmittance (?) of the façade construction. From the analysis of parametric models, it can be concluded that design parameters have significant influence on the indoor thermal comfort and reduction of cooling energy demand for both FRB and ACB respectively. The use of various design parameters in buildings in a hot and humid climate is recommended as a means to regulate the indoor thermal comfort and lower the cooling energy demand.","Adaptive temperature limits; Design Parameters; Free-running buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Building Technology","","","",""

Features were extracted by using an optimal estimation optical flow method coupled with a physical (muscle) model describing the facial structure. The muscle action patterns are used for analysis, recognition, and synthesis of facial expressions. In the thesis the main approaches to facial expression recognition of dynamic images are designed considering three main parts: 1) Region of Interest Selection, 2) Feature Extraction, and 3) Image Classification. Bayesian Networks are a powerful and flexible methodology for representing and computing with probabilistic models of a stochastic process. In the past decade, there has been increasing interest in applying them to practical problems, and this thesis shows that they can be used effectively in the field of automatic AU’s recognition. In past decade optical flows have been used to either model muscle activities or estimate the displacements of feature points but in this thesis we defined nine regions of interest (ROI) which contains the most complex motion by using entropy maximum algorithm. Furthermore, the results were statistically analyzed by compass diagrams to find out the major ranges of directions and velocities of vector flows in each ROI. We found that for the six basic emotions, the ROI are different, so we did not consider all of nine regions for every emotion because of the complexity of our model. Furthermore, we present a methodology for obtaining the BN structure, learning the parameters and inference, including issues such as the discretization of continuous variables. Finally, we apply the BN model to recognize single Action Units (AUs) and some important AU combinations.

By formally recording this knowledge, it becomes easier to exchange information between workflows. To make the information useful we created mappings from SFRL to function point counts based on the NESMA specification and to an initial system specification based on the UML components method. Also, we mapped the information in a UML components specification back to SFRL. These mappings were implemented in a model transformation language.

(mentor)","2009","The effect of introducing an air film around a submerged water jet is examined in laboratory experiments. The objective is to reduce the friction forces between the water jet and the ambient fluid, making a jet potentially more effective at a larger distance. The test are conducted at a physical scale comparable to dredging practise, contrary to earlier experiments reported in the literature, where small scale jets are tested. During the tests the development of the jet was measured in axial and radial direction. The jet pressure and air discharge are varied, leading to a number of combinations of jet pressures and air discharges. The results showed that also at this scale the development of the water jet is influenced by the air film, although not as much as in the earlier experiments. Governing parameters have been established. Examples are the volume, mass and momentum ratios between the air flow and water flow. The ratios of the air flow and water flow are not in the same order if the comparison is made between the large and small scale water jets. Relatively less air was added in the test of a water jet at the scale used in dredging practise. Adding air around a water jet has a positive effect on the development of a water jet, if enough air is added. With increasing size of the nozzle diameter, more air has to be injected to create an effective air film. If enough air is added to create an effective air film, the effect is observed at very large axial distances. A description of this type of jets is given based on the description of Yahiro and Yoshida (1974) of water jets surrounded by an air film and the description of Rajaratnam (1976) of submerged water jets. The total amount of energy of the water jet and air film can also be used to create a water jet without an air film. A water jet without an air film with the same total amount of energy does not result in the same velocity increase as observed if an air film is created.","water jet; air film; experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Veel ouders genieten weinig van hun vrije tijd tijdens recreatie, omdat ze hun waardevolle kinderen niet uit het oog willen verliezen. Ze zijn continu bezig met deze taak. Om deze last een stuk te doen verminderen is het Childfinder systeem in ontwikkeling. Het doel van het onderzoek binnen deze deelthesis is uit te zoeken welke methoden er allemaal zijn, welke methode het probleem het beste aanpakt om het kind te lokaliseren, deze methode te implementeren en de effciëntie ervan te evalueren. De andere twee deelgroepen houden zich bezig met het uitzoeken van de beste hardware en het minimaliseren van de multipath. Het lokaliseren van een target in een omgeving heet positionering, het bepalen van de richting en de afstand tot een target. De positionering van het kind wordt in dit onderzoek mogelijk gemaakt door de richting naar het kind te bepalen en door te bepalen of het kind zich binnen of buiten de veilige zone bevindt. Wanneer het kind buiten de veilige zone is, zorgt het systeem ervoor dat de ouder gealarmeerd raakt en geeft ook de richting aan waarin het kind zich bevindt. Om deze taak te kunnen realiseren is het nodig om eerst alle eigenschappen en de eisen van het systeem op een rijtje te zetten. Vervolgens worden de belangrijkste omgevingsfactoren bekeken, deze zijn immers essentieel wanneer men een goede methode wil ontwikkelen. De omgevingsfactoren hebben grote invloed op de eigenschap van het kanaal. Deze eigenschappen van het kanaal zijn pathloss: verzwakking van het signaal tot de ontvanger en de multipath, een signaal dat via verschillende reacties binnenkomt bij de ontvanger. Er zijn vele positioneringstechnieken beschikbaar. Deze kunnen verdeeld worden in twee categoriën: afstandsbepaling en hoek bepaling. De manieren om de afstand te benaderen zijn RSS (Received Signal Strengt), dat handig gebruik maakt van de Pathloss en TOA (Time Of Arrival). De manieren om een hoek te benaderen zijn TDOA (Time Difference Of Arrival) en de 'fase verschil' methode. De voordelen en de nadelen van deze technieken zijn onderzocht met een opstelling die gebaseerd is op het ultra-wideband signaal (UWB). Een ultra-wideband signaal heeft een te grote bandbreedte en bevat dus ook de narrowband frequenties waardoor het onderzoek naar het narrowband signaal ook mogelijk is geworden. Er zijn ook verschillende manieren om deze parameters te interpreteren om tot een afstand of een hoek te komen. Mapping is de belangrijkste mathematische methode, deze kent meerdere varianten, k-NN of neurale netwerk methode zijn hier twee van. Mapping methode maakt tevens positief gebruik van de Multipath, dat in meeste gevallen als iets negatiefs wordt gezien. Er kan ook met alleen hoekmetingen een afstand benaderd worden, of met alleen afstandsmetingen een hoek. Deze methode worden ook behandeld en heten geometrische benaderingen. De mathematische benadering en de geometrische benadering kennen wel beperkingen: ze zijn niet implementeerbaar in een mobiel of compact systeem. Wanneer de narrowband techniek met de UWB techniek vergleken wordt, is te zien dat de UWB techniek betere resultaten genereert. Vooral de resultaten bij het benaderen van afstand worden met UWB vele malen nauwkeuriger gemaakt dan de RSS methode. Hoekbenaderingen met narrowband komen wel in de buurt van UWB, maar het is te zien dat bij een NLOS situatie, de UWB techniek toch betere resultaten genereert. Van de verschillende methodes die gebruikt kunnen worden voor positionering van een kind, zijn er maar een paar gebruikbaar. De beperkingen zijn de afmetingen van het systeem, het doel van het systeem en de kosten. De afmetingen van het systeem zijn fysische beperkingen waar weinig aan veranderd kan worden. Het doel is ook vastgesteld. Omdat ouders de klanten zijn van een dergelijk systeem, mogen de kosten ook niet hoog oplopen. Na afweging van deze beperkingen is gekozen om de RSS-methode voor afstand en de 'fase verschil'-methode voor de hoek te gebruiken. Met deze twee methodes kan de afstand en hoek met de eisen dat in de inleiding staat beschreven behaald worden. Wel is de aanbeveling om in de toekomst, gebruik te maken van UWB-techniek. De verwachting is dat dit systeem vele malen goedkoper geproduceerd zal worden dan dat het op dit moment gebeurt.","RFID; Ranging","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Elektrotechniek","","","",""

Insight into the formation of sandwaves is necessary to understand and predict the processes that control sand transport and sedimentation patterns in San Francisco Bay. When aiming at predicting large scale morphodynamic processes within a time span of years, a numerical model is imperative. The aim of this research is to study the capability of DELFT3D to model the sandwaves using a 2Dv-model, with emphasis on assessing the formation mechanisms. The model is built using a sinusoidal shaped bed level and flow velocities with large temporal variations (max. of 2.00 ms-1). Analysis of results focuses on two main aspects: sandwave equilibrium and residual flow patterns for one tidal cycle. Model results show that equilibrium in sandwave height is found for relatively large scale lengths (order of 100 m) and that modelled sandwaves show different growth and decay rates for steeper slopes and higher velocities. Stability in sandwave development is contributed mainly to a term which hinders the formation of steep slopes resulting in a so called equilibrium slope angle, and a growing term based on the residual near-bed current velocity. For the studied range of sandwave lengths, heights were found to be independent of the local water depth. And increasing flow velocities only allow the largest dimensions to reach equilibrium. Growth in height is found to be mainly caused by the hindering crest velocity term, being not large enough to compensate for the high near-bed upslope velocities. Decay in height is mainly attributed to asymmetric residual current flow, due to an initial bed level steepness that is too gentle.","San Francisco; sandwave; residual flow; equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

WSNs are ad-hoc wireless networks of small form-factor, embedded nodes with limited memory and processor power. Further, they are often battery powered, meaning that energy use must be kept to a minimum. A diagnoser design is proposed that uses the distributed nature of WSNs to find initial symptoms based on a local model, while leaving the more complex computations required to combine these symptoms to a more powerful central sink computer.

The model used in the proof of concept application created during the work on this thesis did have some problems in dense networks, showing that care must be taken when crafting the model to ensure a successful deployment.","model-based diagnosis; diagnosis; wireless sensor networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Budiarjo, I. (mentor); Hayes, V. (mentor)","2009","The IEEE 802.11n standard is a promising technology for near future Wireless LAN's. By utilizing enhanced techniques like MIMO communication and OFDM digital modulation extremely high data rates over large distances are possible for wireless communications. Predecessors like 802.11b/g standards are succesfully outnumbered and a strong competitor to other rising WLAN techniques e.g., UWB and Wimax is born. With the rapid migration of 802.11n into WLAN a new scenario arises where 802.11n networks and other nearby located 802.11b/g/n networks operate simultaneously. Forced to share the medium, interference between the networks is often inevitable, causing performance degredation in such way that the promised maximum data rates and communcation distances cannot be guaranteed. The objective of this thesis is to study these interference scenarios and gain a clear understanding of the consequences and effects of interference on the performance of the networks under consideration. In this regard real life measurements are performed and an analysis has been carried out. Our main focus will be on an 802.11n WLAN operating within the range of another 802.11b/g/n WLAN. We will observe the dramatic impact on the performance of the networks with respect to network throughput and packet loss rate. Consequently, the results of our study will address the eminent interference problem that the rapid growing WLANs are facing.","802.11n; Interference; Medium sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","IRCTR, Telecommunications, Electrical Engineering","","","",""

This study deals with the feasibility of transporting a considerable part of this volume by using the sediment transport processes at the Texel Inlet. The morphological development of the dump of a significant volume of sediment in the deeper parts of the Texel Inlet has been examined. The amount of the dumped volume that sedimentates at the end of the Texel Inlet close to the Afsluitdijk determines the efficiency of the method. The Texel Inlet is a tidal inlet in the western part of the Dutch Wadden Sea.

This framework, together with the applications implemented with the goal of demonstrating and managing the capabilities of the distributed object library, is designed to provide users the capability of sharing and reusing information in a distributed fashion. Although a large number of ontology modeling languages exist, the problem of mapping knowledge from one modeling language onto another was placed outside the scope of this project, which resulted in Gellish being selected as the modeling language used to conceptualize the information stored at the distributed data stores. The need to classify ontology modeling languages, based on their subject and structure of conceptualization, resulted in the construction of the conceptualization graph. This graph is used to compare ontology modeling languages used within the building and construction industry, but also to motivate the aforementioned choice for Gellish as the modeling language used throughout the distributed object library. With the distributed object library framework and associated applications constructed, the final part of this thesis will conclude with the identification of limitations, based on tests performed with these applications, and present recommendations for improving the framework and applications where needed.","distributed object library; conceptualization graph; Gellish","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-06-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Parallel and Distributed Systems","","","",""

In Barbados the problem arose of lack of space for development on the existing shoreline. Therefore the project ""The Islands"" has been conceptualized. In front of the west coast of Barbados, a group of artificial islands will be created. On the islands there will be space for luxurious villas and hotels. The location of the islands is in the west of Barbados in front of the coast of Brighton Beach and Brandons Beach north of the Barbados Port. For the project ""The Islands"" already some initial work has been performed on basis of which an architect made a design for ""The Islands"". The design consists of a group of islands and some beach extensions. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of the different coastal components of the masterplan and to identify potential impacts of the proposed plan on the coastal environment. For the different parts of the islands the stability in different wave and current conditions has been researched. The main tool for this research was the engineering software package MIKE 21, developed by DHI. With this program calculations have been made to determine the wave climate at the project location and to determine the stability of several components in the design. With wave-energy spectra from a database based on numerical hindcasting, the long term wave climate around Barbados has been determined. With this a more detailed model for the project location with and without the islands has been run to get detailed wave data. After this a stability analysis has been executed to determine the short term stability of the beaches and other components during a swell and a hurricane event. Also a long term beach stability analysis has been executed with LITDRIFT. With the results of the models some conclusions have been drawn and some design modifications have been suggested, such as a revetment, some groynes and maintenance dredging.","resort; longshore transport; Cariben; Barbados","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Mestres, M. (mentor)","2009","This report contains the work of Stella Spyropoulou for the final MSc thesis for the Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management Erasmus Mundus Postgraduate diploma, with the help and supervision of the UPC (Universitat Polytechnica de Catalunya) staff Marc Mestres and Manel Grifoll. An effort is made in this thesis to identify dominating and driving factors of the water currents in the outer part of the Nervion Estuary located in the port of Bilbao area in Northern Spain. The findings of this work will assist, and is part of, a larger scale governmental project aiming to identify high risk scenarios and areas in the main ports of Spain and with a long term target to create detailed emergency plans in case of a pollution source in those ports. Real, raw campaign field data very recently obtained are used throughout this research, and a large part of this work was to make these raw data into useful, comprehensible set of graphs and figures. Several computer software are used for the simulation of the water velocities and the production of graphs, like the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and Matlab. After having successfully identified the driving forces and converted the raw data into a final set of useful information, a closer observation is made in order to point out the effects of the different weather, tidal and seasonal conditions. The most important conclusions found are that the estuary, especially in the river mouth are that the dispersion of the fresh water is due to advection than diffusion, ruling out strong water movement due to turbulences because of density differences. Another important observation is the very strong effect of the wind during calm seas while this effect eliminated when waves are present. The main driving force of the water currents, as expected, is the tidal force and the water velocities follow the central axis of the estuary. Another part of the thesis was to numerically simulate the water movement. From these simulations it was found that the most prone to persistent pollution section is the inner area of the harbour (South-East), however the areas with the higher risk of polluting the estuary is on the North-West and along the central axis of the estuary. This work has opened up many more aspects of the application of hydrodynamics observation and modelling and finally a set of research exercises should be carried further in order to complement this report and apply the findings into more practical applications. At the end of this report, the author provides a set of possible further exercises and research ideas for this particular case study of the Bilbao Harbour.","residence time; water quality; circulation; Bilbao","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Cobos, X.G. (mentor)","2009","The sport of surfing has increased tremendously in popularity in the last decade and surf breaks around the world are progressively getting overcrowded with surfers. This overcrowding is an annoyance to surfers themselves since surfing is an individualistic sport, one wave for one surfer. This coastal problem has been addressed by science through Artificial Surfing Reefs (ASR), however these are highly ambitious projects that haven’t been perfected. This thesis introduces and alternative way to approach the problem, which is to improve the conditions at the surf breaks that already exist. The objective of this thesis is to introduce Floating Wave Filters (FWF), which are floating structures anchored to the sea bottom that aim to block short-period waves and transmit long-period waves in order to improve surfing conditions. Short-period waves are generated by local winds, their periods do not exceed 4 seconds and wave heights are less than half a meter. Long-period waves refer to swell waves, with periods longer than 8-10 seconds and variable heights. In general the preferred conditions for surfing are long-period waves, light offshore wind or no wind and the right tide for the particular surf break. When the wind at the coast is onshore the conditions for surfing deteriorate for two reasons. The first reason is that waves will tend to spill instead of plunge and surfers prefer plunging waves. The second reason, which FWF address, is that as wind blows toward shore, short-period waves are formed and these waves mix with the long-period waves to tamper or ruin surfing conditions. The thesis gives a general description of the sport of surfing, discusses the role of surfing in Integrated Coastal Zone Management, describes coastal wind patterns, characterizes good surfing waves and gives the guidelines to perform an experiment with FWF in a wave flume.","surf conditions; floating breakwater; surf sport; surfing reef","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""
