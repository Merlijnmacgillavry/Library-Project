(mentor); De Borst, R. (mentor)","2004","Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are finite element techniques for the solution of partial differential equations. They allow shape functions which are discontinuous across inter-element edges. In principle, DG methods are ideally suited for hp-adaptivity, as they handle nonconforming meshes and varying-in-space polynomial-degree approximations with ease. Recently, DG formulations for elliptic problems have been put in a general framework of analysis. Although clarifying basic properties, the analysis does not warrant a clear preference. Specifically, none of the conventional DG formulations possesses a bilinear form that is coercive (and continuous) on an infinite-dimensional broken Sobolev space. Rather, bilinear forms are only weakly coercive or defined on subspaces only and employ stabilization parameters that typically increase unboundedly as the subspace is expanded, e.g., if the polynomial degree is increased. For hp-adaptation, coercivity is a fundamental property: By the classical Lax-Milgram theorem, any conforming discretization of a coercive formulation is stable, i.e., discrete approximations are well-posed and have a unique solution, irrespective of the specifics of the underlying approximation space. In this thesis we consider the one-dimensional Poisson problem and present a generic consistent conventional DG formulation. We show that conventional DG formulations are necessarily noncoercive. Moreover, we presents a new symmetric DG formulation which contains nonconventional edge terms based on element Green's functions and the data local to the edges. We show that the new DG formulation is coercive on H1(Ph), the space of functions that are piecewise in the H1 Sobolev space. Furthermore, we show that the new DG formulation and the classical Galerkin formulation are equivalent, that is, in the infinite-dimensional case they yield the same solution.","discontinuous galerkin; finite element method; elliptic problems; hp-adaptivity; coercivity","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Engineering Mechanics","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

Geconcludeerd kan worden uit dit onderzoek dat de gebruikte methode correct is volgens de toen geldende TAW-richtlijnen.

De vaarweg biedt toegang tot de havens van Buenos Aires, La Plata en een groot aantal bestemmingen gesitueerd aan de Paranivier. De Argentijnse economie is voor een groot deel afhankelijk van de export van agrarische producten. 75% van de georteerde goederen wordt per vrachtschip via het Rio de la Plata vervoerd naar bestemming over de hele wereld. Voorspellingen laten zien dat de verkeersintensiteit zal toenemen in de toekomst. De vaarweg van het Rio de la Plata heeft een totale lengte van 350 kilometer en wordt door baggeren op diepte gehouden voor de scheepvaart. Twee bedrijven, HidrovS.A. and Riovia S.A. zijn verantwoordelijk voor het beheer van de vaarweg. Via tolgelden, betaald door passerende vrachtschepen, worden hun activiteiten gefinancierd. Door de vaarweg heen gelden verschillende vaarregels. Deze regels schrijven voor hoe en waar schepen elkaar mogen passeren of inhalen en waar dit verboden is. Om te gehoorzaam aan deze regels worden schepen mogelijk gedwongen te wachten op wachtplaatsen of hun snelheid aan te passen. Zo ontstaan wachttijden die afhankelijk zijn van de regels en de verkeersintensiteit. Om te bestuderen hoe de stroom van schepen door de vaarweg zich ontwikkeld bij een toenemende verkeersintensiteit is het simulatiemodel Harboursim gebruikt. Dit model, ontwikkeld aan de TU Delft, simuleert hoe schepen door het systeem varen en registreert de wachttijden die ze ervaren door het gehoorzamen aan de verkeersregels. Met behulp van het simulatiemodel zijn studies gedaan naar de wachttijden bij verschillende scenarios. Gebaseerd op het verwachte aantal schepen in jaar 2020 zal de gemiddelde wachttijd per passerend schip toenemen. In verhouding tot de totale verblijftijd in de vaarweg van het Rio de la Plata is de toename klein. Gebaseerd op de uitkomsten van het model wordt de vaarweg in staat geacht de toekomstige verkeersintensiteit te kunnen verwerken. Het slot van de studie heeft zich gericht op de financi aspecten van het oplopen van vertraging door vrachtschepen. Het vertalen van vertraging naar kosten is complex en verdient verdere studie.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2004","This study focuses on the consequences of sea level rise on the tidal inlet of Norderneyer Seegat, which is located in the East Frisan Wadden Sea. The Norderneyer Seegat is located between the islands of Juist and Norderney in the North and the East Frisian mainland coast in the South. The Wadden Sea landscape is mainly shaped by the tides. The tides constantly transport huge amounts of water and within sediments, which are gradually deposited, forming both sublitoral and intertidal shoals. The shoals performing intertidal flats are only visible during low tide. At low tide, the water recedes in narrow channels. These tidal channels work as a distribution system for water and sediment. The volumes of channels (water) and flats (sediment) are assumed to tend to a dynamically equilibrium state. A rising sea level disturbs this equilibrium. Due to the sediment import into the basin, the flats are continuously growing following the sea level rise. For most of the tidal basins of the Wadden Sea, the net amount of sediment transport into the basin is adequate to compensate the effects of the present rate of sea level rise (1,5 mm/year). If this would not be the case, the whole landscape of the Wadden Sea would change. This would have serious consequences for the safety of the coastline against the sea, because the intertidal flats effects a significant attenuation on incoming waves. To investigate if the system is capable to adapt to the changes with a sea level rise being significant accelerated compared to present conditions, the numerical model ASMITA (Aggregated Scale Morphological Interaction between a Tidal inlet and the Adjacent coast, Stive and Wang, 1996) is applied. The ASMITA modeling concept is based on empirical equilibrium relations between intertidal flats, tidal channels and the ebb-tidal delta performing the morphodynamic elements of the Wadden Sea area. The empirical equations implemented in ASMITA contain of empirical parameters. These parameters depend on regional properties. A part of the study is spent to the determination of these empirical parameters for the Norderneyer Seegat. To determine these parameters, topographic and hydrodynamic datasets are used provided by the Coastal Research Station on the East Frisian Island of Norderney (Germany). After calibrating the ASMITA model it is possible to calculate the development of the intertidal flats and the channels of the Norderneyer Seegat, due to an observed averaged sea level rise of about 1,5 mm/year. The calculations are limited to the volumes of the elements of intertidal flats and tidal channels. Using reconstructions of historical morphological states of this area for the years 1650, 1750 and 1860, which have been developed at the Coastal Research Station, the results of the ASMITA model, are validated. After reproducing the trends of the evolution in this area over the past 350 years, predictions can be made about the consequences of scenarios with an accelerated sea level rise. This aims to contribute to an estimate of the consequences of global climate change or land subsidence. At the end of the study, conclusions are drawn, about the consequences of a increase in sea level rise for the tidal inlet of Norderneyer Seegat. Therefore, different scenarios of sea level rise are simulated. Besides this, data analysis and modeling long-term developments of large-scale morphologies is discussed. The report is finalized with some recommendations and aspects to be studied in future.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Its main tourist attraction is the beach, which is 5800 m long and rather narrow with a dry width of 10 to 20 m. The city is facing several problems regarding the beach that have a negative impact on tourism. The main problems are: the beach is overcrowded in summer and becomes entirely shaded in the mid-afternoon due to the many high-rise buildings along the beach. To resolve these problems the municipality of Balneário Camboriú wants to nourish the beach to a width of 100 m. The preliminary design of the beach nourishment was made by the Danish Hydraulic Institute DHI, who based their design on data measured by the Brazilian Hydraulic Institute INPH. The Vale do Itajaí University (UNIVALI) in Itajaí, eight kilometer north of Balneário Camboriú, thinks the design of DHI is incomplete and based on inappropriate data and fears that the municipality of Balneário Camboriú will carry out the proposed beach nourishment any without further investigation. In this project the design of DHI has been analysed and a new design of the nourishment has been made. First the morphodynamics of Camboriú Bay have been studied. The bay can be defined as a headland-bay with a parabolically shaped beach between two protruding headlands, formed by energetic swell waves from the southeast. The beach planform is in dynamic and close to static equilibrium, which means it is stable as long as sediment supply is maintained. Because the bay is rather indented, there is no sediment exchange with the surrounding area. The tide in Camboriú Bay has a small range and little influence, inducing very small currents. Therefore the beach of Balneário Carnboriú is wave dominated, except for the south, which is more sheltered from incoming waves. The beach has a very gentle slope and can be classified as dissipative. After the study of the morphodynamics the data needed for the design of the nourishment have been investigated. The DHI design is based on data from INPH, which has done measurements of the bathymetry, grain sizes, cross-shore beach profiles and waves in Camboriú Bay. UNIVALI has also done measurements of these parameters and, except for the bathymetry, both data show several differences. Considering the grain size, the results of INPH show a larger and more constant median sand diameter than the results of UNIVALI. The results of UNIVALI seem to be more reliable, because they took more samples, they are more experienced with measurements in Camboriú Bay and they measured a significantly smaller grain size in the south of the bay, with is plausible because in that area a small river, Rio Camboriú, flows into the bay. The cross-shore beach profiles measured by UNIVALI extend much further seawards than the ones measured by INPH, which only take a small part of the area that is influenced by the waves into account. Since for a beach nourishment the whole area where waves have influence on the cross-shore profile is important, again the data of UNIVALI are more useful. With regard to the wave data, both the measurements of INPH and of UNIVALI have drawbacks. UNVALI did wave measurements for almost a year but on Brava Beach, six km north of Balneário Camboriú, not in Camboriú Bay itself. INPH did do measurements in Camboriú Bay, but only for a period of two weeks, which is not sufficient for reliable wave measurements, as they admit themselves. This means there are no good wave data available for Camboriú Bay. In the design of the nourishment this problem can be circumvented by deriving the closure depth (the depth where the waves have no impact anymore on the beach profile) from the cross-shore profiles instead of from the wave data. Unlike INPH, UNIVALI has also done research on a possible borrow area that serves as a sand source for the nourishment. This area is located 20 km east of Balneário Camboriú and has sand characteristics that are comparable to those of the beach in Balneário Camboriú. After the investigation of the relevant data, the nourishment design of DHI has been analysed, DHI used the method of Dean, a well-known method for designing beach nourishments. In their design the beach is widened with 100 m and the initial slope of the nourished beach is 1:20. This results in a final beach width after the profile equilibration (due to wave action) of about 40 to 100 m at MSL +0,7 m, depending on the location and the size of the borrow sand. The total amount of sand necessary for this design is 1,8 million m3. Since the design of DHI is based on data from INPH that are not very reliable or accurate, their design contains several uncertainties. Besides they used a constant closure depth of MSL -3 m along the entire beach, which is strange because the wave activity varies between the north and the south. Therefore the design of DHI has been verified with the use of the data from UNIVALI. It turned out that the constant closure depth assumed by DHI (instead of a variable closure depth) coincidentally has no significant impact on the necessary amount of sand; only the distribution of sand along the beach changes. Also, it turned out that if the DHI design were based on the beach profiles measured by UNIVALI, the total fill volume would be almost 30% larger, which is probably caused by the fact that the original beach width measured by UNIVALI is smaller than the one measured by INPH. The reason for the latter is unclear. Finally, it turned out that the final equilibrated beach width would be very different if DHI used the grain sizes obtained by UNIVALI instead of by INPH. Because of the several uncertainties in both the data measured by INPH and the nourishment design of DHI, a new design of the nourishment has been made based on the data from UNIVALI, which are more appropriate. In the new design the beach is extended to a final equilibrated width of 100 m. To maintain a gentle slope, which induces a wide surf zone with good conditions for wave surfing (this will be discussed below), the beach is nourished with compatible sand, which means the grain size distributions of the borrow sand and the native sand are comparable. Since it is not known at what height the municipality of Balneário Camboriú wants to have a beach of 100 m wide, two alternatives have been investigated: one with a final beach width of 100 m at MSL +0,7 m and one with a final beach width of 100 m at MSL +2,5 m. In both alternatives the initial slope of the nourished beach is 1:39. The amount of sand necessary for the first alternative is 2,33 million m3, which is 0,5 million m3 more than in the design of DHI, but with the result that the (equilibrated) beach will be wider and the slope much more gentle. The stability of the planform of the nourished beach will be influenced by the presence of the jetty constructed in the south of Balneário Camboriú in 2004. It will block sediment supply from Rio Camboriú to the beach, which will probably result in erosion, since the beach is for the most part in dynamic equilibrium. To prevent erosion to the new beach, the concept of headland control has been applied. By relocating the diffraction point in the north and the south of the bay, the predicted shoreline in static equilibrium, corresponding with the new diffraction points, will coincide with the shoreline of the nourished beach. This can be achieved by the construction of a 230 m long jetty in the south, or the extension of the existing jetty in the south, and the construction of a 150 m long jetty in the north. As mentioned before, the gentle beach slope in Balneário Camboriú induces a wide surf zone with good surfing conditions, especially for beginning surfers. However, the nourishment design of DHI will result in a much steeper beach, leading to a narrower surf zone. To improve the surfing conditions after the nourishment, it is possible to construct an artificial surf reef on which optimal surfing conditions can be created. In this project a design of such a reef in Balneário Camboriú has been made as well. Since a surf reef is a relatively unknown subject, a literature study on surf reefs was carried out first. This has resulted in an extensive description of the creation of good surfing rides and the wave breaking types favoured by surfers. The main parameters in describing a surfing wave are the wave breaker height, the peel angle, the breaking intensity and the wave section length. ""Short boarders"", who make up the majority of surfers in Balneário Camboriú, favour high waves with an extreme breaking intensity and a long surfing ride. For the creation of good surfing waves, it is necessary to alter the existing bathymetry. This is done by the various components of a surf reef, each in a different way and on a different scale. By adjusting the configuration of the components, the four surfing wave parameters can be influenced such that the desired surfing conditions are created. The most common construction method for artificial surf reefs is the use of sand filled geotextile bags. The main reasons why this method is often preferred to other methods are the lower construction costs and the possibility to modify and optimise the reef after construction. An example of an artificial surf reef constructed with sand filled geotextile bags is the Narrowneck surf reef in Australia. This reef forms the basis for the design of the artificial surf reef in Balneário Camboriú. With the knowledge obtained in the literature study, a design of the surf reef in Balneário Camboriú has been made. Two locations were found to be the most suitable for the construction of the surf reef. The first location is on a rocky outcrop in the north of Camboriú Bay, where the water depth is small and the waves are the highest thanks to convergence and shoaling. The second location is situated between the first location and the beach. Two alternative surf reefs, alternative A and alternative B (one on each location), have been investigated. With the help of MIKE 21 the wave propagation on both alternatives has been modelled. To determine the best alternative they were judged on five criteria. Alternative B on the rocky outcrop proved to be the best option. This alternative is cheaper and creates better surfing conditions than alternative A. Besides,for alternative B the probability of the formation of a tombolo behind the surf reef is negligible, while for alternative A, which is much closer to the coast, this probability is very large. Finally, the costs of the new design of the beach nourishment and the artificial surf reef in Balneário Camboriú have been estimated. The beach nourishment will cost approximately 13 million euros and the construction of the surf reef approximately 1 million euros.","Balneário Camboriú; nourishment; beach nourishment; artificial surf reef; beach design","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-26.991208, -48.621609"
