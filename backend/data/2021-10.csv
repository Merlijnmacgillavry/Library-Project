(mentor); Boskos, D. (graduation committee); Feng, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Uncertainty can be defined as imperfect or unknown information arising in a stochastic environment. Due to the very limited knowledge, it is difficult to propagate and quantify various uncertainties affecting the system to its next step. As a result, it has been a challenge to consider multiple uncertainties affecting the system in various fields, such as Fault Detection and Diagnosis. Fault detection has been an essential part of a large industrial and manufacturing system to take a proper corrective measure into account in a case of unexpected behavior. However, determining a robust threshold bound for fault detection is a big challenge. Several uncertainties affect the system (such as parametric uncertainties, experimental uncertainties, process noise, measurement noise, etc.). Ignoring the effects of various uncertainties (i.e., Deterministic Bound) can lead to a false alarm.<br/><br/>Therefore, to design a robust threshold probabilistic-based technique is used where all unknown parameters are taken into account. However, the major problem lies in propagating these unknown parameters into the next time step with their limited knowledge. A novel Message Passage Bilinear Uncertainty Propagation (MPBUP) algorithm is being proposed, which is used to quantify and propagate various uncertainties affecting the dynamical system into the next time step. The main aim of the algorithm is to quantify and propagate various uncertain parameters affecting the system at each time step. Uncertainty is propagated in terms of mean and covariance at each algorithm iteration to find the overall effect. Therefore the primary research is to design and validate the proposed algorithm and to check the algorithm can be used to determine a probabilistic threshold.<br/><br/> In the report, a detailed explanation of the algorithm for a trivial example is presented. The algorithm is then developed and implemented in MATLAB. Next, validation of the output generated through the algorithm is performed using Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, various analyses based on the MC simulation are discussed to support the results generated through the algorithm. An innovative approach is also discussed to extend the polynomial system algorithm as the proposed algorithm is limited to the bilinear system.<br/><br/>Further, a detailed explanation is given on applying the algorithm on a general state-space model in terms of mathematics involved, which is further extended on applying the algorithm on a real-time application such as the Four Tank System. After successfully implementing the algorithm on the Four Tank System, the algorithm is used to propagate uncertainty into the dynamical system to determine the robust threshold. A robust threshold is found considering the effect of various uncertainty. The threshold found using the proposed algorithm is dynamic as it evolves based upon the state dynamics and satisfies the required condition. As a result presented algorithm satisfy all the requirement and can also be used in other applications. The algorithm was analyzed based upon various criteria to conclude this thesis, and a comparative study is conducted.","uncertainty propagation; Probabilistic Threshold; Fault detection; Graphical Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Swiss watches are known around the world as a luxury product. Due to the fact that the product is considered a status symbol of wealth the market for counterfeit watches is a continuing concern of the industry. Historically the watches have primarily been manufactured in Switzerland. In recent years, however, manufacturing is done all over the world due to the shortage of trained labour in Switzerland. The need for managing the flow of partial products and authenticity has therefore increased. Collaboration in supply chain management allows participants to obtain the benefits of cooperation using each other's expertise to develop a product. The benefits include the sharing of knowledge or resources to create products more economically than individually. Collaboration encounters challenges such as vast geological distances between participants and large amounts of shared information. In a supply chain, many participants contribute information about a resource. In our research scenario, the resource information is co-owned by all contributing participants and includes a range of relevant information such as transportation documents and product patents. Some of this information is private and should only be shared on a need-to-know basis. In our research, we aim to design a protocol that supports the privacy of each owner's partial access decision while maintaining verifiability in a distributed system. We achieve our goal by using an owner-controlled blockchain to create a shared platform for data control and access management. A part of the platform is a network of trusted operators to evaluate the access decision for each owner. Participants on the blockchain can make requests to the operators to access information. During an access request an operator requests the relevant access policy for the request, evaluates it and sends the result to the owner. The owner validates the results by signing the partial decision if they agree with the operator. The operators collect partial decisions of the owners before reaching a final decision using a consensus mechanism. All final access decisions are stored on a blockchain for verification.<br/><br/>Based on a comparative evaluation of the related work, we found that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first protocol that designs and evaluates a blockchain-based access control system with the focus on verifiable access decisions of co-owned resources. In our evaluation, we found that the protocol performed efficiently regarding time and communication complexity but had a large memory overhead. We believe that the proposed problem and protocol has relevance in the real world in scenarios where many entities contribute and need access to information regarding a shared resource.","Access control; Blockchain; Collaborative ownership; Supply chain management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

(mentor); Langeveld, J.G. (graduation committee); Abraham, E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Urban Drainage Systems (UDS) are one of the most vital yet, complex infrastructures that support people's livelihood in urban areas. However, due to their mainly underground infrastructure and complexity, the planning and management of UDS are usually associated with high investment, which stakeholders sometimes overlook. As long-lived infrastructures, UDS’s limited capability is being put under constantly increasing pressures. Amongst the pressures, the global effects of climate change on rainfall extremes is the most important. As climate change affects the rainfall extremes and the overall hourly and daily rainfall events, urban flooding issues are becoming more costly to manage. Several rehabilitation efforts have been made to address this issue with minimum cost and optimal performance in flood reduction by increasing the resiliency of UDS in order to minimise the duration and magnitude of urban flooding. <br/><br/>Rehabilitation of UDS can be done in several ways, including implementing Green-Blue-Grey Infrastructures (G-B-G measures). The combination of G-B-G measures can increase the resiliency of the UDS to withstand higher intensity rainfall by reducing both the peak flow and enlarging the capacity of the UDS system. Therefore, this thesis aims to develop a method to find the optimal way to rehabilitate an existing UDS to reduce the risk of flooding under the climate change rainfall scenarios. <br/><br/>The method developed coupled a hydrodynamic model, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal solution to rehabilitate UDS. The effect of climate change was incorporated by simulating the solutions using composite design storms that represent the increase in hourly and daily rainfall extremes for 2030, 2050, and 2085. The objective function of this optimisation problem becomes the minimisation of the total cost to implement the measures for the rehabilitation of UDS, under the constraint that no flooding can happen on the system when tested against the climate change rainfall scenarios. Therefore, the decision variables of this optimisation are the size and location for each implemented measure, while the penalty cost is associated with the cost of each m3 of flooding. <br/><br/>Based on the analysis of the case study, the most appropriate Green-Blue measures to be implemented is Rain Barrels, Infiltration Trenches, and Pervious Pavements. Meanwhile, for grey measures, it is best to consider pipe and pump replacements and increasing the CSOs’ weirs. The optimisation was done using the developed formal method and manual trial-and-error. The results of the formal optimisation have been confirmed to outperform the result from manual optimisation using the traditional trial-and-error method. The optimal solutions proved that a combination of both grey and G-B measures produced the lowest cost to reduce flooding. Although the solutions can be adapted over time from 2030 until 2085, the results show that adaptive solutions might not be needed when the solution for 2085 is better implemented from the year 2030. Overall, it can be projected that in the future, the combination of G-B-G measures can produce an economically optimal solution to be implemented in order to achieve zero floodings in the case study location.","Urban Drainage; Optimisation; Climate Change Adaptation; Rehabilitation; SWMM; Genetic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Additionally, variable-step integration of the orbital state averages improved propagation speed. The implemented optimization tool was applied to the GTO to GEO transfer problem, demonstrating improved convergence compared to the previous authors, with the exception of eclipse conditions, requiring further verification. Additionally, a transfer with significant plane changes to a space debris object in LEO was investigated, including oblateness and aerodynamic perturbations.

(graduation committee); Brard, Bryan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In earlier times the climate crisis was ignored. However, these days it is acknowledged as one of the most important challenges the world is facing. With increased awareness of anthropogenic emissions, most sectors are changing rapidly. One of those sectors is the offshore wind energy sector. As a consequence of the Paris Climate Agreement, the European Commission adoptedan offshore renewable strategy that aims to install at least 60 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and up to 300 GW by 2050. With the increasing capacity of offshore wind being constructed, new wind farms will move gradually further offshore. This, therefore, requires a need for significant investments in large-scale wind farms and in the required grid infrastructure to be able to transmit the large amounts of electricity produced offshore to the consumers onshore.Thus the need for cost-efficient integration of the North Sea transmission arises. Currently, existing offshore wind farms are being investigated as potential gateways in order to achieve this offshore transmission network integration in a cost-efficient manner.In this master thesis project, the effects of various future connection schemes and market setups on the business cases of offshore wind farms were investigated. The study focuses on a location in the North Sea close with similar geographical characteristics as a large sandbank called the Doggerbank. First, a literature study was performed to obtain background knowledge about the offshore situation. Relevant assets were identified, multiple offshore gridtypologies were found and different offshore governance models and market setups have been identified. In addition, the theoretical background of constructing a business case for offshore wind farms from a Dutch and British perspective was explored. The main cost drivers were identified and can be distinguished in capital expenditures and operational expenditures. In addition, these cost categories were quantified in order to set up a business case for an offshore wind farmat a specified location. The cost category taking up most of the investment was found to be the grid connection, taking approximately 30% of the total investments. In addition, British built wind farms require more initial investment with respect to the Dutch wind farms, due to a difference in governance models between the countries. Next, the methods by which a wind farm can collect income was explored. Various categories were identified being; revenueby selling the commodity, power purchase agreement, financial support schemes and green certificates. Historical wind data was used to determine a wind profile. In addition, the historical market data was added to quantify the cash flow of an offshore wind farm. Last, an expression of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) was found for a Dutch and British constructed offshore wind farm respectively.To obtain insights into the effects of the North Sea transmission integration on the business case of offshore wind farms, a scenario-based modelling &amp; simulation approach was adopted. First, a conceptual model has been developed. This was done by, first, identifying the situationin which the problem occurs and second, determining the modelling scope. Next, the in- and outputs were explained and the simplifications used for the model were presented accordingly. Various scenarios were developed in order to be able to simulate distinct future situations in which a wind farm may be required to operate. These system changes are predominantly caused by different connection scenarios or by a change in market setups. First, a base model was developed, to understand the basic operations of a wind farm. Next, the reference case using a Dutch and British wind farm connected to their own national electricity market was simulated that represents the current situation of existing offshore wind farms. Then, a cross-border connection was added to the reference case under the current home market setup. Subsequently, a change in market setup, the offshore bidding zone, was introduced.The first insights were obtained through simulation of the reference case, which represents the current situation. Large wind farm projects far from shore were found to be most likely still dependent on support through subsidy schemes. This holds for both a Dutch and British perspective regarding the construction. The first scenario on which the effects were simulated, describes a situation in which a connection to a foreign market is introduced to the reference case. The results of these simulations show no substantial changes in the cash flow of theoffshore wind farms. However, large amounts of costs imposed on society were identified under this scenario. When the offshore bidding zone was introduced as a new market setups in a cross-border connection various results were found. First, for a Dutch wind farm in this connection and under this market setup, the revenues tent to increase with respect to the reference case. However, for a British wind farm a clear decline in the collected revenues by the wind farm developers was observed. Nevertheless, due to the regulatory conflicts thatwere identified in the cross-border connection scenario under the current home market setup, a change to the offshore bidding zone market setup seems desirable. This implies that under current regulation, the offshore bidding zone market setup shows no issues being compliant with EU legislation and National regulation.An additional step was performed in this master thesis project, that adopts the objective to identify instruments that could mitigate these declines in revenues under an offshore bidding zone market setup. These instruments are regarded as mitigation options or mitigation schemes. The academic method of a policy scorecard was adopted, and additional desk research was performed to identify current proposals for mitigation schemes in the literature. Eight mitigation schemes were found from which seven were applicable to an offshore biddingzone market setup. These could be distinguished into support through operations and through regulatory changes. It was found that, within the scope of this research, which is looking into the economic effects and the feasibility of the identified mitigation schemes, the Contract for Difference scheme seems to be the best choice as it provides stability for the wind farm developers, and is the most cost-efficient option with respect to society. Good alternatives were identified to be the redistribution of congestion income and granting windfarm developers a so-called ""Transmission System Operator -light"" certificate that allows for a share in the congestion income. However, there is a broader political impact, in terms of financial budget requirements on a member state level, general public support for support schemes and overall effectiveness of support schemes in broader policy objectives. As a consequence, it is recommended for future research to further investigate different domains than the economically and feasibility domains that have been presented in this research. In order to solve the current issue, thesedomains require additional investigated to obtain this broader perspective and to eventually be able to make political decisions.","Renewable Support Schemes; Offshore Grids; Energy policy and regulation; Hybrid offshore projects; Offshore wind; Interconnector; Transmssion system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Previous research concentrates on the effect of a centralised route guidance system when every vehicle participates and all vehicles have perfect knowledge of the traffic state. This is not the real case with human drivers and multiple service providers and the impact of cooperation may be limited. This study combines habitual driving behaviour, the effect of the quality of information and a congestion avoiding user optimum algorithm to quantify the impact of a centralised route guidance system. The congestion avoiding user optimum algorithm will add a perceived time penalty to all routes with links above a certain intensity/capacity ratio to avoid choosing the congested route. The cooperation is described by the coordinated approach model of the SOCRATES²·⁰ project. In this model, the cooperation is organised by an intermediary who takes on the management tasks. Because a lack of commitment could be a problem for the success of the system, the services of the intermediary can be regulated with four regulation strategies starting with no regulation to regulation for both service providers and road users. The impact is determined with the dynamic macroscopic traffic model MARPLE. The result shows that without commitment the system does not improve the traffic state. For the maximum potential of the system, it must be fully regulated for both service providers and road users. Although with only the commitment of service providers, there is already a positive impact on the traffic flow and in less complex networks it can already solve all congestion.","Centralised route guidance; Congestion avoiding; Traffic simulation; MARPLE; Connected vehicles; Cooperative traffic management; Social routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Bazilinskyy, P. (mentor); Driessen, T. (mentor); Happee, R.

Therefore gaining a better understanding of the nature of this interaction with a passenger is crucial. Additionally, drivers and passengers acquire nearly identical visual information from the driving scene. As a result, synchronised behaviour may occur. The driver-passenger synchrony may provide additional information on driver-passenger interactions. This led to the aim of the current study: The identification of synchrony in head orientation and movement between drivers and passengers for various road types and cornering events. This study was based on real-world driving data. The head angle (orientation) and angular velocity (movement) of all three principal axes (pitch, roll, and yaw) were analysed for synchrony. <br/><br/>The following methods were applied for the identification of driver-passenger synchrony. The head angles of drivers and passengers were detected using OpenFace 2.0, a video-based pose estimation method. Second, the windowed cross-lagged correlation (WCLC), a linear approach for synchrony identification, was applied. Next, two distinct facets of synchrony were measured. The first facet was determining the frequency of synchrony derived by the peak-picking algorithm developed by Altmann (2013). The frequency of synchrony was summarised as the percentage of synchrony that occurred over the measured road segment. The second facet of synchrony studied was the strength of synchrony with the help of the peak-picking algorithm developed by Boker et al. (2002). This peak-picking algorithm searches for the maximum peak correlation at every window of the WCLC. Then all maximum peak correlations were averaged into a single mean peak correlation per road segment or cornering event. Since behavioural synchrony could appear by chance, the results of the peak-picking algorithms were compared to pseudosynchrony. The first hypothesis states that it is possible to distinguish detected synchrony from pseudosynchrony of driver’s and passenger’s head angle and angular velocity. Secondly, it is hypothesised that more synchrony is detected in the urban road type than outside built-up areas- and highway road types. <br/> <br/>The results showed that differentiation between the detected synchrony and pseudosynchrony could be made for the analysis on the total route for almost all head angles and angular velocity for the frequency- and strength of synchrony. Furthermore, the analysis on the different road types, revealed that the identified synchrony could be differentiated from pseudosynchrony for almost all urban road segments. The findings on the other road types were mixed. It can be concluded from these research results that synchronisation has been identified for the urban road type. The road types where the detected synchrony was not significantly different from pseudosynchrony could indicate that there was no synchrony present or that the applied methods were unable to capture the driver-passenger synchrony. Synchrony identification in cornering events revealed no observable patterns. As a result, no conclusions on the cornering events could be formed. The second hypothesis could only be tested for one condition, since the identified synchrony could not be differentiated from pseudosynchrony for all the required road types for the second hypothesis. The result showed no significant difference between the urban road type compared to the built-up areas and highway road types for the pitch–angular velocity.<br/> <br/>According to this study, drivers and passengers exhibited synchronisation in their head orientations and movements along particular road segments. However, more research is needed to truly comprehend the synchronised behaviour of drivers and passengers. A good place to start is for a study that looks into the relation between synchronous behaviour and the impact on driver safety as a result of the passenger's presence.","Synchrony; Driver-passenger interaction; Head orientation; Head movement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Compliant alignment mechanisms can be used to meet these tolerances.

Metal 3D printing (SLM) is a newer manufacturing method that can produce complex geometries in a large design space with unique limitations but has no extensive library of solutions.

These constraint combinations and tools to develop them into building blocks are presented as tables with geometries and a flowchart describing their use. The design method is demonstrated by applying it towards the development of a compact, low-mass mechanism with three independent alignment stages. FEM analysis and a prototype in Ti6Al4V are used to explore some of the properties and manufacturability of this demonstration case.","metal 3D printing; SLM; Compliant; Alignment; optics; flexure; additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro-optics and Optomechatronics","",""

Rijkswaterstaat must repair or replace hundreds of bridges in the upcoming decades. At the same time, the impact of human behaviour on climate change becomes more visible and must be reduced. The most structural solution to diminish the human impact on the environment is switching from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE).<br/>This research aims to develop a system for circular highway bridges by both constructing with timber and extending the lifespan. The first contributes to a lower environmental impact as timber is a renewable material that captures carbon during growth. For an outdoor timber structure, protection is crucial to prevent the timber from deteriorating due to weather influences. The lifespan extension is obtained by applying three circular principles: (1) Design for Material Efficiency (DfME), (2) Design for Adaptability (DfA), and<br/>(3) Design for Disassembly (DfD). Variant studies on typology, connections and material optimise for material efficiency. A flexible structure enables DfA: converting in function and expansion in length and width is possible. Furthermore, a modular system is developed to include DfD: connections between modules are demountable to disassemble, adapt and reuse the system. In summary, four design strategies are defined: efficient, protected, adaptable and demountable.<br/>This research aims to provide an alternative for concrete highway bridges with a lower environmental impact.The timber bridge, a circular concrete bridge and a traditional concrete bridge are compared. The comparison includes the production (A1‐A3), construction (A4‐A5) and end of life (C1‐C4) stages. Timber results in a lower carbon footprint for all reference periods and lifespans. The study considers the third scenario most reliable, as the technical lifespans are most substantiated. In this scenario, reductions of 18% and 47% for respectively the circular and traditional concrete bridge are established.<br/>This study concludes that Dutch highway bridges suit replacement with a modular timber alternative. The developed modular system covers 58% of the highway bridges stock owned by Rijkswaterstaat that were built in 1950‐1980. Moreover, timber shows substantial environmental benefits compared to concrete. The alternative reduces the carbon footprint by 47% compared to a traditional concrete bridge. Furthermore, this study observes additional benefits when one considers carbon emissions in time, as the structure<br/>sequestrates carbon during use. Consequently, building with timber lowers the carbon concentration in the atmosphere, reducing the global warming effect. This study recommends Rijkswaterstaat to invest in the development of circular timber highway bridges. By changing the ’business as usual’ from concrete to a more sustainable alternative, the circular and climate goals can be obtained. Furthermore, the recommendation is made to clarify the regulations on quantification of environmental impact, both on data and methodology level.","Circular construction; Timber; Bridge; Sustainable; Parametric Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(mentor); Kober, J. (mentor); Kooij, J.F.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Learning from demonstration is a technique where the robot learns directly from humans. It can be beneficial to learn from humans directly because humans can easily demonstrate complex behaviors without being experts in demonstrating required tasks. However, it can be challenging to gather large amounts of data from humans because humans often get tired, bored, or lose focus while giving many demonstrations. Therefore, the learning algorithms require to be as data-efficient as possible. To solve sequential tasks using few human demonstrations, the Transporter Network was introduced.<br/><br/>The Transporter Network consists of two networks, namely the pick network and the place network. Both these networks have a fully convolutional architecture which has the property of being translationally equivariant. Translational equivariance is well suited for estimating pick locations because the predicted pick location changes corresponding to the change in the object's position in the image. However, the performance of the transporter network on sequential tasks depends on the receptive field of the fully convolutional network because each pixel in the output should depend on each pixel in the input image. This correlation is important for the network to make predictions based on the overall configuration of objects in the input image. A larger receptive field would give a prediction by correlating large amount of pixels in the input image, however increasing the receptive field could result in loss of resolution which in turn leads to information loss in the latent space. Therefore, it is essential to select an appropriate size for the receptive field such that there is minimal loss of resolution in the latent space of the fully convolutional network. This limitation of selecting the appropriate size of the receptive field was also observed in the preliminary experiments on the pick network of the Transporter Network. <br/><br/>In this work, a SEquential Attention Network (SEA Net) is introduced to overcome the dependence of the Transporter Network on the receptive field size for solving sequential task. SEA Net is a variation of the pick network of the Transporter Network. SEA Net works under the assumption that the set of objects to be picked are known beforehand. Based on this assumption, the SEA Net learns to predict two things: 1) The pick location of all the objects. 2) ""what"" object to pick as a function of the current configuration of the objects in the environment. SEA Nets can be used independently to predict pick location sequentially and also be used as a replacement of the pick network in the Transporter Network. SEA Net is evaluated on two datasets, namely synthetic dataset and simulated robot dataset. The synthetic dataset has a top-down view of simple shape blocks. In contrast, simulated robot datasets are extracted using a pre-trained policy on the Mujoco simulators. The Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) metrics is used to score the distance between the predicted pick point and the ground truth. The OKS Metric uses a standard deviation threshold (σ(threshold)). A strict standard deviation threshold (σ(threshold)) of 2 pixels and a lenient threshold (σ(threshold)) of 20 pixels is used because a strict threshold will evaluate the resolution of the prediction. In contrast, the lenient threshold will assess if the predicted pick point is, at least on the desired object. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 64% for a strict standard deviation threshold (σ(threshold)) of 2 pixels and accuracy of 85% for a lenient standard deviation threshold (σ(threshold)) of 20 pixels on the OKS metrics, on the synthetic dataset. The model could perform on a simulated robot dataset with an accuracy of 82% on a strict standard deviation threshold (σ(threshold)) of 2 pixels.","Deep learning; Computer Vision; Supervised Learning; Learn from demonstrations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This will be a major challenge for municipalities , which will need public support to accomplish this. The role of citizens is considered essential for the heating transition. Co-creation provides an opportunity for this problem, in which citizens are not only participating in the process, but have also become the initiator and designer of the process. The heating transition is a complex process, which stretches beyond the local level at multiple governance levels. The heating transition setting is very complex and polycentric, where multiple actors and different governments at multiple levels are involved. The polycentric governance perspective will be proposed for this study. Polycentric governance is a system, in which multiple public and private parties interact with each other to decide on a specific geographical location through a system of negotiated rules and norms to solve a problem efficiently with multiple semi-autonomous centers of decision making.","Co-creation; Polycentricity; Heat Transition; energy transition; public participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

In this thesis we study a generalization of Voronoi diagrams known as the Laguerre-Voronoi diagram. In particular, we consider the stereological problem of estimating the 3D cell volume distribution of such a diagram from one of its 2D planar sections. This problem is not in general solvable for all Laguerre-Voronoi diagrams. We consider a specific class of Laguerre-Voronoi diagrams generated using an algorithm which allows to control the volume distribution of its cells. Inspired by related stereological problems, an estimator for the distribution of areas observed in a planar section is proposed. This estimator can be used for estimating the cell volume distribution from a sample of observed areas in a planar section of a 3D Laguerre-Voronoi diagram. Given that the problem is motivated by a materials science application we consider Laguerre-Voronoi diagrams with a lognormal cell volume distribution, which is commonly used in this field. The simulations show that the proposed method works well in the sense that on average the estimated parameters of the lognormal cell volume distribution are close to the actual parameter values. While the focus is on the lognormal distribution, generalization of the estimator considering other parametric distributions is briefly discussed. The thesis is concluded with a case study: the 3D grain volume distribution of a real steel microstructure is estimated from observed areas obtained from 2D image data.","stereology; Laguerre-Voronoi; tessellation; inverse problem; microstructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While aircraft parking for this purpose is a largely unexplored area in academic literature, the problem shows similarities with cutting and packing problems which have been researched for many years. Hence, the proposed model in the paper is modelled similar to that of the irregular strip packing model, where a fixed width is used and the length of the parking layout is to be minimised. Aircraft are represented as non-convex polygons and are allowed to rotate in discrete intervals. The concept of the no-fit polygon (NFP) is used in order to prevent overlap between aircraft. A tabu search algorithm with an adaptive tabu list is proposed in order to optimise the sequence and orientations in which the aircraft are placed onto the placement area using a bottom-left (BL) placement strategy.

Therefore, it is essential to transition to a sustainable heating system in the built environment. According to the dutch climate agreement of 2019, municipalities are given a leading role in this transition. Municipalities became responsible for setting out the strategy for this transition. They decide for each neighborhood within their jurisdiction how the reduction of heat usage through insulation can be realised. Furthermore, a switch to a sustainable alternative for natural gas needs to be transitioned to. Consisting these two steps, this strategy has to be formalised before the end of 2021 in the `Transitievisie Warmte' (TVW).<br/>However, decentralised coordination of this transition has its limitations: municipalities lack the knowledge to oversee the consequences of their decisions on this complex socio-technical system. Decentralising responsibility means increased demand for knowledge. This lack of knowledge from municipalities lead to decisions made without understanding the consequences of their local decisions on the regional and national electricity and gas networks. <br/>These networks can be limiting for the decision freedom of municipalities and their transition plans to a sustainable heating system. Because they share the same energy networks, municipalities’ choices can limit the options of neighbouring municipalities. The objective of this research is to increase the understanding of the consequences of local decisions in the heat transition.

Recent events such as the extreme rainfall in the summer of 2021 in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands and hurricane Ida in Mississippi (USA), caused severe floodings and damages in these areas. Climate change, in turn, leads to an increase in sea level rise, making flood prone areas more at risk for floodings. However, the magnitude of rise in sea level is of an uncertain nature. This bolsters the idea of applying adaptive designing methods on flood defence systems to tackle the uncertainties decision makers and engineers face in the wake of climate change, whilst finding a balance between safety and expenditures. In this research, I apply adaptive design methods on the Rhine-Meuse estuary to develop an adaptive flood defence system in a system-to-structure approach. Thus, to converge onto a flood defence structure, three design loops are considered. In the first loop multiple adaptive systems are designed with the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, showing various flood defence options and other required measures to allow the functioning of the systems, as a function of sea level rise. To select an adaptive system in which an adaptive flood defence structure is developed, a set of preferred pathways (systems) are designed and quantified in three sea level rise scenarios. This leads to a preferred open/closable system in which a storm surge barrier is developed to replace the current Maeslant barrier at the end of its life span. In the second loop a Multi Criteria Analysis is applied to determine a preferable location and barrier type, which resulted in the adoption of a sector gate barrier near Maasdijk. In the third design loop, a reliability model is developed to determine whether designing barrier in an adaptive manner is (economically) beneficial to cope with uncertainties surrounding that of sea level rise and the relative structural failure probability of the barrier over a range of sea level rise scenarios. With the model I was able to produce data about the balance between structural safety of various designs and construction costs of the barrier. Subsequently, the model provided substantiated data about which components of the barrier provide a high level of confidence in returning positive economical benefits when designed as adaptive. The applied method in this thesis shows promise, however, to further develop adaptive designing methods it is important to apply the approach in other, quantitative, case studies.<br","Adaptive; Sea level rise; Flood defence; Barriers; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","","51.954270, 4.163131"

The scope of the research is to investigate the division of tasks amongst stakeholders that have a responsibility in collecting and storing the data throughout different project delivery methods for the Infrastructure and the Real Estate sectors in the Netherlands. The aim of the research is to come up with a new setting of arrangements that shows a clear division of the responsibilities, hence promoting the safeguarding of data in a material passport.<br/><br/>Responsibilities have been assigned to actors and stakeholders throughout different project phases based on the tasks at hand to cover the full spectrum: from Producer to Demolition and Recycling phase. Literature studies and explorative interviews allowed for the framework to be developed under a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed) matrix. Mainly, two approaches have been developed:<br/>• The Centralized approach to store the data centrally within the organization/party ensures that each organization comes up with its tailor-made passports according to their own goals and needs for re-use. <br/>• The Supplier approach that entails keeping the data with the Supplier. Each supplier will be able to determine what information is necessary to collect for their own production and hence promoting the potential re-use of the material.<br/><br/>According to several criteria and limitations assessed, results have shown that the Centralized approach is incentivized to be used in the infrastructure sector. The end responsibility lies with the most profitable party, the party that has the best interest in keeping the information centrally in accordance with their way of working, which remains with the Lease holder/ Asset owner. Moreover, the Supplier approach was deduced to be best applicable in the real estate Sector. End responsibilities is best with financial parties (banks, insurance companies) in order to maintain the value of the asset as a collateral (Onderpand) until the building is eventually decomposed. Recommendations for the application of the framework is through contractual agreements. Special agreements could pave the way for the initial setting of the division of responsibilities, however, changes are recommended to the procurement law for the long-term applicability of passports.","Circular economy (CE); Material Passports; Project Delivery Methods; Data Management; Contractual arrangements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Multiple recent studies state that enhancing the information flows can result in a better functioning organisation.<br/><br/>Research description<br/>The information flow between the different layers of an organisation is of high importance. A distinction can be made between formal and informal information flows. Controlling a large organisation, the formal information holds a very dominant and strong position when it comes to information flows. Nevertheless, formal information does not always deliver the managers of the organisation the right information to establish proper coordination and strategy. Conjoining the process of acquiring information informally and the formal information systems of organisations has not been successful so far. The literature indicates that strategies and the way of coordinating an organisation should be based on both the formal and informal information, but chances are that the formal information instruments dominate the informal information. Hollandia Infra believes that there is room for improvement on how to cope with their information flows. The research question formulated in order to help to reflect upon this matter is:<br/><br/>‘How can information flows be enhanced <br/>in construction projects within a construction company?’<br/><br/>To answer this question a literature study is conducted to investigate the current theoretical role of information flows in intrafirm supply chains of construction projects. Afterwards a case study has been conducted at the construction company of Hollandia Infra. As part of this case study the intended information flow is studied by conducting a company document study. A Social Network Analysis is carried out in order to understand how the actual information flow functions. The intended and actual information flows are compared. Identified differences are explained by interviewing those involved. To understand the role information flows play in the organisation. The interview findings result in managerial implications which aim to support efforts to enhance the information flows. These managerial implications are validated by interviewing two experts. <br/><br/>Theoretical role of information flows<br/>Information flows can be divided into formal and informal information flows. Formal information flows concern information that is less dependent on individual information holders. This form of information flows is easier to regulate, using IT systems for instance, than informal information flows. The informal information flow is very dependent on the individual information holder and his/her willingness to share information. The focus of organisations is mainly on the transfer of formal information as organisations aim to provide and produce generic information and guidelines that employees can use to work with. This results in informal information flows playing a background role, while this form of information is of strategical added value. <br/><br/>Intended and actual information flow<br/>By carrying out a company document study, the primary process of Hollandia Infra during the construction phase was studied in-depth. Understanding and visualising the workflow and what the function of the different actors in the primary process is, has led to the disclosure of the relationships and the associated information flow.

While capable of delivering localized electrical impulses, the implantation is highly invasive. Handheld devices do not ask for a risky surgery, but their imprecise targeting of the neck reduces efficiency and provokes additional side effects.<br/><br/>Ultrasound has been widely used in clinical applications ranging from focused ultrasound (FUS) tissue ablation to medical imaging.

Growing efforts towards basin wide cooperation from the international and scientific community have led to the development of a common decision support tool, the Nile Basin Decision Support System (NBDSS), but applications are still limited. This thesis assumes that a discrepancy between values included in the design of the NBDSS and values that actually play a role in decision making might contribute to the lack of implementation. This assumption involves two important research gaps, namely the absence of a clear overview of values of decision makers in the Blue Nile countries and the capabilities of the NBDSS in considering all values in decision making. This thesis aims to fill these research gaps and finally test the assumption by evaluating the NBDSS from a value perspective. The evaluation uses four elements, namely design requirements to allow value considerations, design values of the NBDSS, actor values and associated potential conflicts and synergies. This thesis produced two main results that are valuable to the academic community, namely a list of values associated with water resources for each Blue Nile country and an evaluation of the NBDSS from a value perspective. <br/>Literature review resulted in five design requirements: transparency, participatory development, flexibility, useful information and reasonable value judgements.

However, none of the analysed documents on the NBDSS talks about value considerations explicitly...<br","Water Resources; Decision Support Systems; Values; Blue Nile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However, there are several limitations related to this integration. This research aims to identify these challenges by looking at the Dutch TSO, TenneT and its specific context. Furthermore, the research aims to provide a decision-support framework through which these limitations can be countered and the integration of sustainable goals in projects can be achieved.<br/>First, a literature study was conducted to define sustainability and the concepts associated with it. To properly understand the context of TenneT and identify the limitations associated with sustainability, company professionals were interviewed. This pointed to the need for prioritisation and gradual integration of sustainability measures. A desktop study was also conducted to identify the company’s sustainable goals, their associated measures, and their real-life applications. A decision-support framework for integrating sustainable goals in projects, based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Analysis (MCDA) was proposed. Using the Best-Worst Method (BWM), as the selected MCDA method, developed by Rezaei (2015), a sustainability workshop was organised where decision-makers from TenneT were asked to select relevant sustainability goals for TenneT, and the ones selected by three or more decision-makers were then used for performing the BWM. To avoid focusing on already well-performing sustainability goals, the performance of their associated measures was studied, using a Maturity Model based on the work of Silvius and Schipper (2015). Finally, an Importance-Performance Analysis (Martilla and James 1977) was performed, to assess future actions for each sustainable goal. The BWM showed that the Planet aspect was selected as the most important one for stimulating sustainability in projects. Additionally, Reducing Emissions was selected as the most important sub-aspect while in the People aspect, Health and Safety ranked first. The Maturity Model showed that the least integrated goals in projects are Human Rights, Labour Conditions and Decent Work, Energy Consumption, Materials and Natural Resources and Circularity and Waste. The BWM and Maturity Model also produced interesting results regarding the awareness of decision-makers and how they perceive sustainable goals and the performance of their associated measures in projects.<br/>Based on the Importance-Performance analysis, the research suggests integrating the sustainable goal of Circularity and Waste in the company’s following projects. This can be achieved by using existing sustainable measures, such as the Raw Material Passport (RMP), in the tender process. Using measures such as the RMP in the pre-qualification phases or selection phase, as entry requirements with specific targets to be met, or as an award criterion, aiming to create added value for the project, can stimulate the contractors and suppliers to act more sustainably. This will in turn increase TenneT’s sustainable performance and will help the company meet its own sustainable targets.<br","Sustainability; Transmission System Operators; Decision-Making; Sustainable Projects; Sustainable Procurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

With recent data acquisition developments, high-resolution geological models can be generated for the subsurface reservoirs; however, uncertainties of geological data and too many details in the model have brought up remarkable limitations for application of high-fidelity geo-models in reservoir management. To generate efficient low-resolution models, which are relatively representative of the reservoir dynamic behaviour, data-driven models are proposed. The data-driven models are trained principally based on the production history of the reservoir with primary knowledge of structural information. The Data-driven Discrete Well Affinity (DiWA) model is designed to generate efficient proxy models that require basic geological information and full production history of the reservoir. Since it benefits the computational power of the Delft Advanced Terra Simulator (DARTS) and adjoint gradient-based optimization, the DiWA model has become an efficient framework in terms of accuracy and computational costs. This research shows that the DiWA model can relatively reconstruct the reference reservoir parameters out of an ensemble of priors, and the final results can be improved utilizing closer prior knowledge to the true response. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the performance of the DiWA model in a complex, realistic oil field can be enhanced using a comprehensive objective function, applying appropriate well controls, understanding the underlying driving mechanisms, using sufficient degrees of freedom, and applying consistent boundary conditions.","data-driven models; Production forecast; History matching; Reservoir simulation; proxy models; DiWA model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Metabolic, a sustainability consultancy that helps clients transition towards the circular economy, recognizes that a circular product can only exist within a properly functioning circular system. Therefore, they adopt system thinking, a thinking skill that perceives parts of a more extensive system as intertwined components rather than independent entities (da Costa Junior et al. 2019), with science-based analysis in their project work.<br/>However, collaborations between stakeholders are essential to achieve systemic changes since they might all hold different values, interests, and world views on a system.

Systemic design provides frameworks and methods to create a shared understanding that mutual agreement can emerge among actions to be taken. Besides, designers’ ability and methods to synthesize, visualize, and create can complement system thinking in co-creating circular economy solutions among stakeholders. Therefore, this graduation project explores how systemic design and other design methods could help improve Metabolic’s circular system design process.<br/>The outcome of this project is a Circular system design process with multiple sessions, activities, and tools developed for Metabolic to apply in their future projects.

Analysis of regional potential morphology increases insight in individual tissue characteristics, possibly aiding in future selection of patients with AF benefitting from additional treatment with.<br/><br/>Methods: single potentials (SP) are extracted from four defined regions: right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), pulmonary veins (PV) and Bachmann’s bundle (BB). The methods are divided in two parts. In part one, the clusters are determined. Choice of algorithm, evaluation of distance metrics and evaluation in reduced dimensionality are performed sequentially to determine the eventual clustering setup. The clustering setup is repeated for different types of input data, originating from different regional structures (all four regions, solely LA and solely the RA) to avoid deterioration of cluster formation from single region(s). In the second part, the clusters are adapted to evaluate morphological characteristics in the included regions. <br/><br/>Results: Data from a total of 23 patients was used, containing 128 files and 468588 SPs. K-means using the first 8 principal components was deemed the most suitable clustering method with the current data, identifying a total of five clusters. The clusters showed evident different morphology, mostly distinguishable by RS-ratio and potential duration. RA showed a predominant S to an RS-wave pattern, comparable to PV. Both showed similar contribution of fast and slow S-wave morphology. LA showed a RS to R-wave morphology. The cluster showing a slow S-wave morphology was substantially increased across BB compared to other regions but also when compared to other clusters in BB. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Looking at spatial cluster occurrence through an RS-ratio perspective, the beforehand expected deviation from AF compared to sinus rhythm (SR) was not observed. The observed pattern during AF suggests more elaborate contribution of atrial tissue than often targeted in current daily practice. The methodology and defined groups of potentials facilitate evaluation of potential morphology at an individual level. Translation to an endocardial perspective could assist in selecting patients eligible for additional treatment when technologically feasible.

Food waste is a wicked problem that causes environmental deterioration and the socio-economic food gap. At the EU level, disposing of 89 million tons of food waste per year consumes 261 million tons of resources, equal to 170 million tons of CO2 emission (FAO, 2013). If this food is distributed and used properly, 1.3 billion tons of food waste in 2011 is estimated could feed up to 868 million people worldwide (FAO, 2011). In the Netherlands, approximately 2 million tons of food waste are produced annually, of which households as the highest contributor share 37% (Netherlands Nutrition Centre, 2019). To understand food waste prevention problems in Dutch households, the project started by conducting user research. The research concluded that forgetfulness due to low visibility, laziness to check the fridge regularly, and a messy food storage arrangement are why people discard food. People have tried to tackle those issues by displaying fruits and a few vegetables in a bowl or putting them on the kitchen counter. However, sometimes some food is still hidden at the bottom of the bowl and gets rotten before being consumed. By knowing the most discarded food by the participants, the scope of this project was narrowed down to save fruits, vegetables and food leftovers. Based on the insight from the photo diary and follow-up interview, a problem statement was formulated: ""How might we minimise forgotten and overlooked food at home for people who live in the Netherlands so that as to reduce food waste at the consumer level?"" After determining the design challenge, exploration to find solution ideas began. In this phase, four initial concepts came up. They were analysed, and the most promising idea for each concept was combined, resulting in a particular design concept called FooDi. FooDi is storage to display fruits and partly used vegetables usually hidden and forgotten in the fridge (e.g. half onion, half paprika or other cut vegetables). This product encourages the user to eat fruits they purchase in a daily portion and reuse the raw vegetable leftovers as soon as possible. A transparent lid is implemented to see through the cabinet and not miss any food to enhance food visibility. In addition, the quantity of food to show is limited to prevent food stacking that could lower visibility. FooDi was designed as short term storage (only for 1-2 days). However, a few possible risks were considered to slow down food deterioration. FooDi prevents quick overripening by splitting ethylene gas producers and absorbers. Moreover, a lid with natural ventilation was applied to keep the stored fruits and vegetables fresh (avoid rapid ageing). At the end of the project, the impact of using FooDi to support people in reducing food waste at home was measured. Thanks to FooDi, households' share in food waste decreased from 37% to 29%. In addition, the user could be able to save edible food worth €120 per year.<br","Food Waste Reduction; Household Waste; Design Intervention; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","Master Thesis",""

One group of biomaterials impacted by the innovation of 3D printing are degradable biomaterials. Degradable biomaterials could eliminate the need for surgery to remove the implant. 3D printed porous degradable biomaterials provide both mechanical support and space for bone ingrowth. As of today, there is an absence of materials for this application that are biodegradable, biocompatible and can be 3D printed. Magnesium can be used as a degradable biomaterial but its corrosion resistance is not yet adequate for application in the human body. Applying zinc as an alloying element to magnesium increases its corrosion resistance compared to pure magnesium. As the addition of alloying elements changes the microstructure, which in turn changes its corrosion behaviour.<br/><br/>This thesis analysed the effect of microstructure on the corrosion behaviour of extrusion-based 3D printed porous Mg-4Zn (wt.%) scaffolds, using localised electrochemical techniques i.e. scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The microstructure of the Mg-4Zn scaffolds includes grains with secondary phases precipitated along the grain boundaries with the presence of micropores. The secondary phase particles showed increased Volta-potential compared to the magnesium-based matrix. Therefore, the addition of zinc caused micro-galvanic coupling between secondary phase particles and the matrix, but their contribution to corrosion is minimal due to postponed contact with the electrolyte and the protection by the corrosion products. Micropores in the Mg-4Zn scaffold increased the surface exposed to fluids and were pitting corrosion initiation sites. During corrosion however, the surface was covered with a more stable corrosion product compared to pure magnesium. As a result of this, the corrosion resistance of Mg-4Zn scaffolds is better than pure magnesium scaffolds.","magnesium alloy; degradable biomaterial; Corrosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A. (graduation committee); Wang, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The large-scale integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) brings about challenges related to the stochastic characteristics in supply. In this light, a recent and promising approach which has received increasing attention is that of multi-energy systems (MES). A MES is defined as an energy system whereby different energy sectors interact with each other, and builds on the notion of considering the optimization of the whole energy system instead of focussing on specific energy sectors. The increase in substitutions between different energy carriers offer increases in overall efficiency and system flexibility, compared to non-integrated energy system (NIES). This thesis presents a MES investment model. The model is able to systematically find the cost-optimal investment portfolio for meeting three types of demand (electricity, heating, and hydrogen). The outcomes consist of the capacities and locations of generation and conversion technologies, as well as electricity and hydrogen network lines and storage technologies, simultaneously, whilst adhering to balance and RES target constraints. The model is an extension of the current cost-optimal energy investment Greenfield Renewables Investment Model (GRIM) and allows the incorporating of spatial characteristics of VRES supply, leading to a more realistic representation of the real energy system. Furthermore, the model is able to account for limitations on maximum available land for onshore wind and solar photovoltaics (PV).<br/>A case study was conducted on the energy system of the Netherlands. Fifteen scenarios were run, for increasing RES targets, different levels of sector integration and land-use restriction for solar and onshore. The results show that increasing sector integration can lead to a cost reduction of 25% in a fully renewable scenario. Increasing connections between electricity, heating and hydrogen sectors provides system flexibility, resulting in a decrease in generation, network, and storage investment. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of considering the spatial components: both limitations on land-use and spatial-temporal VRES supply profiles have significant impact on the optimal solution. For the Netherlands, imposing land-use constraints resulted in a decrease in market share from onshore and an increase in solar, since the maximum amount of available land for onshore wind is reached, when including three types of demands.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This graduation thesis report describes the research activities investigating the education on filter bubbles in Dutch secondary schools towards teenagers between 14-16 years old, and the design to improve this through including critical thinking techniques. <br/>During this research the context and two main target groups were explored through literature research, observations, generative sessions and interviews. Insights from this research led to the design brief containing the design goal, interaction vision, design criteria, and learning objectives.<br/>The design brief was formulated after exploring the context, media literacy, and stakeholders and target group. From this research, it was found that Dutch secondary schools are still at the beginning stages of implementing media literacy in itself in their curriculums, which means that filter bubbles are even less discussed in schools. Teenagers are confident about their media literacy and often confuse this with tech-savviness. This results in that they often think they learn more through Social Media. But even though teenagers nowadays in 2021 are raised alongside Social Media, teenagers are not necessarily media literate. Especially when it comes to critical thinking about the media consumed. To stimulate critical thinking in education, pupils have to be encouraged to come up with their own ideas and opinions and be able to discuss the different ideas with other people. Pupils also have to be able to connect subjects to their daily lives. For this to happen, a safe space needs to be created for pupils to be able to share perspectives with each other. <br/>Following these insights, the design goal was to design an intervention that can be used as an addition to the “social studies” course in secondary schools in The Netherlands. This intervention should teach teenagers to critically think about the content they consume within their filter bubbles, through meaningful conversations with other teenagers about the content. <br/>Ideation involved creative sessions and individual brainstorming and soon went into testing and iterating concepts. The final concept was evaluated with Social Studies teachers and teenagers. In conclusion, the Pop your Bubble: Lesson plan has created an opportunity in class for pupils to explore their own filter bubbles and discuss them with each other. Though further testing in context and research on the long-term effects of this lesson plan is required, teachers and participants agreed that this is a useful way to teach pupils that filter bubbles can have an influence on opinions and that it helps teenagers discuss them.","Social Media; Education; filter bubble; Teenagers; Dutch education; Critical Thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.0021456446433, 4.369971709304539"

This is strictly related to the linearity of its production model, which puts profit and product generation before environmental and social sustainability. Very often this leads to overproduction and huge amounts of waste created. Specifically, the fashion industry that designs clothes made of synthetic fibers faces also the struggle of recycling the material into new clothes, due to technological backwardness and lack of proper systems that could implement it. <br/><br/>Maium is an Amsterdam-based fashion company that produces recycled PET raincoats and that highly values sustainability in its practices, wanting to lead as an example for other fashion brands. <br/>Market and brand analysis (through tools such as 4C analysis and SWOT analysis) are the starting point of this research, which aimed at analysing Maium’s environmental impact through Life Cycle Assessments and finding more sustainable alternatives to their current production model. The design process consisted in applying tools like VentureWell’s Whole System Mapping and Presidio Sustainability Booster to the results of the LCAs. The process has been an iterative one, so as to best define pain points and opportunities, and thoroughly think of the possible solutions that could be implemented. <br/>The design solution has the intent of including the final users in the clothes’ lifetime extension process by teaching them techniques and skills that they can apply to their raincoats and to other pieces of clothing as well. Moreover, the intent has been also to provide them with as much information and transparency as possible for what concerns the production processes, the supply chain and alternative business models to the linear one.","Fashion Industry; Sustainabilty; user inclusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The sensitivity analysis is the study of how uncertainty in the outputs of a model can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs. The software Delft3D FM is used to simulate the model, which is developed by Deltares. This thesis is supported by German pilot of the UNITED project, which studies the possibilities of combing blue mussel and sugar kelp cultivation with wind energy. The investigation is conducted at FINO3 platform, 80 km off Sylt.<br/><br/>In this thesis project, temperature and current velocity are selected as outputs in sensitivity analysis, which are influential factors of blue mussel and sugar kelp growth. Specific parameters in the hydrodynamic model are selected as inputs respectively. Three sensitivity methods are conducted: Morris, copula-based and variance-based method. Among them, copula-based and variance-based consider the independency information, while parameters are assumed dependent in Morris method. To generate samples, parameters are transformed into a unit hypercube in Morris method and run on the contour of the grid cell, composing paths. Between two steps within the paths, only one parameter changes at a time (OAT method). The input domain is scanned with a better strategy to separate the paths maximizing the dispersion. Each parameter’s elementary effects are calculated within paths, evaluating the changes in outputs contributed by the single parameter. Then (absolute) mean and variance of elementary effects are used as sensitivity indices. Copula-based method uses similar sampling and the same measurements, but it gathers parameters into copulas before sampling to include the dependency information. In variance-based method, the variance of the outputs’ conditional expectations is used to measure the sensitivity. Only random samples are needed in this method.<br/><br/>Morris and copula-based method prove the temporal and spatial similarities of parameters’ sensitivity behavior. Convective and evaporative heat flux are the most influential parameters of temperature, and they also show correlations with other parameters. Air density influences current velocity the most, while Smagorinsky factor is the most correlated parameter of current velocity. Variance-based method gives similar results about rankings of influences. Correlations are proved to exist among parameters. Uniform horizontal eddy viscosity/viscosity in definition files have no impacts, as they are overwritten. Three methods are compared. Except the differences in independency, sampling and measurement, there are some other differences. Much more samples are required in variance-based method and it is used mainly to decide the existence of significant correlations and whether a parameter can be neglected. While Morris and copula-based method ranks the influences and correlations.","Sensitivity Analysis; Morris method; Copula-based sensitivity analysis; Variance-based sensitivity analysis; Delft3D FM; 3D DCSM-FM; Temperature; Current velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","UNITED",""

One of these adaptations was the accelerated shift towards e-health solutions. This rise happened because of the inability of the medical system to serve patients of non-respiratory related illnesses during the pandemic. This was experienced as a rise from 1% to 70% of remote general practitioners consultations in the early months of 2020(Mueller, 2020).<br/>Key to these consultations is the use of medical devices to gather information relating to the patient's state. New medical device categories now allow people with little or no training to collect accurate information (European Commission, 2017), including by using wearables first intended for tracking activity-related metrics that are currently being fitted with state-of-the-art sensors that allow them to become a realistic alternative to strict medical devices (Raja et al., 2019). Despite this, several key issues impede their use in standard medical practice and are more commonly used as informational tools only (Raja et al., 2019).<br/>The use of wearables as informational tools has the potential to increase the awareness of people of the effect of the things they do on their wellbeing, an essential part of the concept of preventative medicine. A concept that aims to enhance wellbeing is wellness, with health being a state of being and a goal to achieve (Stoewen, 2015).<br/>Wellness is also a concept that is well entrenched on the product lines of the brands of Arçelik, and is seen as an important opportunity to grow medical capabilities in the products they already dominate.<br/>This thesis project presents a service design concept that aims to help people create their own wellness journey by passively tracking habits and receiving advice based on this information. The concept is based around the gathering of information through smart home appliances, focused around four modules: nutrition, activity, sleep and vitals.<br/>The project concludes that the proposed service solution brings the possibility to integrate the capabilities that Arçelik needs to enter the larger healthcare market while staying in the product categories that it dominates.<br","Wellness; General practicioner; Healthcare design; Roadmapping; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to track and measure the emissions in our environment for detecting the sources and understating the climate change so as to figure out possible solutions. Despite ongoing development, the current LEO and GEO satellite instruments have a long prolonged global survey, revealing the pollution trends at a broad scale, but there is still a lack of high-resolution data to pinpoint pollution sources.<br/><br/>For this, John Hopkins University (Applied physics lab) and NASA are now developing a new earth atmospheric monitoring mission called Compact Hyperspectral Air Pollution Sensor (CHAPS) to address it at a local scale. Presently, TNO is carrying out the design study for this system by employing both freeform optics and additive manufactured mechanics. The mission objective is to perform targeted local measurements of the atmosphere on a daily basis by providing high spatial and temporal resolution possible in UV-VIS wavelength range.<br/><br/>In order to characterize, quantify, and monitor emissions from urban areas, power plants, and other anthropogenic activities, it is important to collect accurate and precise data and calibrate the optical instrument. But the data often received from the sensor is not reliable due to the operational and the non-operational conditions leading to cross-sensitivity, change in the trajectory, and optomechanical errors. For this, an on-board calibration system is developed to perform continuous calibration of the science product, that is compatible with both the instrument and the satellite platform and is robust to the variable operating conditions. This requires a stable system that achieves a good performance that is insensitive to thermal and mechanical disturbances, in order to meet the strict specifications.<br/><br/>As opposed to conventional methods, additive manufacturing, enables new possibilities for developing Optomechanical structures because of the layer-wise manufacturing technique. This manufacturing process is widely touted as a foundation for the next industrial revolution as it offers profound advantages like shorter lead time, lower wastage of materials, and higher geometric complexity that can be useful for multi-functional and multi-material structures. It can also facilitate good strength, significant mass reduction, and better dimensional homogeneity and stability. At the same time, additive manufacturing is not an easy process and requires new design strategies and solutions for overcoming the existing constraints.<br/><br/>The prime research objective is to investigate the optomechanical design of the spectral calibration module applying a kinematic approach. The second research objective is to investigate design and the potential improvements when applying additive manufacturing. The present case study demonstrates and evaluates the preliminary phase of the calibration module design study, thus providing the key ingredients for the realisation of the full system.","Calibration Module; Additive Manufacturing; Optomechanics; Optical instruments; TNO; Thermal stability; Earth Observation Satellite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro-optics and Optomechatronics","",""

Many datasets contain valuable information that can, for example, be used to make forecasts. In this thesis, the dataset of a company in the self-storage industry is analyzed. The company offers customers rental storage facilities, such as lockers, rooms, containers at several locations in the Netherlands. The rooms, also called units, are characterized by three features: location, volume, and floor. The dataset contains for each storage facility the entire renting history of each self-storage unit. For the company, it is of interest to understand and predict the demand of its customers, such that it can flexibly adjust the prices of the rooms and services based on demand. Beyond, forecasting users' demand for various types of products is a common and essential problem in many different domains (e.g., recommendation systems, transportation systems).<br/><br/>This thesis aims to predict the demand for the next week by applying white-box and black-box models. The problem is represented as a temporal weighted bipartite network prediction problem. Specifically, the goal is to predict the network structure at a time T+1 based on the bipartite network observed at time T-k+1, T-k+2, ..., T, where k is an integer and needs to be optimized such that the prediction error is minimized. By analyzing the data in its temporal dimension, using the autocorrelation and cross-correlation among different storage locations, floors and volumes, it was shown that the autocorrelation is high and the cross-correlation is low. This suggests that the temporal bipartite network is possibly predictable.<br/><br/>We have explored different state-of-the-art predictive techniques. Markov chain model, LSTM, and ConvLSTM have been selected because of their fundamental difference in the way they learn and predict. A performance comparison is given where the techniques have been applied on the storage data, and it shows that LSTM outperforms the Markov chain and ConvLSTM based on the following evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, and accuracy. According to our dataset, higher predictability was achieved when only the data of a single link was exploited. The Markov chain and the LSTM utilize the information of a single link to predict. On the contrary, the ConvLSTM utilizes the information of the entire network to predict. The low cross-correlation between the links explains why the LSTM outperforms the ConvLSTM. The ConvLSTM tries to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, while this, in general, does not contain much valuable predictive information. Thus, the model is introduced to more noise, making it harder to predict accurately. The LSTM also outperforms the Markov chain model, which is used as a baseline method. This proves that it is beneficial to use a complex deep learning model for this dataset to predict. However, the Markov chain performs comparable to the ConvLSTM, showing that a black-box model does not always outperform a white-box model. This emphasizes that the most suitable predictive algorithm depends on the statistical properties of the dataset.<br/><br/>The theoretical upper bound of the predictability of the network is computed. It is the upper bound that can be used to compare the realized performance to the maximum achievable prediction performance for any predictive algorithm. The difference between the performance of the best performing algorithm to our dataset, LSTM, and the theoretical upper bound is still large, indicating that there is still room for improvement.<br","Temporal Link Prediction Problem; Bipartite Network; Markov Chain; LSTM; ConvLSTM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","Computer Science | Multimedia Computing","",""

A major obstacle in GBM research is the lack of reliable in vitro models that can mimic the tumor cellular environment. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D-engineered scaffold as a new cell culture model capable of providing a more accurate representation of the tumor environment. 3D-engineered scaffolds, inspired by the geometry of brain blood vessels, were fabricated using two-photon polymerization. A newly developed biocompatible material with low auto-florescence was used for fabrication. To assess the ability of the 3D model in mimicking GBM’s natural environment, cell colonization, cellular morphology, microtube formations, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressions of cells were derived from confocal microscopy images and compared with those in 2D control experiments. The EGFR expressions were further evaluated in the presence of two EGFR inhibitors. U-87 cell line and three primary GBM cell cultures successfully colonized the scaffolds. Morphological differences were observed between 2D and 3D models with 3D models more closely representing in vivo observations. Microtube-like protrusions were present in both 2D and 3D models but the 3D model better matched the morphology of microtubes in vivo. There were no significant differences in expressions and subcellular localizations of EGFR between 2D and 3D models. However, EGFR internalizations were not prevented in the presence of EGFR inhibitors. This previously-unreported observation may explain the in vivo resistance of GBM cells to inhibitors. The 3D-engineered scaffolds provided a new suitable model that better replicated the GBM’s natural environment with advantages that were difficult to capture in 2D models.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

This network has the double function of supporting the weight of the mountain and connecting and stabilizing the towers. With the “Rotterdam Mountain” Project as a starting point, the thesis aims to investigate the structural feasibility and performance of a new typology for the design of high-rise towers, where a cable network interconnects and stabilizes them. The goal of the thesis is to investigate the design of such a system with respect to relevant parameters, as the relative position of the cable-net (RPC) or the spacing between towers (SBT). Such, a core system to which the cable-net is connected is used throughout the thesis. To understand the relative influence of different parameters, a parametric approach (in Grasshopper) is used, that allows for a rapid change of the initial properties of the system. The Grasshopper script is linked to the Robot Structural Analysis (RSA) software, where a non-linear analysis is performed. The outputs of the RSA analysis refer to both the serviceability limit state and ultimate limit state, as both the core and cable-net are designed to meet the stability and strength requirements imposed by the Eurocode. Based on the Eurocode checks, conclusions are drawn on the preliminary design of the system, by identifying multiple design zones with respect to the two relevant parameters: a zone where the stability of the core is governing (for a SBT of up to 90 meters, and an RPC of up to ~0.6), a zone where the strength of the core is governing (for a SBT higher than 90 meters or an RPC higher than ~0.6), or a zone where the influence of the cable-net is negligible (for an RPC lower than ~0.1). Conclusions are further drawn on the performance of the system, by comparing it to the simple core and outrigger systems. It is observed that the proposed core + cable-net system performs (at least) as good in terms of stability and strength with less material usage. A concrete weight reduction of the core of up to 50% is observed when compared to the simple core and a steel weight reduction of up to 20% is observed when compared to the outrigger. From an economic point of view, preliminary calculations have shown a reduction of the total weight of the structure of up to 14%, due to the increase in slenderness when the cable-net is placed. This is equivalent to a number of up to 5 extra floors that can be constructed with the same amount of material. With these remarks in mind, it is concluded that, based on this preliminary study, the cable-net stabilized towers can pose a feasible alternative to the design of high-rise towers, and they can be efficiently used for the ambitious “Rotterdam Mountain” project.","High-rise; Cables; Cable network; Parametric Engineering; form finding; Concrete; Robot Structural Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

There is a lack of model-scale tests where dynamic sturcutral properties were systematically varied to derive the influence of these properties on boundaries of the three crushing regimes. Those regimes are intermittent crushing, where both the ice load and displacement signal have a sawtooth pattern, frequency lock-in, with its characteristic sinusoidal displacement signal and continuous brittle crushing with smaller random ice loads and structural displacements compared to the two previously mentioned regimes. The first goal of this thesis is to test if an error in the dynamic structural properties (mass, stiffness and damping) has an effect on the transition velocities of the crushing regimes. Secondly, a parameter study has been done to derive trends in the transition velocities when changing dynamic structural properties. Ultimately, in literature proposed dimensionless numbers, which are particularly only taking linear elastic ice parameters into account, have been checked for rightness.<br/>To be able to achieve the above mentioned goals of the thesis, a model-scale test campaign has been performed at the Aalto Ice Tank as part of the SHIVER test campagin. 36 unique single degree of freedom configurations have been tested to derive trends in ice-structure interaction when changing dynamic structural parameters. The most notable element of this test campaign was the usage of a real-time hybrid test setup, which allowed the testing of multiple sets of structural parameters while only one physical structure was used. <br/>Those test signify that there is a relation between mass, stiffness, natural frequency and damping and transition velocities inbetween the three crushing regimes. When mass, stiffness and natural frequency increase, the boundaries of those regimes shift to lower velocities. An increase in damping caused the velocity of the boundary between frequency lock-in and continuous brittle crushing to go up, while the boundary between intermittent crushing and frequency lock-in was not influenced by the change in damping. Furthermore, from the tests it could be conlcuded that dimensionless numbers based on only linear elastic parameters are not correct and more parameters should be taken into account as well.<br/>The thesis is a steping stone into more research into the dependency of ice-induced vibrations on dynamic structural properties with different initial conditions or structural properties.

However, not many studies have been conducted for the dormancy of microorganisms in the wastewater treatment sector. Treatment processes like the NEREDA® technology use Phosphate Accumulating Organisms (PAO) to remove phosphate from the wastewater. If dormancy affects these bacteria, it can cause the wastewater treatment plants to function at a lower capacity. Reviving dormant PAOs can increase treatment capacity and treat the wastewater during high influent loading without effluent deterioration. Studying the optimal conditions for granule storage without inducing dormancy can be advantageous during granule transport for inoculation of reactors during their start-up phase. This study presents the first independent assessment of the possible dormancy of PAOs in Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS).<br/><br/>In this research thesis, dormancy is a survival strategy opted by PAOs to persist substrate limitation. There are two different pathways to dormancy that has been explored here. Responsive switching and starvation are studied as they express fast and slow transition respectively into dormancy. Lag faced during resuscitation of dormant cells is considered proportional to the length of dormancy in responsive switching. <br/> <br/>The experimental phase of the research can be interpreted in three parts: first through method development, second through method testing and third through the application of the developed method. The method was developed to understand dormancy in PAOs by observing differences in their maintenance and activity rates. This method was then tested on granules where dormancy was induced by lowering the temperature to 4ºC and anaerobically storing without feed. This method was then applied to newly sampled granules from a full-scale reactor to study dormancy in the PAOs. The developed method increased the activity of the former granules by 60% but did not raise the activity of the latter. Maintenance rates increased by 167% and 68%, respectively, in the granules. Although dormancy could not be sufficiently proved by the method, starvation of PAOs in Utrecht NEREDA® reactors was possible. <br","Aerobic granular sludge; PAO; DORMANCY; Starvation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Mazhar, O. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As robots are becoming a more integral part in our daily lives, it is important to ensure they work in a safe and efficient manner. A large part of perceiving the environment is done through robot vision. Research in computer vision and machine learning lead to great improvements in the past decades and robots are able to outperform humans on certain tasks. However, these tasks are often in closed set condition. This makes translation to a real world application challenging, as this is in open set condition. The open set condition implies that incomplete knowledge of the world is available at training time. It is important for a robot, or agent, to be aware of this limitation. In vision tasks this is defined as open world recognition and allows an agent to detect and incrementally learn unknown objects. The key contributions of this report are an autonomous data collection protocol for synthetic data creation, the open world algorithm Learning to Accept Image Classes (L2AIC) and an on-the-job recognition approach that combines open world recognition with autonomous data collection. L2AIC is a deep meta-learning model that classifies objects by comparing it to its memory in an n-way k-shot manner. New classes can be incrementally added to the memory without needing to retrain the model. The autonomous data collection protocol consists of two steps. First, a 3D model is reconstructed from an unknown object with an RGB-D camera. Secondly, from this 3D model a synthetic dataset is created that is added to the memory of L2AIC. Results show that the on-the-job recognition approach is successful in learning to recognize a single unknown object using the L2AIC model with small-fc architecture an ResNet152 encoder. The encoder is loaded with pretrained weights on the ImageNet dataset. No additional fine-tuning is required, this has an adverse effect on the performance. Using the autonomous data collection protocol two datasets were created, varying the distance from the camera to the object. It was found that the synthetic dataset containing close-up images achieves the best performance. The performance of L2AIC with this closeup synthetic dataset is similar to using a dataset of actual images of the object. This means that for a single object it currently is not efficient to create a synthetic dataset. A more extensive study is required to compare performance of both datasets when increasing the number of encountered objects. Finally, the on-the-job approach shows it is capable of recognizing other instances of the same object class, using only the dataset of a single instance. This shows the on-the-job recognition approach is able to generalize well. Future work could be focused on improving this generalization with, for example, the help of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).","machine learning; meta-learning; object recognition; open world learning; on-the-job learning; 3D reconstruction; Synthetic data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Naturally, the market is driven to reduce the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCoE) to become more competitive with fossil fuels and less dependent on government subsidies. A transition in wind farm development towards deeper waters is expected and already observed in the market, driven by decreasing availability of shallow area's and higher wind resource at far offshore locations. The majority of the northern part of the North Sea is between 60 - 120 meter deep, currently the jacket foundation is deemed as the foundation of choice for this water depth range. Despite several technological advantages of the jacket, the main downsides are the large engineering effort and welds required to produce such a foundation resulting in difficult series production and high costs. This does not align with the industry's ambition to lower the LCoE. As such, the need for a technologically viable and economically attractive foundation concept for waters between 60 - 120 meter deep arises.<br/><br/>The goal of this research can be divided in to two parts. The first part is to determine the potential of conventional monopiles in this water range and identify the main limiting factors. To do so, a monopile is dimensioned at a selected reference location for three turbines representing the current, near future and future outlook of the market. The designed monopiles are tested for manufacturabiliy, Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Fatigue Limit State (FLS) to identify the technical showstoppers. Next, in the second part, a novel monopile design is introduced and analysed to work around the identified limits.<br/><br/>To dimension the monopiles for the three reference turbines a parametric dimensioning script is developed. The monopile geometry is dimensioned to have a selected first natural frequency of 0.20 Hz, based on the relevant frequency diagrams. Next, these geometries are tested against mudline ULS failure for the power production and parked condition load cases. Hereafter, an FLS check for the B1, C1 and D S-N curves is conducted based on the obtained scatter tables for site conditions. It was found that D-curve fatigue damage for non grinded butt welds is the main limiting factor for all dimensioned monopiles in deep water. However, industry experts believe that all welds can be grinded in the production process, eradicating the need to assess the D-curve. When assuming this statement to be true the newly obtained limits become ULS failure during parked conditions for the 15 MW reference turbine and manufacturability constraints for the 20 MW reference turbine. The Haliade X showed no limits within the specified water depth range when neglecting the D curve fatigue damage.<br/><br/>A perforated monopile concept with reduced available area for wave loading is introduced. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model based on the 2003 Menter Shear Stress Transport turbulence model is constructed for a perforated monopile to gain insights into how waves propagate through the structure and the forces associated with this. The CFD model is verified against experimental wave flume data before being used for further analysis showing a root mean square error of 0.0192 between model results and experiments. The CFD model is used to assess three geometries with different perforations and levels of porosity. No increased drag around the first natural frequency caused by the perforations, hinting to favourable dynamics, was found in any of the test cases. As such, the dynamic response of the three perforated monopiles was found to be unchanged when compared to a reference pile without perforations. Despite this, a significant reduction of lifetime fatigue damage was observed caused by the reduced forces acting on the structure resulting from the smaller frontal surface. Next, the mudline stresses are recalculated and a structural finite element model to assess the stress concentrations around the perforations is set up to verify the maximum allowable stress level threshold is not exceeded. A geometry was found which shows a 35.5% reduction of lifetime fatigue damage whilst stresses remain below the maximum threshold, hereby showing the potential of the perforated monopile. Implementing this perforation allows the use of monopiles up to 87 meter deep, limited by D curve fatigue. Reference piles without perforations were found to be infeasible for all assessed water depths, also limited by D curve fatigue. It is shown that the perforation concept can either be implemented to push the monopile foundation to deeper waters, or can be used to realise steel reduction at current water depths.<br/><br","Monopiles; Offshore Wind; Perforation; Renewable Energ; Wind.

In this study, the effect of blade sweep on the trade-off between propeller efficiency and noise is investigated. A panel method was implemented to analyze the propeller aerodynamics, while a tonal far-field frequency formulation was used to analyze the propeller acoustics. It was concluded that the effect of blade sweep on the thickness noise for conventional propeller systems at a constant advance ratio is noticeable. A relation was found for the trade-off between propeller efficiency and noise. This relation shows that the sensitivity of noise reduction reduces as the maximum allowed efficiency penalty is increased.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Agriculture was one of the main income revenues for ancient Basrah even though it received only an average of 60mm of rainfall per year, indicating a large reliance on irrigation. Therefore, this study focuses on how the landscape would have offered options for irrigated farming. The unique element of this irrigation system is the existence of many large ridges, however their significance is not yet understood.<br/>Within this study a HEC-RAS hydraulic model was set up to explore the hypothesis of the ridges themselves having served the function of elevated agricultural fields. Therefore, multiple scenarios were constructed and sensitivity analysis of the boundary conditions performed, to explore how easily the landscape within the ridge area could be flooded and transformed into a marshland. The results showed that although there were always some dry spots between the fields, most of it was flooded all day and all year round, with a mean water depth ranging from 0.3m to 0.6m. The maximum water depth stayed below 5m in all model variations (except for one sensitivity analysis run), therefore the ridges (which have been hypothesized to originally have been 5 m tall) would have stayed dry.<br/>The main limitations were set by the lack of data available. Except for the elevation data, very little data was available in general and additionally no data from before the 1940’s was available. Therefore, this study should be viewed as an exploration of how the system may have functioned given certain hypothesized boundary conditions. Further research for confirmation of the utilized boundary conditions is necessary to confirm the study results, for example decreasing the river cross-sections by 25% lead to an increase in mean depth of up to 26%.","HEC-RAS; Hydraulic Modeling; Basrah","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Masania, K. (graduation committee); Çağlar, B. (graduation committee); Alderliesten, R.C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Mechanical air entrapment, void compression and void dissolution are the main mechanisms behind void formation in liquid composite molding. Mechanical air entrapment is induced by the highly non-uniform geometry at the meso- and micro-scale and the heterogeneous properties of the reinforcing material. This results in differences in the velocity profile through the porous- and free flow domains, which can lead to air being entrapped in slow-flowing domains, by resin flowing through the faster flowing domains. Depending on the competition between the viscous flow through the free flow domains and the capillary flow through the porous domains, voids occur either in the intra-bundle domain or in the inter-bundle domain, where the competition between the two flow types can be quantified by the capillary number. Once the voids are entrapped, they can change in size due to void compression and -dissolution, all which occur on considerably different timescales. An experimental set-up was developed which uses fast radiation curing to almost instantly cure the resin during injection and thus detach the different stages of void formation from each other. In this research the relationship between the mesoscale structure of a woven fabric and mesoscale void formation was investigated. The mesoscale structure is strongly related to void formation, as viscous flow is related to the inter-bundle domain size in the through-thickness direction of the preform and capillary flow is related to the mesoscale bundle porosity. As the bundle porosity is related to both the bundle permeability, and the capillary pressure, its influences on void formation were considered to be large, and thus bundle porosity became the main research topic. A 2D semi-analytical model based on mechanical air entrapment was constructed which was capable of determining the filling times of the intra- and inter-bundle domains on the mesoscale. A parameter called the competitive number was introduced which was related to these filling times. Once the competitive number was larger than 1, spherical inter-bundle voids should be formed, once it was equal to 1 no voids should be formed and once it was lower than 1 ellipsoidal intra-bundle voids should be formed. This model was validated experimentally. Flow behavior predicted by the model was compared to video footage of the flow front propagation at the surface of the preform at the macro- and mesoscale during multiple injections. Void volumes, types and locations obtained from the model were compared to voids observed in micro-CT scanned samples and were in agreement with each other. The validated model was eventually used to investigate the effects of bundle porosity on void formation. It was found that increased bundle porosity at a constant global preform porosity, leads to increased intra-bundle flow and decreased viscous flow, thus considerably influencing void formation by mechanical air entrapment. In short injection cycles with high macroscopic flow velocities, which can lead to intra-bundle voids, it could be beneficial to switch a fabric with a higher bundle porosity, as that would effectively reduce the intra-bundle void size. For injections with low macroscopic flow velocities, the opposite would apply, thus usage of fabrics with lower bundle porosities could help to reduce the inter-bundle void volumes.","Voids; RTM; Resin Transfer Molding; Liquid composite molding; Woven fabrics; Mesoscale; macroscale; Permeability; Capillary pressure; Porosity; Bundles; Pores; micro-CT; Fast radiation curing; Dual-scale flow; Flow front; Darcy's law; Brinkman; Continuity equation; Mechanical air entrapment; Void compression; Void dissolution; Degassing; Unsaturated flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the past, the relationship between humans and nature was known to have high interdependency reflected by integrating people’s activities and behaviour towards nature. This integration can be seen through rituals, rules, and folktales, including awareness, responsibility, and respect between nature and humans. However, some influences gradually alter the relationship and nature by entering the Anthropocene era and industrialization, modernity, and globalization. Thus, it becomes divisible and changes the ways humans perceive and manage landscape (McHarg, 1992). <br/><br/>On the other hand, rich natural and cultural land, namely Toba Caldera Geopark, is facing shifts in its economic scheme: becoming the main priority in the tourism sector in Indonesia for national economic growth. Thus, it raises three main challenges that need to be addressed to achieve sustainable and inclusive tourism while also promoting socio-ecological resilience within local society. The first is about revealing nature capacity, continuity, and limit in order to address biophysical integration. The second is about unfolding the changing of human cultural identity that is presently (and in the past) becoming tourism assets and vulnerably to loss because of sharing culture, social well-being, and prosperity in order to promote social resiliency.

Previous research conducted in a Tencent Datacenter using traditional regression models such as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) resulted in a 98% accurate prediction model that can predict 15 days in advance of a battery unit failure.

In this work, an MPC-based active seat control algorithm is designed that can generate and track whole-body vibrations of a particular frequency to induce sleep in the passenger while minimising road vibrations. The controller is tested with different input tracking frequencies and its performance is evaluated using RMSE seat displacement and the lower body RMS acceleration of the passenger. Next, the controller is evaluated on its ability to induce sleepiness in passengers with a pilot study using a moving-base simulator. Using a pool of nine volunteers, the effectiveness of the generated vibrations is validated by subjectively and objectively evaluating the induced sleepiness. The results indicated an onset of sleepiness in the volunteers.","Model Predictive Control; Seat suspension control; Sleepiness; Active seat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

A primary challenge on the road to this future is the question of how to use the knowledge gathered from sensory data to establish an optimal shape<br/>adaptively and continuously in-flight.<br/><br/>To address this challenge, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for online black-box aerodynamic performance optimization for active morphing wings. The proposed method seeks to extend the scope of state-of-the-art online performance optimization methods by integrating a global online-learned radial basis function neural network model with a derivative-free evolutionary optimization strategy. The effectiveness of the optimization strategy was tested on a Vortex Lattice Method aerodynamic model of an over-actuated morphing wing that was corrected using previously collected wind tunnel data. Simulations show that the proposed method is able to control the morphing shape and angle of attack to achieve various target lift coefficients with better aerodynamic efficiency than the unmorphed wing shape. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the optimization architecture was experimentally evaluated on an active trailing-edge camber morphing wing demonstrator with distributed sensing and control, the SmartX-Alpha, in the open jet facility of Delft University of Technology. Compared to the unmorphed shape, a 7.8 % drag reduction was realized, while achieving the required amount of lift. Further data-driven predictions have indicated that even higher reductions in drag are achievable and have provided insight into the trends in optimal wing shapes for a wide range of lift targets.<br","Morphing Wing; Neural Networks; Evolutionary optimization; Online; Aerodynamic performance; Black-box optimization; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-27","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Organ-on-Chip (OoC) technology aims to aid faster development of new drugs by providing more accurate in vitro models of human tissue, ultimately leading to a higher number of potentially successful drug candidates during preclinical testing. To achieve this, convergence of different engineering disciplines is necessary for fabricating cell culture environments that closely mimic their in vivo counterparts and offer better technological capabilities compared to conventional cell cultures by incorporating cell stimulation and sensor integration. In the case of human blood-brain barrier (BBB), these models offer invaluable insight into how BBB disruption causes neurodegeneration associated with many progressive diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. In this thesis work, a novel OoC device for measuring permeability of the blood-brain barrier using impedance spectroscopy was designed and fabricated. The core of the device is a suspended, 150nm-thin silicon nitride microporous membrane which enables an in-vivo-like separation distance between cells constituting the BBB. A sidewall electrode topology was proposed as it offers a fully unobstructed view of the cell culture environment. A cleanroom-based fabrication flow was devised which enabled device fabrication of a two-channel microfluidic device with integrated impedance spectroscopy electrodes. Through simulation-based modelling, the electrode topology was optimized and was shown to be highly uniform in terms of measurement sensitivity, removing the need for commonly used measurement correction functions. To go beyond the limits of photolithography, a process flow utilizing convective self-assembly-based nanosphere lithography was demonstrated in fabricating sub-500 nm diameter pores, thereby facilitating higher pore density per cultured cell. A preliminary testing setup was designed, but due to machine unavailability in the cleanroom the full fabrication of the device could not be completed and testing of the final device is expected to be done in the future in a biology lab.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment modalities available to treat cancer. Radiotherapy treatment plans are created based on CT scans of the patient. In such scans the macroscopic tumor is visible, but microscopic disease present in the surrounding tissue cannot be observed. To achieve an optimal clinical outcome, both the macroscopic and the microscopic disease must be treated. Currently, the macroscopic tumor is extended by a margin into the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) to include the microscopic disease in the treated volume. The same margin is used for all patients, although the extent of microscopic disease is patient-specific and can vary largely among patients.<br/><br/>In this study, probabilistic treatment planning was investigated as a method to replace the margin concept. Probabilistic models were created by explicitly modeling uncertainties in the microscopic disease into an objective function used in the treatment plan optimization. By optimizing either the expected Tumor Control Probability (ETCP) or the expected Logarithmic Tumor Control Probability (ELTCP), optimal dose distributions could be obtained. Two different one-dimensional models for probabilistic treatment planning were investigated.<br/>In the first model, the uncertainty in the extent of the microscopic disease was modeled into an objective function. This was done using a function that describes the probability of finding microscopic disease at a certain distance from the macroscopic disease. In the second model, the uncertainty in the tumor cell density in the microscopic disease area was modeled into an objective function. The uncertainty was modeled by defining the tumor cell density field as a random field and generating different realizations of the tumor cell density field using a Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion. <br/>For the first model, both the ETCP and the ELTCP were used as objective functions and in the second model, only the ETCP was used as an objective function. Furthermore, a penalized ETCP objective function was investigated for both models. In this penalized objective function a penalty on the dose was used to allow for controlling the balance between tumor control and sparing of normal tissue.<br/><br/>Using the first model, two different types of dose distributions were found. When the ETCP was optimized, the maximum dose was given to as large a volume as possible and no dose was given in the rest of the investigated volume. When the ELTCP was optimized, dose was given throughout the volume, so that the whole volume received as much dose as possible. Optimization of both objectives resulted in good tumor control. When the penalized ETCP was optimized, dose was given to a much smaller part of the volume than with the unpenalized objective, while the tumor control was still good. <br/>Using the second model, it was shown that the KL-expansion is a promising method to model the uncertainty in tumor cell density. Different shapes of the input mean tumor cell density field were investigated. Optimizing the ETCP resulted in realistic dose distributions. Good tumor control was obtained for the different shapes of the input mean tumor cell density field. Furthermore, using the penalized ETCP, good tumor control was retained, while the dose deposited in the volume was decreased.<br/><br/>In conclusion, probabilistic treatment planning promises to be a good alternative to the current margin concept. It was shown that good tumor control could be achieved in the microscopic disease area using probabilistic objective functions. Both models showed promising results and the penalized objectives showed that it is possible to balance between tumor control in the microscopic disease area and sparing of normal tissue. Additional research is necessary to extend the one-dimensional KL-model into a more detailed three-dimensional model. Furthermore, the objectives need to be implemented in treatment planning systems to create real patient plans. Such studies should be performed in cooperation with clinicians and radiologists.<br","Radiotherapy; CTV Margin; Treatment Planning; Cancer; Microscopic Disease; Probabilistic Treatment Planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

This thesis focuses on extracting CO<sub>2</sub>  from Chimney stacks and regenerating the solvent using electrochemistry. The main aim of this thesis is to identify a solvent that is capable of being used as a good CO<sub>2 </sub>capture medium and at the same time as an electrolyte for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.<br/>Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have been gaining much attention due to their desirable properties such as biodegradability, low vapour pressure, and high tunability for the required purpose. Research has shown promising results in the application of DES in the field of CO<sub>2</sub> capture at a lower price with more eco-friendly solvent. Choline chloride is the most widely used quaternary amine salt which has all the desirable properties; when combined with a CO<sub>2</sub> philic hydrogen bond donor group such as amines, a novel solvent could be formed. The low/negligible vapour pressure of DES makes it suitable for CO<sub>2</sub> absorption in industrial applications. Based on the literature, three different solvents were selected, Choline chloride and Ethylene glycol (ChCl:EG), Choline chloride and Monoethanolamine (ChCl:MEA) and Choline chloride with Aminomethyl propanol (ChCl:AMP).<br/>Various experiments were conducted on different molar ratios of selected solvents to determine the physico-chemical properties. Viscosity was measured as it affects the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption capacity due to limiting the mass transfer and has a significant impact on ion mobility resulting in high ohmic drops and reduced efficiency of the electrochemical extraction process. Conductivity was also measured as having higher conductivity will reduce the ohmic drop and improve the CO<sub>2</sub> removal process; conductivity is inversely related to viscosity. Effect of varying temperature, water and CO<sub>2</sub> loading was observed on these physical properties.<br/>Based on the experiments conducted, it was found that ChCl:EG solutions have the highest conductivity among the pure solvents, with some of the lowest viscosities. In the case of ChCl:MEA, the viscosity reduced with the increase in temperature and increased drastically on the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is because of the formation of carbamates as confirmed by FTIR. ChCl:AMP is a unique solvent as absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> results in the formation of a bicarbonate precipitate, as shown in FTIR.<br/>Addition of EG to ChCl:MEA solution improves the performance of the DES significantly. At similar CO<sub>2</sub> loading, the viscosity of ChCl:EG:MEA (1:4:3) is almost 63.88% less and the electrical conductivity 134.45 % more than ChCl:MEA(1:6)<br","Deep Eutectic Solvents; Carbon capture; Amine; choline chloride","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Ongoing sea level rise combined with significant levels of land subsidence cause the everlasting need for reinforcements of the current coastal protection measures to ensure a certain level of coastal safety. Developing countries in the Asian regions tend to suffer from even more severe levels of land subsidence and often lack the financial resources to fulfil these continuing needs for reinforcements, which put the coastal areas under the continuous tread for potential flood disasters. The Lease Polder is a new Building with Nature approach for the sustainable design of protective coastlines and can offer a durable solution to this current problem. The concept is built upon the principle of sharing a part of the land with the hydraulic system and thereby allowing the natural vertical growth of the area by siltation during in- and outgoing tide. The concept is, however, still in its infancy, causing numerous uncertainties regarding the feasibility. The critical design parameter that affects the feasibility is the Lease Polder period, denoting the duration for which the breach of the Lease Polder is kept open. This study aims to offer a quick assessment tool that can determine the optimal Lease Polder period and perform a feasibility analysis for arbitrary Lease Polder cases, based on a sensitivity analysis of influential parameters on the potential siltation process. <br/><br/>A simplified 2DH process-based Delft3D model was used to perform a sensitivity analysis on multiple sediment characteristics, hydraulic boundaries and dimensional parameters. The parameter sensitivity was determined by comparing the results from a set of parameter scenarios to a base-case model. This base-case model was a simplified version of the Tollesbury realignment site and was calibrated and validated on the available historical data sets. The base-case model was simplified to a square 430m by 430m basin area with a near-horizontal initial bed level 1m above average sea level and a 50m wide breach. The foreshore was assumed to be alongshore uniform with an offshore tidal boundary condition and an assigned level of suspended sediment concentration. A wave module was coupled to the flow module to include a constant input of wave forces. Processing the results consisted of exponential curve fitting through the average change in bed level of each scenario, followed by the determination of the initial sedimentation rate and the average equilibrium bed level. These two characteristics were then transformed into parameter specific functions describing the dimensionless<br/>dependency for a given parameter value relative to the base-case scenario. A quick assessment tool called the WisLi-tool was created to predict the sedimentation curve for arbitrary Lease Polder cases, based on these parameter specific functions. It thereafter uses this curve to perform a cost-benefit analysis<br/>on the complete life cycle of a Lease Polder, resulting in a quantitative net profit or loss. Finally, the tool will enter an optimization process by determining the optimal Lease Polder period which results in the maximum financial benefit.<br/><br/>The simplified model based on the Tollesbury was able to accurately reproduce the morphological changes which followed from the historical data analysis. A summary of the sensitivity of the most significant parameters is listed below.<br/>Suspended sediment concentration The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at the boundary showed a positive linear relationship with the initial rate of sedimentation, where the increase in SSC was directly proportional to the increase in initial sedimentation rate. The average equilibrium bed level was however independent of the SSC. Breach width The breach width showed to have a negative relationship for both the initial rate of sedimentation and the average equilibrium depth. Polder length and width The dimensional length and width of the polder showed to have an insignificant effect on the initial sedimentation rate, with differences remaining within the 10% range. The average equilibrium bed level decreased for increasing polder length and width. Initial polder bed level The sensitivity analysis on the initial polder bed level showed a dichotomy into two regimes, where the ’shallow regime’ was coherent to initial bed levels betweenODÅ1.0m andOD¡1.5m and the ’deep regime’ to the bed levels between OD ¡2.0m and OD ¡4.0m. The deep regime was characterized by the abrupt stop in sedimentation due to the high levels of wave energy entering the polder. Both regimes showed decreasing levels of initial sedimentation rate and average equilibrium bed level for increasing initial polder bed levels. Tidal amplitude The tidal amplitude showed to have a positive relationship with the initial sedimentation rate and the average equilibrium bed level for tidal amplitudes of 2.5m and lower. Higher tidal amplitudes caused high-velocity circular flow patterns within the polder, preventing further siltation. The above-mentioned relationships were translated into functions describing the dimensionless dependency for a given parameter value relative to the base-case scenario. <br/><br/>The analysis on the effect of sea level rise on the sedimentation process of a Lease Polder concluded that the siltation process was able to produce a local bed level change following the exact rate of sea level rise, for an average rate of sea level rise of 4.2mm/year . The Lease Polder can, therefore, be seen as a partly self-sustaining system of coastal defence. The quick assessment WisLi-tool was able to accurately predict the sedimentation curve based on case-specific input parameters using the dimensionless functions derived from the sensitivity analysis. By utilizing location-dependent financial input parameters, the tool was capable of performing an optimization process for the determination of the optimal Lease Polder period. <br/><br/>The final conclusion is that there is not a single uniform optimal duration for the Lease Polder period but that it may vary for each individual Lease Polder case. However, the WisLi-tool was able to assess arbitrary Lease Polder cases based on their parameter values and could determine the case-specific optimal duration of the Lease Polder period. Therefore, the WisLi-tool can act as a valuable resource during both the design and operational phases.","Lease Polder; Wisselpolder; Delft3d; hydraulic engineering; Numerical modeling; modeling; Tide; Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The ALERD operates autonomously underwater, which saves energy during the dredging process and transit. Autonomous underwater operation drives the need of alternative energy facilities. However, due to the energy savings of dredging, alternative energy supplies are possible. A wish of C-Job is that the ALERD operates with zero emissions, and therefore the system should comply with it as well. This introduces the research goal: Devising a sustainable electrical energy supply for ALERD. An additional challenge to the research goal is that the dimensions are not yet established and are still an open question in the research.<br/>The simulation model uses the calculated electric load balance of the Autonomous Underwater Maintenance Dredger (AUMD) and scaling to determine the power balance of the ALERD over various hopper volumes. Furthermore, the operational area has been studied to determine charging/bunker locations and distances. The project requires an annual sedimentation of 12 million m³, including foreshore and coastal replenishment.<br/>To determine the best system, a literature review was done towards the systems. Two key systems came out as the best systems for autonomous and sustainable operation: The Li-ion battery and the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The systems have very different characteristics. Typically, batteries have high costs for the energy storage and fuel cells costs are determined by the nominal power output.<br/>The abovementioned systems were both used in a simulated operational profile of the ALERD. Results from the simulation, suggests that the battery has the optimal performance at 2-3 times dredging per energy cycle, where 4-9 times are the optima for the Hybrid solution. When both systems have charging/bunker stations near the operational area, a dredging cost of €*** per m³ can be achieved for both systems. However, when the ship is charging/bunkering in the port, the costs per m³ increase with €*** for the hybrid and €*** for the battery powered ALERD. This results in a maximal investment of €** million for a local charging/bunker station, to be economically feasible. By making these stations accessible for other purposes, profit can be taken to recoup the investment. It is however expected, that these local stations will not be feasible for the first generation of ALERDs.<br/>When cost development is taken into account, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) prefers the hybrid system. Which is a result from the sharply decreasing hydrogen and fuel cell costs. The system also achieves a lower TCO than a conventional dredger, in a manageable time.<br/>A (near) future orientated system has also been considered, the direct-fed ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). It has comparable costs per cubic metre for port bunkering as the other systems, when they are locally charging/bunkering. Furthermore, there are a lot of practical advantages by the use of ammonia instead of hydrogen as fuel. This consists of better fuel handling and easier storage. <br/>Together with the benefits of taking more energy inside the ALERD, it is believed that the hybrid types of ALERD have the best characteristics for coastal maintenance. It depends on the developments of the ammonia SOFC, if it is ready to supply energy to the ALERD, or that the hydrogen PEMFC is the best solution in a hybrid design. Furthermore, the decision depends on the results of the weight and stability study, which is still ongoing. The results could eliminate a systems by its volume or weight. Due to the reserved space and freedom in the ship design, this is however not expected.<br","Sustainable; Economic engineering; Submarine; Fuel cells; Batteries; Dredging; Optimization; Dredger; Cost optimization; Scaling; cost analysis; Electric load balance; Simulation; Power; Energy; Calculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-26","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","Development of the ALERD","52.29305222001756, 4.709822557998245"

The unchanged water depth, the equilibrium seabed, in inlet systems is important to know for shipping near harbours and wildlife in nature reserves.<br/>An idealized exploratory version of this complex system of morphodynamics to find the equilibrium solutions is usually modelled in a depth- and width-averaged way, which removes the vertical structure. Hence I will investigate if it is possible to model the system in a width-averaged two-dimensional way with the vertical structure intact and what are the consequences of retaining the vertical structure?<br/>To investigate this the construction of a two-dimensional model is described and the solution methods posed. Following this the resulting equilibrium sea beds are compared to the equilibrium sea beds found in depth-averaged one-dimensional models to ascertain the importance of the vertical structure.<br/>It was found that adding the vertical structure makes the resulting governing equations of the model more complex but can be solved with perturbation techniques. Furthermore, for specific sets of parameters describing the system it is possible to have multiple equilibrium sea beds, which suggests the existence of bifurcations. Finally, it is possible to find a relation between the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional governing equations that results in both models producing the same results.<br/>Concluding, two-dimensional models compared to one-dimensional models add an extra layer of complexity which allows for bifurcations but makes the model computatively more expensive. Instead, using the relation found in this paper in a one-dimensional model is preferred as in theory it results in the same equilibrium sea beds found.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Patients visiting a hospital for elective surgery often have multiple consultations with a surgeon before undergoing surgery. Hospitals discern between different types of consultations, and make a schedule allocating timeslots of outpatient department sessions to these different consultation types several weeks in advance. Changing the proportion of consultation types affects the patient waiting lists for both consultations and surgery. However, the precise consequences of such interventions are uncertain, as not all patients follow the same treatment pathway. Furthermore, as these planning decisions are made far in advance, they are based on an uncertain prediction of future waiting lists. The goal is to use these interventions to control waiting lists, in order to reduce waiting times for patients and ensure that all available time capacity in the outpatient department and operating room is used. This problem is referred to as the timeslot allocation problem. In this thesis, we study the performance of various solution methods in achieving this goal.<br/><br/>The problem is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). As the state space is very large, the problem does not admit an exact solution. Therefore, least-squares policy iteration is used to find an approximate solution. We also formulate an (integer) linear program which is used to solve a deterministic variant of the MDP, and investigate some simple decision rules.<br/><br/>This thesis features a case study at the Sint Maartenskliniek, a hospital focusing on orthopaedic care in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Data from the hospital is used to make a simulation with which solution methods can be tested and compared. We find that all methods improve on the static roster method used by the hospital, with the linear program leading to the best results. Furthermore, planning less far ahead allows for a better prediction of the state for which to plan, and so also leads to better performance. In the case of SMK, we recommend fixing 60\% of the timeslots using a static roster method 12 weeks in advance, and using the integer linear program to schedule the remaining 40\% of appointments 6 weeks in advance.","Optimization; Least squares policy iteration; Reinforcement learning; Healthcare planning; Linear programming; Markov Decision Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Accidents in buildings happen frequently and if people are not evacuated in time, this can have major consequences. The behaviour of building occupants is one of the most critical determinants herein. <br/>Evacuation behaviour consists of two phases: the response phase and the evacuation movement phase. During the response phase, a building occupant is notified of an incident and performs a series of information and action tasks. When the response phase is finished, a building occupant will initiate movement towards an exit or safe place during the evacuation movement phase.<br/>In this thesis, the focus is on response-phase behaviour. There are many factors influencing response-phase behaviour, four of these are: culture, cues, affiliation and setting. <br/>Culture is defined as ""the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others"". For this research, national cultures have been considered. <br/>Cues are any kind of changes in the environment, which indicate that something is not normal. Affiliation encompasses the tendency for people to seek friends or colleagues. Lastly, setting limits the knowledge obtained and the type of actions which can be performed based on the location of the building occupant.<br/><br/>The following research question has been answered: "" How does culture, in combination with cues, settings and affiliation, influence response-phase behaviour and time and total evacuation time ? ”. To answer the research question, a case study was introduced. In this case study library evacuations have been considered in Czech Republic, Poland, Turkey and the UK. Within the context of this case study a questionnaire and an agent-based model have been developed.<br/><br/>The results show that that there are significant differences in the number of response tasks being performed. Turkey performs the highest number of response tasks, followed in a decreasing order by Poland, Czech Republic and the UK. Furthermore, it has been found that response behaviour in all countries is influenced by cues, setting and affiliation, which results in significant differences between the countries for their response and evacuation time. It has been found that, as with the number of response tasks, Turkey has the highest evacuation and response times, followed in a decreasing order by Poland, Czech Republic and the UK. Lastly, it has been found that affiliation and being informed by a staff member highly affect response and evacuation times, while the setting and seeing fire do not. The degrees to which these factors influence response and evacuation times differ per country.<br/><br/>Overall, this research acknowledges the importance of performing cross-cultural research for evacuation behaviour. It has shown the need for policy makers and emergency planners to discuss effects of culture on evacuations. Additionally, it provides a new approach to study the effect of cultures, in combination with cues, setting and affiliation, on response-phase behaviour and response and evacuation times.<br","Agent-Based Modeling; Evacuations; Evacuation behaviour; Response-phase behaviour; Response time; Cross-cultural","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The medical industry generates a large amount of waste, much of which are disposable medical instruments and consumables, of which some are not reused. In the context of creating more circularity, an “all-in-one” process has been designed for the reprocessing of the Rüsch Polaris Fiber Optic Laryngoscope Blades made from Zamak. A system was designed where blades were reprocessed by means of melting into new raw material which was used to make new products. The blades are melted in a receptacle containing a grate with 3 mm x 3mm holes which acts as a filter. This receptacle is connected to a mold where the liquid Zamak can subsequently flow into. As the holes of the filter are too small for many of the impurities to pass through, the filter prevents most non-Zamak particles on the blades from flowing into the mold along with the liquid Zamak. Multiple ingots were casted using this setup. The amount of Zamak extracted from the blades was analyzed by weighing the Zamak before and after melting. The purity of the processed material and its mechanical properties were also evaluated. Through XRF tests, it was found that the ingots had a purity of 99.6% on average in respect to 100% pure Zamak. Using the final iteration of the melting setup, the ingots were found to have an ultimate tensile strength of 223 MPa and a yield strength of 124 MPa on average. It was also possible to recover about 93% of the Zamak from the blades. To exemplify the possibility of directly creating new products with the “all-in-one” process, a rotation knob for a laparoscopic instrument named “SATA grasper” was additionally casted. The flat surfaces on the rotation knobs were grainy, while the curved surfaces were smooth. The edges of the rotation knob were sharp with a 90oC angle. After cooling down, pattern shrink was found in different sections of the rotation knobs. The shrink was not uniform and varied between 0% - 1.2% between the different sections. To achieve the previously mentioned mechanical qualities and recovery rate of Zamak, a melting temperature of 420oC was applied and the ingot mold was designed with a riser and rounded edges. It is recommended to implement these factors in the final iteration of the melting setup when reprocessing Zamak with an all-in one process. The Zamak laryngoscope blades were found to be suitable for reprocessing with the “all-in-one” process if the recommendations are followed. More widespread implementation of “all-in-one” reprocessing can contribute to higher sustainability in the medical field.","Reprocessing; Zamak; Medical Instruments; Waste; all-in-one process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Active noise control systems that attenuate noise through open windows have the potential to create quieter homes while maintaining ventilation and sight. Such systems are commonly realized with closed-loop LMS algorithms. However, these algorithms require a large number of error microphones inside the room and provide only local attenuation. Using many error microphones leads to slow convergence and high computational effort, having additional disadvantages. Therefore, closed-loop active noise control algorithms are undesired for real-world application. In this study, we develop an open-loop wave-domain algorithm that converges instantaneously and operates with low computational effort. As it is open-loop, it does not require error microphones. We position a control region in the far-field that covers all directions from the aperture into the room. In the algorithm, we minimize the sound in that control region. Hence, it inherently ensures cancellation in the whole room. We derive acoustic transfer functions to obtain frequency responses of the aperture and loudspeakers. Those are used for soundfield calculation. The sum of the soundfields, from the aperture and the loudspeaker array, is then expressed in orthonormal basis functions. By minimizing this sum in least mean square sense, we can calculate the filter-weights that minimize the sound energy in the control region. Implementation of these filter-weights with block-wise processing using the Short-Time Fourier Transform generates the signals for the loudspeaker array. However, this processing induces a delay. To compensate for this algorithmic delay, two methods are compared. The first is positioning a reference microphone further in front of the aperture. The second method uses an autoregressive model for signal prediction. Both lead to a loss in attenuation performance compared to the optimal algorithm. We compare the optimal wave-domain algorithm with a LMS-based reference algorithm, as well as both the algorithmic delay compensation methods. The algorithms are tested with a sparse and grid loudspeaker array, and we use rumbler-siren, airplane, and white noise signals as incoming noise. Furthermore, we compare performance for three incident angles. Our simulation results indicate that wave-domain processing has the potential to outperform LMS-based methods in practical active noise control for apertures. More specifically, we obtain an average -10dB global reduction up to 2~kHz for all signal types with the optimal wave-domain approach. In comparison, the performance of the closed-loop algorithm ranges between -5.2 and -9.2dB, depending on the signal type. Furthermore, we indicate the limited impact of the incident angle on performance for the wave-domain algorithm. Positioning a reference microphone in front of the aperture outperforms the predictor approach in all scenarios, and its performance compares to that of the closed-loop LMS algorithms. Eventually, the absence of error microphones and inherent global control ensure that the wave-domain algorithm can be used for a practical active noise control system for apertures. Future work could improve the algorithm by reducing loss of performance with small window-sizes due to time-delay wrapping in the block-wise processing. Furthermore, a natural continuation of this study is to develop and test the wave-domain algorithm for scenarios with a moving primary noise source to further emphasize its advantage over the closed-loop LMS algorithm.","Active Noise Control; Open window; wave-domain algorithm; open-loop; aperture; noise cancellation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The best choice is the CFD-CRN method which is a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical reactor network (CRN) for decoupled simulation of fluid flow and detailed chemical kinetics. This thesis describes an improved solver implementation for resolving a constructed CRN using only global resolution methods and debunks the notion of needing any form of sequential resolution. This research focuses on further improving the Python based computational tool AGNES, developed at the Delft University of Technology. AGNES can automatically cluster CFD cells into reactors, solve the network and visualise the results [?][?]. This project aims at boosting the performance by reducing computation time and selecting a PETSc [1] based global resolution approach using time integration and Newton’s method. Sandia flame D, a piloted methane-air jet flame (Re=22400) [2], is chosen as the test case. The CRN results for species concentration, mainly NO and CO, are validated with the experimental data and CFD simulation results to ensure no compromise on the accuracy. The solution time and convergence ratewere compared for pre-research AGNES (AGNES v1.1) and the current version (AGNES v1.2). Results show that opting for an entirely global resolution approach is computationally feasible at higher reactor count (more than 500 reactors) and proves superior to the pre-research version. The achieved speedup is around 13% and with smart Jacobian evaluation, this is risen up to 21%. The potential reason for the improved performance is identified as the capability of the global time integration method (in place of local sequential resolution approach) to provide sufficient convergence with an increasing number of reactors and increased complexity. Moreover, the solver can be further augmented by selecting an efficient way for Jacobian calculations either by using automatic differentiation or simplifying the current Python loop approach.","AGNES; PETSc; CFD-CRN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Climate change will exacerbate the water problems, while oxidation of the peat will also contribute to climate change. This raises the question of whether it is wise to build in this polder.

It will be investigated what form suits the polder, but also the people who like to live in a village.

Seventeen percent of NP patients scored their life as “worse than death”. A myriad of causes may underlie NP, such as stroke or spinal cord injury. Also, damage or disease of the <i>peripheral nervous system</i> (PNS) may result in NP. One of the main issues of NP caused by a <i>peripheral nerve injury </i>(PNI) is the development of a neuroma, which is a tumor-like mass at the proximal end of a severed nerve that can become very painful. Neuromas show unique neurophysiological characteristics. Cell membrane alternations lead to different ion channel distributions, which in turn result in <i>subthreshold oscillations</i> (SO) and <i>ectopic discharges</i> (ED). It is assumed that this behavior could lead to NP generation. <br/><br/><i>Electrical neurostimulation</i> (ENS) is used to treat patients, thereby applying pre-programmed stimulation patterns to the affected nerves. However, the pain-provoking signals which run through the nerves are not detected and analyzed before ENS is provided. Furthermore, it is questionable whether (the currently applied) pre-programmed ENS defuses these signals anyway. In addition, pre-programmed ENS is not effective at all moments of the pain experience caused by fluctuations in signal intensity. As the clinical results are discouraging, and in view of the high costs, the popularity of this technology is currently waning. Optimization of this potentially powerful technique is needed to improve the outcome and make this technology useful to implement in the treatment strategy of patients with intractable otherwise difficult to treat pain syndromes.

As a result, we designed a standardized conceptual framework (DPS framework) for the Dynamic Selection of various TCP congestion control algorithms (as the pre-existing transport protocols). To enable this framework to function autonomously, we developed an online learning strategy implemented in the framework design. Also, to ensure efficient deployability of the framework in a real-network, we further proposed a fairness framework to manage multiple DPS framework-enabled application flows to co-exist sustainably.<br/><br/>Through our experiments, we demonstrated the trade-off between application flow performance and learning time for the proposed online learning strategy and the ways it can be tuned to benefit certain types of application flows.

Within the NOVAIR project, Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) tests these new concepts on a Scaled flight demonstrator (SFD). Using an SFD allows for testing of dynamic and flight physical behavior of new aircraft concepts, which is difficult with more theoretical methods. Furthermore, by using an SFD, the risks associated with full-scale testing in terms of cost and time are minimized. One of the new concepts developed for the SFD is Distributed electric propulsion (DEP). Here, the two jet engines are replaced by six electric propellers. As these can be used actively for control, this results in an over-actuated system. These propellers interact with the aerodynamics of the wing resulting in Propulsion airframe interaction (PAI) effects. Although using the PAI effects for control has the potential to improve capabilities, efficiency and robustness of the aircraft, research into controllers using these effects actively is limited.<br/><br/>This thesis, therefore, presents a new control method including control allocation for the DEP-SFD aircraft, based on the nonlinear Incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) controller. INDI enables controlling the nonlinear dynamics of the DEP aircraft over the complete flight envelope with one controller. By feeding back real-time sensor measurements, robustness to modeling errors and external disturbances is increased. Using the Incremental nonlinear control allocation (INCA) method, the full control authority of the DEP can be used. This technique enables taking into account nonlinear allocation relations and control effector interactions, while solving the control allocation real-time, which is key in actively using the PAI effects for control. The INCA method is used for two performance improvements: tracking performance and propeller power efficiency. To compensate for actuator dynamics, this thesis implements an Model predictive control (MPC) controller which results in improved tracking and higher efficiency. The performance of the controller was analyzed in simulation, where a reference square signal input on the roll angle was applied, while minimizing the sideslip angle and maintaining a steady altitude and velocity. The INCA controller with MPC is compared to a conventional INDI controller, showing a significant decrease in rise time from 2.46 s to 0.703 s with minimal tracking error. Furthermore, the effective bandwidth of the system was increased from 0.186 Hz to 0.663 Hz and the power consumption reduced by 6.3%. Modeling uncertainties, external disturbances and a propeller fault were introduced to verify the robustness of the controller. Finally, the reference altitude and velocity were varied, demonstrating controller performance over a large part of the flight envelope.<br","Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; Incremental Nonlinear Control Allocation; Distributed electric propulsion; flight control; Scaled flight testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The proposed location of this discharge sluice is close to an already existing marina, the Royal Yachtclub Oostende (RYCO), and hindrance is expected regarding the outflow of the sluice in marina direction. When designing the sluice, an optimal balance has to be found between acceptable flow velocities in the downstream area and the capacity of the discharge sluice. It is therefore very important to be able to determine resulting flow patterns.<br/><br/>Formulas and rules of thumb found in literature are not sufficient to determine the resulting flow pattern of this system due to the complex geometry, including a pile row for flow velocity reduction. Other studies have shown that numerical models could simulate flow patterns of discharge sluices with much detail. However, a lot of detail in the results also requires much computational time. An example of a detailed numerical software program that is able to simulate the complete three-dimensional flow field is COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 (COMSOL). Although it provides the most detail, simulating the flow in the entire area of interest (including the RYCO) for a complete tidal cycle in COMSOL would take too much computational time.<br/><br/>The objective of the present study is therefore to investigate the possibilities of determining the flow pattern downstream of a discharge sluice using a numerical method that requires less computational time but has sufficient accuracy to determine the potential impact of a discharge sluice on nautical activities.<br/><br/>In the present study, two options are considered to determine the flow field downstream of a discharge sluice. Method COMSOL-D3D is a coupled numerical method of a COMSOL and a coarser Delft3D-FLOW 4 (D3D) model. The other option, method D3D, uses only a D3D model and the sluice outflow is schematized by means of the general discharge relation.<br/><br/>As validation of the results is not possible due to a lack of measurement data, the methods are applied to a simplified case. The flow pattern resulting from each method is compared to the results obtained with a so-called baseline method. This method consists of modelling the entire domain with only a detailed numerical model, COMSOL. This is possible since, for validation purpose, the domain of the simplified case is relatively small and only stationary conditions are considered.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there is a lot of potential in the use of both methods in predicting the flow pattern downstream of a discharge sluice. They produce for the simplified case flow patterns similar to those obtained with the detailed method. Moreover, both methods require relatively little computational time compared to a full 3D simulation, method D3D requires the least amount. However, there are a number of conditions for the application of both methods.<br/><br/>The methods cannot be applied in the direct vicinity of the discharge sluice where the flow is highly three-dimensional. If one is interested in the flow in the first meters after the outflow opening or around the pile row, for example for designing the bottom protection, the two considered options are not sufficiently accurate. The flow in this area is too complex to simulate in a D3D model. In this case it is recommended to model the situation completely in COMSOL or a model similar to COMSOL. Furthermore, method D3D can only be applied if the sluice system is simple enough to correctly determine the discharge coefficient analytically/empirically and to simulate the effect of the pile row with a simplification in D3D. It is possible to accurately determine the effect of the pile row on the flow in this study with a schematized porous plate in D3D. Further research must show whether this applies to all types of pile rows.<br/><br/>For method COMSOL-D3D it is important that a correct coupling is made between both models. Here it is important to gradually impose the flow rates in the D3D model. Furthermore, the coupling should be made before the predicted point at which the jets starts deflecting towards the side but downstream of the area at which three-dimensional flows caused by the pile row are present.<br/><br/>It is important to note that due to a lack of validation data there is an uncertainty in the results following from the model approaches.

It becomes clear that flow rates exceed predetermined limits for safe operation in the marina. This applies to the entire marina and a large part of the time that the discharge sluice is discharging in marina direction. Measures will therefore have to be taken to prevent this. It is recommended to use method COMSOL-D3D to investigate the optimization between flow velocities in the marina and the discharge capacity. This is due to the fact that the design of the discharge sluice is expected to become much more complex and as a result the discharge coefficient is no longer easy to determine using formulas from literature.","COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6; Discharge sluice; Discharge coefficient; Loss coefficient; Delft3D-FLOW 4; CFD modelling; Flow; Turbulence; Coanda effect; Marina; Nautical activity; Density differences; Tide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sanderse, Benjamin (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Model order reduction (MOR) has been a field of active research in the past twenty years, more recently also in fluid dynamics. The main advantage of MOR is computational cost reduction, which, along with equally important accuracy, constitute main objective in the MOR community.<br/>A main ongoing issue is that data volumes in fluid flow simulations (such as turbulent flows) are usually very large, hence processing is costly. An example of a high-cost operation in MOR is the construction of reduced basis (RB) via singular value decomposition (SVD) of snapshot data of turbulent flows. The present research, in its first objective, aims at tackling this problem by applying and adapting an incremental SVD algorithm (iSVD). The procedure does not require simultaneous access to the entire snapshot matrix, but<br/>the price to pay is that accurate approximations of RB via iSVD are obtained only for low-index. ROMs require exactly those, therefore application of iSVD is plausible. The algorithm is tested on high-fidelity data representing transitional and turbulent flow solutions, obtained with an energy-conserving code (INS3D). Important iSVD paramters are identified and their influence on key properties of RB: orthogonality, zero-divergence and fidelity w.r.t. conventional SVD basis is examined.<br/><br/>The second objective concerns closure modeling. MOR by definition neglects a part of information.<br/>Hence inaccuracies and/or instabilities often develop in the reduced order model (ROM) solution. The applied ROM framework is energy-conserving (EC-ROM), thereby ensuring non-linear stability. Accuracy is not guaranteed, therefore a correction is desirable. In ROM context several strategies exist. In the present research one such strategy, dissipation via a closure term, is examined in an `a priori' test. Based on the full order model (FOM) data and projection of it onto the reduced space, exact expression for missing information (exact closure term) is derived. Subsequently, an eddy viscosity (EV) ansatz is applied, whereby also high-fidelity data is used to compute EV. The turbulence model is of mixing-length type. <br/>The related turbulent diffusive term with variable EV is regressed on the exact closure term.<br/><br/>It is concluded that iSVD is a feasible algorithm in MOR applications, particularly in combination with EC-ROM, provided that parameters of iSVD: increment size, maximum dimension of RB and threshold are far from their lower bounds. EV mixing length model is considered inadequate as a means of improving accuracy of EC-ROM in periodic shear-layer.","Reduced Order Model; Incremental SVD; CFD; Turbulence; POD; Eddy Viscosity; Regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The first phase of this transition (2018-2023) consists of experimentation. Here, circular building experiments should trigger radically new ways of thinking and radically new ways of doing. Learning-by-doing is the device, but clear conceptual knowledge on how to achieve deep learning is lacking. Therefore, this explorative research aims to assess how circular building experiments could be designed in order to stimulate deep learning. Stakeholders involved in the design and construction process of four circular building experiments in the Netherlands have been research. Based on transition and organizational learning literature, for each case the subjects (who learns), the process (learns how), the objects (learns what) and the effect (outcome) have been assessed. The case-studies show that deep learning is achieved in every experiment and that it has changed organizations routines, providing evidence that experiments are an effective means to trigger radical change. However, the potential of transition learning is higher, given the fact that the learning activities in the experiments and structures in the organizations involved were missing or inadequately approached. Therefore, this research recommends to more carefully design experiments to support transition learning. In doing so, this research proposes a typology for transition learning based on seven flavours, which allow researchers to understand, set-up and evaluate transition learning in experiments. Here, combinations of flavours can yield different outcomes. Furthermore, for practitioners a roadmap with checklist questions has been developed to support setting-up future circular building experiments.","Circular economy (CE); Built Environment; circular economy transition; Transition learning typology; Transition experiments; Organizational learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

For instance, we have proximity­based tokens (e.g., keys and smartcards) for access systems installed at various places such as in cars, at contactless payment terminals, and in electronic passports. Moreover, such systems exist in critical environments like nuclear power plants.Unfortunately, the current systems used to detect proximity between devices and/or users are rife with vulnerabilities. Numerous attacks, such as Relay attack, Preamble Injection attack, Early Detect/Late Commit, and Cicada, exist that let an attacker maliciously alter the measured distance. The research community has proposed several solutions to address these problems and based on their inputs, the IEEE 802.15.4a standard was recently amended. Nevertheless, we show that the newer amendment(i.e., IEEE 802.15.4z) is however not entirely secure and still vulnerable to being exploited.In this work, we evaluate and address the vulnerabilities present in the recently introduced standard,IEEE 802.15.4z amendment for Ultra­Wide Band (UWB). This standard forms the basis of proximity detection in a majority of new devices such as keyfobs for cars, access control systems, smartphones like Samsung S21 and Google Pixel 6, and even medical equipment to monitor patients. First, we mount two attacks, namely the Cicada­TF and the Adaptive Injection, against UWB ­based proximity detection systems. Second, we propose a novel approach to detect the presence of these attacks. We create a real ­world testbed using DWM3000 ICs mounted on NRF52840­devkits to launch the attacks and implement our proposed detection approach. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in three different environments: an indoor residence, a large outdoor passageway, and an office space. These environments were selected to represent the most commonly used places and were based on the802.15.4a channel models document by IEEE. Our experiment results show that the proposed model can detect the presence of attacks with high accuracy (94%) in all three environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work that presents a way to detect the presence of such attacks and also to be verified on hardware.","Ultrawide Band; Proximity Detection; IEEE 802.15.4z; security attacks; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is growing rapidly in order to determine the position (both horizontal and vertical). However, the GNSS is only able to give the geometric height which is the position on the ellipsoid, which have a drawback that the surface of constant ellipsoidal height are not equipotential surface, and hence these heights need to be transformed into traditional height systems such as the Normaal Amsterdam Peil (NAP) used in The Netherlands. In order to derive these NAP heights from the GNSS heights, a (quasi-) geoid model along with corrector surface model is used to convert from one height to another. In this study the newly computed local quasi geoid model NLGEO2018 rather than the NLGEO2008 is adapted using RDNAPTRANS2018 along with Fugro Rail Infrastructure aLignment Acquisition (RILA) technique which makes use of GNSS/IMU to obtain ellipsoidal height. It was found upon using the older transformation procedure RDNAPTRANS2008, which makes use of NLGEO2008, a mismatch in the order of 17mm between the NAP and GNSS-derived NAP from RILA. This error is not only due to the geoid itself but also the systematic errors in the different height system. However, this new geoid NLGEO2018 along with the new transformation procedure of RDNAPTRANS2018 allows a more accurate conversion of ellipsoidal to normal heights and this study focuses on this quality assessment of the new GNSS/IMU derived NAP heights and investigate how well NAP heights be obtained using RILA technique based on the new geoid. It was found with the use of the new geoid and the new transformation model RDNAPTRANS2018, the mean height difference was reduced from 12mm to 3.6mm showing a better fit of GNSS heights to NAP heights. An error budget was also calculated, to understand the reliability of these RILA measurements with the NAP heights. This error budget includes all the uncertainties from all error sources, namely RILA derived height, geoid height and the levelled height, followed by hypothesis testing. The highest uncertainty was from GNSS/IMU measurements from RILA system followed by the levelling and then the gravimetric quasi-geoid. Finally from this analysis, areas where the terrestrial surveying can be avoided was found. It was found that near the stations, tunnels, high vegetation had the highest uncertainty due to poor GNSS reception. It was also found that level crossing also showed a constant systematic offset between the two heights potentially due to the materials of the level crossings.","remote sensing; GNSS; IMU; NAP; geodesy; RILA; RDNAPTRANS2018","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-01","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The offshore wind farm is one of the solutions that are able to harvest energy sustainably from the environment. To erect these offshore windfarms, the debate about whether a new fleet should be designed and built or make the existed offshore fleet go under retrofitting has been raised. The stakeholder group involved in this issue is formed by the ship designers, ship operators, and market analysts. The difference between the existed offshore support vessel fleet and the offshore wind farm support fleet is the former is built to perform a certain operation and will require another considerable investment to be retrofitted while the latter is looking for solutions to switch from different equipment thus to keep the flexibility between different operation.<br/>The main objective of this research is to propose a ship design methodology to enable the offshore wind farm's request in mission flexibility by improving the design process in the preliminary design phase. Modularity and Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) are chosen to be the two main topics to support the research objective. To narrow down the research scope, the research object is limited to a small Offshore support Vessel fleet that is able to perform service throughout the lifecycle of an offshore windfarm.<br/>The application of the modularity concept is to break down the vessel system into smaller subsystem or function blocks then reassemble them to be self-sufficient modules. Modules are the basic elements for forming a modular platform to provide a basic model that is able to perform various operations by mounting different equipment. In the former research done in NTNU, a methodology for manipulating the modularity to assemble a product platform by processing previous configuration scripts has been developed. It has greatly reduced the repetitive and iterative works in the design of similar vessels, especially the design for OSVs. Though the configuration scenarios are flexible to change, the pre-designed modules' properties are limited by the based configuration. On the other hand, the configurations are closely tight to the hull shape thus limited the freedom from both the hull design and configuration design. In this research, an improved configuration generator is developed to separate the configuration design and the hull design. The proposed methodology will also keep the flexibility in importing new configurations and the latest hull shapes without conflicts.<br/>Knowledge based engineering is another topic included in this research. It has been proved and widely used in the aerospace industry. As for the ship design industry, the application is limited to local structure design. KBE is a bridge to bring the user and the designer together in the design project. It consists of a programming stage, Knowledge Based System (KBS), to process the selection of suitable design cases and a visualization stage, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) ,to give a direct review on the whole design project. The fundamental drivers for each KBE system are called ""High Level Primitive"" (HLP). They are the basic units for the knowledge stored in the database. KBS picks out suitable HLPs from the database and assigned them in a configuration script thus forming a design result stored in the digital world. CAD will take over the result and visualize it in the drawing window. This is the proposed methodology to fill the gap between the modularity re-configuration and the diversity of modules.<br/>A Multi-Model-Generator (MMG) will become the final output of this research. It is designed to be able to reproduce several vessels in the OSV market. A further demonstration of the ability to generate a modular OSV product family at the end of the research. Though the modeling output has been proved to meet the index set for the research object, the MMG has the potential to be improved in the future by importing a well-constructed database from the industry.<br","Knowledge based engineering; Multi-Model Generator; Modularity; Offshore support vessel; Product family; Modular platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the ever-increasing threat of malware attacks, building an effective malware classifier to detect malware promptly is of utmost importance. Malware is constantly growing and evolving with the use of sophisticated obfuscation techniques. Thus, classifying malware accurately becomes a tough challenge. Malware visualization approaches and deep learning techniques have proven effective in classifying sophisticated malware from benchmark datasets. A big problem with these classifiers is that they need to be re-trained when a new malware family is to be classified. Thus, novel malware family classification becomes computationally expensive and requires a large amount of data. In this thesis, we propose few-shot classification techniques where a malware sample from an unknown malware family can be classified using just a few instances of that class. Firstly, we first compiled the MalBaz dataset that we built by collecting recent malware samples from a public malware repository in 2021 to validate our classifier on recent malware samples in addition to the benchmark datasets. Secondly, we encourage the use of malware feature visualization over direct malware visualization techniques. We propose a novel malware feature visualization technique that generates a 3-channel image. The 3-channel image is a result of fusing three malware feature extraction techniques into one image. Our experiments show that the 3-channel image performs better when used with a shallow CNN (Convolution Neural Network) architecture than the state-of-the-art deep CNNs such as Resnet50. The 3-channel image outperforms the Resnet50 model in terms of classification accuracy and total training time. Finally, we propose using few-shot classification techniques combined with the proposed 3-channel image to classify unknown malware effectively. Our two proposed few-shot classification methods, namely CSNN (Convolutional Siamese Neural Network) and baseline-FE (baseline Feature Extractor), can be used in two distinct scenarios. We use the CSNN approach for one-shot classification and when scarce training data is available. We experimentally show CSNN achieves high classification accuracy even when trained on approximately 10\% of the total data. We use the baseline-FE approach for 10-shot classification, and it outperforms the CSNN approach but requires sufficient training data. CSNN achieves a novel-class classification accuracy of 96.21%, 94.99% and 93.42% on the Malimg, Microsoft BIG 2015 and MalBaz dataset, respectively. Experimentally, baseline-FE achieves a novel-class classification accuracy of 98.26%, 88.68% and 97.65% on the three datasets mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose novel-class classification using benchmark datasets using simple few-shot learning architectures. We show our models' ability to successfully recognize recent malware samples from sophisticated and unknown malware families.","Malware Classification; few shot learning; Feature Extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Cvetkovic, M. (graduation committee); Bauer, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Traditional trains, with steel rails and wheels, have been around for centuries. The very good energy efficiency of steel-wheeled trains is one of the reasons that they are one of the more promising transportation modes in the future, where energy conservation becomes more and more important. Furthermore, electric trains are able to efficiently use sustainable power. They usually power their on-board motors by a sliding contact, with an overhead catenary wire or a 'third' power rail. However, trains using a linear motor have also emerged. These have several advantages: the amount of moving parts is reduced and the amount of traction force available is independent of the slipperiness of the tracks. Some systems still use a 'third rail' for power transfer however, which is a sensitive moving part and limits the train speed. Furthermore, arcs can cause damage under reduced air pressure. This may be eliminated using a linear doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM), which may be able to simultaneously propel and provide power to the train. The latter can be used to charge an on-board battery, which can provide the energy to keep the velocity constant between the stations, where active tracks may be omitted to save costs.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the use of a DFIM for a train application has been reviewed. A linear DFIM has been designed in a previous work \cite{Becetti2021}, whose parameters are used in this thesis to simulate the concept. A controller is to be designed which allows the prescribed use of simultaneous propelling and charging. This thesis explores the requirements and possible controller candidates for the train application, which is followed by simulation and laboratory testing. <br/><br/>The application for a vehicle drive provides unique objectives and restrictions. One of the most restricting elements is that preferably no trackside (stator) quantities should be required for the control of the DFIM. After all, requiring trackside quantities would require a critical very dependable communication link between the track and vehicle. For this reason, estimation methods have been selected to control the vehicle with only vehicle-side measurements. <br/><br/>Three main categories of controllers have been identified: field-oriented control, direct torque control, and model predictive control. It has been found that each controller family has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best controller depends on the final system design of the train system. Field oriented controllers have the lowest current ripple, and can therefore be very predictable and efficient. Direct torque control is best used if it becomes very important to keep the final algorithm very simple. A model predictive controller excels if additional constraints are required, such as when using a multilevel inverter that requires balancing. This thesis provides a selection that can be used to make a decision in a later stage. <br/><br/>The operational principle of the train with the DFIM has been verified with a simplified laboratory test. A rotary DFIM has been powered with a fixed grid frequency-powered stator and an inverter-controlled rotor. Using a simplified control algorithm, the experiments have verified that the DFIM can be used to charge the vehicle at a high efficiency of up to 85\%, and that the DFIM can indeed be used to simultaneously charge the vehicle and provide a tractive force. Additionally, a Simulink-simulation is performed where the performance of the linear DFIM design is validated. It has been concluded that the DFIM is an attractive candidate for use with a linear motor-driven train since it can indeed fulfil the roles of both motor and charger simultaneously and efficiently.","machine drive; DFIM; doubly-fed induction machine; Electric machine; Electric Vehicle; railway; Wireless Charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","51.99710270392556, 4.37484160171474"

In this thesis, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and domain knowledge, with the aim of improving the generalization capabilities of RL-agents. <br/>In classical DRL setups, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are often applied as neural network architectures for an agent’s policy and/or value network. In this thesis, however, GNNs are used to represent the policy and value network of an agent, which allows for the application of relational inductive biases that are more domain-specific than those of MLPs and CNNs. Observations received by the agent from a simple navigation task - which requires some relational reasoning - are encoded as graphs, consisting of entities and relations between them, which are based on domain knowledge. These graphs are then used as structured input for the GNN-based architecture of the agent. This approach is inspired by human relational reasoning, which is argued to be an important factor in human generalization capabilities. <br/>Several GNN-based architectures are proposed and compared, from which two main architectures are distilled: R-GCN-domain and R-GCN-GAN. In the R-GCN-domain architecture, the graph encoding of observations is based on domain knowledge, whereas in R-GCN-GAN we aim to combine the relational encoding of a CNN with additional, learned relations, allowing for an end-to-end solution that does not require domain knowledge. Sample efficiency and both in- and out-of-distribution generalization performance of our architectures are tested on a new grid world environment called ’Key-Corridors’. We find that adding domain-specific relational inductive biases with the R-GCNdomain architecture significantly improves sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization, when compared to MLPs and CNNs. However, we did not succeed in learning these domain-specific relational inductive biases with R-GCN-GAN, which does not manage to significantly outperform a CNN. Overall, the results indicate that applying relational reasoning in RL - through the use of GNNs and domain knowledge - can be an important tool for improving sample efficiency and generalization performance. <br","Reinforcement Learning (RL); Graph Neural Networks; Domain Knowledge; Generalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Rubble mound structures are often constructed to prevent severe wave damage to ships. By constructing the crest at a certain level, the waves are reduced such that safety is ensured. However, a large increase in sea level rise is expected in the next century due to climate change. Because of this, multiple adaptations might be necessary to meet the required lifetime of a rubble mound structure. In current guidelines, the influence of these adaptations is already included. However, for a combination of solutions the empirical equations are not always accurate enough (van Gent, 2019). Accurate guidelines are necessary to correctly predict the overtopping rates for a combination of solutions. In this research, the accuracy of current guidelines is investigated.<br/><br/>The research performed in this thesis is divided into two parts. First, multiple solutions are derived to adapt a breakwater and ensure safety for a rising sea level based on existing empirical equations. Safety is ensured if the mean overtopping rate remains less than 50 l/s/m. Beyond this point, the ships behind the structure might become prone to large wave attacks. Secondly, the accuracy of current guidelines (i.e. the empirical overtopping equations) is tested in an OpenFOAM model. OpenFOAM is a so-called open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software that can solve complex fluid flows.<br/><br/>Several solutions are possible to ensure safety against severe wave overtopping. The four solutions applied in this thesis are the addition of a berm, the addition of a crest wall, an increased foreshore and the implementation of a low-crested structure. By combining these solutions, the overtopping rate remains below the maximum of 50 l/s/m. The combination of solutions forms a path, all paths together form a pathway. The adaptation pathways are a guideline for the moment in time at which a certain solution should be implemented. Therefore, a structure is not unnecessarily expensive and can be managed easily. The paths are rated based on the implementation costs of the combination of solutions.<br/><br/>In total two empirical equations are applied to derive an adaptation pathway. The first pathway is based on the overtopping equation proposed by the TAW (2002). The TAW is a Dutch advisory committee on flood defences. Based on the applied theory, the economically most attractive solution consists of a low-crested structure, a foreshore and a berm. As this equation does not account for the influence of a berm in non-breaking waves, an adapted TAW equation is applied as well. The adapted equation was proposed by Krom (2012) and includes the influence of a berm. Based on the adapted equation, the economically most attractive solution consists of a foreshore, a crest wall and a berm. Once the economically most attractive solution is derived, the accuracy of current guidelines is reviewed in a phase-resolving model. It is found that, there is a large discrepancy between the results calculated with the empirical equations and the results from the model. As no physical data is applied in this research it is hard to interpret and analyze the exact numbers. Therefore, the relative effect of an adaptation is compared. It is found that in contrast to the TAW overtopping equation for non-breaking waves, a berm decreases the overtopping rate by at least 30% for the case study applied. Furthermore, the current method to account for a crest wall proposed by the TAW overestimates the reduction (73% compared to 40% in OpenFOAM). Finally, it is concluded that the addition of a low-crested structure decreases the overtopping rate by a larger value than based on the applied guidelines (74% in OpenFOAM compared to 35% in theory).<br/><br/>Based on the performed research a realistic combination of the adaptation measures consists of a combination of a berm, a crest wall and a shallow foreshore. Therefore, it is advised to focus further research on the combination of these measures. It is necessary to improve the guidelines for combinations of these adaptation measures since the existing ones seem to be either incorrect (TAW, 2002) or require a better validation (Krom, 2012).","Climate adaptation; Rubble mound breakwater; Wave overtopping; OpenFOAM; Adaptation pathways; Sea level rise; Berm; Foreshore; Crest wall; Low-crested structure; CFD; Combination of solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Dutch climate agreement, the Klimaatakkoord, the Dutch government has set an ambition to produce 70 PJ worth of green gas in the country by 2030. This ambition has been set to reduce the carbon emissions from the use of natural gas, as green gas is a low carbon alternative. Green gas is produced by anaerobically digesting biomass - i.e.,manure, agriculturalwaste, sewage sludge - and removing any unwanted compounds during the upgrading stage of the production process. The result is green gas, a gas which is of the same characteristics as natural gas and can be used for the same appliances. It can thus, also be injected into the Dutch gas network where it can be transported to end consumers such as households and the industry. As of January 2020, the production capacity of green gas is 0.18 billion cubic meters per year which converts to 6.33 PJ, only 9% of the production capacity goal set by the government. Change is thus necessary in order for the ambition to be reached. One of the major obstacles holding back the growth of green gas production in the country is the injection capacity of the distributional networks of the gas system. Green gas is mostly produced in small-scale decentralized anaerobic digesters which are connected to the distributional grid. These distributional grids have been designed to distribute gas fromthe high pressure transmission network operated by Gasunie to the end users. They have not been designed to receive gas on a decentralized level. The problem with green gas is that production and injection occurs at a constant rate due to the biochemical nature of the production process. The supply of green gas is constant. On the other hand, demand is not constant. Demand fluctuates on a seasonal and daily basis. During summertime for example, demand is very low due to the higher outside temperature. There is thus less need for gas for spatial heating. The constant supply and fluctuating demand therefore result in imbalances which need to be managed in the distributional grid, or else the producers will not be able to inject the gas. The distributional system operators will thus need to invest in strategies that can increase the injection capacity of green gas or the ambition of the Dutch government will be difficult to reach. The goal of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different capacity-creating strategies for different distributional gas networks and gain insights that can be used by decision-makers. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the different strategies for different networks, a model has been developed with which different gas networks and their network-specific variables can be simulated over a period of 15 years. This part of the model is used to determine when imbalances between supply and demand occur, and what the extent of the imbalances are while also taking demand and supply trends into account. The capacity-creating strategies can be applied to the network in the model which can then be used to analyze how effective the strategies are in decreasing the occurrence and extent of the imbalances. A decrease in imbalance means more green gas can be injected into the network and thus more green gas producers can connect to that network. It also means more natural gas can then be substituted by the low carbon green gas resulting in lower carbon emissions. This part of the model is finally combined with a social cost benefit modelwith which the costs of the investment and the benefits of decreasing the imbalances can be translated to monetary terms. This will aid decision-makers in the decision-making process regarding investing in the distributional gas grid. The general analysis showed that there is a clear distinction between strategies that can create a lot of injection capacity and strategies that are very limited in their ability to create injection capacity. Static and dynamic pressure adjustments, and connecting CNG refueling stations to add additional demand to the network are strategies that are limited in their effectiveness. Pressure adjustments are affected by the pipeline volume and average pressure in that pipeline. Both are relatively low in distributional grids compared to the transmission grid thus adjusting the pressure in the grid to createmore storage capacity is not very effective in creating capacity. Static pressure adjustments however have negligible costs and are therefore deemed a costeffective measure. Performing dynamic pressure adjustments require the placement of a costly system and has been found to be outperformed by static pressure adjustments for all analyzed networks. CNG refueling stations add a small amount of demand and some storage capacity. However, due to the expected decrease in gas demand fromthe transport sector, the effectiveness of connecting to CNG refueling stations decreases severely to the point that connecting to new stations does not make sense froma cost-wise perspective. Using the storage tanks of the stations to strategically store gas during the more problematic nighttime - imbalances occur more often during nighttime than during the day - however is a cost-effective strategy. DSOs should consider reaching out to CNG refueling station operators for this strategy. The other strategies have a much higher capability of creating injection capacity. Their cost-effectiveness is however very location specific. A gas booster needs to be placed close to the transmission network and an industrial user or other distributional network to connect to can be difficult to find in some cases. Their effectiveness is determined by the feed-in limit for the gas booster, and the additional demand for the industrial user and other distributional network. The costs are governed by the distance to the strategy as new pipelines will have to be constructed to reach them. Also, dependent on the urbanization level of the region the pipelines will be built in, the costs can differ. Constructing in amore urbanized region will be more costly. Finally, a storage facility has been found to create a decent amount of injection capacity too - though this is affected by its scale - however, it is a very costly option resulting in a negative net present value and should thus only be considered as a last resort strategy. Finally, the model is used to analyze the Stedin network in Friesland as a case study. It is expected that this network will experience a lot of imbalances in the future because of the large amount of expected green gas producers in that area. The analysis was used to gain insights with which recommendations are developed for Stedin. First of all, static pressure adjustments and strategically using the storage tanks of CNG refueling stations that are already connected to the network should be used to create additional injection capacity. Both strategies are very cost-effective however they do not create enough capacity for all the expected green gas producers to connect. In order to accommodate the connection of all the expected green gas producers, Stedin will have to make use of a gas booster to inject surpluses of green gas into the transmission network. A possible location for a gas booster in Friesland is on the gas grid in Leeuwarden operated by the DSO Liander. Stedin will thus have to connect its network to that of Liander in Friesland. The most cost-effective option for this is to connect the network from Hallum to Leeuwarden through the network of Stiens. The total net present value of the investments mentioned above is estimated to be 22 million euros, thus making it a very beneficial investment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Currently, within the PVMD group at the TU Delft an optical solar cell simulation tool, GenPro4, is being developed to allow for the quick optimization and analysis of solar cell designs. However, the implemented wave optics model has limited accuracy and thus an alternative model is sought.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we researched several rigorous wave optics simulation methods such as: finite element method, finite difference time domain, transfer matrix method, and rigorous coupled wave analysis. Based on three decision criteria (speed, accuracy, and compatibility) the choice of implementing rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) was made. Besides the standard RCWA formulations, a few improvements were made. S-matrices were used to increase<br/>speed and memory efficiency of the program. Furthermore, calculation of the local E-field allowed for the determination of absorption per material in our cell. Lastly, an angular intensity distribution, known as scatter matrix, was produced as output to allow for the full integration with GenPro4.<br/><br/>We validated our new model by comparing results of a nano-textured GICS solar cell with previously conducted finite element method (FEM) simulations. Over a large wavelength range our model showed good agreement with the FEM data. However, slight inaccuracies were observed at longer wavelengths (&gt;1000 nm) as simulation of the metal back reflector became infeasible. Highly absorbing materials, such as metals, potentially required several hundred Fourier modes to be modeled accurately. However, simulations with such a high number of Fourier modes is not feasible as the computer resources (RAM) and computational time<br/>needed grow exponentially. Furthermore, for very small textures, RCWA converges with the GenPro4 flat model as is expected for sufficiently small textures.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, integration of RCWA with GenPro4 was achieved. To demonstrate the ability to quickly and easily simulate real work cell designs, a case study of a perovskite/silicon tandem cell was conducted. In the case study, a combination of 16 interface mythologies was simulated and compared.

(mentor); Pecnik, R. (mentor); Pini, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Organic Rankine Cycle systems are gaining increasing attention as a modular, cost-effective and decentralised thermal energy recovery solution. The design of an efficient expander in the ORC system is crucial to its rapid uptake by the industry. Compared to volumetric expanders, a radial turbine provides advantages in terms of flexibility and better part-load performances. The design of ORC radial turbines is faced with two challenges. Firstly, the expansion in the stator occurs close to the vapour-liquid dome and the critical point, where the ideal gas assumption is no longer valid. Such expansions fall under the Non-ideal thermodynamic regime. Secondly, due to the lower speed of sound in the working fluid, the expansions are supersonic and are accompanied by compressible flow features such as shock waves, expansion fans which generate entropy and reduce the performance of the expander. There exists significant validated design methodologies and empirical relations for conventional turbomachinery. However this is not the case for unconventional turbomachinery where established loss correlations are not applicable. Hence, there is a knowledge gap in validated design tools for unconventional turbomachinery like ORC radial turbines. The thesis forms a part of the validation campaign of the open-source flow solver, SU2 and approaches the exercise by studying expansions in two paradigmatic test cases, namely (i) a linear stator cascade and (ii) a converging - diverging nozzle.<br/><br/>The study of expansions through a linear cascade is a preceding step to the study of a rotating radial turbine. Consequently, a RANS simulation on the single channel blade passage is studied under the validated assumption of flow periodicity. The expansion takes place from inlet total conditions of 18.4 bara and 525 K (Z =0.558) to a static pressure of 1.95 bara (Z = 0.951) and exit flow of Mach 2. Two types of response quantities are studied namely direct and system response quantities. Direct response quantities are those that can be measured directly such as the pressure, Mach, density. System response quantities are derived from direct measurements and provide information to characterise the performance of the stator. The selected system response quantities are: (i) Pressure loss coefficient (C<sub>p</sub>= 0.074), (ii) Kinetic energy loss coefficient (ζ<sub>KE</sub>= 0.115), (iii) Entropy loss coefficient (ζs=0.118), (iv) Base pressure loss coefficient (C<sub>pb</sub>= -0.065), (v) Standard deviation of exit flow angle (σ<sub>β2</sub> = 1.244) and (vi) Standard deviation of exit Mach (σ<sub>M2</sub>= 0.033). Experimentally, it is possible to measure the pressure loss coefficient, base pressure loss coefficient and the flow uniformity at the outlet using a combination of pressure and direct velocity measurements. Through a Design of Experiments approach, the sensitivity of the flow to input uncertainties was studied through a stochastic collocation based forward propagation of the uncertainty. The input uncertainties considered are the inlet total pressure, fluid viscosity and critical point properties. The Sobol indices from the uncertainty quantification indicate the more dominant influence of the critical point properties over other inputs considered. The results also validate the use of a constant viscosity assumption for the RANS simulation. The subsequent planned unit test case was to characterise the expansion through an optimised stator blade row. To this end, a deterministic adjoint based optimisation was performed with the objective function of minimising entropy generation. The resulting geometry was studied and resulted in a pressure loss coefficient improvement of around 4%, although stator flow uniformity at the exit was compromised. The uncertainty quantification performed on the optimised blade geometry yielded robustness improvements on the pressure loss coefficient and reduction in uncertainties associated with direct response quantities, although no strong correlations can be drawn between the improvements in uncertainty and the deterministic optimisation. Given current machining tolerances, the realisation of such a negligible geometry change is not viable from an experimental<br/>perspective.<br/>The second section of the thesis deals with experimental investigation of expansions in a converging-diverging nozzle through a matrix of isobars with increasing degree on non-ideality. Two isentropes with inlet pressure of 2.73 bara (Z = 0.9526) and 6 bara (Z = 0.901) with pressure ratio of 8.76 were performed with recording of pressure, temperature, flowrate and density measurements along the ORCHID. The flow field was visualised using the schlieren method using a z-type layout. The thesis reports the first measurements of total pressure before the nozzle inlet and vapour density and flowrate measurements. The experimental data was post-processed to identify steady-state and quantify the Type A and Type B uncertainties. The schlieren images were used to extract information on the Mach distribution along the nozzle mid-plane using an inhouse line extraction tool. Lastly, a 2.5<sup>o</sup> wedge at the exit of the nozzle is used to generate oblique shock waves that are then manually measured. The flow field at the exit of the nozzle is in the ideal region where the shock angle only depends on upstream Mach number. Hence, the experimentally observed oblique shock angles for the off-design case are close to on-design (Inlet pressure = 18.4 bara) predictions.","NICFD; Linear stator cascade; Compressible flow; Schlieren; Organic Rankine Cycle; Converging- diverging nozzle; ORCHID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","","","","","",""

There are 2 main classifications of MEMS manufacturing technologies, viz. bulk micro-machining, and surface micro-machining.<br/>These techniques have its own set of drawbacks. Bulk micro-machining affects the structural integrity of the wafer because bulk silicon is being etched. Surface micro-machining is limited by the maximum thickness of the method of thin-film deposition (usually a few microns). The current silicon-based MEMS sensors can also fail when it comes to harsh environment sensing. Due to this, the sensors would require many supporting infrastructures such as radiation shield, cooling system and shock-proof packaging.<br/>One way to circumvent this problem is by designing sensors using materials that would not require as much supporting infrastructure. Silicon carbide (SiC) has proved to be a viable candidate to be used in such harsh environments. This is<br/>because it is found to be mechanically robust, chemically inert and with good wear resistance. However, bulk micro-machining with SiC is extremely challenging due to the high difficulty in etching. Many techniques have been tested to etch SiC, but they all have considerable drawbacks or low etch rates. Thus, to make high aspect ratio structures using SiC we will require a new technique where carbon nanotubes (CNT) can be used as a framework in the fabrication process for high aspect ratio surface micro-machining. CNTs can be grown to lengths of several micrometres to millimetres while their diameter is in the order of a few nanometres. Bundles of these tubes were found to have excellent conductance with high current densities, and their behaviour can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chiral vector. These unique properties make CNTs a very interesting material to be integrated into conventional MEMS technology. Although a single nanotube has excellent properties, bundles of nanotubes show a ‘foam-like’ property since they are held together by weak van der Waals’ forces. Thus, to realize mechanical structures with CNTs, we will have to coat the nanotube bundles with a filler material. This has previously been demonstrated to allow tuning of the mechanical properties of the composite. SiC would be an attractive filler candidate for harsh environment sensors. Due to the porous nature of nanotubes, it is possible to infiltrate the forest by deposition of a nanoscale coating. The deposition of the filler material is done by means of low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) since a low pressure and deposition rate will enable the nanotube forest to get completely infiltrated and more uniformly coated. The goal of this research is to fabricate the first sensor using this technique, viz. a comb type capacitive accelerometer and test its performance and resilience to harsh environments by using SiC as coating. This technique will enable the user of a thicker layer for the proof mass and combs, resulting in a higher performance and potentially, resistance to harsh environments.","Carbon nanotubes; Silicon carbide; nanocomposites; micro-machining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-25","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Treatment and prognosis of breast cancer is highly dependent on early and accurate diagnosis. In recent years, many studies have evaluated the use of artificial intelligence for the detection of breast cancer in mammographic images. Another imaging modality, breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI), or molecular breast imaging, has not yet been subject to AI algorithms to detect breast cancer. In this paper, we aim to develop and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can detect malignancies in breast-specific gamma imaging, and evaluate the efficacy of different machine learning classifiers to classify breast tumors based on estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-neu) status. Methods Three CNNs were created and trained and tested on a total of 3,503 BSGI images. The models varied in complexity in terms of convolutional layers and filter sizes. A semi quantitative lesion segmentation was created based on adaptive thresholding and shape and location analysis. Radiomics features were extracted, and univariate feature selection was applied to disregard redundant features. Different machine learning classifiers, which are widely used in literature for binary classification problems, were evaluated. Results In detecting malignancies in a dataset containing clean breasts and breast with malignant lesions, the best performing network reached an area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.93, while an AUROC of 0.88 was achieved when using the same networks in the classification of malignant versus benign lesions. The best performing machine learning classifiers were the linear discriminating analysis (LDA) classifier for ER and PR status, reaching accuracies of 75% in both receptors. In Her2-neu prediction using machine learning, the best accuracy of 69% was achieved by the RF classifier. Discussion &amp; conclusions Based on the results presented in this paper, CNNs can accurately detect malignancies in BSGI images, and discriminate malignancies from benign lesions to a certain extent. The combination of radiomics and machine learning, however, is in its current implementation not accurate enough to predict the ER, PR and Her2-neu status in BSGI images. Future research, however, could focus on using a combination of imaging modalities, such as BSGI, MRI and mammography to improve the predictive accuracy of machine learning.","Artificial intelligence; deep learning; Breast cancer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Problem statement - The global community is facing scarcity of finite materials and environmental pollution. In response to these mounting issues, the government of the Netherlands plans to transition to a circular economy (CE) by 2050. The shift towards a CE affects the built environment. Currently, the global building industry is responsible for 40% of material consumption and one-third of energy consumption. In essence, there are CE developments happening in the Public Real Estate (PRE) and barriers are known in the existing building stocks. However, insufficient research has been conducted on what the barriers could be for the existing PRE in regards to the CE transition. Barriers can hinder further CE development and the CE transition in existing PRE. What these barriers exactly are, has yet to be mapped out for the existing PRE. Therefore, sufficient research is needed to fill this gap. Hence, the following research question is then formulated for this research: “What are the current barriers to the circular economy transition for existing public real estate?”. Sub questions have been formulated in order to answer the main research question: 1. “How is the CE ambition integrated into CGREA’s existing PRE projects?” 2. “How are CE strategies implemented in existing PRE?” 3. “What challenges arise when implementing CE strategies in existing PRE?”. 4. “How are these challenges currently managed in order to realise the CE goal?”. This study explores three cases of the Central Government Real Estate Agencies (CGREA) existing PRE. The results will be used to identify and assess the current barriers for the existing PRE regarding the transition to a CE. Objectives - The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the current barriers to transitioning to a CE for the CGREA’s existing PRE. Moreover, the current CE activities around existing PRE will be analysed, and the facts and barriers for the CGREA will be established. Research method - The methodology of this study is divided into theoretical research, empirical research and synthesis. The research methods of this study consists of a review of previous scientific literature studies on the subject of CE in existing PRE, three case studies and interviews regarding the three cases, and an expert panel to assess, validate and improve the results. Discussion - In essence, this study contributes a more nuanced view on the subject of CE transition in the built environment focused on the existing PRE. The theoretical research indicated that the CE transition in existing PRE was neglected. Yet, empirical research indicated that the CE transition in existing PRE projects is being realised. Moreover, this study has found that, even if the CE ambition is integrated into the later stages of a project, it is still difficult to realise this ambition with the current economy we live in. The analysed cases have indicated the challenges that are an obstruction for further transition to the CE. These challenges are identified and validated as barriers.

(mentor); Herrmann, Y.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In order to create a quantum network for distributed quantum computing and secure communication, quantum nodes are required which can share an entangled state. Colour centres in diamond are a very promising set of nodes that can be used to create entanglement between remote locations. A well-studied colour centre in diamond is the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centre. The NV centre is a promising candidate because the electron spin can be readout optically and the spin state can be manipulated using microwaves. Furthermore, the NV-centre can be coupled to closely located nuclear spins, where the nuclear spins grant access to multiqubit protocols and the creation of a linked qubit register. A problematic downside of the NV centre is its entanglement rate which is currently limited to ∼ 39&#x1d43b;&#x1d467;. The entanglement rate can be increased by coupling the colour centre to an optical cavity. One approach is to use open fibre-based Fabry-Pérot microcavities, with the advantage that it can be fibre coupled, achieve high quality factors and its spectral tunability. An important downside to the spectral tunability, is its sensitivity to vibrations. Therefore the goal of this thesis is to characterise a novel fibre-based microcavity setup, investigate the vibrations influencing the microcavity and actively reduce the vibrations with a feedback loop. When a stable optical microcavity is established, a diamond membrane can be placed in the microcavity to enhance its coherent emission. The novel setup uses a new, low vibration cryostat design together with a passive vibration isolator to suppress vibrations inducing a change in microcavity length. A moveable mirror coated fibre and a flat mirror form the microcavity, where the transmitted light of the microcavity is collected with an objective. We first show control over the microcavity by measuring the linewidth and the length of the microcavity. With this setup we obtain a typical finesse ∼ 6000 (for a bare microcavity), which results in a quality factor of around 80.000 and a mode volume of 27&#x1d706; 3 for a microcavity length of 5&#x1d707;&#x1d45a;. Moreover, we show that the microcavity length dependence on temperature, is roughly 3 1 3 &#x1d707;&#x1d45a; per ℃. And we demonstrate a measurement which allows us to measure the angle of the fibre. The angle of can cause a large decrease in the quality factor and is important for mode coupling. Next, vibrations causing a detuning in microcavity length are characterised. The vibrations can be categorised into multiple frequency ranges which are further analysed. The vibrations for certain frequency ranges can be heavily suppressed by changing the conditions of the passive vibration isolator. By characterising the vibrations, we come to the conclusion that the passive vibration isolation is not optimal, resulting in a high level of vibration. Improving the passive vibration isolation is required in order to proceed to a regime where active feedback can stabilise the microcavity length when the cryostat is on. Finally, we demonstrate active length stabilisation under vacuum at room temperature. The transmitted light of the microcavity is used to actively feedback a voltage to a coarse piezo and a fine piezo. The coarse piezo counteracts microcavity length drifts at lower frequencies and the fine piezo counteracts faster length fluctuations due to vibrations. With this active feedback method, a fundamental mode of the microcavity can automatically be found, and the microcavity length can be locked to that mode. An estimation of the maximum root mean square (RMS) vibration level with the cryocooler off, at room temperature and with active stabilisation is 10&#x1d45d;&#x1d45a;. This is at least a factor 2 lower than the RMS vibration level without active stabilisation. Multiple suggestions are made to lower the vibration level in the novel setup. For example, how to improve the performance of the passive vibration isolator and how to implement a different active length stabilisation scheme like the Pound-Drever-Hall lock.","Colour centres; Cavity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-25","","","","","",""

This study investigates the design of a modular artificial reef developed by the company called Reefy. Reefy breakwaters will consist of interlocking blocks with holes inside and rounded corners. For the configuration of the breakwater no proper design guidelines exist yet which incorporate both the hydrodynamic and ecological functionalities, as both this field of engineering and this reef system are relatively new. Therefore, this study aims to provide insight and develop preliminary design guidance on how to design a hybrid living breakwater from Reefy blocks under wave loading. <br/>To this end, an experimental study was performed in the Eastern Scheldt wave flume of Deltares investigating the impact of different design variables on both the 2D hydrodynamicand ecological performance under wave loading, in shallow water conditions. Both irregularand regular wave conditions are tested. This thesis focuses on submerged structures and therefore the freeboard is defined to be positive for submerged structures. In total, 15 different designs are tested amongst which 7 are 2DV configurations and the other 8 are complex 3D configurations. Single as well as double 3D structures are tested and the space between a double structure is referred to as ”channel”.<br/>For the hydrodynamic performance, the impact of several design variable on the transmission coefficient (Kt) and reflection (Kr) is quantified. In this study, Kt is defined as the transmitted waveheight behind the structure divided by the incoming waveheight at the same location without a structure. These coefficients are based on the incident wave signals. As most of these tests had shallow water conditions, with large Ursell numbers, the usual methods to determine the incoming wave did not work. Therefore, to obtain the incoming wave signal, a new method was used, based on a combination of the existing techniques. Lastly, from the irregular waves the transmitted- and reflected energy density spectra are investigated and compared to the results from the regular waves. The results of this study reveal that for the same number of blocks, a more complex structure can be built without making a compromise in the hydrodynamic performance parameters.  Furthermore, the existing formulae for the Kt and Kr are compared to results of the hydrodynamic performance as measured. The ones with the best correlation are optimized using a non linear regression analysis. <br/>For the ecological performance, the stream-wise peak velocities are investigated in the wake behind the structure and in the channel. The performance is investigated based on a tranquility index Tr. Tr increases if the flow is more tranquil. The outcomes of Tr showed that in general, Tr increases for an increase in the design variables that were inversely proportional related to Kt . <br/>In conclusion, the performed tests and analysis provide insight into relevant physical processes and design parameters for artificial reefs, and therefore assists the designer of artificial reefs.<br/><br/><br","Living Breakwaters; Artificial Reefs; Coastal protection; Environmental Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-17","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

However, the larger design freedom leads to complex and non-convex design spaces. Finding the optimum solution thus becomes costly and challenging, specifically considering the non-linear coupling of thickness with the steering of the filaments or tows. Additionally, an accurate representation of the variable stiffness adds complexity to the modeling strategies, requiring additional refinement relative to constant-stiffness counterpart designs. Surrogate modeling and more exploratory optimization techniques make it possible to circumvent the higher execution time by using a limited set of high-fidelity model evaluations. This enables efficient and accurate exploration of the design space. Bayesian optimization techniques applies the surrogate model to offer strategic and probabilistic exploration of the design space and have demonstrated success in various fields. However, the application of Bayesian optimization schemes in structural optimization is in its nascent stage. The present thesis is a successful attempt that further pushes the application of Bayesian optimization for the lightweight design of variable stiffness cylinders.<br/>A novel finite element SC-BFSC is proposed for modeling and the computational efficiency for linear buckling analysis is investigated. The results showcase an enhanced computational efficiency with retained accuracy.

(mentor); Toepoel, Vincent (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this study a design is proposed and experimentally validated for the gasification of waste plastic pyrolysis oil at small scale for energy applications. The gasifier is designed to be implemented at an existing waste energy recycling (WER) unit at Waste4me B.V. which processes up to 250 kg/h of waste streams in a pyrolysis reactor which converts the waste into pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and a solid residue. The pyrolysis oil investigated in this study was produced from a DKR350 mixed plastics waste stream and was produced at a rate of 50 kg/h with a lower heating value of 36.1 MJ/kg. Because the pyrolysis oil is currently not usable as a fuel or chemical feedstock due to the high oxygen content and the high level of contaminants the oil should be further converted into combustible gas which could eventually replace fossil based fuels or chemical feedstocks. To come up with a suitable design for the gasifier and the implementation of the gasifier, the current WER unit at the company is first reviewed to give context to the design. Then a literature study is done into the different gasification reactions and reactors. With this knowledge the gasifier type ‘entrained flow’ is selected to be implemented at the WER unit for the gasification of the DKR350 pyrolysis oil. Also, a plan for the implementation of the gasifier at the WER unit is made. Then conceptual preliminary design of the gasifier is proposed, which is a low temperature, atmospheric, air blown, non-slagging, recirculating, autothermal entrained flow gasifier. Then an experimental setup is designed to test the potential performance of the preliminary gasifier design. The main aspects that are studied in these experiments are the lower limit of operation of the equivalence ratio (ER), the effects of recirculation, the composition of the product gas at different ER and steam/fuel (S/F) ratios, the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) and cold gas efficiency (CGE) and the performance of the oil injector and evaporator. The oil feed is approximately 4 kg/h and the ER ranges from 0.16 to 0.43, while the S/F ratio ranges from 0 to 1.16. The results of the experiments are compared to the results as computed with the Gibbs equilibrium by the process simulating software COCO. From the experiments it is concluded that the lower limit of operation of the (ER) is lower than 372 oC as the gasifier reaches steady state at this temperature. The effects of recirculation are not investigated as the performance of the recirculation system is not as designed. The composition of the product gas is determined with a gas chromatograph for different ER and S/F ratios. The highest CCE and CGE are found at an ER = 0.16 and S/F = 0 with values of 97% and 64% respectively, although to ensure a robust operation of the gasifier different settings are recommended. Generally the CCE and CGE increase with the ER, while the LHV of the dry product gas decrease with the ER. The CGE and the LHV increase slightly due to steam addition between an ER of 0.24 and 0.3. The addition of steam generally cause an increase in CO and a decrease in CO2 concentration contradicting the results computed with the Gibbs equilibrium. At ER &gt; 0.35 the composition, LHV, CCE and CGE becomes less dependent on the S/F ratio. The oil injector shows no charring nor clogging while the experiments show reasonable CCE’s and CGE’s. Therefore, it is concluded that the used oil injector is a suitable alternative for the commonly used atomizers. With the findings from the experimental validation the preliminary gasifier design and plan for implementation in the WER unit are evaluated and improved. Two implementation plans are proposed, increasing the thermal efficiency of the WER unit from 52% to 58% or to 70%. Concluding from the experimental results a periodical cleaning program is recommended to clean the system from carbonaceous deposition by combusting the deposit in a preheated reactor at T &gt; 790 oC.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-28","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Free-form façades with bent glass have become increasingly popular in recent times. As bent glass is stiffer against out-of-plane loads, it can result in thinner glass and lower embodied carbon. A promising new technique is to cold bend thin glass plates with a stiff structural edge into a hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar), and to subsequently lock the corners to create a self-contained, self-stressed system. In this research, the physical bending process of insulated glazing units (IGUs) with a particular local instability phenomenon is investigated. This instability is hypothesised to be delayed by stiffening the edges of the plate, which is done here by using 30x30 mm GFRP profiles as spacers. These were bonded to the glass using Dow 993 silicone adhesive. Four IGUs of 1.5x1.5 m were produced, three with 4 mm fully toughened glass, and one with 1.1 mm chemically toughened glass. In a series of experiments, the panels were supported on two opposite corners, and pulled down on the others. <br/><br/>A numerical model was developed to predict the outcome of the experiments, as well as the behaviour of the panel under wind load, though the latter was not verified with experiments. In this finite element model, the glass plates were modelled as 2D flat shell elements. The spacers were also modelled with these elements, by using them as the walls of the square hollow profile. The silicone joints were modelled as 3D solids, using the Mooney-Rivlin material model. These parameters were tested by successfully modelling a similar panel that was tested at the University of Cambridge.<br/><br/>In both the model and the experiments, it was found that with the sizes used it was difficult or impossible to get close to a hypar. Due to the small thickness of the glass, one of the diagonals would always be straight or mostly straight throughout the loading process, making the panel not resemble a hypar. The bottom plate of the 4 mm panels broke at a corner displacement of around 150 mm and a total load of 2.6 kN, and the top plate around 200 mm and 0.7 kN. The bottom plate of the 1.1 mm also broke first, at a corner displacement of 120mm and a total load of 1.4 kN. The top plate broke at a much higher corner displacement of almost 400mm, when the loaded diagonal was fully straight. This resulted in the top plate breaking into long, thin rods of over a meter long. It was also found that the top and bottom plates would make contact around 50 mm corner displacement in the 4 mm panels, and around 30 mm corner displacement in the 1.1 mm panel. The numerical model could predict this contact and the overall behaviour of the panel until a corner displacement of 60 mm. From the experiments and the model it was concluded that the glass was too thin for the size of the panels and the applied edge stiffening. Changing the parameters (e.g. thin glass in smaller sizes or higher edge stiffness) could result in a viable product.<br","glass; cold bending; hypar; hyperbolic paraboloid; buckling; twisting; chemically tempered glass; CT; cold twisting; thin glass; IGU; GFRP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

In various cases, it is important to detect informative subsets of nodes such that the nodes within the subsets are ’closer’ to each other. For example, in a cellular network, determining appropriate node subsets can reduce the operation costs. A subset is usually called a cluster. This leads to the graph clustering problem. Furthermore, plenty of systems in the real world are changing over time, and consequently, graphs as models vary with time as well. It is thus also important to update the clusters when the graph changes.<br/><br/>In this thesis work, we studied two problems from the cellular network background. We needed to partition graphs that have certain structures and cluster their nodes to minimize certain cost functions. In the ﬁrst problem, we partitioned a bipartite graph by minimizing the so-called MinMaxCut cost function, while in the second problem, we partitioned a structured graph by minimizing the so-called Modiﬁed-MinMaxCut cost function. The structural property of the graph is incorporated in deﬁning this new cost function. The solutions we proposed are under the framework of spectral clustering, where one relies on the eigenvectors of the graph matrices, e.g., the Laplacian matrix or the adjacency matrix, and any clustering algorithm, e.g., K-means, to partition nodes into disjoint clusters.<br/><br/>Furthermore, for the time-variant graph, we decomposed the problem into two steps. First, we transformed the variations in the graph topology into perturbations to the graph matrices. Then we transformed the update of the clusters into an update of the (generalized) eigenvectors of these graph matrices. We utilized matrix perturbation theory to update the generalized eigenvectors and then update the clusters. Our simulations showed that on synthetic data, the proposed method can eﬃciently track the eigenvectors and the clusters generated by the updated eigenvectors have almost the same cost function value as that of exact computation.","graph partitioning problem; spectral clustering; generalized eigenvalue problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Wireless Communication and Sensing","",""

Side-channel attacks use unintended leakages in the implementation, for example, electromagnetic radiation, to retrieve the secret key. Over time side-channel attacks have become more powerful, and recently the community has shifted towards using deep learning methods. These powerful side-channel attacks operate in the profiled setting, meaning the attacker has complete control over an identical device as the one they are attacking, which they can use to train the model. In this research, the attacker model is changed to the semi-supervised setting, meaning the attacker is limited in the profiling stage.<br/><br/>This thesis proposes a new semi-supervised approach for side-channel attacks, which uses a clustering and a labeling model in a hierarchical fashion. The two common leakage models of side-channel attacks are used to maximize the captured leakage. Furthermore, the newly proposed technique is optimized on several hyperparameters. The approach is compared against two state-of-the-art models in several settings in which five common countermeasures are considered.

(mentor); De Vries, Laurens (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In an energy-only market, private investors play a crucial role in realizing the security of supply. However, several specific characteristics inherent to his market design cause concern about whether this market design is suitable for system adequacy. Moreover, due to policy goals aimed at working towards low-carbon energy systems, these concerns are increased. In this light, many countries have implemented a capacity remuneration mechanism to increase the stability of the security-of-supply in their energy system. While earlier research has been conducted on this topic, we observe two knowledge gaps: 1) from a theoretical perspective, there is debate on the effectiveness of capacity remuneration mechanisms, especially on the role of seasonal storage, 2) from a methodological perspective, we find that there are no models that are equipped to consider myopic investments while having a high enough detailed operational model also to consider investments in (seasonal) storage and the impact of extreme weather scenarios. This research aims to fill these knowledge gaps by presenting a proof-of-concept of a myopic investment detailed operational (MIDO) model. In our thesis, we focus on system adequacy. However, by developing the MIDO model, we hope to enable researchers to analyze any problem related to long-term energy system development with a multi-time scale nature. At the center of the MIDO model are three sub-models: the investment decision model (ID), the future price (FP) model, and the present price model (PP). The first step in this loop is the present-price model, which generates highly accurate information on the operation of a market. After running a year in the PP model, information on the performance of all assets in a market is sent to the ID model. With this data, the ID model performs two tasks: invest based on limited information in an iterative greedy process and dismantle assets losing money. The ID model gets the information on the performance of investment assets under consideration from the FP model. The FP model generates less reliable information than the PP, but it does so very fast. After the investment decisions are made, this information is transferred to the PP model, and the loop starts from the beginning. In this way, a market is simulated with investment cycles, delayed responses, uncertainty, and risk upon investment decisions. This process enables the comparison of different forms of capacity remuneration mechanisms and the effect on the security-of-supply in an isolated energy system. We explore two distinctly different futures within our thesis to see if there is any added value in a capacity market in any of these futures. Moreover, within these futures, we analyze how a capacity market can help withstand an extreme-weather scenario. From this analysis, we find that a capacity market has added value in all scenarios, from the point of system adequacy but also a total consumer cost perspective. However, because we only have explored two futures, we do not argue that a capacity market will always positively impact the system adequacy within an energy system. Instead, we argue against the notion that seasonal storage on its own is always enough to reduce all shortages created in an energy-only market and disagree with the idea that seasonal storage makes capacity markets redundant. We identify two avenues for future research. First, researchers interested in generating more and better results should utilize the MIDO model to explore more future scenarios and compare different forms of capacity mechanisms. Second, research aimed at improving the MIDO model should focus on limiting the computational time generated by the investment loop and seek to expand on the model’s functionalities.","Market design; Investment; System adequacy; Long-term energy system development; Unit Commitment Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Taking the Chinese market as an example, by the end of 2018, the number of pets had surpassed 100 million (Chen, 2019). Approximately 10 million pets die each year, based on an estimated death rate of 8-10%.<br/>When pets reach the final phase of their lives, both the pets and their owners have to deal with a variety of challenges. For instance, the communication between pets and owners decreases due to the illness, causing owners to be overwhelmed with worry and anxiety. When it comes to saying goodbye, it can be an extremely emotional and vulnerable moment. Anger, guilt, disbelief, and depression are all emotions people may experience. When all these complex emotions collide, it is difficult for pet owners to handle practical issues as well as mental or ethical challenges. Furthermore, they usually cannot get the appropriate support from people around them after pet loss. Thus, it is not only the pet itself but also the owner who needs to be taken care of when it comes to death.<br/>The project first took broad research on pet loss through literature review and context research. After creating a journey map of pet loss experience, different design opportunities were identified in different phases. Considering personal preferences and feasibility, the opportunity of communication between dog owners and vets was selected to be further explored. Vets always play an important role in the experience of pet loss. Many dog owners find themselves in the dilemma between the quantity of life and quality of life.

(graduation committee); Koot, Laura (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a serious hereditary muscle disease that almost only occurs in boys and men and causes the muscles to become weaker over time. Given scientific research thus far, they are encouraged to obtain and maintain an active lifestyle. This may help delay the symptoms of the disease and help preserve their upper and lower extremity functionalities for a longer period. <br/><br/>Yumen Bionics, a Medtech startup, has developed a passive (motorless) exoskeleton that supports the males’ arm movements and collects data regarding the exact positions of both arms over time. As the exoskeleton is designed to especially benefit males aged 12-18, they will be considered as the target user group for this project. Since the exoskeleton has embedded sensors, Yumen Bionics yearned to investigate how they can give feedback to users and what type of feedback would motivate them to keep moving. <br/><br/>This project aimed to apply Research through Design and co-creative approaches in order to explore ways in which a motivating data interaction scenario can be designed. These approaches foster iterative prototyping efforts and involve potential end-users in the design process. Throughout the entirety of the project, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), a theory of human motivation, was used as inspiration during design development and as an evaluation tool. <br/><br/>Since little was known about a males’ true motivations and behaviors behind interactions with healthcare services, the first phase of the project included a thorough user research cycle. One of the most prominent findings was that there is a disconnect between a male’s extrinsic and intrinsic motivations towards movements that are necessary for their health and wellbeing. It was hypothesized that Serious Games (digital games that can help facilitate physical activity) and/or Digital Twins (a digital representation of the user’s health status in real-time) may be an appropriate way of visualizing the data. The second phase focused on iteratively prototyping and testing these visualizations. This helped gain knowledge regarding users’ motivations and on design functionality, aesthetics, and practicalities. <br/><br/>Given gathered insights, the last phase in the project aimed to bridge all the learnings and design a mobile application that can be seen as a valuable addition to the exoskeleton. This app, also known as “Exo-Pal”, provides meaningful feedback to the user regarding their everyday movement and is perceived to motivate them to move an optimal amount. Through the use of daily goals (moving thirty minutes per day), reward systems (receiving daily and ‘special’ badges), evolving visualization content and storylines, and Digital Twin technology (that takes the form of a ‘Pal’), it can be predicted that these main features can help maintain a user’s interest in using the product. All in all, Exo-Pal may help encourage males with DMD to reflect on their progress (or lack thereof), allow them to be more proactive about their health and well-being, and increase their feelings of autonomy.","DMD; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; exoskeleton; Research through Design; Co-creation; personal informatics; Digital Twin; gamification; self-determination theory; motivational data interactions","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://bit.ly/Exo-Pal_App Exo-Pal Prototype https://bit.ly/Exo-Pal_Demo Exo-Pal Demonstration","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

On (sub-)hourly timescales, the apparent scaling of precipitation extremes is stronger than expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Here, we focus on a common hypothesis which states that feedbacks from the local dynamics of clouds are responsible.<br/><br/>The effects of climate change on intensification of extreme precipitation in the Netherlands are modeled using the Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation (Lochbihler et al. 2019). The objective is to understand more about extreme precipitation events in a warming climate in the Netherlands. A feedback loop is proposed in which cold-pools increase precipitation intensification with super-CC scaling.<br/><br/>Atmospheric conditions from a composite of days with extreme precipitation are perturbed.The entire atmospheric temperature column is warmed and cooled by 4 degrees Kelvin under constant relative humidity. The convective precipitation is described with a 10 minute timescale. A period of organized convection in the simulations is selected for comparison between the simulations. In this timeframe of extreme precipitation, the yield increases 8.5\% per degree Kelvin.<br/><br/>Convection grows deeper and updrafts in the clouds become stronger with warming.

Moisture transport near the surface increases along organized gustfront lines. On average the increase in transport by updrafts in the sub-cloud layer is dominated by increased moisture rather than due to strong updrafts becoming stronger. The moisture that is concentrated into convective cores coincides with intenser precipitation cores. With warming the subsiding motions accelerate and a stronger drying effect is present around precipitation cores.

These traditionally segregated systems are now being integrated with general-purpose Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The coupling of the physical power system and its communications infrastructure forms a complex, interdependent structure referred to as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). As cyber attacks on critical infrastructures become more frequent, power systems are especially vulnerable, as their OT systems were not designed with cyber security considerations. Hence, identifying and quantifying the risk of cyber attacks on power grids is of utmost importance.<br/>In this dissertation, a method for quantitative risk assessment is proposed. The impact of cyber attacks is examined on a holistic model of a cyber-physical power system and their likelihood is assessed through attack graphs. Firstly, the physical power system is modelled to analyze the impact of cyber attacks on power system operation. The dynamic model of the IEEE 39-bus is used to validate the proposed risk assessment method. Various protection schemes are implemented and coordinated to analyze how cyber attacks can lead to cascading failures and a blackout. The communication networks of digital substations are modelled and integrated with the power system model. They emulate the communication network traffic between the control center and digital substations. The physical and cyber system models are integrated via co-simulation.<br/>Secondly, attack graphs for digital substations are designed and used for cyber attack analysis. The attack graph model is based on the topology of a digital substation, specified by industry and academia. A novel method is proposed for defining the probability distributions of the time-to-compromise for each attack step, which is used in the attack simulations to extract the global time-to-compromise of the targeted asset. <br/>Furthermore, an impact assessment method is proposed, which correlates the impact on both layers of the cyber-physical system. Key performance indicators for the power system operation as well as the operation of its communication system are defined and implemented. The overall risk of a specific cyber attack scenario is assessed based on the impact indices, likelihood of the cyber attack to commence, and a proposed metric regarding power system restoration. The proposed methods are validated by examining various cyber attack scenarios on the developed cyber-physical system model. The examined scenarios are based on real-world cyber attacks. Additionally, a study regarding the effect of different attack sequences is conducted. The impact is assessed on both layers of the cyber-physical power system by running dynamic simulations. <br/>On overall, the CPS simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods to assess risks and identify the most critical systems per cyber attack scenario. The proposed methods correlate the vulnerability assessment of the modelled security infrastructure with the corresponding impact on the cyber-physical system. The risk assessment is validated by a comprehensive analysis of selected study cases, examining the cascading failure chains of the power system. These studies show the importance of examining various attack scenarios in order to identify the weak points and bottlenecks in the integrated cyber-physical power system. <br","Risk Assessment; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Attack Graphs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Although TAM projects have a recurring character, the TAM projects’ schedule performance is still frequently unmet. It is also revealed that rework is one of the causes of TAM schedule overruns. Hence, this research aims to make recommendations for reducing rework events by enhancing the knowledge reuse process. This research focuses on the TAM projects in Pupuk Kaltim, a petrochemical company in Indonesia. This research draws the data from 9 interviews and examines the company’s relevant documents. The data was then used to develop a fault tree to derive the causes of rework. Among five others, rework events are caused by knowledge issues, namely worker inattention to work instructions and employee knowledge gaps. Subsequently, the activity theory was used to describe the current practice of the knowledge reuse process. It is found that knowledge reuse occurs through both person-to-person and person-to-document ways. As boundary spanners, people may arrive in different communities in different TAM projects. Thus, knowledge reuse occurs through the employee’s network. On the other hand, the documents work as the boundary object. As a tool involved in every stage of the TAM project setting, it must be well developed and maintained. Nevertheless, this is not the case. Activity theory models are also helpful to discover the enabler and the barriers of the knowledge reuse process. Those enablers are (1) people found abnormality, (2) leadership and working environment, (3) familiarity among each other, (4) a need for specifics and details, (5) assistance from an expert/knowledge producer, and (6) work’s passive by-product to record the knowledge. On the other hand, the barriers to reusing the knowledge are (1) low explicit knowledge quality, (2) it is not correctly indexed, (3) the expert lacks props, (4) lack of incentives, (5) resources, and (6) standards for reporting and evaluation meetings to reintegrate knowledge. Based on these factors, it is proposed to use new web-based tools to capture the knowledge from the execution stage and update work instructions. Moreover, it is also suggested to develop guidelines to formally capture the knowledge at the closing stage and reuse it at the planning stage, which encompasses knowledge about equipment and failures, especially previous rework events. This solution is polished through expert validation, where it must also be reinforced by strong leadership and organizational support. Through this research, it is expected to broaden empirical findings on learning in project and maintenance management. Finally, this research is also likely to enhance the knowledge reuse process in turnaround project contexts for companies who similarly conduct their turnaround projects as Pupuk Kaltim.","Turnaround Management; Knowledge Reuse; Activity Theory; Rework; Petrochemical company","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The government needs to renovate unstable quay walls quickly. With 600 kilometre of quay wall in Amsterdam alone, this is a great challenge. Currently, unstable walls are found by deformation monitoring using tacheometry, which takes too much time for large scale monitoring. To increase both speed and coverage, a photogrammetric deformation analysis is proposed. In multiple epochs, at months interval, a series of images of the quay wall is made from a boat. In these images, feature points are identified and matched, where part of the feature points are matched across multiple epochs. All feature point observations are put in a multi-epoch least squares adjustment. This adjustment integrates both feature point observations of individual epochs and point deformations between multiple epochs. Using photogrammetry in combination with such a deformation adjustment has not been done previously, but has great advantages. The least squares adjustment allows to take the stochastic nature of the observations into account. This enables proper error propagation, such that not only quay wall stability can be assessed, but also the corresponding error budget. Results show that using two epochs 300 multi-epoch feature points can be found per square meter quay wall. With these points, sub-centimetre deformation can be estimated.","Quay walls; Photogrammetry; least-squares; Deformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

These modules have a higher stabilising capacity than modules that are currently being used in the Netherlands and other countries and can therefore be used for more storeys without requiring an additional stabilising structure such as a concrete core.<br/>In the first part, reference projects and case studies are looked at to get a good understanding of the current applications in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. After analysing four case studies, an assessment is done on the functional efficiency, structural capacity and environmental impact of these modules. By doing so, the load-bearing structure of self-stabilising modules that can be used at a greater height can be identified. Design variants can now be drafted with different bracing configurations, which are later verified on strength and stability requirements. To effectively design a suitable braced frame, it has been researched what the displacement components for braced frames are. This has been done for simple frames without eccentricity as well as frames including eccentricity. Apart from single-cross frames with a relatively large span, double-cross frames are also looked into due to their increased stiffness. <br/>As part of the total structure of the building, a design for the foundation as well as the inter-module joint, which is required to be demountable, has been made. These parts of the design are required to calculate the horizontal displacement during lateral loads.<br/>A structural assessment is done on the stabilising capacity of each variant at 8 storeys. The design adjustments that are required to further increase the number of storeys up to 10 are looked into as to see whether or not an efficient structure can be maintained. It turns out that each design variant requires adjustments that reduces the efficiency. These changes are the result of a large increase of braced span, resulting in either inefficient use of beam profiles or a too large length when there is more than one braced span along the length.<br/>Apart from a structural assessment, the functionality and environmental impact of the design variants has been analysed as part of the overall efficiency of the modules. The functional assessment includes several criteria such as wall-to-floor area and space efficiency factor. Using the required material use in partition structures and load bearing elements, the environmental impact is calculated, resulting in values for the embodied energy and embodied carbon per square meter in each design variant. Since the differences between the design variants are relatively small, they are also compared to four case studies that were done before.<br/>On the basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that self-stabilising modules can be constructed with different possible bracing layouts and an efficient load-bearing structure up to 8 storeys. <br","modules; Modular construction; Sustainability; residential building structure; self-stability; Environmental impact; Modular Design; Structural Optimization; Bracing design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Due to the current short operational life time of composite aircraft the risks of impact damages on composite structures are unknown. This paper proposes a new method for quantitative risk analysis of low velocity impact damages on composite aircraft structures by combining a conventional risk analysis with the probability of detection of the damages. Real damage data of metal structures is used to estimate impactors and to predict damages on composite structures by means of an aircraft impact damage model. To create a large set of impact events and to conduct a more accurate analysis impactor data estimated from the real metal damage data is augmented. Three fuselage sections with a significant difference in amount of damages have been selected to compare the different risk results. The outcome of a conventional risk analysis and the outcome of the probability of detection of damages show that the section with the highest amount of damages results into the highest risk. However, the proposed method by combining the probability of detection of the damages with a conventional risk analysis shows different and more revealing results. The fuselage section with nearly 50% less damages compared to the section with the highest damages appears to be the highest risk section but the difference with the other fuselage sections is small. The proposed risk analysis method intends to be a useful tool for aircraft maintenance organisations for a different approach of assessing the risks of impact damages on composite structures.","Composite structures; Risk Analysis; probability of detection; machine learning; visual inspection; aircraft; impact damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Kunneke, R.W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the 2019 European Green Deal, the EU has set an ambitious roadmap to enable European citizens to benefit from a Green Transition. One of the main goal of the Green Deal is the deployment of renewable energy sources. Within these, solar power has been identified as the fastest growing<br/>source. Within solar technologies, crystalline-silicon (c-Si) based account for a market share of 95%. Nevertheless, large-scale production of solar PVs encounters many challenges, due to the current solar industry design. Countries that aim at developing solar technology on a significant<br/>scale, have to face China’s current market dominance. China is the largest producer, exporter, and installer of solar panels, on a worldwide scale. The final goal of the research is to evaluate if and how could China impede the competitiveness<br/>or market expansion of Member States in the c-Si solar-tech industry. The main research question therefore is: What is China’s market dominance when compared to the European Union in the solar panels<br/>global industry?<br/>The analysis is structured by following the application of a novel Analytical Framework that takes into account all the significant factors that are able to influence the solar market dynamics. From the application of Analytical Framework to the EU-China case-study emerges the Market Dominance<br/>Assessment, that analyses the actual market dominance of China, with respect to the European Union, in the commercialization of c-Si technologies.<br/>Three are the main takeaways that can be drawn from the Market Dominance Assessment. Firstly, China, technically, controls over 80% of the worldwide c-Si solar market; each variable of the Analytical<br/>Framework confirms the predominance of Chinese companies along the global solar supply chain, creating a situation where European parties cannot have access to those resources that allowed China to reach its current status. Secondly, the European Union is dependent on imports of Chinese c-Si panels, at the point that 90% of the current PV installations in the European territory come from China and few other Asian countries; at the same time, the EU is China’s number one trading partner. C-si panels trading, therefore, over years, created a situation of mutual dependency<br/>among the two market parties, where the EU is dependent of Chinese export rates, while<br/>China, to avoid over-supply, is dependent on European import rates. Thirdly, the best market strategy that Member States can apply is to accept and recognize the market dominance of China, and work to strengthen the domestic solar industry by tackling local weaknesses. As outlined in the policy options, the European Union, on my advice, should work, in the first place, towards the<br/>implementation of a European electricity market. In conclusion, the European Union, therefore, remains highly dependent on Chinese c-Si panels, and this dependency is expected to rise in the coming years, due to future European plans to foster<br/>solar energy. Anyhow, with the right policies and an adequate degree of investments in the solar industry, European countries will easily be able to reach the goals set in the European Green Deal.","Solar energy; European Green Deal; Assessment Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Each DORV patient requires an individual surgical approach. In complex cases the optimal surgical approach may be difficult to assess based on conventional 2D imaging. The aim of this study is to assess the added value of 3D printed and 3D Virtual Reality (VR) models used for surgical planning in DORV patients, supplementary to the gold standard 2D imaging modalities, in a retrospective clinical setting. Methods: Five patients with different DORV-subtypes were selected, of which 3D prints and good quality cardiac CT scans were available. Participants were twelve congenital cardiac surgeons and paediatric cardiologists, from 3 different hospitals. Participants were shown the 2D images first, after which they assessed the VR and 3D model in random order. After each imaging method, a questionnaire was filled in on the visibility of essential structures, feasibility of four-chamber repair, and the surgical plan. Results: Spatial relationships were generally best visible using 3D methods. The feasibility of VSD patch closure was accessible best on the VR 3D reconstructions (good visible: VR 92%, 3D print 66%, and US/CT 46%, P&lt;.01). Moreover, based on the three different visualisation modalities, surgical plans were proposed. The proportion of proposed surgical plans similar to the performed surgical approach was 72% for plans based on conventional imaging, 85% for plans based on 3D printing, and 87% for plans based on VR visualisation.Conclusions: In this study, we determined that the use of both 3D modalities is very useful and participants could visualize spatial relationships better compared with conventional 2D imaging. Moreover, based on the 3D visualisations, the proposed surgical plans were corresponding more to the actual performed surgery.

Locals, especially the poor and uneducated locals who lost access to land as a result of development of solar park, suffered more. Injustice and feelings of unfairness persist among locals when they talk about the jobs, local development, access to energy and additional burdens like risks and responsibilities created due to the solar park. Unjust procedures led to unjust outcomes. Locals were deprived of full and impartial information, local power dynamics influenced decision-making process leading to injustices done to rightful beneficiaries and local voices were ignored during various stages of project operation. Lack of transparency, accountability and participation, changes in resource use, and practices such as political influence, corruption, intimidation were identified as factors causing the injustices in the implementation of solar parks. Most of these factors, however, are systemic and are present across various sectors. Renewable energy projects proved to be no exception!","energy justice; developing countries; India; case study; solar park; Energy infrastructure; energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The unchanged water depth, the equilibrium seabed, in inlet systems is important to know for shipping near harbours and wildlife in nature reserves.<br/>An idealized exploratory version of this complex system of morphodynamics to find the equilibrium solutions is usually modelled in a depth- and width-averaged way, which removes the vertical structure. Hence I will investigate if it is possible to model the system in a width-averaged two-dimensional way with the vertical structure intact and what are the consequences of retaining the vertical structure?<br/>To investigate this the construction of a two-dimensional model is described and the solution methods posed. Following this the resulting equilibrium sea beds are compared to the equilibrium sea beds found in depth-averaged one-dimensional models to ascertain the importance of the vertical structure. \\ \\<br/>It was found that adding the vertical structure makes the resulting governing equations of the model more complex but can be solved with perturbation techniques. Furthermore, for specific sets of parameters describing the system it is possible to have multiple equilibrium sea beds, which suggests the existence of bifurcations. Finally, it is possible to find a relation between the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional governing equations that results in both models producing the same results.<br/>Concluding, two-dimensional models compared to one-dimensional models add an extra layer of complexity which allows for bifurcations but makes the model computatively more expensive. Instead, using the relation found in this paper in a one-dimensional model is preferred as in theory it results in the same equilibrium sea beds found.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Predicting an accurate fatigue lifetime is important for structures (e.g. wind turbines) that are supposed to be out at sea for decades. It is valuable for all type of structures that encounter stochastic sea loadings to optimise the design so that fatigue failure is predicted for, or material is saved in preventing over conservative estimates. This research contributes to the investigation of multiaxial fatigue concepts by getting insight in the mode-III loading &amp; response conditions for the effective notch stress concept. The mode-III loading &amp; response will in this research be represented by a tubular welded joint loaded under torsion. A semi-analytical formulation is developed to describe the weld notch shear stress distribution analytically. This formulation can be used as input for the effective notch stress concept. The formulation is based on three components, the notch stress, weld load carrying stress and far field stress component. Furthermore, the static force and moment equilibrium is satisfied. The weld load carrying stress component is based on a weld load carrying stress estimate. This coefficient is used because the weld geometry causes a local change in stiffness, a shift in neutral axis, meaning the weld becomes load carrying up to some extent. The distribution must be corrected for this phenomenon which is done by this estimated term. The geometry is a tubular welded joint. This specimen can be loaded with torsion which in the case of the tubular joint cause mode-III shear in the through thickness direction at the weld notch level. The weld load carrying stress estimate is based on the geometry ratios of the assessed specimens. It is individually fitted for all 6,300 geometries by comparing the results to stress distribution obtained with 2D finite element analysis. The results of the individual fitted load carrying stress estimates are used as input of a multi variable polynomial regression analysis. The regression analysis led to a polynomial function that describe the load carrying stress estimate which uses geometry ratios as input. The far field information and geometry dimensions are the input for the semi-analytical formulation to obtain the weld notch shear stress distributions analytically. Accurate results are obtained and therefore the formulation can be used as input for the effective notch stress concept. The effective notch stress concept is also based on a material characteristic length, ρ*, over which the stress distribution can be integrated to obtain the effective notch stress. This parameter is obtained using a log likelihood regression analysis and led to a value of ~1 [mm]. Although this is a good result, the confidence regarding the value is low due to low variety in the experimental data set and little data in general. The findings of this study will be used in further research regarding the 4D fatigue project and the effective notch stress concept in general at the Delft University of Technology.","Fatigue; Effective notch stress; Mode-III; Torsion; Welded joints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","4D-Fatigue",""

Intensive maintenance dredging is required to ensure safe shipping traffic. Conventional dredging methods are highly expensive, and therefore port authorities seek for more efficient solutions to reduce costs. One of these solutions is water injection dredging (WID), which in general, proves to be cheaper than hopper dredging by leaving the sediment in place, thus, eliminating substantial costs for relocation of the dredged sediment. <br/><br/>WID is generally applied on soils, which show high concentrations of fines in their particle-size distribution. These kinds of soils, known as fluid mud, exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour. An extensive rheological analysis of fluid mud from the Caland Canal (Port of Rotterdam, The Netherlands), confirmed that fluid mud does indeed show non-Newtonian behaviour. Flow curves obtained by a rotational rheometer provided evidence that fluid mud can be classified as a visco-plastic fluid and furthermore exhibits thixotropical behaviour. The focus of this study is on gaining more insight into the influence of this non-Newtonian behaviour on fluid mud density currents created by WID using detailed numerical simulations.<br/><br/>The numerical simulations were carried out by a variable density 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Visco-plastic behaviour was added through the Bingham-Papanastasiou model, in addition, two rheological models, relating the Bingham model parameters to the volumetric concentration of solids were used to capture the rheology of fluid mud. Numerical results were validated by new experimental measurements performed in the water-soil flume at Deltares. Comparison was made between a regular simulation, without rheology, and the two rheological models for different magnitudes of viscosity regularisation. The main difference between the two is the formation of a new bed layer due to the influence of yield stress. This is caused by the relatively high (apparent) viscosity, which is approximately two orders of magnitude larger, decelerating the density current. Apart from this, a sharper density gradient and a lower density current are developed as a consequence of the non-Newtonian rheology.<br","Water Injection Dredging; Fluid Mud; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Dredging; 3D Modelling; Port of Rotterdam; Caland Canal; Non-Newtonian Fluids; Rheology; Rheometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-20","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","PRISMA II",""

The problem with this method is that it binds the network to a specific decision making process that is encoded into the dataset. We propose a novel architecture we call map-grasp that does not propose grasp locations but instead produces property maps describing measurable, physical object properties while simultaneously detecting and classifying items in an image. We devised a method to automatically generate a dataset containing these property maps from a point cloud, from which we can then determine a grasping location based on custom criteria. We train our network on a training set containing 1845 images and then test it on a physical system where we attempt over 700 grasps on 66 different items. We compare our performance on a current state-of-the-art analytical method and show that our network can outperform it, achieving an 82.16% first-try success rate and a 89.73% total clear rate.","Deep learning; convolutional neural network; bin-picking; Grasping; Grasp Synthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-19","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As their name suggests, variable stiffness mechanisms are mechanical systems that are capable of altering their stiffness. They can do this in order to adapt their interaction with the environment. One of the applications where variable stiffness can offer advantages is in healthcare. Specifically in minimally invasive surgical procedures, such as cardiac catheterization. In cardiac catheterization a catheter is maneuvered to a target location where it is to perform its task, which can be diagnostic or interventional. Currently, catheters are preceded by guidewires, which navigate the vasculature before the catheter follows. During the navigation of the tortuous vasculature, situations, such as a very tight bend, may present themselves that the guidewire cannot comply with in terms of stiffness. The guidewire is then to be replaced by one that does conform to the required stiffness for that situation. However, swapping guidewires takes time and imposes stresses upon the patient, which is not beneficial. It is then desirable to develop a catheter that does not depend so heavily on guidewires, such that it can navigate the vasculature practically by itself. After the navigation the catheter should still be able to perform its tasks as other currently used catheters. In order to comply to the different scenarios that the catheter may encounter during navigation or procedural tasks, the catheter should be able to vary the stiffness characteristics of some of its degrees of freedom.<br/>An analysis was conducted of which degrees of freedom are key during interactions between the catheter and the vasculature and what their desirable behaviour should be in a number of scenarios. It was identified that mainly the axial and bending degrees of freedom undergo loading during interactions with the vasculature. The two degrees of freedom should be able to obtain both a flexible state and a rigid state. In the flexible state the behaviour of the degrees of freedom should pose a minimal chance of causing significant harm to the vascular environment. The rigid state allows the catheter to resist more of the contact forces without deforming, thus leaving the catheter able to better transfer force upon the environment. In some scenarios it is vital that one degree of freedom is in the flexible state, while the other is in its rigid state.<br/>The identified requirements were used to develop a number of conceptual solutions, of which the most promising were further developed. Eventually, the concept with the most potential was fabricated into a prototype and its stiffness behaviour of the separate degrees of freedom validated. After validation, the final prototype was designed which serves as an interpretation of how the novel catheter may be used in the medical field.<br/>The fabricated prototype was tested by subjecting the tip to axial and bending load cases. The magnitude of deflection due to the imposed load showed the stiffness characteristics of each degree of freedom. It was found that the stiffness of both degrees of freedom was able to be varied using the working principles of the developed concepts. Also, the results showed that a stiffness variation in one degree of freedom did not significantly influence the stiffness characteristics of the other degree of freedom.<br/>From the results following the tests of a prototype based on the developed concepts, it was concluded that the novel catheter is be able to adapt the stiffness of the axial and bending degrees of freedom, such that it can comply to several scenarios. Compliance to these scenarios allows the catheter to navigate through the vasculature without inducing significant harm, but also to apply force along a certain degree of freedom to the environment when necessary. The implementation of the stiffness variation methods into real life application would benefit both patient and operator in terms of decreased procedural time and elimination of stresses associated with guidewire replacement.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

For deep-sea shipping, ammonia is marked as a high potential fuel. The AmmoniaDrive concept feeds the anode-off gas from a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and additional ammonia into an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The exhaust gas coming from the ICE can contain relatively large amounts of NOx, NH3 and N2O. This research focuses on reducing all these substances using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in steady-state conditions. A 1-d single-channel model is used to model a Vanadium, Iron and Copper catalyst. The levels of pollutants entering the atmosphere are compared to the current legislation for ships, where NOx emissions are limited. Furthermore, new legislation is proposed that also limits the NH3 and N2O emissions of the powerplant. Meeting these limits is much more complicated than meeting the current legislation. The presence of N2O in the exhaust can be problematic as only the Fe catalyst can reduce N2O with temperatures above 350/400 degC. The Cu based SCR has the highest potential for AmmoniaDrive as it can meet the newly proposed limits with exhaust temperatures below 200 degC, this allows for an efficient driveline.","SCR; AmmoniaDrive; NOx; NH3; N2O; Selective catalytic reduction; NO; NO2; exhaust aftertreatment; ammonia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

Among the findings, the most significant one is that the leaders didn’t reach a consensus on the company’s long-term goal; and the employees didn’t have an aligned sense of the company’s mission and product vision. This phenomenon led to employees’ low productivity in new product development, constantly making incorrect trade-offs, and misaligning collaboration across different teams.<br/><br/>The project presented a design toolkit consisting of a canvas and an instruction brochure to overcome the challenge. This design toolkit helped the leaders collaboratively develop a big shared picture by outlining the company’s mission and product vision. The author held a design workshop to implement the solution with three company co-founders and successfully generate the organization’s long-term goal. As a result, the author evaluated the outcome by comparing employees’ behavioral changes.<br/><br/>Internally, an enormous leap in the team’s productivity has been identified.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The energy transition is expected to increase the peak loading of the grid, requiring Distribution System Operators (DSOs) like Stedin to invest an increasing amount of capital and labour in the reinforcement of their network. Flexible resources can be used to decrease the peak loading of the grid through better matching consumption and generation. DSOs can defer or avoid reinforcement by using flexible power to realize sufficient capacity at the lowest possible cost. This thesis provides the means for quantifying the ability of flexible power to act as an alternative to investment in grid reinforcement. <br/>The problems expected to arise as a function of the energy transition are identified by literature research. It was found that of the identified problems, ’Power quality: Voltage dips and swells’- and ’Capacity: Thermal capacity'-problems are likely to be solvable through the application of flexible resources. To assess the intensity of the problems in Stedin's service area and research possible means of categorization, a projection of the energy transition scenarios of Netbeheer Nederland on parts of Stedin's grid is used. These simulations show problems arising mainly from cumulative integration of typical energy transition technologies, like PV, HP and EV. The voltage and capacity problems are shown to be highly related to active power flows, where the influence of reactive power flows is comparatively low.<br/>Through a proposed revision of the 'Reinforce unless'-framework, the means are provided to determine the feasibility of solving encountered problems and bottlenecks through flexible resources. The revised framework quantifies the flexible resources’ ability for mitigating bottlenecks by combining the Jacobian matrix of power flow analysis with the technical abilities of the flexible resources. The application of flexible resources as an alternative to investment reduces the certainty of supply through the possibility of insufficient flexible capacity to mitigate the bottleneck. The resulting risk can be quantified through the 'not delivered'-energy. <br/>Several potential barriers and discussions arise through describing the potential flexible resources in the distribution grid. The main discussion is based on the lack of insight and controllability in the distribution grid, reducing the overall applicability, and the trade-off between applying flexibility or facilitating flexibility. This trade-off requires DSOs to determine where to facilitate and where to use flexibility. <br/>The financial feasibility of applying flexibility as an alternative to investment is discussed on both the procurement as the comparative feasibility towards reinforcement. Based on the review of services currently contracted by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) and literature research, a most likely approach to contract sufficient flexible resources at reasonable costs is described. The resulting method counteracts gaming, guarantees sufficient flexible power for mitigating bottlenecks at reasonable prices, and allows for market operation to provide the lowest possible costs.<br/>This thesis reviews the operational problems that DSOs can expect and the role flexible resources can play to solve them. The framework of 'Reinforce unless' is adapted to fit this wider range of bottlenecks and to include specific methods to assess and substantiate the sufficiency of flexible power to solve the bottleneck.<br","Flexibility; Distribution System Operator; Distribution Grid; Energy System Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Boer, Deodaat (mentor); Broekhuijsen, Peter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands is like no other country enthusiastic about cycling and is the home of 37.000 kilometers of bicycle paths. These bicycle paths need to cross other modalities and therefore intersections are needed. At signalized intersections, the control is mostly regulated using sensors such as push buttons and one or multiple inductive loops. Sensors for cyclists are running slightly behind in comparison with those from cars and the company of CycleData anticipated on this fact by developing a new sensor, the iSignum, that works on radar and laser service and is capable to determine speed. The iSignum is capable of communicating with the iVRI (intelligent traffic light control) where it is installed and notify that a cyclist is coming. The sensor is placed further away from the stop line meaning there is time to communicate with the iVRI that a cyclist was detected and for example with what speed. This can benefit the comfort and traffic flow of cyclists when a notification leads to green light such that cyclists simply do not have to stop unnecessarily before the intersection. Part of this research was a literature study towards stakeholders and existing bicycle sensors. The latter was needed to be able to make a comparison of what makes the iSignum stand out from the rest or if it is just another bicycle sensor. A literature study has indicated that inductive loop sensors in combination with push buttons are used the most. Additionally, there are other cyclists sensors on the market nowadays. These sensors include infrared sensors, smart cameras and mobile phones and WiFi/Bluetooth applications. These are however not used on a big scale yet. In this report, research was done towards the newly developed sensor that is installed at an intersection in Delft, the Julianalaan-Nassaulaan intersection. Several matters were looked into, such as the accuracy of the iSignum in comparison to the reality at this location and what potential situations can result in disturbances in detecting cyclists. Furthermore, preventions are explored to an extent of what could be possible at this specific location. To test the exactness of the iSignum, manual bike counting is done over the course of three days. This data was then compared to the data that the sensor of iSignum logs. Conclusions that have been made after the comparison is that the newly developed sensor is not as accurate as the company CycleData claims it to be, the promised 95% is not reached. During the measurements, the sensor did not manage to pass the 78.2% accuracy. However, disturbances that happened, such as the presence of a delivery van or garbage truck or cars that drive over the bicycle path, while counting cyclists are included. Making the preciseness less in particular cases, with the worst case being 75.3%. V-log data, which logs traffic status and information such as detection and signal groups from an iVRI, is additionally used to check whether those disturbances can be covered by the existing control of the intersection. The outcome states that the existing intersection control of a loop sensor and push-button manage to still detect cyclists during the time of disturbances. Next to this, prevention methods for the disturbances are researched such that relying on the existing intersection control may not be needed in the future and the full potential of the iSignum can be reached after more precision from the sensor itself is achieved. A prevention method that could help all the occurred disturbances is to move the sensor more downstream from the bicycle path where the disturbances do not influence the sensor anymore. This is therefore also the recommendation for this particular intersection such that unnecessarily errors are filtered out of the data. Additionally, further research is needed after the relocation of the sensor and towards the enhancement of the accuracy because other errors are present that are not accountable to a disturbance. It is valuable to do more extensive research on this topic to determine if these errors can be erased from the system to reach the full potential of the iSignum such that the objective of shorter waiting times and more comfort for cyclists can be reached at signalized intersections.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Their intended power system integration goes along with increasing the share of renewable energies. Hereby, PEV have the prerequisites for intelligent charging to support grid stability and increasing the utilisation of fluctuating renewable energies. Beside integrating PEV as an intelligent load, the approach using the PEV’s battery capacity to serve power system needs can further increase the value of PEV in the power system. Thus, for compensating additional stress on the PEV's components, ancillary services revenues are commonly measured against PEV's wearout for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) applications. Depending on the selected driving pattern, location, battery, regulation and revenue of ancillary services, use cases lead to different conclusions. In the scope of this thesis, it is argued that ongoing transitions in the power system and transport sector result in uncertainties how these use case and its dependencies change in the future. However, the technical prerequisites of V2G based ancillary services, which subject to physical, chemical and electrical processes, are known, whereby a broad view on use cases is essential. Hence, in this thesis, the sensitivity of these services is measured against vehicle characteristics from a technical point of view. This work identifies more than 30 technical dependencies that affect the PEV's degradation and total discharging costs. With respect to the Dutch energy market, the results demonstrate that Vehicle-to-Grid costs can lead to a significant market potential loss. However, operation conditions exists, which lead not only to a high market potential in the balancing and day-ahead market, but also in a reduction of battery degradation. Based on the sensitivity results, implications that cover the regulation, business, user and technical layers of Vehicle-to-Grid are given based on an architecture model. The presented work allows identifying use case related dependencies and therefore helps to clarify the reasons for the different results/conclusions on V2G research.","Electric Vehicle; Vehicle-to-Grid; Ancillary Services; Sensitivity Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-18","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

As demands on global data transmission grow the capacity of these systems needs to be increased. The behaviour of light waves through these optical fibers is described by the Manakov Equation (ME), a system of nonlinear partial differential equations.<br/><br/>The ME is an integrable system, which can be solved analytically using Nonlinear Fourier Transforms. Recently, fiber-optic communication systems based on the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) of the ME have been proposed. Similar to the linear Fourier Transform, which decomposes a signal in linear frequency components, the NFT decomposes a signal in nonlinear frequency components. This nonlinear spectrum consists of a continuous and a discrete part. The continuous spectrum in general constitutes the whole real line. The discrete spectrum consists of distinct points in the complex plane which correspond to so-called solitons, which are stable wave forms. The evolution of the nonlinear spectrum along the fiber is trivial.<br/><br/>The nonlinear spectrum however cannot be computed analytically for most signals and therefore numerical methods are needed. The existing numerical methods have a high computational complexity of O(D^2) for computing the continuous spectrum, with D the number of time samples of the signal. For the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE), a simplification of the ME, more efficient numerical methods exist with a computational complexity of O(D log^2(D)). In this thesis we present an extension of these so-called fast NFT methods to the ME. The resulting algorithms are second and fourth-order algorithms based on second and fourth order exponential integration methods respectively. <br/><br/>We developed open source software implementing the fast NFT algorithms for the ME and integrated them in the already existing Fast Nonlinear Fourier Transform (FNFT) software library. We provide detailed documentation and examples which allow other researchers to use the algorithms as tools or as a base for developing new algorithms. We furthermore test the accuracy of the developed algorithms against analytic examples. Of these examples, the rectangle signal and secant hyperbolic signal are new analytic examples for the ME to the best of our knowledge.","nonlinear Fourier transform; Manakov equation; Software Library; fiber-optic communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); de Vos, P. (graduation committee); Coraddu, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The use of fossil fuels and their impact on humans and nature is becoming a bigger concern worldwide. An interesting concept to lower polluting emissions coming from maritime engines is the combined use of a dual-fuel engine and an underwater exhaust system. In the dual-fuel engine natural gas is used as the main fuel type. It is seen as a cleaner alternative to the traditional fossil fuels that are being used. In order to ignite the air-gas mixture in the cylinder a small amount of diesel fuel (pilot fuel) is used, therefore making it a dual-fuel engine. Some advantages of using an underwater exhaust system are no direct emissions into the atmosphere, increased space on decks and reduced noise from the exhaust. However the downside is that such a system causes back-pressure effects which can deteriorate engine performance. So far research on these back-pressure effects on a dual-fuel type engine is lacking, therefore this thesis focuses on the static back-pressure effects on a dual-fuel engine.<br/>For this purpose experiments were performed on a constant pressure turbocharged, 4-stroke dual-fuel engine. Engine performance and emissions were recorded for load points along the propeller and generator curve for three cases of back-pressure. The back-pressure was controlled by a butterfly valve in the exhaust pipe of the engine. Due to the fact that this butterfly valve could only be controlled manually, the back-pressure during the experiments could not be kept at a constant level. Also the engine experienced an absolute back-pressure of 1.15 bar with the valve fully open which was already quite high. And in the natural gas that was used a substantial amount of hydrogen was present. An existing diesel engine model (DE-B) that was developed at the TU Delft was then adapted to turn it into a dual-fuel engine model. It is a mean value first principle (MVFP) model. This dual-fuel MVFP model was then matched to the tested engine by using the experimental data. After the matching the model was used to test levels of back-pressure that could not be reached experimentally, due to engine limits, to see the effect on engine performance at these levels. The results were then analysed to see what the critical engine parameters are for the limits of the engine.<br/>The experimental results showed that at low power more pilot fuel is needed to combust the gaseous fuel. It was also clear that there was a changing combustion efficiency for the gaseous fuel along the propeller curve. For the part load conditions the combustion efficiency was lower than at low or high power. For the generator curve the total efficiency was more constant, but always lower than the efficiency of the propeller curve. The results also showed that with increasing back-pressure the fuel consumption decreased for both the pilot and gaseous fuel, with the exception of the gaseous fuel flow at part load for the propeller curve. The recorded emissions showed lower levels of O2, CO and unburned hydrocarbons and higher levels of CO2 and NOx with increased back-pressure. Looking at the emissions in combination with the fuel flows, they showed signs of improved combustion efficiency with increased back-pressure. Increasing the back-pressure caused lower pressures and temperatures at the inlet side of the engine and higher pressures and temperatures at the outlet side. So for the thermal loading of the engine the outlet side is the critical one. The tested dual-fuel engine had a waste-gate installed. The model runs with higher levels of back-pressure showed that the pressure on the inlet side could become so low, that the pressure at which this waste-gate becomes active is no longer reached. This causes high pressures and temperatures before the turbine and high temperatures of the exhaust valve. The model also showed that at high levels of back-pressure the flow through the turbine becomes too low and not enough air is being put into the engine, so the air-excess ratio becomes too low, making the air-excess ratio also an important parameter for the engine limits. Finally it was shown how the dual-fuel MVFP model can be used to define acceptable limits of back-pressure for the air-excess ratio, exhaust valve and outlet receiver temperature.<br/>The main recommendation for further research is to investigate the combustion efficiency of the gaseous fuel. Both the fact that at part load the efficiency was at it worst and the lower fuel consumption when back-pressure was increased need to be looked at. This will also help with improving the current dual-fuel MVFP model. Next to that it would be interesting to see what happens with different types of gaseous fuel and how the engine performs under a fluctuating back-pressure as induced by waves.","Dual fuel engine; back-pressure (static); emissions; mean value first principle model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

These models incur large computational costs. Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo is proposed as a method to reduce the computational cost of these simulations. In addition, research is conducted on the use of porous media as passive damping systems. Hence, an analysis on the effect of porosity on the vortex shedding frequency is conducted. This thesis is an exploratory investigation on the application of Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo in fluid dynamics topics and its particular use for analysis of the effect of porosity on the vortex shedding frequency on a porous circular cylinder. Three case studies are conducted. Firstly, applying Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo on a solid circular cylinder case, which is deemed as a successful application, based on the estimated quantity of interest, variance reduction and computational cost reduction. Furthermore, two parametric studies are conducted: 1) to discover empirical relationships (low-fidelity models) and 2) forward uncertainty propagation with Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo using a uniform input distribution. Both parametric studies consist of a number of equally distributed points of porosity on a case setup of flow past a porous circular cylinder. The parametric studies use a frequency detection algorithm, which approximates the vortex shedding frequency using the frequency of lift force oscillation. The results of the first parametric study indicate there is a drop in vortex shedding frequency as experienced by the cylinder for increasing porosity. The hypothesis is that for increasing porosity the formation length of vortex shedding increases. Two empirical relationships are derived from the results by curve fitting the Strouhal number (dimensionless form of the vortex shedding frequency) versus porosity. These empirical relationships are incorporated in the Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo method and applied to a similar parametric study on the effect of porosity on the vortex shedding frequency. The results indicate the presence of systemic errors in the high-fidelity model. The conjecture is that the major influence on these errors is due to the resolution of the frequency detection algorithm being too low. For this reason, no clear conclusion on the validity of the empirical relationships is obtained and further research is required.","Monte Carlo; Porous Media; Multi-Level Multi-Fidelity; Strouhal number; vortex shedding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

As researchers recognize, these conditions are a source of managerial complexity as Project Delivery Organizations (PDOs) face interorganizational incompatibilities due to the multiple and sometimes conflicting logics or ways of thinking. To date, these conditions continue to be a source of managerial complexity, yet no formal addressing towards the importance of tackling these incompatibilities within the internationals PDOs collaborating has been made. Therefore, this study investigates the incompatibilities these organizations commonly face in theory and practice to provide a solution that addresses them on time so a collaborative partnership between PDOs can be achieved. To fulfill this objective this research follows the Double-Diamond methodology and divides this research into four parts, these being literature review, case studies, design of a conceptual framework for implementation and expert validation. In the first part of the research, literature is reviewed to gain insight into interorganizational incompatibilities and the influence these have on collaboration between PDO partners. Results from this step show that differences in Regulations, Norms, Culture, Interpartner relations and Structural characteristics are among the most frequent incompatibilities found. As a second step, exploratory interviews in two case studies are conducted to investigate the incompatibilities present in practice and delve into how different PDOs deal with them. Results from this step show that the incompatibilities found in the literature are similarly observed in practice. Similarly, it was found the presence of these incompatibilities often leads to misunderstandings, relationship damage, collaboration difficulties and others, which in turn hamper the management and performance of projects. In addition to the previously identified categories, incompatibilities in Interpartner relations and Politics are found. Based on these results, the third step of research focuses on developing a framework that PDOs can implement in the front-end phase of project development to establish a collaborative relationship between PDOs partners and thus overcome interorganizational differences. This framework consists of three preconditions that need to be present throughout the process of partnership establishment, while six other strategies follow a step-by-step approach for targeting the previously identified incompatibilities. As the last step of research, the previously designed framework is validated with four experts on its usefulness and applicability. The results from this study suggest that cross-border projects are more complex to manage due to multiple interdependent participants which are embedded in different institutional contexts. Yet, through the proposed conceptual framework, this research contributes to developing a coherent package of strategies for overcoming the most relevant incompatibilities so PDOs can improve the process of achieving interoperability and collaboration in cross-border projects.","Cross-border projects; Collaboration; Interorganizational incompatibilities; Framework development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

While point forecasts in a single-step-ahead horizon for that unresearched market provide novel insights already, the scope of this research also includes interval forecasts in a multi-step-ahead horizon. A forecasting procedure is established that organizes several stages of in-sample and out-of-sample testing so that the number of arbitrary choices regarding features and hyperparameters is kept as low as possible. It is concluded on the basis of accuracies attained by naive, regression, and artificial neural network models that the machine learning models that are capable to incorporate linear and nonlinear relationships are able to infer to a varying degree what drives intraday from day-ahead prices. Furthermore, it is addressed whether superiority in terms of accuracy coincides with what is deemed as superior in practice. A simulation of a generic system, which consists of a battery and a wind turbine located in the Netherlands, smartly dispatches stored energy according to a schedule optimized with model predictive control based on point forecasts of intraday price. It is concluded that, in general, slightly higher profits are obtained with more accurate point forecasts and that different point forecasts lead to very different dispatch schedules that vary more than 10% in terms of dispatch frequency.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Transfer function noise (TFN) modelling is a form of time series analysis which regularly uses the recharge as a stress to explain the groundwater table fluctuations. Often the recharge flux is estimated as a linear combination of the precipitation and the (potential) evaporation. However, this is a simplification of the actual hydrological processes in the unsaturated zone. This is tried to be overcome by implementing a nonlinear recharge model in TFN time series models. Additionally, TFN models can use different impulse response functions, where some of them account for dispersion and retardation due to the unsaturated zone.<br/><br/>In this report the performance of a linear and nonlinear recharge model, inside the TFN model, are tested against synthetic time series of the groundwater table. These time series for the groundwater table are created with the unsaturated/saturated zone model HYDRUS-1D. With HYDRUS-1D, thirty-five synthetic time series are created for five different soil types and seven different unsaturated zone thicknesses (up to 5 m). The three most commonly used response functions, exponential, gamma and four-parameters are also tested for these thirty-five time series.<br/><br/>The results show that TFN models using the nonlinear recharge model are almost always better in estimating the groundwater table time series than the linear recharge model. This is confirmed in both the calibration and validation period. The common disadvantage of the linear recharge model, undershooting the groundwater table in (dry) summers, is not observed for the nonlinear recharge model. This can improve the forecasting abilities of TFN models during droughts.<br/><br/>Additionally, the nonlinear recharge model gives a more realistic representation of the fluxes in the root zone. This is confirmed goodness-of-fit parameters when comparing of the recharge flux and evaporation reduction calculated by HYDRUS-1D and the nonlinear recharge model. Especially when using the exponential response function, the recharge flux can be estimated quite well by the nonlinear recharge model. However, the nonlinear recharge model is currently not able to estimate groundwater uptake (upwards recharge) while it is observed in the HYDRUS-1D simulations.<br/><br/>The linear model does perform decently for shallow groundwater tables down to a depth of 150 cm since that is where large groundwater fluctuations and more days with groundwater uptake (upward recharge) are observed. The use of the gamma and four-parameter response functions significantly improves the performance of the linear recharge model. This can be explained by the compensation of these response functions for dispersion and retardation in the root zone. Nevertheless, when performing groundwater table time series analysis on synthetic time series created with HYDRUS-1D, the nonlinear recharge model is preferred to simulate the groundwater table.","Time Series Analysis; Pastas; HYDRUS; HYDRUS-1D; Recharge; Nonlinear Recharge Model; Unsaturated Zone; time-series analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Hydrology","",""

However, capacities have not grown at the same rate as air traffic, making Air Traffic Control one of the most encountered primary delays. A data driven approach is taken in order to expose the drivers of the ATC delays for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flights at Schiphol Airport. The used data consists of public and proprietary data, and contains information related to the weather, KLM flight operations, operational data, and Airport Collaborative Decision Making. To perform the analysis, two causal methods were used, association rule mining as a baseline method and a Bayesian network as the state-of-the-art model. Both methods were able to identify various conditions that trigger and/or prevent ATC delay occurrence, and agreed on the majority of the identified influential factors of the ATC delay. It was found that the main influences of ATC delay are the average startup delay of flights in the 20 minute time interval of the flight's departure, as well as the received pure ATFM delay and the assigned regulation delay key. Additionally, other influential parameters on the ATC delay related both to the amount of traffic volume and congestion at the airport, as well as individual variables of the flight, such as the propagation of arrival delay, the number of updates in the CDM process and the delay in the closure of the doors. The main discrepancies in the results could be attributed to the limitations of both methods. In general, it was found that both methods are suitable to diagnose direct causes or influencing factors on a target variable. The Bayesian network method was found to be more suitable to better understand a system and the dynamics between a large number of variables, as the conditional dependencies can be observed from the learned structure, and are not hidden in a large number of frequent patterns. However, first diagnoses of influential variables can also be done using association rule mining, which could find more indirect effects on the target variable compared to the Bayesian network, in which indirect relations might be lost in the structure learning process.<br","Air Traffic Control; Flight delays; Air Traffic Control Delays; Bayesian Network; Association Rule Mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Although the evolu­tion of system performance during a disruption can be visualized in the resilience curve, not much is known about performance during disruptions or the extent to which the curve applies in practice. The limited quantitative knowledge about the resilience of railway networks makes it hard to design appropriate recovery measures. In this thesis, a data-driven evaluation approach is presented to make an ex post assessment of the resilience of railway networks. Several resilience metrics are extracted from literature and two new resilience metrics are introduced. Using historical traffic realization data, resilience curves are reconstructed for a large and heterogeneous set of single disruptions and are quantified in terms of the resilience metrics. Among others, the values of the resilience metrics are compared across disruptions of different causes using Welch’s ANOVA and the Games-Howell test. The approach is applied to a case study of the Dutch railway network, with a focus on the five most common disruption causes. The results of the case study show that there is significant heterogeneity in the shape of the resilience curve, even within disruptions of the same cause. Train defects are found to be the least impactful disruptions on multiple resilience metrics, while collisions are found to be the most impactful disruptions on multiple resilience metrics. The successful application of the approach shows that it can be used by practitioners to assess which types and which parts of disruptions deserve attention to improve disruption management practices, and thus, improve resilience.","Railways; Resilience; Bathtub model; Disruption management; Data-driven; ANOVA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This type of research, usually performed by data-scientist, make use of machine learning techniques in order to improve any system or product that makes use of automated decisions. Now that other researchers, in this case researchers from design studies, would like to perform data-centric research. Therefore, they must be made aware of the issues that could be introduced by using machine learning to automate decisions in electronic devices. To address the issues around bias, we thought that it would be good to make them aware through some type of system where they should be made aware of bias. So we proposed that there was a need for a system where the user could explore bias present in the dataset or introduced by machine learning practices. To be able to find biases we had to decide which bias toolkit which led to use of the AIF360 toolkit that we eventually used to create FairData. FairData lets the user explore bias in datasets that include machine learning predictions by going through and iterative process consisting of a exploration stage and a result stage. The exploration part contains the parts for analysing the datasets by going through the attributes and making small modifications to the dataset. At the results page of this system it will show a change in bias represented by multiple metrics to support the users in becoming aware of bias. The experimentation part of this thesis showed that our system is able to inform two different groups of participants (compute science &amp; industrial design) about the bias present in the dataset. The experiment made it clear that even though participants have different behaviour when analysing/exploring the dataset, they all tend to become aware of the bias by looking at the different metrics provided by FairData.

The efficiency of water electrolysis is therefore closely related to the presence of bubbles in the electrolyte.<br/>In this work, the focus is on the numerical modeling of the evolution of the bubble layer in a vertical channel with gasevolving electrodes on either side of the channel.

This objective can be facilitated by including chemical recycling techniques to recover valuable chemicals such as syngas (H2/CO) and monomers (ethylene/propylene) from plastic waste [2]. Among the chemical recycling techniques, gasification is a mature technology with the highest flexibility on the feedstock composition, allowing to treat complex mixtures as plastic waste [3]. In this framework, the project “Towards improved the circularity of polyolefin-based packaging” evaluates the technology readiness level of gasification for recycling a plastic waste mixture representative of the packaging sector (39.6% of the European plastics demand in 2019 [4]), to increase the knowledge of polyolefins waste (PW) gasification to contribute in closing the plastics loop [5]. The Process and Energy Department of TU Delft is part of this project and is responsible for gasifying a polyolefins waste mixture representative of the packaging sector (PW-DKR350) in a novel Indirectly Heated Bubbling Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer (IHBFBSR) [6].

Preliminary results by Van Duinen (2020) indicate that suction remains present, albeit ever decreasing, during the winter. This means that it would be possible for a dike to dry out during the summer period such that it becomes unsaturated, and that any effects may not have fully disappeared during a normative event.<br/><br/>This problem is two-fold, as (i) the strength of an unsaturated soil is higher compared to a saturated soil, and (ii) it is unknown how the strength associated with the initially unsaturated zone can be modelled in a macro-stability calculation as it varies temporally. This report investigates the strength of the initially unsaturated zone in clay river dikes in the Eastern part of the Netherlands and it explores the opportunities which the better understanding of the strength may present for the factor of safety in a macro-stability calculation<br/><br/>The feasibility and applicability of the SSCC as formulated by Lu and Likos (2006) for conventional geotechnical laboratory tests is investigated. A literature review bundles international knowledge on unsaturated soil behavior which is relevant in the context of dike design. Silty clay samples from the dike trajectory of Ravenstein-Lith were investigated using the SSCC. It can be successfully applied to K0-CAU triaxial test when determining strength parameters using strain-compatibility. Compared to its conventional variant, the saturation stage must be skipped. Samples are air-dried under laboratory conditions to a prescribed volumetric water content which can then be linked to an amount of suction using the SWCC and a comparison can be made with the closed form of the SSCC (Lu et al., 2010). <br/><br/>The SSCC cannot be applied to DSS tests successfully. In DSS tests both slip and a diagonal failure plane was observed. This research was able to pinpoint at which shear strain slip would occur, and hence when tests are valid. DS tests were used to confirm the validity of DSS tests using CCSM.<br/><br/>A case study performed on a representative cross-section found a positive effect on the factor of safety due the additional strength related to the initially unsaturated zone. The FoS increased by at least 1.7% in the most conservative case and at least 5.0% in a scenario supported by field measurements. The current limited number of field measurements restricts a more precise determination. It is advised to perform more of these such that the initially unsaturated zone in a clay river dike can be modelled effectively and reliably with a high degree of certainty.<br/><br/>To conclude, with the application of the SSCC concept, the additional strength produced by considering the initially unsaturated zone in clay river dikes in the Netherlands leads to an opportunity where the dike can be designed more efficiently by reducing conservatism. Thus, taking the initially unsaturated zone in a dike into account can be considered as a valuable contribution to the toolbox of Dutch geotechnical engineers.<br","SSCC; Initially unsaturated zone; K0-CAU; DSS; Strain-compatibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However these give no insight in how the face is shaped by genetics. To investigate the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype, predictive modelling can be used. Predictive modelling is a term used to describe genetic prediction models: tools that aim to predict a phenotype from the genotype.<br/>Objectives: The objective of this project was to investigate the possibility of predictive modelling of facial features from DNA. This method could be used to visualize the variation in facial features caused by the underlying genetics<br/>Methods: In this project the LDAK genetic prediction model was used, this is a software package for phenotype prediction, which uses multilinear regression. Two different datasets were used for this study: Generation R and the Rotterdam Study. Generation R data existed of subjects at the age of nine years old and from the Rotterdam study subjects ≥ 45 years old were included. The datasets were processed individually. From both datasets, phenotype and genotype data was used. The phenotype data consisted of 3D facial meshes that were reduced to 200 endophenotypes with an auto-encoder prior to this study, and genotype data consisted of SNPs acquired using genotyping arrays. The prediction model was trained on 90% of the data, the other 10% was used for testing, where the facial morphology was predicted based on the SNPs. To evaluate the prediction a similarity measure was computed between the predicted faces and the ground truth faces. The similarity measure was computed between each predicted face and all ground truth faces in the test set, thereafter they were ranked in ascending order based on the computed similarity. Next the rank of the true ground truth was determined. Based on the ranking, an accuracy plot was constructed for both datasets and the accuracy ratios (AR) were computed.<br/>Results: For the Generation R dataset the AR found was 0.06 for the Generation R dataset and 0.02 for the Rotterdam Study dataset. The results indicate there is some predictive power, however the AR’s are only slightly above the lower bound for presence of predictive performance. Furthermore, there was a difference in the AR for the Generation R and Rotterdam Study dataset, which could be the result of increased environmental component in facial morphology which reduced the genetic predictability. However, currently the predictive power is minimal. This could be caused by several factors, such as the number of subjects and prediction model that is restricted to only linear relationships. <br/>Conclusion: The objective of this project was to explore the possibility of predictive modelling of facial features from DNA. It was found that there was some predictive power, however this was very limited. Research on predictive modelling of facial features is still in early stages and further research is required to improve the predictive power.<br","Predictive modelling; Facial morphology; Genetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

Output-error estimation is the most accurate method; however, it relies on the use of approximations in order to be implemented in practice.

The proposed method is compared to reference error estimators on an unsteady Burgers’ equation using the method of manufactured solutions, as well as a lid-driven cavity flow. For both of these test cases, it was shown that super-resolution neural networks were able to reconstruct the fine adjoint solution and provide robust and inexpensive output-error estimates at the cost of lower accuracy.<br/>Nonetheless, the accurate estimation of the error indicators gives great confidence in the proposed method’s ability to perform similarly to the adjoint-weighted residual output-error estimate with a mesh adaptation procedure. A cost metric for the computational overhead of the output-error estimate is proposed.

As the sea levels are expected to rise the coming decades coastal protection is becoming increasingly important. To better prepare for the future, increased understanding of embankment breaching is desired. An area of embankment breaching that has been relatively left untouched is the impact of a foreland during a breaching event. This study examines the different effects caused by the presence of a foreland, namely reduced flow rate through the breach, limited breach growth and an elliptical erosion pattern in the foreland. <br/>Embankments are generally more erodible than forelands, and erosion of the foreland occurs after the adjacent embankment has been breached to its base level. As water continuous to flow over the foreland, a plunging jet will form, falling from the high foreland into the breach bottom. This causes undermining in the foreland and subsequent headcut erosion. A distinction is made between cohesive and non-cohesive forelands. Cohesive soil layers experience rotational failure and non-cohesive layers experience sliding failure. <br/>A model is presented that calculates headcut erosion in a foreland, flow characteristics over the foreland and erosion shape of the foreland. The erosion shape of the foreland affects the discharge through the breach and is captured in the non-dimensional constant m. The presented model is implemented as a module into the existing breaching model BRES. The added functionality will increase the accuracy BRES model results.<br/>Two experiments were performed to verify the model. The first experiment examined soil failure of a foreland in dry conditions by pushing an extracted foreland soil layer from a table to observe the failure type and the effects of vegetation on the strength of the soil. The second experiment was performed in collaboration with the University of Antwerp. A soil layer was extracted from a foreland and placed in a large flume. The foreland was subjected to a plunging jet to simulate a breaching event. The outcomes of the model were in line with observations made during both experiments. <br/>The presented model serves as a significant first step towards implementing forelands in flood protection programs, but further research is suggested. The uncertainties stemming from assumptions in the model and the underlying sediment transport relations are significant. Most importantly uniformity of the soil is assumed, whereas in reality root systems in fertile forelands can lead to significant local strengthening. The assumptions in this model are conservative, but additional studies can further increase the accuracy of the foreland- and BRES model.<br","Foreland; Headcut erosion; Embankment breaching; BRES; Building with Nature; Salt marsh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Generation of carrier frequencies for these mm-­wave applications imposes a challenging specification of high spectral­ purity on the frequency synthesizers. Sub­sampling PLLs (SSPLLs) show a remarkable performance in terms of low­ power and good spectral purity, which are critical for such high­speed applications. However, due to their low lock­-in range, SSPLLs require the assistance of an additional frequency­-tracking loop (FTL) for an improved locking performance. These FTLs conventionally employ either high power consuming frequency dividers, or reference frequency multipliers. In this thesis, a novel implementation of an FTL which avoids the usage of high-­frequency dividers is proposed. The proposed FTL uses three sub­-Nyquist sampling rates, which are derived from three mutually co­prime integers, for an unambiguous VCO frequency estimation which helps in frequency error correction. Consequently, the proposed FTL eliminates the need of sampling rates higher than the Nyquist rate and the circuit limitations posed by such high sampling frequencies. The FTL employs a simple amplifier, counter and look­up table based VCO frequency estimation procedure which avoids the need of performing high complexity frequency estimation algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FTL also features a speed optimization algorithm which helps in achieving low frequency­-locking times. The proposed FTL is designed in the 40­nm CMOS technology, targeting an output frequency locking range of 9.8­12.2 GHz. The post-­layout simulations show that the FTL is able to coarsely lock to any desired frequency in the wide­band locking range within an error of 3 MHz, in less than 3 휇s at start-up. Error injections as high as 1.5 GHz are efficiently detected and corrected in less than 3 휇s as well. The area consumed by the FTL is 0.35 푚푚2 and the active area of the total chip is 1.09 푚푚2 including the decoupling capacitors. The FTL consumes a maximum power of 1.56 mW when the PLL is in a locked state. A comparison with other state-­of-­the-­art frequency­-tracking loops demonstrates its clear advantage of wide­band frequency locking and low locking time, while consuming a similar amount of power. Analytically, the proposed FTL also exhibits competence in scaling to mm­wave frequencies.","frequency-tracking loop; PLL; lock-in range; sub-Nyquist; symmetric number systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-14","","","","","",""

This task/state space policy enables the agent to execute the task when the dynamics of the environment is changed from the original environment, without the need of additional demonstrative effort from a human teacher. We achieve this by<br/>decoupling the objective task into a Task space policies and dynamics model.

Thus, effectively decoupling the task objective from the dynamics of the environment. In case, the dynamics of the environment changes, only the agent’s dynamics model has to be relearnt, while the task space policy can be reused.<br/>The method was tested and compared to other imitation learning methods, for various control tasks of the OpenAI Gym toolkit in their original environment.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Semi-submersibles are common vessels in the offshore sector. These vessels usually have a bracing structure to restrain floater movement and to support the deckbox structure. The bracing configuration influences strength, fatigue and other semi-submersible parameters. The first assignment objective was to study the structural design impact on a twin-pontoon semi-submersible when applying different bracing configurations. The influence of bracings on characteristic responses, defined as loading and accelerations governing for the strength and fatigue of semi-submersibles, was studied first. Generally, an increase in bracing diameter results in an increase in characteristic response. However, bracings do not affect characteristic responses much, as differences below 11% are observed. Global strength assessments in the ultimate and accidental limit states were performed using finite element analyses (FEA) for different bracing configurations. Each bracing configuration differentiates itself being beneficial for certain load cases, or is beneficial regarding fatigue sensitive locations. The structural design of semi-submersibles with different bracing configurations were modified to have similar structural performance compared to a reference semi-submersible. The bracing configurations were evaluated based on payload, structural centre of gravity, structural redundancy and fatigue. Generally, the presence of transverse horizontal bracings affects structural performance most significantly, since a payload reduction of 22% is observed when not present due to the dominant splitting force load case and ineffective load path. Adding diagonal bracings in the horizontal or vertical plane, reduces column and deckbox loading for the longitudinal shear, torsion moment and inertia load cases, resulting in a payload increase up to 5%. Omitting braces results in the lowest amount of fatigue sensitive locations. However, since the columns and deckbox structure needs strengthening, welding volume at other fatigue sensitive locations increases, which affects fatigue negatively. The bracing configuration selection should be merely based on the semi-submersible’s requirements. Therefore, the designer should first rank the requirements after which a bracing configuration can be designed. <br/><br/>Fatigue of semi-submersibles remains a challenge in today’s practice, since service cracks are frequently found during inspections. Fatigue resistance is usually determined by S-N curves based on tested small-scale specimens (SSS). Large-scale specimen (LSS) and full-scale specimen (FSS) fatigue tests are performed less frequent. Semi-submersible tubular brace-column and brace brace fatigue resistance is typically determined by LSS tubular joint tests. The fatigue resistance similarity between SSS planar joints and LSS tubular joints was examined by the hot spot stress and averaged effective notch stress concepts. Five different LSS tubular joint fatigue tests, derived from literature, were studied by shell FEA and volume FEA. Weld geometry in tubular joint shell FEA can affect results significantly. When not present, bending stresses are overestimated up to 208%. For most LSS tubular joints, similarity with respect to SSS planar joints is increased for the average effective notch stress concept, compared to the hot spot stress concept. Most LSS tubular joints fit inside the average effective notch<br/>stress SSS planar joint fatigue resistance data. Dissimilarity for divergent LSS tubular joints can be related to different modelling assumptions compared to actual conditions, where differences in boundary conditions and weld geometries is most likely. Fatigue resistance similarity, expressed as the strength scatter index and intercept log<sub>10</sub>(&#x1d436;), of LSS tubular joints is increased compared to hot spot fatigue resistance. Differences in slope &#x1d45a; are similar. A SSS planar joint based design S-N curve is therefore applicable for tubular fatigue sensitive locations of semi-submersibles and other structures. Moreover, this study increases the applicability of the average effective notch stress as fatigue assessment concept. More LSS tubular joints should be studied to demonstrate similarity with higher confidence. <br/>To accurately estimate fatigue lifetime, a detailed fatigue assessment is performed of a tubular brace-brace connection. Multi-axial loading was studied at global and local level, however at the critical saddle location, mode-I stress dominates. Therefore, multi-axial fatigue was not considered. The structural stress,&#x1d446;&#x1d460;, average effective notch stress,&#x1d446;&#x1d452;, and hot spot stress,&#x1d446;ℎ, were applied as fatigue assessment concepts. The fatigue assessment of the simple tubular joint concluded insufficient fatigue lifetime. Stress intensities at the critical saddle location were reduced by implementing internal ring-stiffeners, classifying the connection as a complex tubular joint. Stress reduction factors of 3.9 and 4.1 were achieved, resulting in fatigue damages below 1, thus acceptable. Compared to common fatigue assessment concepts, the detailed &#x1d446;&#x1d460; and &#x1d446;&#x1d452; fatigue assessments reduce the possibility of service cracks and maintenance and inspection work can be planned more precise. However, DNV-GL and IIW guidelines state a fatigue resistance slope change is present above 10<sup>7</sup> cycles (N), which is not accounted for in &#x1d446;&#x1d460; and &#x1d446;&#x1d452;.

(mentor); van der Kolk, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis, a ground structure based thermofluid topology optimization (TO) method is presented which is applicable to problems with creeping flow. Fluid channels with creeping flow are found in a variety of engineering applications, primarily in the field of microfluidics. Current fluid channel TO is typically done with density-based TO and Darcy-Stokes flow. While this approach can improve the performance of cooling devices, certain benefits can be achieved by using a ground structure representation of the fluid channels. By confining the flow to a Poiseuille flow pipe network, a significant reduction (up to a factor 13 in 3-D) in the number of degrees of freedom can be obtained compared to an FEM discretization of the Darcy-Stokes equations, thus reducing computation time. Other benefits of this approach are related to the increased control of explicit geometry features such as channel minimum/maximum width, channel to channel angles, or the number of channel branches at junctions. The presented method, named the Ground Structure Projection (GSP) method, uses a projection step to map the channel geometry and flow onto an Ersatz material model. Performance is subsequently evaluated using an FEM discretization of the advection-diffusion equation. The modeling is validated with comparisons against a trusted commercial FEM package. For Reynolds numbers in the range of Re &lt; 20, the GSP method shows fluid and thermal results within 5% accuracy of an FEM solution. Afterwards, a number of numerical optimization cases are analyzed including a multi-objective (pressure drop + average temperature) optimization of a cooling device. It is shown that the GSP method can achieve improved cooling performance with good objective convergence. In the second part of this thesis, the GSP method is applied to an industrial case concerning the reduction of optical aberration of a Projection Optics Box (POB) mirror in an EUV photolithography machine from ASML. Extreme precision is required in EUV photolithography machines and hence any unwanted optical aberration of the POB mirrors must be minimized. However, the mirrors absorb some EUV radiation resulting in thermomechanical deformation and consequent optical aberration. By optimizing the cooling channel layout to maximize surface temperature uniformity, an attempt is made to reduce optical aberration. A hybrid 2-D/3-D model is created to evaluate the optimization objective. It is shown that for a dipole and a circular heat load the temperature uniformity is improved significantly against a reference fluid channel layout. To check how well the chosen objective translates to reduced thermomechanical deformation, an optimized design is transferred to a commercial FEM package and analyzed. Since the optical systems in the EUV machine can compensate for some optical distortion, a second order surface polynomial is fitted to the FEM deformed mirror surface.

The main objective of this thesis work is to build two connectable systems for tracking and classifying human activities with radar sensors and address the problems caused by the mutual requirements through system designs. To achieve it, this thesis work proposed a multiple target tracking (MTT) system and a human activity recognition (HAR) system based on a distributed IR-UWB radar sensor network. The result shows that the MTT system is able to track multiple extended targets and extract the Doppler characteristics, and the HAR system provides an end-to-end solution for data fusion and activity classification.

With advanced packaging, more efficient and smaller microchips can be produced. For this, advanced packaging stepper systems are used, which are lithography machines with a highly optimized projection lens system, that use a powerful light source. The projection lens system for lithography machines are highly accurate optical assemblies with stringent optical requirements, such as a small wavefront error. These requirements need to be fulfilled, while also dealing with a high throughput. Due to the high throughput and the powerful light source, some of the light passing the projection lens system gets absorbed by the lenses. This causes local lens heating, which degrades the optical performance. Local lens heating causes thermal gradients to arise in the lenses, which cause refractive index gradients. Due to thermal expansion, the lenses will also deform, therefore changing the geometry of the optical surfaces. To analyze the lens heating effects, a Structural, Thermal and Optical Performance (STOP) analysis is performed.

The videos contained annotations of pedestrian eye contact, crossing behaviour, GPS location, vehicle speed, and yielding rules. The distance between vehicle and pedestrian was manually added, and object counts (detected number of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles) and respective sizes were added as an index of visual clutter. In each video, participants were asked to press a key on their keyboard and hold it as long as they felt a situation could become risky, and after each video rate perceived risk using a slider and answer whether the pedestrian had made eye contact. Videos in which the participant observed eye contact, increased perceived risk, suggesting that eye contact increases drivers’ vigilance. Videos with more visual clutter, and with higher vehicle speed were also associated with increased perceived risk. However, the causality of the correlation with vehicle speed can be questioned and may be mediated by the environment and whether crossing occurred. Videos in which yielding rules were absent, compared to videos in which they were present, did not affect perceived risk. This study is the first to investigate how pedestrians’ eye contact affects drivers’ perceived risk.

The current study designs an ideal experimental protocol that would test reflex modulation as a response to perturbations during a goal-directed movement. Methods: A total of twelve participants participated in the five experiments (mean age 25.9 9 ± 3.6 years in the range 22 - 34, seven men and five women, all right-handed and with no history of neuromuscular impairment). The TU Delft Human Research Ethics Committee gave approval for the current study. The experimental protocol is separated into three pilot experiments, one main experiment and an addendum experiment after proven effectiveness of the protocol. The main experiment is conducted with ten subjects. The design process was iterative. The experiments were tested, designed and implemented on a wrist manipulator (PoPe). The transient perturbations are designed to be Ramp-and-Hold (R&amp;H) perturbations of amplitude 0.08rad, 2rad/s with a 180ms hold, causinga stretch reflex response in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR). Results: The main experiment showed that the short-latency (M1) and long-latency (M2) areas in the FCR significantly differ with respect to the posture at which a perturbation is elicited. Upon showing the effectiveness, the experiment is further improved with the implementation of continuous pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS) perturbations to allow for continuous measuring of the stretch reflex, and thereby increasing protocol efficiency. Conclusions: The designed experimental protocol is, therefore, effective in observing reflex modulation during a goal-directed movement performed by the wrist.","Stretch reflex; Experimental Protocol; Wrist","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-12","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A multi-scale reservoir characterization is carried out with the aim to understand the geothermal reservoir potential of the Triassic Main Buntsandstein (RBM) in the Tilburg area. Seismic data, well logs and petrophysical data are used to evaluate the reservoir architecture, stratigraphy, and quality of the potential Main Buntsandstein geothermal aquifer. It was found that the study area is located within a horst- and graben system bounded by normal faults where the top boundary of the RBM is located at depths of 1900 – 2100 m for the horsts and 3300 – 3500 m for the grabens. The horsts and grabens range from circa 3000 to 4000 meters in width. Well log correlations and thickness maps at RBM scale suggest thicknesses of the Subgroup from ca. 160 to 220 meter. The thickness of the Main Buntsandstein generally decreases on the horsts and increases towards the grabens, suggesting higher temperatures of up to 100° C and thicker sand units in the grabens. Thickness generally decreases on the horsts and increases towards the graben suggesting faults were active at time of deposition and better geothermal potential in the grabens due to greater depths and thicker RBM unit. The core analysis of the study showed that the potential Main Buntsandstein reservoir is composed of a variation of sand- and mudstones interlayers, which were deposited on a large fluvial-fan system terminating in a playa-lake environment towards the basin center. Four different facies associations were distinguished within the cores of wells AND-06, KWK-01, SPC-01 and WWN-01-S2. Optimal reservoir connectivity is, according to the facies architecture model, expected in the Lower Volpriehausen and Detfurth Sandstone Members due to the presence of stacked amalgamated fluvial fan sandstone facies. It appeared that aquifer quality does not correlate with increasing depth or stratigraphic position, although the Volpriehausen- and Detfurth Claystone Members display significant poorer reservoir properties. These members, which can be correlated at well distance due to its widespread deposition as playa-lake sediments, are likely to act as a baffle to flow in the subsurface. Best reservoir potential, considering petrophysical measurements on porosity and permeability, is within the fluvial fan sandstones of all facies associations whereas the fine grained cross bedded sandstones show best reservoir quality of all encountered lithofacies. The data showed highly variable measurements where highest mean values for the porosity (11 %) and permeability (105 mD) are encountered in the Lower Detfurth Sandstone Member of well HVB-01. It turned out that northern located wells of Tilburg (AND-06, KWK-01, WWN-01-S2 and SPC-01) showed considerable poor reservoir potential with mean values of below 10% and 10 mD for the porosity and permeability. The southern wells, however, appear to have generally higher reservoir properties compared to the northern wells suggesting better geothermal potential in the area south of Tilburg.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-02","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

To better understand the generation and propagation of free infragravity waves, the SWAN model is used to inspect the infragravity wave pattern, the infragravity wave origins, and the corresponding contribution from different coastlines in the North Sea. The local equilibrium between sea swell wave and infragravity wavebands is applied to parameterize the source infragravity wave along the coastlines bordering the North Sea following the approach of Arduin et. al. (2014). The empirical parameter α1 representing the radiating energy level from each coastline and bottom friction coefficient χ representing the dissipation strength are combined to calibrate the model. 10 storm events with an observed infragravity wave height over 10cm are chosen to gain detailed insight into the evolution of free infragravity waves under extreme conditions in SWAN. A correlation between α1 and χ is found. A relatively good explanation between measured and predicted infragravity wave height can be obtained as long as a large α1 and a large χ are implemented in the model or vice versa, showing an accuracy of up to 75% in the open sea. Based on a proper combination of two variables, the contribution of infragravity energy from each coastline varies spatially in predicted results. The Danish coastline is the dominant region radiating infragravity waves to the open sea and the reflected free infragravity waves could reach the adjacent coastlines such as Netherlands and UK. Behind the peak of an extreme storm event, the excitation of free infragravity energy is observed along the south of the UK coast originating from Denmark. The north of Holland coasts also radiate large amounts of free IG energy but are unable to have a prominent impact in the center of the North Sea due to energy dissipation. These results imply that the radiated infragravity waves can be influential in distant coastlines in the North Sea during storm events and the changes of local coastal dynamics can be attributed to a different generation region due to the storm characteristics.","infragravity waves; SWAN modelling; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

Currently, the TAFG is operational for three NWP models (HARMONIE, HIRLAM and ECMWF). This research found that the HIRLAM TAFG has a better performance than the HARMONIE TAFG. This result is caused by the larger training data­set that is used for the HIRLAM TAFG (20 years) compared the training data­set of for the HARMONIE TAFG (3 years).

Autonomous perception in driving is a key challenge, in which multi-sensor fusion is a common feature. Due to the high resolution and rich information, the camera is one of the core perceptual sensor in autonomous systems. However, the camera provides no knowledge on distance (or depth), which is insufficient for the requirements of autonomous driving. On the other hand, LiDAR provides accurate distance measurements, however the information is sparse. The complementary characteristics of cameras and LiDAR have been exploited over the past decade for autonomous navigation. In order to be able to fuse the camera and LiDAR sensor system jointly, an efficient and accurate calibration process between sensors is essential. Conventional methods for calibrating the camera and LIDAR rely on deploying artificial objects, e.g., checkerboard, on the field. Given the impracticality of such solutions, targetless calibration solutions have been proposed over the past years, which require no human intervention and are readily applicable for various autonomous systems, e.g., automotive, drones, rovers, and robots. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we review and analyze several classic targetless calibration schemes. Based on some of their shortcomings, a new multi-feature workflow called MulFEA (Multi-Feature Edge Alignment) is proposed. MulFEA uses the cylindrical projection method to transform the 3D-2D calibration problem into a 2D-2D calibration problem and exploits a variety of LiDAR feature information to supplement the scarce LiDAR point cloud boundaries to achieve higher features similarity compared to camera images. In addition, a feature matching function with a precision factor is designed to improve the smoothness of the objective function solution space and reduce local optima. Our results are validated using the open-source KITTI dataset, and we compare our results with several existing targetless calibration methods. In many different types of roadway environments, our algorithm provides more reliable results regarding the shape of the objective function in the 6-DOF space, which is more conducive for the optimization algorithms to solve. In the end, we also analyze the shortcomings of our proposed solutions and put forward a prospect for future research in the field of joint camera-Lidar calibration algorithms.","sensor fusion; extrinsic calibration; camera-LiDAR system; autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","ADACORSA",""

As the number of flights is expected to increase, the total environmental impact of aviation will continue to worsen. New solutions are required to mitigate these effects. Aircraft Trajectory Optimization For Environmental Impact (TOFEI) can help reduce the impact of aircraft pollutants while also facilitating an increase in the number of flights. Whereas previous studies have shown that TOFEI can be effective in mitigating the footprint of aviation, their scope is limited. An applicable model should include wind, variable Mach number and an appropriate environmental impact metric. This paper presents the Trajectory Optimizer for Environmental Purposes (TOEP), which bridges the existing gap. The approach comprises two models, a genetic algorithm and a direct collocation model. The former finds climate-optimal trajectories using a meta-heuristic search technique, while the latter solves the problem using optimal control in CasADi. As direct collocation provides faster and more accurate results, the genetic algorithm is used to verify the direct collocation model. The algorithm uses the open aircraft performance model OpenAP. Results show that the environmental impact of flights could be reduced by as much as 6.6% when fully optimizing for this metric. The impact differs significantly between short haul flights and long haul flights, with 1.2% environmental cost reduction for the former and 2.7% for the latter. Pareto fronts are utilized to investigate the relationship between operating cost and the environmental cost.","Optimization; Trajectory; Trajectories; Aircraft Trajectory Optimization; Climate Optimization; Environmental Impact; Environmental Optimization; Aviation; Aviation Climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Among these parameters, only temperature is occasionally measured in PV installations, and such monitoring is often external to the module. This limits its use and does not provide accurate information on the conditions at cell level. The integration of different sensors on PV cells can improve the performance of PV devices and enable the early detection of faults and unwanted operating conditions, examples of which are PV-module delamination and the occurrence of hotspots, respectively. This thesis reports on the design, fabrication and testing of four types of sensors, as an initial step within the PVMD group towards sensor integration on PV cells. The devices considered for this work are the following: an aluminum-based resistive temperature sensor, a Boron-doped poly-silicon piezoresistive strain sensor, and two polyimide-functionalized humidity sensors – one capacitive, the other thermoresistive. Furthermore, these devices are combined into multi-sensing platforms with the aim to simultaneously sense sets of parameters (e.g., strain &amp; temperature) to eventually compensate for their reciprocal interference. The results of the electrothermal characterization of the non-laminated temperature and strain sensors reveal an overall linear response of the devices, with an average TCR of around +3.75*10-3 °C-1 and -3.7*10-3 °C-1, respectively; this translates into a change in resistance of approximately 22.2-22.5% over the temperature range under study (30 °C-90 °C). Meanwhile, the characterization with a climate chamber of a fabricated capacitive humidity sensor shows a significant increase in capacitance: when relative humidity changes between 20% and 80% at 30 °C, the measured capacitance rises from 6.86 nF to 7.20 nF – equivalent to a 5% increase. Furthermore, capacitance measurements performed at constant humidity ratio and varying temperatures indicate a substantial cross-sensitivity of the humidity sensor under test, resulting in an approximately linear capacitance increase between 20 °C and 40 °C with an average regression slope of 10 pF/°C. Since the tested capacitive humidity sensor and piezoresistive strain sensor show a substantial response to temperature, temperature compensation is needed to ensure reliable and accurate measurements of both humidity and strain. To this regard, a simplified compensation based on the simultaneous interrogation of the resistive temperature sensor and capacitive humidity sensor is successfully performed, which highlights the importance of integrated multi-sensing platforms.","Sensor; photovoltaic; integrated sensors; Capacitive sensor; humidity; temperature; Strain; Piezoresistive sensor; Thermoresistive sensor; Resistive sensor; Polyimide; L-EDIT; Multi-functional; microfabrication; Lamination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-11","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Innovations consist of numerous environmental, social and financial factors that need to be linked with social and moral values. Towards this direction, the Responsible Innovation (RI) concept has emerged. Although RI is an extensively researched topic, there is a considerable gap between scholars referring to RI and those capturing RI’s institutionalisation in driving organisational change (Genus &amp; Iskandarova, 2018; Yaghmaei, 2018). Therefore, this research seeks to answer the following question: “How effective is the use of Key Performance Indicators for Responsible Innovation in driving organisational change?” This analysis studies eight research (performing or funding) organisations, part of the H2020 Co-Change project, which aims to boost changes in organisational behaviour. Firstly, lab representatives from the studied organisations selected, clustered and weighed the most relevant Key Performance Indicators for their innovation projects. Secondly, participants were asked to measure their selected KPIs over time to assess performance within their labs regarding RI values. Thirdly, between these two rounds of assessment, exploratory, semi-structured interviews were conducted with lab managers and representatives to ask for clarifications behind their choices. Results indicate that anticipation is a highly relevant and desirable aspect in the innovation process that often remains at a theoretical level due to the lack of established, institutionalised activities for innovation processes. Inclusion of diverse stakeholders is essential for balancing all interests. However, it is challenging due to conflicting interests and scarcity of resources, resulting in the under-representation of several societal groups, such as end-users. Reflexivity it is perceived as the most complex dimension. Being utterly objective and putting personal assumptions, motivations or interests aside is challenging. Responsiveness is essential to point out the importance of receiving feedback from society and being attentive to needs regarding innovation (Stilgoe et al., 2013; Kupper et al., 2015). Finally, Openness and Transparency are desirable, but cannot always be possible due to privacy limitations. The main dimensions identified as relevant for the studied labs are diversity, transparency and inclusion in the design processes of the projects. The labs participating in this study benefit from it in various ways; either by small, incremental changes, as a result of gaining learning experience. However, even when no changes occur, the use of RI Key Performance Indicators is considered a helpful reflection tool that can eventually result in actual organisational change. Raising awareness and making researchers reflect on Responsible Innovation’s practices and values through the use of KPIs can eventually become more effective than what can be derived by simply looking at formal assessments, leading to more positive and responsible organisational behaviour. Future research in organisations operating in other industrial sectors, for prolonged periods, with quantitative methods, could be studied and introduced to the KPIs assessment to look for actual changes in organisational performance.","Responsible Innovation; Organisational change; Key Performance Indicators; Ethics; Institutional Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Based on mass, hydrogen contains about three times as much energy as conventional gasoline. However, the volumetric energy density, which is the amount of energy per volume unity, is much lower for hydrogen. Therefore, it needs to be stored either at cryogenic temperatures or at hyperbaric pressure. The most common nominal working pressures (NWP) for hydrogen are either 350 or 700 bar. Because of these excessive pressures, the composite pressure vessels (CPVs) require to become thick-walled. This makes the out-of-plane stress components significant which requires calculation models that consider these effects.<br/><br/>This thesis evaluates, whether the use of tow-preg material, could reduce the amount of material necessary to attain a predefined burst pressure. Currently, the production of CPVs is mainly executed using wet winding. The use of this process results in varying material properties due to differences in fibre volume fraction. Also, the friction coefficient is minimal because the resin has a low tackiness. This friction is required for the production of winding paths, which deviate from the traditional geodesic angle. Alternatively, tow-preg material introduces constant material properties and possibly an elevated friction coefficient. This friction coefficient provides an opportunity to vary the winding angle through the thickness, by which the material strength can be made more uniform in every lamina. However, the challenge during the design and production of CPVs is that several effects are present which alter the mechanical response such as varying stiffness on the dome-cylinder interface, non-geodesic winding angle on the dome and resin-rich areas. This thesis will attempt to describe the mechanical behaviour of the CPV, by including several phenomena in numerical models and to minimise the material usage.","Composite pressure vessel; Hydrogen storage; Design optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-11","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To achieve these goals, three online lock scheduling algorithms are introduced and tested on realistic problem instances. Their run-time is negligible compared to exact methods and the resulting lock schedules are competitive. Assuming a constant lockage duration during scheduling allows the number of interactions to be reduced significantly with a small decrease in lock schedule quality.

Wind- and solar-powered generation is set to become dominant both globally and in the Netherlands. However, integrating additional renewable generation capacity into existing power networks presents a challenge to network operators. Wind and solar generation are characterised by increased variability, causing higher peak loads on power networks. Moreover, the energy transition also increases demand loads through electrification. Combined, these effects are causing power networks in the Netherlands to become congested, limiting the possibilities for integrating more renewable generation capacity into the networks.There are two main ways to reduce congestion: increasing the network capacity or decreasing the network load. The network capacity can be increased by upgrading the grid, which is often expensive and time-consuming. The load on the network can be decreased by curtailment--discarding the excess generation in moments of overload, often resulting in costs for network operators. Another solution would be to shift the transport of excess generation to a moment with sufficient network capacity. Battery systems could provide this function, as they are well-equipped to storing electricity for a short (&lt;24 hours) period.This thesis studies how batteries could provide a solution for integrating additional renewable generation into congested regional networks in the Netherlands. There are different ways to integrate a battery system into the network, and the value the battery system can provide to the network will likely depend on how and where it is integrated. This integration can be defined by two key characteristics: the physical location of the battery's connection to the regional network and the type of renewable generator connected to the battery system and network. The combination of the connection location and the connected renewable generator is called 'system location' in this study, because these combinations of connection and renewable generator are elements that can be found in many power systems.To determine where batteries could provide the most value, the influence of system location on the value a battery system can pose to the regional network operator is researched. The viewpoint of the regional network operator is used for the valuation of the system because the operator is the party that will decide which solution to implement when integrating additional renewable generation. To analyse the influence of system location on the value of the battery system, eight different system locations are studied, with batteries connected to the network either at the site of the renewable generator or at a regional HV/MV substation, combined with four different additional renewable generation scenarios.With assistance from Liander (a DSO), a case study is formulated around substation Waalsprong, which is at risk for congestion in the near future. Two different models are designed to dispatch the battery systems. The first is developed for a battery sized to resolve all projected congestion on the substation. Results demonstrate that to fully solve the projected congestion, large (&gt;25 MWh) volumes of storage capacity are necessary for all system locations. To improve on this large and inefficiently used battery system, a second dispatching model is developed. This model combines battery operations with curtailment and minimises curtailment costs for the network operator over an entire year. The model uses predicted curtailment costs, based on EPEX prices and subsidies. For the case of Waalsprong, the combined battery and curtailment model achieves its goals: curtailment costs are reduced between 65-80\%, depending on the system location. The volume of curtailed electricity is reduced by at least 60\% in every scenario. Additionally, connecting the system at the generator site has resulted in higher battery revenues from charging and discharging. To determine the economic feasibility of the battery systems, a cost-benefit analysis is performed from the perspective of the network operator. Four solutions for integrating additional renewable generation at substation Waalsprong are compared: grid upgrades, curtailment, the large battery solving all congestion and the battery + curtailment system. Results indicate that curtailment is always the least-cost option for Waalsprong, but it should be noted that curtailment is only allowed on a temporary basis under current regulations. Of the other solutions, the battery + curtailment system results in fewer costs for the network operator for all solar generation scenarios. In contrast, for wind or combined wind/solar generation, grid upgrades result in fewer costs. The connection location of the battery system has a limited impact: for the solar scenarios, connecting the system at the generator is slightly advantageous.To put this research into a broader perspective, an analysis was made of stakeholders, regulations and barriers connected to battery systems in the Netherlands. Current regulations ban network operators from owning and operating batteries. Therefore, private parties would have to provide this service to network operators. This shed new light on the influence of system location on battery value: due to high transportation and connection tariffs, private parties operating a battery will always do so at a generator location.Based on the overall research findings, recommendations to the network operator and other stakeholders can be made. First, both the regulator and the network operators should be open to other solutions for congested network areas: this research has shown that for Waalsprong, a battery and curtailment system could result in fewer costs than a network upgrade in some scenarios. Second, a regional tendering system for requesting flexible capacity through long-term contracts should be set up, in which battery operators could participate to deliver flexible capacity to DSOs. Third, DSOs should also consider battery systems as a short-term option, while waiting for network upgrades, as a large share of the Dutch network will need to be upgraded in the coming decades. Finally, the Dutch electricity tariffs are in need of a revision: current tariffs create an unlevel playing field for battery systems. This could be corrected by exempting battery systems from some parts of the transportation tariff.","Battery System; power system; Regional network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, buildings have often unused roofs, which can be converted into sustainable roofing options. Green roofs are systems which allow for the growth of different types of vegetation, mitigating heat and capturing water. Blue roofs are layers for water collection, which provide temporary storage and slow release of rainwater. Yellow roof is another name to indicate roofs with photovoltaic (PV) panels. Some areas of the city may be more subject to flooding and heat. Some buildings may instead receive more solar radiation. Therefore, prioritizing which option to install where may be the key to the success of sustainable roofing placement. In this study, we construct an optimization model that evaluates the benefits of the roofing option in each potential location and chooses the combination of roofs and roofing options which maximizes the total societal benefits. The reduction of flooding and heat risks and the production of clean energy are modeled considering both climate variables and the city’s characteristics. However, the derived data and parameters are uncertain by nature. Climate data is used in ensembles and is integrated into the problem by formulating the model into a stochastic and robust version. We take Schiedam as our case study area and solve the model. We also perform uncertainty analysis, making use of clustering and classification tree regression. This analysis allows to understand which parameters are driving which type of solutions, and to understand how robust the constructed model is. Moreover, we formulate the same problem in the shape of a multi-time step model, where the decision maker can make the optimal placement decision every year. In this case, it is possible to simplify the decision process into a one-branch tree for which we present a methodology. The results show that our model is robust in terms of placement choice when parameters change, and we discover which parameters drive the main variations. The total benefits are instead much more reliant on the uncertainty of the problem.","Green roof; Blue roof; Solar panels; Optimization; Uncertainty Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Runoff is determined using the Soil Conservation Service Curve-Number (SCS-CN) method requiring soil and land-cover maps. Land-cover maps are created for 1986, 2013, and 2020 using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 surface reflectance products. Evapotranspiration is derived from the MODIS evapotranspiration product and precipitation is retrieved from CHIRPS. Results indicate that groundwater recharge decreased by 80% from 1986 to 2020 (124Mm3 to 28.9Mm3) attributed to a loss of permeable land (63 percentage point decrease) and intensification of urbanisation. Domestic and non-domestic groundwater consumption in 2020 is estimated to be 28.4Mm3 and 2.7Mm3 respectively. For 2020, long-term average groundwater recharge (28.9Mm3) is less than the annual abstraction (31.1Mm3) indicating current urbanisation trends are unsustainable for future groundwater availability. Under a ""business as usual"" scenario, population growth presents the largest challenge for the future by causing an estimated four-fold increase in groundwater consumption by 2050. Climate change and land-cover changes under the same scenario may reduce groundwater recharge by 10% and 55% respectively. This requires the implementation of policies to properly manage the groundwater resource, such as promoting low-impact development, monitoring groundwater use, and monitoring changes in the groundwater system. This study should be seen as a preliminary investigation into the components affecting groundwater sustainability. Further research is needed to assess the exact state of the groundwater system and its response to future challenges.<br/><br/>https://code.earthengine.google.com/b4ebac49f28c93a633eb7bd4806f409b (groundwater recharge)<br/>https://code.earthengine.google.com/ad1a0a88240e75e3dd727a6a350edb18 (land cover changes)","Groundwater recharge; Sustainability; Remote Sensing; Google Earth Engine; Groundwater abstraction; Urbanisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","African Water Corridor (AWC) project","6.6666,-1.6163"

(mentor); Morales Napoles, O. (graduation committee); Yang, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Nowadays, one of the main requirements from civil engineering structures is the level of reliability and safety that they must provide to the users. In structural analysis, the exponential application of numerical methods, as the nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA), is due to the increasing growth of computational power. These powerful tools provide the opportunity to study the global behavior of complex systems. The latter is especially relevant for cases where nonlinearities highly impact the performance of the structure. However, to ensure a certain level of safety, the stochastic nature of all the influencing parameters must be accounted for during the analysis and design stages. The latter is precisely the role of Safety Formats: a mathematical procedure to ensure an imposed level of reliability while computing the design resistance of structures. Several existing safety formats have been implemented along with the NLFEA in the structural reliability assessment of reinforced concrete structures. Nonetheless, these formats face some criticism in their usability due to some of the assumptions implied in their derivation. Therefore, Monti et al. (2021) recently proposed a safety format: a new Global Factor Method (GFM) that aims to be applicable in the nonlinear finite element analysis of reinforced concrete structures with concurrent failure mechanisms influencing the global performance at a predefined limit state. In a general description, the method requires the output obtained from two nonlinear finite element analyses and the calculation of a Global Safety Factor related to the resistance of the whole structural system. This thesis aims to provide scenarios to validate the new safety format for its future implementation in codes and the industry since, currently, they are extremely limited. Therefore, the GFM is implemented in three overall case studies with increasing levels of complexity, divided into two reinforced concrete cross-sections, and three simply supported beams. During the case studies, special attention is given to the size of the perturbation (described by the so-called $c$ parameter) that proportionally decreases the basic variables for the second nonlinear analysis. Several Engineer Decision-based Scenarios are applied when choosing the Critical Local Failure Mechanisms and the related basic variables to be perturbed. Finally, it is found that the method provides reliable resistance for structures with a single failure mechanism. However, for structures modelled with continuum elements where two concurrent failure mechanisms lead to global failure, the GFM still needs to be revised to provide more accurate guidelines and reduce the space for decisions made by the analyst that highly impact the performance of the method. These decisions are related to identifying and locating the LFM and their basic variables, selecting the solution strategy implemented in the NLFEA, and choosing a suitable modelling uncertainty. At this point, the application of the method demands an experienced analyst and several parametric studies regarding all those decisions, which reduces its efficiency in terms of engineering and computational time.","Structural Reliability Analysis, Safety Format, Global Factor Method, Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis, NLFEA, Reinforced concrete, Concurrent failure mechanisms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Gbps data rates, minimal latency, and good connectivity are the ultimate aims of 5G. To achieve them, 5G systems employ the mm-Wave frequency band which has a frequency range above 24GHz and so allows for higher bandwidth and gigabit wireless services. Because the size of the antenna elements and their spacings are so small in mm-Wave, massive antenna arrays in the base station may fit into a smaller area while yet providing high gain. However, the problem with the mm-Wave integrated antenna array system is the excessive heat generated per unit volume as there is not enough surface area to dissipate heat. Thermal management of the antenna system is very important as it affects the reliability and lifetime of the electronic components in the system. Both active and passive cooling strategies have been employed with passive cooling being the cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. Heatsink antennas can enhance the cooling capacity by providing dual functionality in terms of both thermal and electromagnetics. Traditionally, most of the works on heatsink antennas are focused at lower frequencies and a few at the mm-Wave frequency range. However, proper mm-wave thermal modeling in active integrated antennas is missing and there isn’t any research on the performance of heatsink antennas in array designs. This thesis work aims in designing and optimizing a heatsink antenna operating at 28 GHz to achieve dual functionality. The second aim of the thesis is to develop an appropriate thermal model for the designed antenna. Following the conduction-based simulations depending on assumed heat transfer coefficients, proper thermal modeling with appropriate beamformer chip characteristics and a CFD-based natural convective simulation setup has been developed without the assumption of a heat transfer coefficient. Optimal heatsink antenna dimensions are chosen based on the electro-thermal performance. Then, the selected antenna has been used in 1D and 2D arrays. Finally, a comparison study has been made with that of the conventional patch antenna. The results obtained have shown that both 1D (1x8) and 2D (4x4) heatsink antenna arrays can achieve a better heat dissipation by lowering the junction temperature of about 10-20 degrees Celsius (for the investigated cases) with higher realized gain and similar side lobe level compared to the respective patch antenna arrays. Furthermore, amplitude tapering of the heatsink antenna array achieved lower sidelobe levels which make this heatsink antenna a low-sidelobe and low-temperature alternative for the patch antenna array.","mm-Wave Antenna; Thermal Management; Heatsink Antenna Array; Low Sidelobe; Low Temperature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Examples of such damages are missing elements, deformation, and the loss of joint filling. However, little is known about the exact consequences of those damages. Therefore, when damage is observed during an inspection, it is estimated based upon experience what the possible consequences are. If the consequences are misjudged, this will lead to inefficient maintenance. <br/>Better insight into the exact consequences of damages will expand the possibilities of how risk-based maintenance can be used to maintain revetments. Consequentially, maintenance interventions can be planned more efficiently, reducing the societal costs incurred due to inefficient maintenance. This study contributes to this topic by investigating whether it is possible to estimate the impact of damages on the stability and reliability of a revetment using a model.<br/>Within the study, first, damages are analyzed based upon a literature review. Next, data of old flume experiments with Basalton and basalt revetments are analyzed to study and quantify damages. This analysis focuses on the uplift of elements, deformation around the wave impact zone (S-profile), and washed-out joint filling. Then, a finite element model (FE-model) is created to simulate the wave impact on pattern-placed revetments. The main focus of the FE-model is to study the uncertainty due to structural changes, which are the damages. The damages quantified during the analysis of the flume experiments are also included in order to be able to assess damaged revetments. Finally, the study uses the FE-model within a sensitivity analysis to study the most important uncertain parameters. Based on the samples used in the sensitivity analysis, response surfaces are fitted to obtain a model that can predict the damage for any set of parameters. Finally, these models are demonstrated in a case study of a coastal dike near Den Helder. An increase of 10 – 100 times of the failure probability has been observed for small deformations, while for medium to large deformations, the failure probability increased by 1000 – 10000 times. For no joint filling or a missing element, the failure probability increased by 10 - 100 times.<br/>This study showed that it is possible to create a finite element model that can estimate the impact damage has on the stability and reliability of a pattern-placed revetment. The obtained results can be used within the daily practise as part of risk-based maintenance as the study provides a way to obtain a first indication of the impact of missing elements, deformation, and washed-out joint filling. Additionally, the developed methodology can be used to obtain the impact of other types of damage. Although Basalton is the primarily investigated type of top layer, analysis of the flume experiments showed that basalt revetments are subject to identical types of damage. Therefore, it is expected that the findings within this study can be applied to a broader range of top layer elements with similar characteristics to Basalton (e.g. basalt, C-Star, and Hydroblocks).<br","pattern-placed revetments; revetments; damage; finite element model; basalton; basalt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

To tackle this, we propose multi-objective reinforced active learning (MORAL), a novel framework based on inverse reinforcement learning for combining a diverse set of human norms into a single Pareto optimal policy. We show that through the combination of active preference learning and multi-objective decision-making, one can interactively train an agent to trade off a variety of learned norms as well as primary reward functions, thus mitigating negative side effects. Furthermore, we introduce two toy environments called Burning Warehouse and Delivery, which allow for studying the scalability of our approach in both size of the state space and reward complexity. We find that through mixing expert demonstrations and preferences, we can achieve superior efficiency compared to employing a single type of expert feedback and, finally, suggest that unlike previous literature, MORAL is able to learn a deep reward model consisting of multiple expert utility functions.","Active Learning; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Multi-Objective Decision-Making; Value Alignment; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); Kamper, Suuz (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","Wind turbine blades are composed of complex composite material structures that are difficult to recycle at the end of their operational lifetime. As such, they are oftentimes landfilled or incinerated. Following the Circular Economy principles, there are a multitude of strategies that may be applied to these structures; these range from more to less desirable, where landfill and incineration are categorised as least desirable. In the ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reach agreed upon climate goals, the implementation of wind power plays a central role in the Netherlands, and hence the number of end-of-life wind turbine blades will significantly increase in the coming decades. In an attempt to better manage this issue, the creation of a central circular hub as treatment facility for these end-of-life blades has been suggested. Hence, a framework is developed to compare ports with regard to their suitability for the development of a circular wind hub. The framework is based on six categories: port willingness, available space, existing companies and infrastructure, accessibility, focus on circular strategies, and centrality with respect to return volumes. Subsequently, different ports in the Netherlands are compared for the establishment of a circular wind hub. The Port of Den Helder and Port of Amsterdam come forward as most suitable locations, with a strong willingness and being most centrally located. However, it is also highlighted that the hub need not be limited to one single location - in fact, it could be valuable to collaborate and create synergies across ports. Additionally, interregional collaboration with neighbouring countries of the Netherlands – Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium – will help to improve the economic viability of such a hub. This research therefore performs a geographical explicit quantification of the availability of end-of-life wind turbine blades in this region between 2020-2050, and places the results in the context of three circular strategies based on reusing, repurposing and recycling the blades, respectively. This is done through the use of a dynamic Material Flow Analysis and the use of a Geographic Information System. The results indicate a clear increase in end-of-life wind turbine blades in the defined region until 2050, reaching a cumulative amount of 690 kilotonnes by 2050. Application of the circular strategies strongly influences the amount of material for which it is economically viable to be treated in the hub. In all cases, this is significantly lower than the total amount of material in the region. Among the three strategies, reusing the blades results in the highest amount of material treated, energy saved and economic benefits realised. However, the potential market size seems largest for recycling the blades and smallest for reusing them; hence regulation for this disparity is called for. Furthermore, a push is needed for the viable volumes under application of the circular strategies to better approach the total volume in the region. To accomplish this, it is imperative that the economic value of the secondary material be increased, as well as the documentation of wind turbine blades and transparency in the value chain be improved. All in all, this research expresses the urgency, feasibility and potential value of the development of a circular wind hub for end-of-life wind turbine blades in the Netherlands.","end-of-life; Wind turbine blades; Circular Economy; Circular Hub; Material Flow Analysis; Geographic Information Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

One type of analysis is remotely piloted scaled flight tests. One of the aspects that can be analyzed through remotely piloted scaled flight tests is the dynamic behavior of the aircraft. This thesis shows a method to determine the lateral-directional stability and controllability of a remotely piloted scaled flight model. The objective of this research is to show a method to determine the lateral-directional stability and controllability of a remotely piloted aircraft. The aircraft used to demonstrate the method is the X-UAV Skysurfer X8. This aircraft is equipped with a Pixhawk 4 flight controller running a custom version of the PX4 software stack. The Pixhawk 4 records measurements of many different sensors as well as the control inputs given to the servos. From the acquired data a linearized state space model for lateral-directional stability and controllability is created through the optimization of a cost function depending on the difference between the estimated model and the measurements. From the optimized state space system the lateral-directional handling characteristics are determined from an eigenvalue analysis. The results show that the aircraft as configured during the flight test has an unstable spiral mode, damped Dutch roll mode and a highly damped roll subsidence mode. The results for the lateral-directional dynamics are analyzed further according to military specification MIL-HDBK-1797. This analysis shows the aircraft has level 3 behavior with respect to the spiral mode, meaning constant attention is required from the pilot if no control augmentation system is used, but it is still controllable. The roll subsidence and Dutch roll mode are of level 1 which is considered satisfactory behavior. The roll performance of the aircraft is of level 2, meaning it is acceptable behavior.","Flight Testing; Flight characteristics; UAV; lateral-directional stability and control; Flight Data Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Due to the inaccuracy of the weather hindcasts, the accuracy of these machine learning techniques is not satisfactory for Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) which is the company for which this study is performed. Since the vessel motions are a direct result of the meteorological conditions an approach is investigated in this research to replace the meteorological data by motion data to train a machine learning algorithm and obtain accurate results. The vessel motions are captured by a motion sensor on board the vessel. Multiple machine learning techniques were tested in this research. The data used to train the best performing learning algorithm represent the motions by the first and second moment of the nonderivative motion and the second moment of the first derived motion. These moments are obtained from the motion distributions of a time window of 5 minutes. The obtained best parameters for representing the motions were obtained by testing if a spectrum must be provided, how many motion derivatives are required, which moments are needed and how large the time window must be. Although the accuracy of the developed learning algorithm is determined as satisfied no digital twin could be made and tested. Unfortunately, due to the limited amount of data available no separate algorithm could be made which uses the Extra Tree learning, as digital twin base, to determine the overconsumption of the vessel. Only data from one voyage was available. All this data was used to train the learning algorithm to have as much variance as possible in the data set such that a good learning algorithm could be developed.","Machine Learning; Ship performance monitoring; Supervised Learning; fuel consumption; Energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","","",""

While a number of papers have been researching this vehicle routing problem (VRP) in order to minimise costs, fuel consumption or another metric, most research uses deterministic input data. However, sudden changes are inevitable, disrupting the resulting schedule. In this paper, we propose both a strategic model and a tactical model for airport surface movement, taking into account stochastic delays to the flight schedule. The subsequent tactical schedule can be produced with only little deviations from the strategic schedule. The tactical model can be generated in the order of seconds, making it useful for real-life traffic management decision support systems. We found that the tactical schedule does not worsen remarkably. Still 47.9% of the flights can be towed by a TaxiBot, which was 48.5% in the strategic schedule. Different case studies have been performed in order to determine the effect of e.g. the size of the flight schedule and the number of TaxiBots used, on the aircraft taxiing coverage and TaxiBot efficiency. With this, both busy and calm days, now and in the near future are assessed and the optimum number of TaxiBots necessary can be determined. An upper limit is reached at an asymptote starting from 34 TaxiBots, while a lower limit is dependent on a trade-off between flight coverage and spare TaxiBot capacity.","Electric Taxiing Systems; TaxiBot; Vehicle Routing Problem; Fleet Scheduling Assignment; Greedy Approach; Dynamic & Stochastic; Disruption Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, PV installations require extensive resources for their development and construction, so it is essential that the efficiency of energy conversion is high. A very important factor to ensure PV system efficiency is the use of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). MPPT controls the system's operating point so that at each instance power drawn from a PV module or array is the maximum power available. This is realised by employing a DC-DC converter controlled by an MPPT algorithm. The most widely used algorithm due to its simplicity and cost of implementation is the Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) algorithm. However, its performance is not ideal in both steady-state and dynamic conditions. The algorithm's operation depends on the P&amp;O parameters and conditions in which the algorithm operates are influenced by irradiance variability.<br/>There are several studies on P&amp;O algorithm efficiency and irradiance variability separately, however, a link between these two topics has not been explored. Thus, this thesis aims to bridge the gap and its purpose is to determine the relationship between P&amp;O algorithm efficiency and irradiance variability. This was carried out by use of real 3-second irradiance data from Oahu, Hawaii, modelling the power output of a PV module and obtaining the operating point of the system by implementing a P&amp;O algorithm without assuming any physical properties of a DC-DC converter. Then using operating point and maximum power point power values, 3 s averages of the P&amp;O algorithm efficiency were computed, and variability metrics were calculated using the original irradiance data. Finally, an exploratory analysis of the prepared dataset was performed to determine how the P&amp;O algorithm varies when exposed to different irradiance variability. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was deemed necessary to examine efficiency dependence on P&amp;O algorithm parameters - sampling interval and perturbation amplitude - in different cases of irradiance variability.<br/><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align:justify"">The results of this research have shown variations of P&amp;O efficiency values on different time scales as well as in different variability conditions. Each day of the year was classified by occurring irradiance variability. It was confirmed that efficiency depends on the variability class of the day with the lowest efficiencies down to 99.8 % found for highly variable days. Monthly P&amp;O efficiency was determined to be affected by the number of days from each class. P&amp;O efficiency was highest when the least days in the month were classified as highly variable. Monthly efficiencies were found to be above 99.9 %. To describe the relationship between variability and P&amp;O efficiency, variability metrics were selected and computed for 1 min periods. Major scattering of data was found when 1 min averaged efficiency was plotted against any of the variability metrics. Magnitudes of 1 min average efficiency were determined to be mostly above 95 %. To reduce scattering, average efficiencies that could be expected in bins of variability metrics were determined, and in such a case, a general decrease in efficiency was observed with increasing magnitudes of variability metrics. Additionally, polynomial fits through the data were produced to provide functions with which P&amp;O efficiency could be approximated when variability described by a metric is known. Lastly, P&amp;O efficiency sensitivity to its parameters study has shown that in most cases efficiency is more sensitive to perturbation amplitude, however, in high variability, sampling interval and perturbation amplitude must be sufficiently small (ΔV≤1% of V<sub>oc(STC)</sub>, T<sub>a</sub>≤10 ms) for better performance of the algorithm.","MPPT; irradiance variability; P&O algorithm; efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Sorting processes can cause a coarsening of the bed surface and influence the formation of aeolian ripples. However, it is not fully understood what influence sorting processes have on the magnitude of this transport. In this study, sorting processes of different grain sizes when interacting with wind and their influence on the magnitude of aeolian transport are investigated by performing a tracer study and developing a conceptual model. Sand grains were painted in different colors according to particle size and placed on Noordwijk beach, Netherlands. Several experiments were conducted with varying wind speeds. Surface sampling and cameras tracked the sand color movement on the bed surface, and wind speed and direction were measured. The tracer experiments show that for moderate wind conditions, ripples developed. Once the ripples have formed, the supply of finer tracer grains in downwind direction decreased over time, while the supply of coarser grains remained constant. A strong linear relationship between ripple speed and wind speed was found. For higher wind velocities, no ripples or differences in transport of grain size fractions were observed. Alternating phases of erosion and deposition of upwind sand were observed which could not be related to local variations in wind speed. Based on these results and literature, a conceptual model for an Active Bed Surface Layer (ABSL) with two regimes corresponding to moderate (I), and high (II) wind speeds was developed. The concept enables to estimate the magnitude of aeolian sediment transport as a function of wind speed, bed characteristics, and upwind sediment supply. For Regime I, a linear relationship between sediment transport and wind speed is suggested and for Regime II a third power relationship in combination with a process-based model accounting for supply limitations is suggested.","Aeolian sediment transport; Supply limited; Sediment sorting; Armoring; Aeolian ripples; Tracers; Field measurements; Conceptual model; Beach","en","master thesis","","","","","","The main body of this thesis (Part I: Paper) is provided in paper format with the aim to publish it in the Special Issue in Earth Surface Processes and Landforms “Coastal dunes: links between aeolian processes and landform dynamics”.

It proposes an integrated system of predictive model powered by machine learning algorithm and exact optimization model such that it is distinct from most existing literatures in this domain. The uncertainty of truck arrival time is captured as presence probability by the developed predictive model. Subsequently, a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) is built to solve the Probabilistic Slot Rescheduling Problem (P-SRP) in which the rescheduling is subject to expected value constraint that incorporates the presence probability of incoming trucks. The objective is to minimize the expected cost of rescheduling that would lead to more efficient and robust operation.

Moreover, adding real-time elements enhances the prediction result by 20%. In regard to optimization model, the P-SRP model results on expected cost that is 42% lower than the P-SRP model. Numerical experiment based on multiple scenarios indicates that the proposed solution yields optimal added values in situation characterized by high number of reschedule being required, large scale of operation in terms of quantity of loading bay and utilization rate, the priority is to maintain initial schedule, and there is no stand-in loading bay available. Lastly, it is found that increasing operational efficiency comes at the expense of the schedule robustness, although the value is negligible.

Indicators for CE play a key role in this transition, enabling the measurement and control of this development. However, the scattered landscape of micro level CE indicators, which varies in purpose and scope, and their ambiguity in measuring environmental and social impact, complicates this transition. Circular consultants are being faced with these challenges when advising the right CE indicator to companies.<br/>This study aims to provide CE consultants the tools to find an indicator that measures CE holistically and that fit their client’s profile. A literature review and interviews with 5 different circular consultants shows that many CE indicators are focused on material efficiency, leaving out aspects that are key for measuring environmental impact such as emissions and pollution. Additionally, social aspects are often not included in CE indicators even though the social dimension of CE is crucial for reaching a sustainable industry. At last, the literature review shows that CE indicators differ in characteristics such as purpose (such as learning or decision-making), their maturity in CE (from beginner to advanced), and data requirements.<br/>Insights from the literature review and from the five interviews with different circular consultants, have led to the development of three tools: a checklist of sub-indicators for CE indicators to analyse their contribution to measuring environmental impact, a checklist of social indicators that are relevant for CE, and a framework to categorize CE indicators on six categories: measurement level, purposes of measuring, company’s maturity in CE, life cycle focus, ease of application and data requirements. The checklist for environmental impact and the categorization framework are applied to five CE indicators chosen from literature. The checklist provides an overview of sub-indicators present and missing in the CE indicators of analysis. Additionally, the sub-indicators in the checklist is translated into a questionnaire for a hypothetical company, to check its practicality. The framework shows that there are notable differences between the five CE indicators: in their purpose, life cycle focus, data requirements and ease of application.<br/>Further work is required to investigate the tension between the CE indicator checklist for environmental impact and the ability of organizations to pick and choose CE indicators – which can be financially driven. Secondly, future case studies could help validate the effectiveness of the indicator checklist for environmental impact and the framework in assisting circular consultants in choosing a suitable and holistic CE indicator for a manufacturing company.","Circular economy (CE); Circular indicators; Circular Business Model; sustainability indicators; social indicators; environmental indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://lnkd.in/d2HYgY4 The author published blog under the wing of Circle Economy, related to this master thesis research.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

There are several concepts that affect the performance of SMEs. One is ambidexterity, which refers to the balance of activities for explorative and exploitative innovation. Another concept is diversity which encompasses differences in gender, age, cultural and functional backgrounds. Ambidexterity and diversity might be related as diversity influences the activities for explorative and exploitative innovation. It has been argued that successful organizations need to be ambidextrous. The relationship between a diverse middle management team (MMT) and top management team (TMT) might affect the organizational ambidexterity. This impact has not been fully explored within SMEs. The purpose of this research is to identify how diverse management teams can impact organizational ambidexterity. An exploratory approach was used to get a deep understanding and to answer the research question. First, a literature review was conducted to explore key concepts related to organizational ambidexterity and to identify diversity characteristics that might impact the relationship between MMT and TMT, affecting the organizational ambidexterity. Thereafter, semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of the management team of Feedbackly to answer the research questions. This research found that diverse management teams have a direct impact in organizational ambidexterity by providing a pool of resources, increasing the expertise, knowledge, and capabilities of the organization. Nevertheless, complexity in managing diverse teams increases, as potential barriers might appear, hindering the relationship between the two levels of the management team. Additionally, organizations might struggle to recognize diversity as way to acquire additional resources, and it is often difficult to take advantage of the benefits of diversity in turning the organization ambidextrous.","Organizational Ambidexterity; Diversity; SMEs; Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Mehta, M.K. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The largescale installation of wind energy will provide challenges, such as maintaining a stable grid, security of supply, and profitability of renewables. The unpredictable nature of wind energy will cause more imbalances between generation and consumption to occur, consequently increasing the demand for the balancing energy reserves that ensure the grid’s stability. The intermittent nature of wind energy necessitates the ability to time shift energy production from high to low periods of wind energy availability to retain the security of supply. Furthermore, generators can face imbalance costs due to errors in wind energy generation forecasts. They are already being confronted with the declining value of wind energy in energy systems with a high share of renewables. Storage capacity is widely perceived as a technologically possible solution to alleviate these issues. Additionally, storage capacity can be a carbon neutral alternative to the traditional power plants that currently provide the required flexible generation and balancing energy. However, the lack of economic benefits is the missing link between the technical benefits and mass implementation of storage capacity.<br/><br/>This study explores whether operating storage, collocated with a utility scale wind power plant, can solve these challenges while improving the bottom line for operators. Spot market arbitrage, providing balancing energy through the automatic frequency restoration reserve, and generator imbalance cost reduction are identified as possible strategies for operating storage that can add value whilst also alleviating the identified issues. Furthermore, this study explores if arguments for co locating storage with wind energy to form hybrid wind and storage power plants exist or if the business case for operating storage is independent of being collocated.<br/><br/> It was found that an 8-hour battery performs best when undertaking spot market arbitrage. Still, even with a perfect market forecast and no storage degradation costs, it will need at least a 65% decrease from current Li-ion storage costs to become profitable. The 8-hour battery outperforms the higher power batteries because the low volatility of the spot market doesn’t warrant the higher costs of 1 and 4-hour batteries. Additionally, it was found that providing non-contracted balancing energy to the grid with a 1-hour battery provides a potential 5-fold increase in profitability compared to having no co-located storage. However, the sensitivity analysis to storage degradation costs ultimately makes the case less profitable compared to having no co-located storage. The lower sensitivity to degradation costs of the 8-hour battery cause it to outperform the 1 and 4-hour batteries. Providing contracted balancing energy showed less potential than non-contracted balancing energy before the sensitivity analysis. However, the contracted balancing energy scenario is less sensitive to storage degradation costs. It was found that a 4-hour battery providing contracted balancing energy performed best. However, this strategy was ultimately 20% less profitable compared to not operating co-located storage. Furthermore, the results of the proposed strategies turned out to be independent of the storage being co-located. Therefore, no strong arguments for collocating storage could be made here.<br/><br/>The business case for storage, as put forth in this project, might not exist today. However, strong clues exist that it will in the future. The predicted drop in costs of storage and the increased volatility in electricity markets will provide opportunities for the profitable operation of storage systems. When that time comes WPP operators should also be interested to operate these storage systems to further their goal of competing with traditional fossil-fuel-fired power plants.<br","Storage; Electricity Markets; Frequency Support; Wind Energy; Arbitrage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The axial stress-strain response predicted by the novel model is consistent with current DDD data. The evolution equation of source height fails in capturing the evolution in accordance with DDD data, which originates from the inaccuracy brought by indirect extraction of source shape from DDD dislocation networks.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">One of the preferred features of plastic is its high durability. This merit is its main disadvantage in the natural environment. When poorly disposed of, plastic waste can enter rivers from surface waters and subsequently end up in the ocean. Here, plastic spreads out over the entire ocean and ultimately ends in ocean gyres. Plastic material in the ocean causes environmental damage. Marine animals can get entangled in plastic debris, plastic accumulation occurs when consuming seafood and the material spreads toxins in the seawater. It has also caused economic damage: marine plastic accumulation led to €5 to 18 billion to key economic sectors for 87 coastal countries in 2020 (Deloitte, 2021). Attempts have been made to capture buoyant plastics from the ocean with interception devices, with mixed success.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The placement of an interception device in a river is thought to be a better approach to the problem. A standard interception design is that of a floating boom. Plastic debris is transported by the river flow and these objects guide buoyant plastics into a collection tray. Currently, these interception designs are still in their infancy. A difficulty in the optimisation of these interception devices lies in the limited knowledge of the trajectories of plastic waste. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling can help to create a better understanding of these aspects. This tool can provide a rapid assessment of different flow conditions with different types of plastic debris modelled. Further knowledge into this field can ultimately help into better retention of plastics in rivers.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Plastic modelling for buoyant particles has been performed in the marine environment (Van Utenhove, 2019) and in the river (Van Welsenes, 2019) with a Lagrangian study. However, both works did not perform a validation study. The combination of a CFD model and the results of physical model tests can be valuable in removing uncertainties related to plastic trajectories and the modelling of these.  One physical model test performed on plastics is the release of plastic particles in a flume (Zaat, 2020) Small films were released in a 2DV physical model, representing plastic bags. It was found that these particles followed an inverted Rouse profile for spherical particles times a shape factor.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The study by Zaat (2020) was replicated in the CFD modelling environment of OpenFOAM in this thesis. Subsequently, the retention of plastic particles was investigated. Three hydrodynamic conditions were investigated, with uniform inlet flow velocities of 0.10, 0.55 and 0.90 m/s. The $k-\epsilon$ turbulence model was used. An Euler-Euler approach was applied with a discrete and continuous phase. This modelling approach is computationally less expensive compared to a Euler-Lagrangian framework and can be easily established for different cases. The drag models Gibilaro, Wen-Yu and Syamlal-O'Brien were tested to investigate which concentration profile best fits an inverted Rouse profile for rising particles. The interception device was modelled as a square obstruction of 10\% of the water depth and the model was assumed as a rigid-lid. The retention of particles by the system was explored for neutrally buoyant particles, light material and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) films.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">This study found relative differences in near-surface flow and the analytical approach of 3 to 4%. The Gibilaro model was best applicable and model coefficients for the virtual mass, lift and turbulent dispersion of 0.5, 1.6 and 1.0 were found. The concentration profiles followed the inverted Rouse profile and that for films closely for the medium and high flow cases, but not for the low flow case. A lower retention of plastics was observed for increasing flow velocities. In the extreme case of low flow and light particles a build-up of particles near-surface can be observed and runs against the streamwise direction. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Several limitations were present in this study. Only two parameters of the plastic particles were adjustable, which were the particle diameter and density. In reality, plastic debris has different shapes will experience drag differently, especially the friction drag. The rigid-lid model is valid only if the velocity head is smaller than that of 10% of the water depth, which is not the case for the high flow velocity case.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The results show that on the basis of a rise velocity and a density a representative diameter can be determined from Stokes’ law. The Euler-Euler modelling approach provides an accurate assessment and gives a proper representation of the particles for the Rouse distributions. This is done without handling the particles individually and thus results can be found more quickly. Both for HDPE and PP inverted Rouse profiles were found that followed the theoretical profile with an underestimation of 10\%-20\% near-surface. The retention was influenced mainly by the size of the wake. It is evident that the interception system can work for buoyant particles. The object can be placed during low flow conditions for the highest efficiency. For high discharge in rivers, more particles will be in suspension and thus further away from the water surface, which makes this design less preferred during high flow conditions.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""> </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Recommendations for further research are to perform more physical model tests, implement a non-spherical drag model applicable for plastic material and to apply a three-phase model.

It is only possible to expand the complexity of the CFD model with a larger availability of these physical model tests.","plastic; CFD; modelling; turbulent channel flow; Rouse profile; Euler; OpenFOAM; rigid-lid; k-epsilon; equilibrium; Sediment; plastic films; plastic interception; interception device; retention; Gibilaro; drag model; Law of the wall; Log-law","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their importance, not all of these structures are very well maintained, especially the older ones. Each municipality has their own maintenance regime, depending on the allocated budget. Deficient quay wall management of a few municipalities in the Netherlands resulted already in several quay wall failures, but there are also a lot of those structures still in a good condition. The differences in quay wall compositions and internal force transfer mechanisms could be one of the reasons why some structures do not show signs of deterioration where others are in a very deteriorated state. This hypothesis is the starting point for the following research question: “What is the influence of structural deficiencies to the overall strength and stability of a wooden foundation system under a quay wall structure?”. The geotechnical and material resistances of the quay wall elements are used as a basis for the study to the influence of quay wall defects on the internal force transfer mechanisms. Five quay wall structures with different geometries in Rotterdam and The Hague are selected for the structural calculations. With the help of assessment reports, a few common defects are chosen which are likely to occur for these kind of structures. First, the displacements and internal forces of the pile cap beam in the middle cross-section are calculated when the structure shows no signs of structural declination. The obtained results are then compared with the same base quantities where one of the structural defects is applied. In this way, the effect of each defect can be determined. Although there are large differences between the composition of the various quay wall structures, a general conclusion can be drawn from the performed calculations. A larger number of piles under a quay wall structure has a positive influence on the redistribution of internal forces from a weakened spot to an unaffected part of the structure.","Quay walls; Masonry; Timber; Pile foundation; Finite Element Analysis; Structural defects; Rotterdam; The Hague","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Nowadays, the performance of turbochargers is tested using hot gas stands. These hot gas stands are expensive. The application of an externally coupled e-motor to the turbocharger eliminates the need for a hot gas burner - significantly reducing the cost. However, the validation range with electric motors is limited. Therefore, it is investigated if the circulation of the compressor outlet flow provides additional shaft power by the turbine. Thereby it would be possible to generate a bigger range of compressor performance maps in terms of power and rotational speed with a limited electric motor. <br/>In the first part of the study the test setup is designed. The original e-turbo hardware was not available. Therefore a test setup is designed with a relatively high power output but low maximum speed electric motor. The principle of range extension will be proven in the lower speed range. The test setup will be used in two configurations. One where the compressor is only powered using the electric motor and the other where the electric motor and turbine will power the compressor. For both configuration the input of the electric motor is kept constant in order to validate if by adding the turbine a shift can be measured in the operating points. <br/>In the second part, a performance expectation model is set up. The existing compressor map, turbine map and electric motor characteristics are used to determine which operating point can be validated. When the available electric motor and turbine power and torque are higher as the compressor values, an operating point is considered in reach. The model outcome is a compressor map that indicated which operation points can be reached with only the electric motor and with the combination of the electric motor and the turbine.<br/>The result of the model shows that the outlet flow in both configurations always remains above 1 bar and 0 oC. This means that no freezing gas is expected to be generated. Furthermore, the model shows that for a selected operating point it is possible, depending on the flow control, to push the operating point to a higher rotational speed or mass flow value. <br/>The aim of the research was to use an alternative method to validate the compressor of the turbocharger whereby validation range could be extended by means of energy recovery with the turbine. This study shows a test setup design and a performance prediction model that shows that it is possible to eliminate the use of a hot gas burner for compressor validation and use an electric motor together with the turbine to extend the validation range in a compressor map. However, within the time frame of this study, no physical test was performed due to the unavailability of different electric motors. Nevertheless, this study shows the potential for an alternative way of compressor wheel validation for turbochargers and contributes to the development of the electric assisted turbocharger.<br/><br","E-turbo Validation; Turbocharger validation; Turbocharger Test stand; Electric assisted turbocharger test stand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

By doing this, the farmers are able to make these animals leave the area without killing them. This results in elephants walking around with bullets inside their body and wounds that need to be looked after. Traditional methods for bullet removal are not allowed in Myanmar as the government does not allow surgery on these government-owned animals.<br/>Method <br/>A set of requirements was determined based on a case research provided by a veterinarian. It was determined that a gripper needed to be designed that is able to reach down a 1 m deep fistula with a diameter of 8 mm. The gripper has to be able to provide visual assistance and rinse the fistula during the procedure. The focus of this research was placed on the gripper head, as there are already flexible and steerable shafts designed. The best gripper was to be determined by a pulling test where the maximum pulling force was measured. Another important requirement was the versatility of the gripper. The shape and size are not 100\% certain so the gripper must be able to grasp multiple bullet shapes. \newline Results The important requirements were met in the final design. For the test phase, multiple prototypes were made with slight alterations in the design. Force measurements determined a higher pulling force on an 8 mm spherical bullet with 4 arms (Median= 16.59 N, IQR= 4.7) than with 3 arms (Median= 13.07 N, IQR= 2.3). The pulling force on that bullet was highest with a tip length of 3 mm (Median= 17.49 N, IQR= 2.9). The final design was used in a gelatin 'phantom' to show its usefulness in a more realistic setting. The gripper was able to remove the bullet five out of five times. <br/>Conclusion <br/>The 4 armed 3 mm tipped gripper is able to travel through the bullet wound without creating new holes and able to grasp and retract from the wound with the dexterity of a veterinarian.","elephant; bullet; removal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

This research takes improving the bicycle supply chain within the Netherlands armed Forces as a use case. Aside from the goals for the use case of bicycles, the aim was also to fill the knowledge gap of analyzing an intra-organizational, multi-structural supply chain system, from the perspective of viewing an organization as a collection of business processes. The method used to fill the knowledge gap and gain an answer on the research question is Agent-Based Modelling, combined with an exploration approach using the Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) workbench. The results show that If the processes are not aligned at every decision made by agents, extra variance and unpredictability in the behavior is seen. Both predictive replacements and willingness to share information were promising policies, but do require a trade-off. The uncertainty in demand and supply also greatly influenced the effort required of the different agents. Choices have to be made in what found important within the supply chain. One must also take into account the long term visions of Defense with regards to the goals of the organization as a whole. The used simulation methodology in this research is a novel approach to investigate complex but practical problems occurring within Defense’s processes. Recommendations to overcome hurdles in practical research are, establishing a clear pragmatic goal and exploring all the processes involved before implementing a simulation model or looking to explain quantified performance indicators. Analyzing the intra-organizational supply chain within Defense showed that in general, intra-organizational supply chain research would benefit from a more process oriented perspective. Generalizing of the results goes as far as goods that have the same classification. Limitations of this research consist of three points: Effort as KPI, run time and extrapolation. Further research might investigate the possibility of extrapolation, extended geographical structure within the model and expansion of uncertainty considerations.","intra-organizational; supply chain; multi-structural; Agent-based modeling; business process simulation; exploratory modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The increasing costs and stable R&amp;D outputs jeopardise the industry’s economic health, drug innovation, and the accessibility and affordability of medicines. The pharmaceutical R&amp;D productivity problem is expected to be diminished due to biotechnological breakthroughs and the emergence of biotechnology firms. As a result, significant public and private investments and policy measures are aimed at stimulating the development of the biotechnology sector. In addition, firms in the pharmaceutical industry are adopting organisational strategies to mimic biotechnology companies. However, based on previous studies, the measures to stimulate the development of the biotechnology sector are not justified. Empirical evidence on the impact of the biotechnology revolution on pharmaceutical R&amp;D productivity is limited and contradicting. Therefore, it is important for improving pharmaceutical R&amp;D productivity to grasp biotechnology firms’ current and future contributions to R&amp;D productivity. <br/><br/>This research analysed to what extent disruption of the pharmaceutical industry by biotechnology firms can reduce its R&amp;D productivity decline. First, I assessed the current contribution of biotechnology firms to pharmaceutical R&amp;D productivity. For every drug approved by the FDA between 2008 and 2015, I quantitatively analysed the relationship between biotechnological organisational characteristics and three determinants of R&amp;D productivity: the commercial success, innovativeness and medical importance of the new drug. Second, I examined whether biotechnology firms disrupt the pharmaceuticals market via new-market disruption. I empirically tested for the presence of elements of the concept of new-market disruption using statistical tests.<br/><br/>From this research, I concluded that disruption by biotechnology firms does not and will not reduce the pharmaceutical R&amp;D productivity decline. Instead, the development of new biotechnology firms likely has an adverse impact on R&amp;D productivity. Moreover, new-market disruption in the drug industry is improbable to occur and will not provide the drastic reform the pharmaceutical industry needs to improve its R&amp;D productivity.","R&D productivity; disruptive innovation; biotechnology; pharmaceutical industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The costs of launching payloads to space can be significantly reduced when the launching vehicles are reusable. The two-stage-to-orbit system with a winged, reusable first stage vehicle, is deemed to offer benefits in terms of operations, as it can take-off and land from a runway. <br/>Dawn Aerospace is pursuing development of the winged semi-Reusable Launching Vehicle with horizontal take-off and landing capabilities in the Mk-III concept. In the previous work on this concept, the aerodynamic design has not been addressed. It is important that the aerodynamic design is already considered in the conceptual design, as the large variations in flight conditions during the mission pose conflicting requirements on the aerodynamic design.<br/>A performance analysis model of the launching vehicle was developed, in which the aerodynamic discipline is integrated. Using the developed model, sensitivity analyses and case studies were performed to investigate the impact of design changes on the mission performance. These results indicate that the limited gliding range of the first stage vehicle influences the propellant mass fraction of the upper stage.<br/>The performed case studies indicate how the propellant mass fraction of the upper stage can be influenced, by changes to the vehicle design. Analysis of an alternative wing concept that improves the gliding performance of the first stage vehicle shows that the propellant mass fraction of the upper stage vehicle can be reduced from 91.5% to 90.3%. This can be achieved as the improved gliding range allows to reduce the delta-V delivered by the upper stage, and a less steep ascent trajectory that results in 8.9% less gravity losses. Analysis of a changed fuselage configuration indicates a reduction of propellant mass fraction from 91.5% to 90.4%. <br/>Also changes to the trajectory design were analyzed, and by either reversing the direction of the take-off maneuver or by reserving propellant for the return trajectory, the propellant mass fraction can be reduced. The reductions achieved in the case studies were 0.5% for the reversed take-off direction, and 1.2% for the propelled return trajectory.<br","Semi-Reusable Launching Vehicle; Integrated aerodynamic model; Spaceplane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Polymetallic nodules, which are formed on abyssal plains at depths ranging from 4 to 6 kilometres and are distributed in high abundance on the top of the seabed, contains several times more cobalt and nickel than the entire global terrestrial reserves. This has raised the interest to exploit these resources from the deep ocean. The seafloor mining tool (SMT) can move along the soft sea bottom and can collect polymetallic nodules. While doing so, it will also entrain sediments and water. The excess of water and sediment entrained is discharged at the back of the SMT, forming a sediment plume. The sediment plume dispersion has strong adverse impacts on deep-sea environment.Thus, it is essential to study the sediment plume behavior in order to limit plume dispersion and thus to reduce its environmental impact. <br/>Experimental research is a powerful technique to study the plume behaviour. However, experiments sometimes take a long time due to complex set-up. In comparision, numerical analysis can save time and costs when solving complex problems. Furthermore, numerical modelling can provide deeper understanding and flexibility for boundary conditions and sediment types, which is applicable on both model and prototype scale. Previous numerical studies have noted the significant role of flocculation in limiting plume dispersion, but flocculation process has not been modelled explicitly. This study aims to establish a numerical model to study flocculation process and its effect on sediment transport. <br/>Previous flocculation-fluid dynamics modelling has applied a Euler-Euler method with additional population balance equations. The disadvantage is that many equations need to be solved. To avoid excessive computational costs, the sediment transport is described by a multiphase drift-flux model in this study. The flocculation process is modelled by a discretized form of population balance equations. The author has found that, by multiplying the particle volume, the population balance can be efficiently incorporated in the phase continuity equations in the drift-flux model. The population dynamics of particle aggregation and breakup can thus be characterized by the phase transition terms in the phase continuity equations. Hence, no additional equation needs to be introduced and solved.<br/>Verification is carried out to check conservation relationships and iterative convergence of numerical results. Then, an initial numerical investigation has shown the results can qualitatively show the three settling stages (i.e., flocculent settling, hindered settling and compression settling) found in the experimental studies. Afterwards, the collision efficiency is calibrated using the settling column tests conducted by Enthoven (2021). The results of calibration show a good fit to the experimental data. Another advantage is that numerical simulations can provide the particle size distribution over time, which is not measured in the experiments. <br/>The major novelty of this study is the coupling of the drift-flux model and the population balance equations, which inherits both the characteristics of population balance and the merits of drift-flux model in reducing computational costs. The flocculation modeling technique as proposed in this study can be incorporated as a module into an extended drift-flux model to predict the dispersion of deep-sea mining plumes.","Cohesive Sediment; Flocculation; CFD; OpenFOAM; Drift-flux model; Population Balance; Settling; Deep-sea mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-01","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

To target these issues, this research investigates to what extent Negotiation Support Systems (NSS) can be leveraged to teach Strategic Empathy - a recently introduced negotiation strategy - to women and whether this can improve their negotiation performance. In specific, the effect of teaching Strategic Empathy by means of NSS was tested with respect to enhancing women’s main performance barriers: i) low self-efficacy, and ii) a lack of persistence. Based on a literature review, a tutoring system that integrated Strategic Empathy was developed and tested through the online experiment. The findings provided strong evidence on the effectiveness of using a NSS to teach Strategic Empathy. Women revealed significantly higher levels of perspective-taking and their understanding and use of Strategic Empathy was shown to increase over time. Also, a significant positive effect was found of Strategic Empathy on women’s self-efficacy. No significant positive effect was found of Strategic Empathy on persistence. The high cognitive load of the experiment and a lack of intrinsic motivation were suggested as potential causes for this finding.<br/>Overall, this work demonstrates the applicability of using NSS to teach Strategic Empathy and its effectiveness for enhancing women’s self-efficacy in salary negotiations. By doing so, it contributes towards a solution to decrease the gender difference in negotiation performance.

In fact: it can be a starting point for experiencing luxury mobility in new ways that are more beneficial to the environment, the user and the brand - in this case Genesis, the luxury brand of Hyundai. Based on this, a vehicle interior design proposal was developed for a sustainability-oriented future Europe (2035). <br/><br/>Problem<br/><br/>The automotive industry is under increased pressure to become more sustainable and has responded to this with electrification and new mobility services. However, there has been less focus on the interior design, especially in the luxury segment. The underlying problem is that luxury and sustainability do not easily seem compatible, resulting in sustainability efforts that are mostly limited to the trim and decoration of the product. The aim was to go one level deeper (the interaction level) by envisioning a new and more responsible interpretation of luxury mobility. <br/><br/>Analysis<br/><br/>Using the ViP-method, the three pillars of the project - the brand, luxury and sustainability - were deconstructed. This led to the conclusion that traditional luxury is 'ego-focussed'. Conversely, sustainability means looking beyond the ego, namely balancing the needs between users and the environment. This could be achieved with a circular approach to products and reinforcing human-nature connections in interactions. To innovate on this interaction level was considered most interesting, since this was lacking in Genesis' current sustainability strategy. This could be a way to bridge the gap between the brand's ambitious 'New Luxury' slogan and their current interior designs.<br/><br/>Vision<br/><br/>With an overview of the status quo, now the future context could be explored. This was done by studying sustainability-oriented, societal and technological trends that shape future ('new') luxury. With this the Eco-Luxury travel trend was identified, that united luxury benefits (digital detox for mental wellbeing) with environmental benefits (awareness for more responsible behaviour). Based on this an interaction vision was created of exposing users to their environment, inspired by yachts with open-air lounges. This led to a moodboard and scenario that became the <br/>foundation for the design.<br/><br/>Design<br/><br/>Next, several ideas were explored for the overall vehicle architecture that impacts the interaction. A GT proportion with off-road capability was selected to fit the interaction vision. Based on this a basic technical package was developed as well as several concepts. The selected concept reinterprets the 'majestic bonnet proportion' of typical luxury cars, with a yachting-inspired lounge deck. Here the user is invited to unwind and connect with his/her surroundings. <br/><br/>The lounge can accessed via an interior that is designed to fully immerse in the travel environment. The space looks airy thanks to the enlarged visibility and a calm and honest design, to prevent any distraction. Autonomous driving makes you focus fully on the road ahead, thanks to the absence of a dashboard with steering wheel. Instead the vehicle can be assisted when nessary with a joystick from the comfortable seating position of a hammock. <br/><br/>Evaluation<br/><br/>The design was optimised after extensive reviewing with professionals, experts and users. This led to a final design that was created in 3D. The design is presented with 2D renderings, as well as an interactive, Augmented Reality model.","luxury; sustainabilty; Car Design; Mobility; Automotive; Automotive design; Interior Design; Aesthetics; user experience; Styling","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://sketchfab.com/models/c53c649f17e1410fbe45df65efde61cf/embed?autostart=1&internal=1&tracking=0&ui_ar=0&ui_infos=0&ui_snapshots=1&ui_stop=0&ui_theatre=1&ui_watermark=0 Digital and interactive showcase of the design.

This method is tested against different encoding strategies and Isolation Forest Conditional Anomaly Detection (iForestCAD) using different synthetic data sets. The method shows improved performance to the utilization of encoding strategies for different parameters of the underlying synthetic data. Furthermore, this thesis explores the potential of ternary Isolation Forest, in which the branching strategy of an isolation tree is expanded to produce three child nodes. It is demonstrated using synthetic data, that particularly the performance of MI-Local-DIFFI reduces when applied to a ternary Isolation Forest. Finally, the research considers a practical use-case. Using customer transaction data from Triodos Bank, the locally explainable Isolation Forest is applied to mixed-attribute customer transaction data. This has provided useful insight and resulted in the detection of suspicious customer behaviour and the introduction of new rules into business practices. Although the most interesting customer behaviour did not directly emanate from the nominal attributes, the method of incorporating nominal features resulted in differences when considering the anomalies with the highest anomaly scores.<br","Isolation Forest; Anomaly Detection; Anti-Money Laundering; Mixed-Attribute Data; Ternary Isolation Trees","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To address the traditional education’s challenges, researchers refer to online educational tools to assist teachers. Although large writing tools (for instance, Grammarly and Microsoft Editor) assist students to write effectively, their primary objective is not to educate students. Therefore, we propose RevisionCoach – an automated writing feedback system that iteratively constructs educational, localized feedback to assist students to learn how to write. Clear and effective writing is important for students to succeed in academic endeavors and allows teachers to focus on feedback for the assignment’s primary task. RevisionCoach’s objective is to educate, and for that reason, the design considers learning by deliberate practice, differentiated learning, and self-regulated learning. In addition, RevisionCoach’s feedback has four layers: a sentence-level mistake highlight, an assessment category (coherence, cohesion, readability, and formality), a correction category (rewrite, reword, and rephrase), and a correction suggestion. <br/><br/>RevisionCoach’s categorized feedback allows for convenient evaluation that addresses RevisionCoach’s capability to predict the writing mistake’s importance. In the evaluation, we ask writing experts, students, Grammarly, and Microsoft Editor to find writing mistakes in text and to rate the mistake’s importance. Compared to the experts’ importance predictions, RevisionCoach predicts the mistake importances more accurately (1.89 mean square error (MSE)) than a random baseline (2.70 MSE), student baseline (2.50 MSE), Grammarly (2.52 MSE), and Microsoft Editor (2.02 MSE). Furthermore, the study illustrates the experts’ challenge to provide localized feedback for writing skills because the experts have merely 71.2% agreement about the top 2 most severe mistakes. At the same time, RevisionCoach achieves an average agreement of 72.9% with the experts’ mistake predictions.","Education; Machine Learning; NLP; Transformers; Writing Feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Introduction Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is a relatively novel development in colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) surgery which has proven to be an added value for the detection of new lesions and surgical guidance. However, new possibilities of NIRF imaging in CRLM surgery are yet to be explored. The fluorescent rim of indocyanine green (ICG) surrounding CRLM can potentially be used to predict the resection margin. By predicting the resection margin, irradical resections can be observed during surgery. Additional tissue can be removed intraoperatively, probably resulting in improved outcomes. This research describes a method to analyze the data retrieved at the Department of Pathology. The goal of this thesis is to provide a verdict on whether ICG could be used as a quantitative indicator for distance to the tumor and therefore, help the surgeon to evaluate the resection margin on-site. Materials &amp; Methods Data was collected by imaging bread loaves from resected CRLM. Methods to generate data from these images, to evaluate the collected data, and to evaluate the interobserver error were described. The data were evaluated with the use of general and histogram parameters. Moreover, the data was separated four times into different groups. These groups aimed to investigate the general distribution of ICG around CRLM and the effect of tumor and patient-specific characteristics. Subsequently, the results of the data analysis were used to make a rough estimation of the expected measured fluorescence intensities during surgery. Results The interobserver error was 0.9 or higher (Sørensen-Dice coefficient) for 8 out of the 10 delineation pairs including three pairs with a coefficient of 0.95 or higher. However, two pairs of delineations showed coefficients of 0.566 and 0.797. 33 bread loaves were included in this research for data analysis of the general and histogram parameters. Various distributions of ICG around the tumors were found for the groups varying in tumor and patient characteristics. Moreover, differences between groups in general parameters were observed. The rough estimation of the expected measured fluorescence intensity showed a peak intensity around 5 millimeters from the tumor. Discussion The delineation of CRLM proved to be a reproducible operation in most of the delineations (80%). However, there is a need for ground truth delineations to examine the accuracy of delineations. Besides, the effects of chemotherapy, the location of the tumor, and the size of the tumor on the peritumoral fluorescent rim, as well as the flaws of this research were discussed. Future recommendations Additional research must be performed to be able to develop a method to evaluate resection margins intraoperatively. Future research should focus on the formulation of an implementation plan and the development of the database, the MeVisLab network, the resection margin prediction method, and a protocol that enables the opportunity to create ground truth delineations. Conclusion This study showed the potential of the use of the peritumoral fluorescent rim to develop a method that can predict resection margins of resected CRLM intraoperatively. However, additional research must be performed to accurately implement the method and to increase its accuracy.","Colorectal liver metastases; Near-infrared fluorescence imaging; Surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Ageing of infrastructure leads to an increasing demand for new technologies and design solutions in current bridge engineering. Over the last decades the traffic intensity has grown tremendously, while design codes and regulations have become stricter. Many current steel bridges realised in The Netherlands suffer from fatigue problems. Replacement of the bridges can be expensive, and thus engineers are asked to provide design solutions that can extend the lifetime of these structures. Rehabilitation through the replacement of steel orthotropic decks with Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) sandwich deck panels is considered as one of the few possible solution strategies. FRP's are considered a viable option, due to their versatility, high strength-to-weight ratio, fast installation possibilities, low maintenance costs and their resistance against both corrosion and fatigue. The increasing amount of bridges containing FRP structural elements demonstrates the high potential of the material. However, many engineering consultancies address to face difficult challenges when working with FRP. The main concern in the construction and design field is about the long-term performance of the material. Due to the viscoelastic nature of the polymeric matrix, FRP structural elements show complex creep and recovery behaviour under variable traffic loading. Current standards account for this traffic load by conservatively assuming that 40% of this traffic load should be accounted for in creep calculations, which originates from experience with concrete bridges. However, due to the fast recovery behaviour of FRP compared to concrete, this value might be too conservative. Based on current knowledge and experimental results, a numerical model was created that is able to predict the long-term creep deformation including both creep and recovery behaviour. The model uses experimental results based on UD-plies, which enables the model to calculate the long-term deformation of laminates with a wide variety of layups. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software package Abaqus has been used to model a FRP sandwich deck panel and calculate the time-dependent response under traffic loading. Finally, a FRP sandwich deck panel has been analysed by both the numerical model and according to the procedure prescribed by current standards. Results have shown that the amount of traffic load that is currently considered as permanent static load for creep calculations could be reduced. However, it is recommended for future research to improve the numerical model by using more accurate creep prediction models supported with profound experimental work. It is expected that this would lead to an even higher reduction of the amount of traffic load that is currently considered in design recommendations.","Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer; Sandwich deck panel; Viscoelasticity; Creep; Traffic load","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Steel and Timber Construction","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Density-based topology optimization, when used to design structures that show geometrical non-linear behaviour, currently faces computational effort and stability issues. These issues are caused by the iterative method used in geometric non-linear structural analysis. On top of taking much computational effort to complete, this method encounters instabilities when analyzing low-density elements usually present in the design domain.<br/><br/>This study aims to bypass those issues by proposing approximate analysis in the topology optimization routine, which is an analysis based on an approximation of the geometrical non-linear load-deflection curve of a structure, constructed with equilibrium points close to its undeformed configuration.<br/><br/>To study the performance and the influence of the parameters that govern approximate analysis, three numerical examples are considered. These indicate that using approximate analysis in topology optimization leads to designs that perform over a finite range of motion, similar to when a non-linear analysis is used. The computational effort needed for approximate analysis is closer to the effort needed for linear analysis than non-linear analysis. A limitation of approximate analysis is that its results are only similar to non-linear analysis as long as the deflections stay in the mildly non-linear domain.<br/><br/>When concerning the topology optimization of compliant mechanisms that exhibit mildly geometric non-linear behaviour, we conclude that using approximate analysis is a stable and computationally efficient alternative to non-linear analysis.","Topology optimization; Compliant mechanisms; geometric non-linear; Structural analysis; Flexures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","","","","","",""
