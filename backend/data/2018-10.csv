In The Netherlands, the steel industry contributes to nearly 7% of the total greenhouse gas emissions inventory. To meet the Dutch Government target, Tata Steel IJmuiden is exploring various options to reduce its CO2 emissions. One of the options being considered is CO2 Capture, whereby the CO2 could be captured from the Works Arising Gases (WAGs). Currently, the use of chemical absorption is the most mature technology to capture CO2 from any gas. This study has evaluated the performance, equipment sizing and cost of capturing CO2 using MEA or MDEA/Pz solvents. The performance of the chemical absorption process capturing 90% of the CO2 from a mixture of Blast Furnace Gas and Basic Oxygen Furnace Gas has been evaluated. The process was modeled in ASPEN Plus® . For cases using MEA as solvent, the conventional configuration were evaluated. It could be concluded that the optimal lean loading is around 0.19 mol/mol resulting to a specific reboiler duty of around 3.95 MJ/kg CO2 captured. Different advanced process flow configurations were also assessed. The results showed that the use of intercoolers in combination with a flash split-flow or LVC could result in a reduction of the specific reboiler duty. For cases using of MDEA and Pz as solvent, the conventional configuration operating with 1 and 10 bara absorber pressure were modeled. Resulting to a specific reboiler duty of 3.56 and 2.70 MJ/kg CO2 for 1 and 10 bara operating pressure, respectively. Furthermore, different advanced configurations were also assessed. This consisted of the incorporation of intercoolers and 1-stage or 2-stage configurations. With intercooling, the specific reboiler duty could be lowered down to 2.85 and 2.43 MJ/kg CO2 for operating pressure at 1 bara and 10 bara, On the other hand, based on the UCARSOL 1-stage configurations operating at 10 bara, the specific reboiler duty could be reduced down to 2.34 MJ/kg CO2. A reduction in specific reboiler duty for the 2-stage configuration could be significantly lowered. Preliminary economic evaluations were undertaken in this study to obtain the specific CO2 capture cost – based on CAPEX and OPEX estimates using 8% discount rate and an economic lifetime of 25 years. For the MEA cases evaluated, the costs of CO2 captured are in the range of 52.7 to 65.8 €/tonne CO2; the lowest cost is achieved with the LVC configuration in combination with intercooling. On the other hand, the results for the MDEA/Pz cases indicated that the costs of CO2 captured are in the range of 54.1 to 67.3 €/tonne CO2; the lowest cost is given in the configuration with intercooling operating at 1 bara.","Chemical absorption; Carbon capture; Monoethanolamine; Methyldiethanolamine; Piperazine; Aspen Plus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-31","","","","","",""

One of the keys to this growing demand is the advancement of motion control. To this day, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) has been the workhorse for the industry system control. This is because PID is simple to design and implement and adapt to industrial loopshaping method. Nevertheless, PID suffers fundamental limitations of linear control. To deal with this, a nonlinear control should be utilized. Reset control is a nonlinear control that is still easy but can overcome the limitation of linear control and more importantly, loop shaping method can be used to reset control by using describing function analysis<br/>which is pseudo-approximation of nonlinear system that based on the first harmonic. However, reset control also introduces higher order harmonics into the system that can negatively affect system performance. This is because these harmonics may cause some unwanted dynamics present in system response. Describing function which is the common tool to analyze and design reset control is not accurate enough since higher order harmonics are not considered. Recently, a tool to visualize higher order harmonics in frequency domain is developed. This open the possibilities to study the behavior of higher order harmonics and its effect to system performance.<br/>This thesis focuses on a performance analysis and tuning of a novel reset element called ’Constant in Gain, Lead in Phase’(CgLp). It is shown by the literature that reset control is often utilized to provide phase lag reduction but CgLp has shown the use of reset control to provide phase compensation and this improves system performance. Since its introduction, no guidelines available in the literature to design and tune CgLp. Looking at its potential to be industry standard for motion control, finding guidelines to tune CgLp is an important step to achieve this goal. To do the optimal tuning of reset element, higher order harmonics should be considered so that the effect of unwanted response can be minimized while maintaining the advantage of reset control. Therefore, the work in this thesis is performed by doing performance analysis of CgLp through describing function and HOSIDF.<br/>It is shown that while there is an improvement in tracking and steady state precision performance by using CgLp compared to normal PID, there is deterioration of the performance although describing function predicted an improvement. This is because there is a trade-off between improvement by CgLp and the rise of higher order harmonics gain. In this work, the higher order harmonics was considered at the bandwidth frequency and normalized over its first harmonic. It was observed that the optimal performance is achieved when the highest gain value of normalized 3rd harmonic is around half of maximum possible value of normalized 3rd harmonic.<br","Reset control; precision control; Motion control; describing function analysis; HOSIDF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Over the past twenty years, telerobotics has been developed to assist retinal surgeons. Robot-assisted surgery can aid the surgeon by motion scaling and filtering out natural hand tremor. However, the additive precision has yet to relieve the surgeon from the burdensome task entirely, and teleoperation comes with a downside of extending execution time.<br/><br/>One of the complicating factors in robot-assisted EMP surgery is the limited depth perception afforded by the binocular microscope, which increases the risk of inadvertent contact of the surgical tool with the retina. Recently, PRECEYES has introduced an intraoperative sensor that measures the distance to the surface of the retina to their surgical system. The master device is capable of force feedback, which can be employed to transmit distance information to the surgeon without extra burden to the already visually overwhelmed task. <br/><br/>This study aims to design and evaluate haptic assistance for teleoperated EMP based on noisy distance sensor. Sixteen subjects with non-medical background participated in the human factors experiment performing a simulated vitreoretinal surgery by using a 3-DoF haptic master device controlling a simulated slave robot. All subjects performed two experimental conditions (with and without haptic assistance) in a balanced order. The experimental result shows that, with haptic assistance, the overall puncture rate reduces from 9.6% to 2.8% and peeling forces are stabilized significantly. Which indicates that the proposed method utilizes distance information in a promising way, thus reducing the difficulty of the teleoperated task.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-31","","","","","",""

One possible way to overcome these negative effects is by foaming the gas. Foam can be defined as a dispersion of gas separated by lamellae in a continuous liquid phase. Lamellae stability is enhanced by adding surfactants to the aqueous phase (Lake, 2014). The underlying idea is that the pitfalls of gas injection can be overcome by trapping the gas and therefore reducing its mobility. The benefits of foam flooding have been reported by several authors (Almaqbali et al., 2017, Li et al., 2009, Chalbaud et al., 2002, Patil et al., 2018 ) however, to implement field scale projects, an accurate representation of foams in models that can be applied to reservoir simulators is of paramount importance. In this sense, two main families of foam modelling exist today. One family referred as population balance models, treat foam texture and bubble size explicitly and another family, that treats foam texture implicitly by applying a mobility reduction factor to gas mobility. <br/>In the first part of this document, a model that treats foam texture implicitly will be used to evaluate foam performance in a heterogenous reservoir consisting of two layers with different permeabilities. The model known as STARS (Computer Modelling Group, 2010) reduces gas mobility using semiempirical functions that represent the physics governing foam texture. One of the functions used by the model is the dryout function, which represents the effects of water saturation on foam coalescence. This function is tuned by a couple parameters, namely, fmdry and epdry that control the water saturation at which foam dries out and how fast it dries out, in other words, how abrupt its collapse is. Farajzadeh et. al, (2015) found that these parameters were permeability dependent. <br/>Inspired by these findings, in the modelling section of this project, foam performance in a two layer reservoir with different permeabilities under varying injection conditions is assessed. Each layer will have its unique set of parameters, namely, fmmob, epdry and fmdry. We are interested in seeing the effects that epdry has on foam performance and the effects of having vastly contrasting foam strengths between layers (large fmmob contrast). The results suggest that epdry can have significant impact on foam performance in the high quality regime. Interestingly, it was found that large fmmob contrast reduce vertical conformance and can reduce recovery efficiency in the high quality regime. <br/>It is known that oil can have negative impact on foam stability, however most studies treat gas and oil as different phases. Under miscible conditions, oil and gas become one phase and the extent to how oil destabilizes foam is not clearly understood. Kahrobaei et. al (2017) found in core flood experiments a unique rheological behavior in foams with miscible mixtures of Carbon Dioxide – Decane. Their experiments showed three distinguishable apparent viscosity regimes depending on Carbon dioxide fraction. Regime 1, in which apparent viscosity increased with increasing CO2 fraction; Regime 2 in which apparent viscosity decreased with increasing CO2 fraction; and Regime 3 in which apparent viscosity is constant independently of the CO2 molar composition. <br/>Inspired by Kahrobaei et. al, (2017) findings, the second part of the project attempts to investigate, using microfluidics, the effects in foam texture caused by compositional changes in an AOS surfactant solution and a miscible Carbon Dioxide – Decane mixture. Unfortunately, due to set-up limitations and inability to reliably mix the components, the experiments were inconclusive. Nonetheless, valuable lessons learnt are presented that will facilitate the experimental approach if someone decides to continue with this line of investigation. <br","Foam; dryout function; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work discusses the complex phenomena involved in droplet impingement, especially the effect of temperature dependant surface tension. The volume of fluid (VOF) method is used to solve the axis-symmetric Navier-Stokes equations, which are used to describe the droplet's behaviour. Different temperature dependencies for the surface tension are modelled, to see the effect on the interface and substrate melting. Furthermore, the effect of droplet size, initial temperature on droplet shape and substrate melting is studied. To judge the accuracy of the VOF model, a series of benchmarks are tried. The VOF model used in this work is as accurate or more accurate than previous works. The results show that droplets with a higher percentage of oxygen flatten, this is due to thermo-capillary forces. A higher temperature results in more spreading of the droplet, this is because higher temperatures result in higher surface tensions. These surface tensions keep the droplet together when it first makes contact with the substrate. This causes less air is trapped underneath the droplet, which causes the droplet to spread out more. The air also causes the droplet to cool down less fast, this results in a phenomenon where the hotter droplet is solidified faster than the colder one.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

One such direction was reintroducing the physical world and physical phenomenon back to architectural language and design space. This is especially true as buildings have had to become more and more environmentally sustainable and developable with programs such as LEED, BREEAM, and Zero House popping up. While less pronounced, the same is true for other aspects of architecture too; such as pedestrian flow, constructability, and structural design. Each design in hi-tech architecture has become a compromise of these systems. While significant funding has gone into understand how to design for energy efficient buildings, architects typically shy away from structural systems leaving these problems for structural engineers to solve. However, great design comes to fruition when the two systems work hand in hand. This method of design, integrated design, is starting to appear more and more in the design space with gridshell structures becoming classic icons of the beauty of this marriage. Gridshell structures are becoming more widely known as architects such as Foster + Partners, Asymptote, and John McAslan &amp; Partners have developed work that has become widely lauded and incredibly awe inspiring. These slender shapes still allow for large amounts of natural light as well as enable architects and designers to cover vast areas without the need of massive beams and a large amount of columns, instead finding rigidity in its own form. This research project, attempts to create a system for architects and designers to play with in order to develop an efficient and useful gridshell concept structure and does this by approaching the perspective from two points. On one side a computational system is built based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) data and signal processing while on the other, structural concepts are explored in order to determine a geometric relationship between load, form, and principal stresses.","Gridshell; principal stress; parametric design; Structural Design; particle spring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over time, the flow rate of the production fluid decreases as the reservoir pressure decreases. When the flow rate decreases to below a certain value, unstable flow with liquid slugs occurs and the transportation of the fluids becomes more difficult. This is because of the high amount of liquid accumulation (holdup) in the pipeline. To extend the operation life of the production system, it is important to maintain the continuous production at low flow rates. Regular pigging, which refers to transporting a “pig” (Pipeline Inspection Gauge) through the pipeline, has been a conventional way of managing the liquid holdup in the oil and gas industry. Also ""by-pass"" pigs have been actively used to manage the liquid holdup since they generate smaller slug volumes compared to the traditional non-bypass pigs. However, since the pipeline can be as long as a hundred (or more) kilometers, the volume of the pig-generated slug at low flow rates can be very large. Even this reduced slug volume produced by using a by-pass pig may exceed the capacity of the downstream separator or slug catcher. Moreover, by-pass pigs with a large by-pass area have a high chance to get stuck in the pipeline at low flow rates. To enable pigging operation at those conditions, the use of an undersized ball pig was proposed. Here the ball pig is transversed through the pipeline prior to the by-pass pigging operation. A few test runs with undersized ball pigs were carried out in the F14 multiphase pipeline in Sarawak. To improve its performance, it is of much interest to study the detailed flow around an undersized ball pig. Although in actual operation the ball pig will be used under multiphase conditions (i.e. gas and liquid flow), in this study, as a starting point, single-phase flow was considered. This study investigated the detailed flow around an undersized ball pig in a horizontal pipe with the help of Ansys Fluent version 18.2. First, benchmark data from experiments are used to find the best numerical model which can be used to simulate the flow around a sphere. The comparison between experimental data and numerical results shows that the 2D laminar simulation can accurately capture the flow when Re &lt; 300. The 2D simulation with the SST k-ω turbulence model (low-Reynolds number correction) gives an accurate prediction of the drag coefficient when 300 &lt; Re &lt; 5E5. The selected numerical models are then used to study the flow around an undersized ball pig in a pipe. For each set of conditions, this requires to carry out a number of simulations at different ball pig velocities, and find the velocity that gives zero drag force on the ball pig. The undersized ball pig is first moved to the centre, and 2D simulations were performed. The force analysis around the undersized ball pig at low Reynolds number shows that at equilibrium state, the undersized ball pig experiences a positive pressure force and a negative viscous shear force. Moreover, the computed profile of the normalized terminal velocity of the pig with a diameter ratio of 0.5 at various Reynolds numbers shows that the normalized terminal pig velocity profile experiences three stages when the Reynolds number is increased. In the first stage where Re &lt; 365, the motion of the pig is dominated by the viscous shear force and the normalized terminal velocity of the pig is constant. When Re increases, the flow enters the second stage where the inertia force starts to affect the motion of the pig and the normalized terminal velocity of the pig decreases dramatically. When Re is further increased to above 5340, the motion of the pig is completely affected by the inertia force and the normalized terminal velocity of the pig stays in a stable range when Re increases. After this detailed study of the flow around an undersized ball pig with a fixed diameter ratio, simulations of the flow around undersized ball pigs with various diameter ratios are studied to find the influence of the pig diameter on the terminal velocity of the pig. The results show that the obtained profiles of the normalized pig terminal velocity against Re at various diameter ratios have a similar shape as when the diameter ratio was 0.5; the terminal pig velocity decreases when the pig diameter increases at a given Re. A further data regression analysis shows that the normalized pig terminal velocity in the region when Re &lt; 300 and Re &gt; 10000 has a second-order polynomial relationship with the diameter ratio. After the simulations for the flow around an undersized ball pig that moves along the axis of the pipe, the pig is moved to the bottom of the pipe and the influence of this position change is studied at a diameter ratio of 0.9. Due to this position change, a 3D simulation is required. First a 3D simulation for the previous configuration with the pig at the centre is performed. This simulation shows that the flow is actually unsteady and asymmetric. The terminal pig velocity at a given Reynolds number obtained from the 3D simulation is slightly higher than the one obtained from the 2D simulation. As the 2D simulation cannot capture the asymmetry of the flow, it provides less accurate results. The 3D simulation results of the flow past an undersized ball pig moving along the axis of the pipe is then compared with the one moving along the bottom of the pipe. The comparison shows that the ball pig terminal velocity is decreased when the pig is moved from the centre to the bottom of the pipe.","Numerical simulation; Undersized ball Pig; Pipeline networks; Oil and gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

Comparing the baseline and the calibrated simulation results, the averaged absolute percentage errors of energy use intensity (EUI) among at least 84 valid postcodes have decreased from 24.96% to 8.31% in 2016 and from 19.93% to 7.70% in 2017 respectively.<br/><br/>The calibrated urban building energy model would be most interested by municipalities, urban planners, and engineering consultancies. It can be used to evaluate long-term energy supply and demand strategies, identify building renovation saving potential, perform large-scale building performance mapping, and carry out retrofit measures assessment.","Urban building energy modeling; 3D city model; Sensitivity analysis; Bayesian inference; Model calibration; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","52.370216, 4.895168"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Floor vibrations are a common problem in high tech engineering where good tracking, precision and bandwidth have utmost importance. They are mainly present at low frequencies, and they need to be suppressed. PID control is the go-to controller in the industry because of its ease of design, simple implementation and good performance. However, PID is subjected to the fundamental limitations of linear control theory - the waterbed effect and bode's gain-phase relationship. Therefore, it is not possible to improve one performance criterion, like stability, without negatively influencing the other. The need for overcoming the fundamental limitations of linear control initiates research towards nonlinear controllers. <br/><br/>Reset control is a type of nonlinear controller as a solution to overcome the limitations of a linear control. It reduces phase lag within the system, gives the advantage to reach higher bandwidth and results in lower overshoot or a faster settling time compared to linear controllers. However, using reset control comes with a price of unwanted dynamics due to the higher order harmonics. The main focus of this thesis is to improve disturbance rejection performance against floor vibrations by attenuating the power of high order harmonics. This problem has been tackled within the thesis, and a band-pass reset control is proposed.<br/><br/>Proposed reset controller applies reset only within the frequency range where floor vibrations are present, and it uses integrator as a reset variable. Results show reset controller that has a broadband phase compensation, like CgLp, is more advantageous towards phase lag reduction methods. CgLp is a reset element, which is an abbreviation of Constant-Gain Lead Phase. It gives broadband phase compensation within the desired range of frequencies by using generalized first order reset element. Also, CgLp controller achieved disturbance rejection performance of PI\textsuperscript{2}D with the phase behavior of Clegg.<br","Reset control; disturbance rejection; Nonlinear control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Due to the removal of mangrove forests, coastal zones can suffer from severe erosion. One of the proposed solutions is the construction of permeable structures. This study aims to optimise the design of permeable (brushwood) structures in order to restore the sediment balance and encourage mangrove re-establishment on tropical mud coasts. Preferably wave transmission should be low in order to create a calmer climate behind the structure. In that way sediment is able to settle down, which could lead to a recovery of the mud profile. It is also preferred that reflection by the structure is low. High reflection rates cause scour holes that lead to instability of the structure. Furthermore, scour holes could hinder future mangrove re-establishment. Aiming to achieve low reflection and transmission rates, the dissipation inside the structure has to be as high as possible. Experiments were conducted in the 40 meter wave flume at the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at TU Delft. The permeable structure was schematized as an array of cylinders. With the physical scale model various effects could be tested, including the porosity, structure width, arrangement, orientation, etc. The tests were done for 5 different wave cases, from which the wave energy distribution over reflection, dissipation and transmission was determined. The existing brushwood structures require intensive maintenance. This is partly due to the sinking of the material into the soft mud. Also, the brushwood material washes away often as it is lighter than water and difficult to constrain in vertical direction. An alternative design that requires less maintenance would be preferred. Therefore, it was interesting to see whether a comparable amount of wave dissipation could be achieved by using vertical elements only. One important finding is that in more shallow water regions, vertical and horizontal orientations have similar dissipation rates. In water regions that go more towards deep water, the horizontal structures have higher dissipation rates. This can be explained by the relative importance of the horizontal and vertical velocities due to the wave motion. In deep water vertical velocities are relatively high. As the horizontal elements have more exposure to this component in comparison to the vertical elements, they provide more dissipation. In shallow water the relative importance of the vertical velocities is lower, which explains the similar dissipation rates of the two orientations. The analytical model of Dalrymple (1984) was used to describe the energy dissipation through the structures. Drag coefficients were derived by using the calibration method. For KC&lt;15 the drag coefficients start increasing. This is possibly due to the relative importance of the inertia force. Comparing the drag coefficients to the ones derived from direct force and velocity measurements in previous studies showed relative high values. This could be due to an underestimation of the horizontal velocity due to the wave motion. The velocity that is used is the undisturbed velocity in front of the structure. However, the velocity inside the structure might be higher as the flow accelerates in between the gaps of the elements. Furthermore, the wave cases in this research are in the Stokes 2nd and 3rd order region, indicating that the waves cannot be fully described by linear wave theory. The inertia, permeability and non-linear effects among other possible effects are not included in the analytical model of Dalrymple. Therefore, the drag coefficients do not only represent drag forces, but also other processes. To gain more insight on the physical mechanisms that affect the wave energy dissipation, it is recommended to test the same scale model with direct force and velocity measurements.","Building with Nature; Brushwood structures; Demak; Indonesia; BioManCo; Mangroves; Wave flume experiments; Permeable Structures; Physical scale model; Wave dissipation; Cylinders; Drag coefficients; Arrays of Cylinders; Wave Energy Balance; Dalrymple","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

In contrast, California as the third most extensive area in the U.S., is occupied most of the land use for agricultural purposes.

In general, the thesis will be divided into two big parts, hydrological drought severity and hydrological drought duration. The former part will be analysed using Bayesian Network to estimate the mean monthly discharge in California.

The combiniation of the long-term existence of refugee camps, its negative impact on individuals, the inevitable urbanization and the lack of policy implementation of the UN refugee agency causes urgency to look at the management of a refugee camp differently. Humanitarian aid is not appropriate anymore and the moment development aid comes in remains unclear. The linkage between the different forms of aid is lacking. In this thesis, the transition between these different forms of aid is investigated by conducting a network analysis the case study: Za’atari Refugee Camp in Jordan. The results show that the main obstacle in the transition is the lack of interaction and platform. This is caused by several institutional obstacles. The host government rejects the durable solution integration, has a complex decision-making structure and points towards the international community to take care of the refugee camp which causes absence of incentives to intiate interaction about the transition of the camp. Also from the UN side there is a lack of mandate for the long-term, a short-term funding system and non-transparancy between agencies causes obstacles for interaction. Also having a developmental approach, or exit strategies for humanitarian agencies is blocked by the difficult economic situation in Jordan and the high standards of UN agencies. <br/>By analysing a Think Tank project which aims to establish interaction about the future of Za’atari Refugee Camp the application of network management strategies is tested. The results show that some interaction was established successfully but that the process stagnated when actors had to take ownership and resigned predominantly from the process. Lacking protection of core values and lack of agreement on process rules can be one of the reasons for the stagnation in the process. There are several obstacles to be found to the transition of refugee camp Za’atari, which can also be found worldwide in other refugee camp situations. These obstacles cannot directly be overcome by networkmanagement because it is limited to the extent wherein the core-values remain protected. Network management is hampered when actors on purpose execute non-cooperative strategies to protect their core-values.<br","Network Management; Refugee camp management; Wicked problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

However, this can only be considered true if the energy sources used for charging EVs are also from clean energy form. Various Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are available to provide the EVs charging demand. Nevertheless, due to intermittency power generation characteristic of RES, there is a high risk of supply and demand power mismatch. A grid-connected topology system is commonly used as a backup for lack or over power supply from RES generation. Even though, this configuration may lead to new problems of under/over voltage issues and maximum transformer/lines loading capacity due to RES fluctuation power production. The storage system is considered necessary to be installed in the system as a buffer of the power mismatch and also reducing the grid stress. Excellent approximation of storage sizing and placement is mandatory to provide satisfactory influence to the overall system technically and economically.<br/><br/>This study proposes optimization strategy for optimal battery sizing and placement with optimal power management system in the EVs charging station using photovoltaics (PV) power in a low voltage distribution network using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MINLP) algorithm.

Although relevant and elegant, MAC curves are often insufficient to justify the implementation of abatement options, as many of the ones ranked financially convenient are not fully realized. The Y-factor method is an alternative approach to emission abatement curves, highlighting the relevance of 12 implementation barriers related to Costs, Multi-actor complexity, Physical interdependencies and Behavioral changes. This investigation applies the Y-factor method to construct a new emission abatement curve, validating its characterizing scores with experts. The obtained Y-curve exposes the relevance of many implementation barriers not capture by MAC curves, as financial barriers are found to account for only 30% of all the considered implementation barriers; the relevance of non-financial barriers helps explaining the reasons for which abatement options considered financially convenient are not implemented. The interviews with experts also verify the relevance of each of the 12 considered factors, each of which is found to be explicitly hampering the implementation of abatement options. Moreover, new insights are highlighted for each of the considered abatement options comparing their ranking in the Y-curve with their respective ranking in McKinsey's global cost curve. The constructed Y-curve and the Y-factor method are successively discussed with players responsible and/or consulted for drafting energy strategies in The Netherlands, namely the Ministerie van Economische Zaken en Klimaat, PBL, ECOFYS. The proposed Y-curve is accepted and the Y-factor method is found able to provide supportive insights to sustainable strategy-making. Moreover, the consulted energy strategists envisioned applications of the the Y-factor method for Policy-making, Analytical researches, and for drafting Business strategies. Lastly, a new tool integrating figures from McKinsey's global cost curve and the Y-curve is presented, as an example of possible new tools developed combining the different existing approaches to emission abatement.

This, along with the fact that cities also account for 75% of natural resource consumption and 50% of global waste production, makes urbanization a world-wide issue (Sukhdev, Vol, Brandt, &amp; Yeoman, 2017). Additionally, the widely-practiced urban linear economic structure only amplifies the problems of city life, taking goods from far-off places, using them for a limited time and discarding them in such a way that cuts value chains. A shift toward a circular economy (CE) with the aim to reduce, reuse or recycle materials could be a winning sustainable development strategy for cities aiming to lower their negative environmental impacts. Problems of urbanization are only expected to increase. In Europe, cities house 70% of the population, making it one of the most urbanized regions in the world. In the Netherlands particularly, the percentage residents living in cities has grown from 87% in 2010 to over 91% in the last 8 years (United Nations Population Division, 2018).A major challenge facing the Netherlands is the sustainability of the food system that accompanies this urbanization. Cities depend heavily on imported food to fulfil the needs and preferences of their residents. Besides the negative environmental consequences of excessive and often fossil-fuel driven importation, cities also produce a large amount of food waste which is often simply incinerated or landfilled. A more circular and localized food system, in this case addressed through Circular Urban Agriculture (CUA), would address both the issues of the linear economy and the growing food needs of cities. The Hague presents an interesting opportunity for CUA with its increasing popularity, carbon neutrality goals, location in a highly-productive agricultural area and expanding innovativeness. This research assesses the current state of CUA in The Hague, its potential for growth and possible future scenarios in which it is a larger part of The Hague’s food system. A conceptual framework comprised of quantitative and qualitative criteria from various frameworks leads the way into The Hague’s sustainable future. The contributing frameworks are the Urban Harvest Approach, Strategic Niche Management and Backcasting and draws from three domains: urban metabolism, sustainable transitions and future studies. A literature review gives insight into the current state of both urban agriculture (UA) and circularity in The Hague. Using the three examples of macro-level CUA initiatives available in The Hague (the Edible Park, Urban Farmers and Haagse Zwam), network development, learning opportunities and expectations regarding CUA create a strong story for the future potential of the sector. Those involved externally with the CUA sector, such as municipality representatives, circularity experts and researchers, also contribute to the analysis by providing insight into the landscape of The Hague. Finally, taking expectations, interviews and knowledge of Industrial Ecology into account, a future vision for The Hague in 2050 exemplifies what “could be” for the future food system. The use of multi-level investigations for individual CUA initiatives, the CUA sector, the larger food system and the sociotechnical landscape of The Hague allows for an in-depth analysis that ultimately leads to recommendations for next steps related to CUA’s development.","Circular Economy; Urban Agriculture; Permaculture; strategic niche management; Backcasting; visioning; Urban Development; Urban Harvest Assessment; Food System","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

More specifically, the site chosen is located within the Dunes of Texel National Park, a highly sensitive ecosystem protected by UNESCO. Thus, the Harvested Home was conceived with preserving the integrity of the ground cover in mind. To minimize the work done on site and reduce the damage done during the construction process, the building approach combines, along with its biobased structure, a lightweight pile foundation, plug-and-play connections, and a fully prefabricated structure. These design choices produce a home that can accommodate the uneven and chaotic terrain of Texel without necessitating excavation, and versatile enough to produce buildings customizable to every specificity of the site or the wishes of their occupants. The structure itself completely eliminates oil-based materials and metal. No nails, screws, or other fasteners were used; instead, the structure relies on friction joints. The load-bearing structure consists of a triangular timber frame resting on piles, while the cladding and wall infill is composed of CNC-milled plywood supports geometrically locked in place within the timber frame. The envelope’s water resistance comes form its rainscreen and pine-pitch caulking of its friction joints. A final layer of sprayed cork protects and seals the exposed joints under a waterproof and elastic coating. Relying solely on renewable and biobased materials allows the Harvested Home to have a negative carbon footprint; a Life Cycle Analysis of a 1 meter square sample of the structure reveals an approximately -27 kg of CO2 carbon footprint. The Harvested Home contributes to the field of biobased buildings by demonstration the latter’s potential for flexibility, adaptability, and capacity for rapid assembly.","Biobased; Housing; Life Cycle Analysis; Timber Frame; CNC; Texel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53.095009, 4.753640"

It is a quite complex phenomenon as it is part of different disciplines including fluid mechanics, structural mechanincs, vibrations and computational dynamics. It can be found in many engineering applications such as bridges, industrial chimneys, transmission lines, marine risers in petroleum production and in other hydrodynamics applications. Despite it is a well-known and widely explored topic, the modelling of vortex induced vibrations for engineering purposes still presents a lot of issues due to the complexity of the phenomena involved. These oscillations are of great interest for structural engineers, not only because of the large oscillation amplitude but also due to the long term cyclic loads which can cause significant fatigue damage to the wind turbine towers. <br/> <br/>In this thesis the phenomenon of VIV on wind turbine towers is examined. Before the commissioning of the towers in the offshore wind farms, there is a number of different load cases when these structures are susceptible to VIV. These cases are summarized in the following: (i) towers standing on the quay-side, (ii) on the vessel during their transportation offshore and (iii) as installed towers on the foundation (e.g. monopile or jacket) before the installation of the rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA). The main objective is to formulate a realistic model for the prediction of wind turbine towers response due to VIV. The tower geometry includes a tapered section at the top of the structure complicating the phenomenon. The thesis approach starts with a literature study and continues with investigating the different approaches proposed from the Standards (e.g. Eurocode) and the researchers over the years. Investigation of the theoretical background of each analytical model, sensitivity analysis of the main influencing parameters and comparison of the computed vibration amplitudes contributed to the identification of advantages and limitations of these approaches. <br/>Consequently, knowledge gained from this research and data extracted from forced oscillation experiments performed in a wind tunnel contributed to the development of a more accurate, reliable and realistic model for the prediction of the tower response due to VIV. The recommended design procedure models the fluid structure interaction through a negative aerodynamic damping and takes into account the tapered section of the tower, the effect of turbulence intensity and the shear exponent factor of the wind. Finally, fatigue analysis of the wind turbine towers is performed in order to assess the effect of VIV on the lifetime of these structures. <br/>Concluding, through the literature study and the review of the approaches proposed by the design codes and various researchers, a design procedure for the prediction of the tower response over a range of wind velocities is developed.

Powered Lower Extremity Exoskeletons (pLEE) can serve as rehabilitation devices or as orthotic devices enabling paraplegics to walk. Even though several exoskeletons have been commercialized, the existing exoskeletons’ actuators are still not optimal, since they are facing significant challenges.<br/>Some of these challenges are reducing the weight and size of the actuators, while still providing the required torque and power to produce desired joint trajectories. Also, they have limited performance and there are still torque sensing issues. Measuring output torque directly is quite difficult, thus it is measured indirectly, but often not so accurately.<br/>Compliant actuators utilise springs for torque sensing and compliance with environment, but springs usually limits their torque bandwidth. Elastic elements increase safety by dampening impacts but can make control more difficult. Lastly, torque sensing usually has practical challenges, like determining the placement, attachment, and type of sensor.<br/>The actuator’s components can be configured in many different ways, producing designs with various trade-offs that affect power output, size, weight, efficiency and mechanical robustness. Considering these trade-offs, this project focuses on developing an optimal configuration which provides a compact, lightweight, high performance exoskeleton actuator, while attempting to solve practical challenges involving torque sensing.<br/>Towards this direction, the following approach was followed:<br/>After reviewing existing Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) technologies, a new spring configuration was proposed. This configuration places the spring between the gear and the housing and measures the transmitted torque to the load.<br/>A dynamic model was developed for the proposed design and its frequency response was compared with other common SEA configurations. The simulation showed good torque transmissibility and sensitivity bandwidths. Detailed CAD designs were made for the concept and a prototype was produced.<br/>A combination of structural simulations, along with a careful component selection resulted in a very compact and lightweight design. Tests were designed to measure and evaluate the performance of the actual system. The spring stiffness calibration test showed excellent linearity, and the desired stiffness was achieved. Lastly, a good torque resolution and high torque density were achieved.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-30","","","","","",""

As a result, process simulations, especially dynamic cases, are limited in the amount of detail that can be included due to time restrictions. In addition, under certain conditions flash calculations can fail to provide acceptable results. In this work, artificial neural networks were investigated as a potentially faster and more robust alternative to conventional flash calculation methods. Classification neural networks were used to determine the phase stability of a given mixture of fluids, while regression networks were used to make predictions of thermodynamic property values. In addition to conventional flash types such as the constant pressure, constant temperature (PT), and constant pressure, constant entropy (PS) flash, neural networks are used to develop two concept flash types: a constant entropy, constant volume (SV), and a constant enthalpy, constant volume (HV) flash. All neural networks were trained on, and compared to, data generated using the PT-flash algorithm from the Thermodynamics for Engineering Applications (TEA) property calculator. Data was generated for mixtures of water and methanol over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. The artificial neural networks showed speed improvements over TEA of up to 35 times for phase classification and 15 times for property predictions. Overall phase classification accuracy scores of around 97% were achieved. Average property value prediction errors range between 0.5% and 7% when compared to the spread in magnitude of the test data, and R2 scores were in the general order of 0.95 and higher, although classification and property prediction in the two-phase region showed markedly higher errors than properties in the pure liquid or vapor regions. Moreover, thermodynamic consistency and the stability of a system consisting of multiple neural network flash types both still require considerable improvement. Finally, this work shows that artificial neural networks can be used to create unconventional flash types such a the SV- and HV-flash.","Flash calculation; Phase stability; Artifical neural networks; Vapor-liquid phase equilibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to help patients, we need to gain insight into the wound healing process and in the development of complications that come with serious burn injuries. The final goal would be to prevent or at least reduce these complications. With a mathematical model, we simulate the time-evolution of the skin after a burn injury. The objective is to be able to quantify the impact of (patient-specific) parameters on the evolution of the skin properties. In this thesis, a cell-based model for the cell migration during wound healing is presented. Two types of cells, macrophages and fibroblasts, migrate by incentives of the strain energy density and concentration fields. Two concentration fields are implemented in the model: Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β). PDGF is a chemical that occurs in the wound bed and TGF-β is secreted by the macrophages. The processes such as cell division and death are modelled through stochastic processes. In this way, the data-consuming cell history does not have to be taken into account. The computational work of the corresponding simulations increases rapidly for larger numbers of cells. This holds in particular for the part that computes the strain energy density for every cell pair. This is tackled by employing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for the largest bottlenecks. The CUDA framework is used to program the GPU, where certain parts of the computations can be run in parallel to make the computations more efficient. The GPU implementations are described in this report, alongside with the improved computation times. For a 2D simulation of one day, the speed-up in computation time from the CPU to the GPU implementation was a factor 58. To assess the accuracy of the computation of the concentration fields, Richardson’s Extrapolation is used to estimate the order of the error. More research is required on this part to achieve reasonable outcomes for the order. Moreover, an alternate approach for determining the TGF-β field by Green’s function was studied. The computational work for this method increased rapidly and was therefore unfit to be implemented in the model. Lastly, the influences of parameters on the model outcomes were investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are needed for the interpretation of the stochastic model. The influence of the time step and choice of normalization of the gradients were investigated. For the tested scenarios, the hypothesis that they behave similarly was not rejected. The single-precision implementation of the model did not lead to an overall speed-up. Especially, the increase in computation time of the solver for the concentration fields is unexpected. Using the GPU for efficiently modelling cell migration seems a good idea. The current model can be used as a basis for more sophisticated models in the future.","mathematical modelling; burn injuries; GPU computing; cell migration; wound healing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to bolted shear connectors, a timber joist was embedded in the composite slab over the web of the steel beam. After the first life cycle, the timber joist provides the cut edge of the slab. The experiment is used to model behavior of the composite beam in the first life cycle.

They provide valuable services as tourism and coastal protection. The ecosystems are linked through biological, chemical and physical processes. But they are under pressure due to sea-level rise. The response of one of the ecosystems to climate change could impact the other ecosystem. <br/><br/>In order to predict the impact of sea-level rise on the biogeomorphology in Baie Orientale and Baie de L'Embouchure, the hydrodynamic model Delft3D Flexible Mesh is applied. The effect of seagrass meadows and coral reefs on both flow and waves are captured with this model. In this way, the long term change in average hydrodynamic conditions due to sea-level rise is determined depending on the response of the ecosystems. <br/><br/>A wave-driven circulation is found in both bays with flows of 0.5 m/s over the reefs and currents of 0.2 m/s inside the bays. The hydrodynamic conditions are mainly determined by the reef height. Depending on the response of coral reefs to climate change and the amount of sea-level rise, the wave height inside the bays and the wave-induced currents increase. Under the worst-case scenario, where coral reefs degrade and seagrass meadows die, flow velocities increase by more than 100% in Baie de L'Embouchure and by 200% in Baie Orientale under a sea-level rise of 0.87 m. The significant wave height rises to 300% in Baie Orientale and doubles in Baie de L'Embouchure. But this increase of hydrodynamic stresses is not expected to lead to devastating damage to coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Instead, the response of coral reefs will be determined by changing water temperatures and ocean acidification. A shift in seagrass occurrence due to the changed hydrodynamics is expected. <br/><br/>The long term impact of sea-level rise on the biogeomorphology of Baie de L'Embouchure and Baie Orientale seems to be limited. The ability to mitigate the impact of sea-level rise is shown and the resilience of the ecosystems proved, which is very promising for other shallow Caribbean bays that are threatened by sea-level rise. <br","Delft3D-FM; Sea-level rise; Climate change; Coral reefs; Seagrass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","SCENES","18.086944, -63.021944"

(mentor); Peters, Ravi (mentor); Joosten, Peter (mentor); van Someren, Berry (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In this thesis, an image-based method is proposed for solving the relative translation errors of 3D point clouds collected by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) techniques. The process of matching 3D point clouds is known as registration. Due to environment-depending limitations of the positioning component of MLS systems, when recording a certain scene more than once, point clouds recorded at different times tend to have mainly positioning distortions. Additionally, due to yaw-angle errors of the recording platform it is possible that the point clouds have small distortions around their Z axis or the point clouds are scanned with fuzziness. This project deals only with the translation errors. Various methods can be found in the literature to perform pair-wise registration of point clouds. Commonly, the challenge of aligning 3D features is tackled in 3D. Only a few techniques for registering point clouds in 2D have being explored. However, the approach presented in this thesis uses the attributes of the 3D points to generate and match 2D-projections, by employing a simple correlation technique instead of matching in 3D. As a result, the developed method depends more on the<br/>number of pixels in the 2D-projections and less on the number of points in the point clouds. This leads to a more cost-efficient method in contrast to 3D registration techniques. The method uses this benefit to provide redundant translation parameters for each point cloud pair. Particularly, several images are created from each point cloud tile. The constructed images illustrate the density of the points, the intensity, the gradient of intensity, the depth, the gradient of the depth and the normal vectors of the points. As a result, the translation parameters are retrieved from the matching of various image-techniques and that is how redundant solutions are provided. Next, with the utilization of image-based evaluation criteria the reliable translation parameters are detected and only those are used to compute the final solutions. The reliable estimations are taken into account for the estimation of the final solutions. Since redundant solutions are provided, the confidence levels of each final estimation can be computed. In addition, an indication of robustness showing how many estimations where included for the computation of the final solution is included. As a result, the developed approach is capable of providing information about the precision and reliability of each pairwise registration. In such a way it is known which of the results can be used in a following step, such as a global registration. Furthermore, a 2D Gaussian elliptical fitting is used to obtain sub-pixel accuracy registration results, as the accuracy of the estimations is restricted to the pixel size of the generated images. It is proven that the developed image-based registration method has the capability to produce reliable matches when there is at least some overlap between two overlapping point clouds and corresponding objects between the point clouds are distinct in pairs of 2D projections. The technique developed for the computation of sub-pixel accuracy results seems to have potential, but further improvement is required.","point clouds; registration; reliability; Image processing; sub-pixel accuracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Therefore, this research examines the impact of geotextile application on slope stability in newly-elevated area in Yuriage, Natori City, Japan. This project discussed the analysis of geotextile-reinforced slope by comparing the total displacement at the crest of slope between the compaction method as current design and the using of geotextile with further investigation by optimising the use of geotextile application.<br/>A cross-section of slope with 0.435m height and 29 degrees slope angle were chosen for the geometry of analysis. Two loads acted on the slope such as the uniform load on top of the raised area and dynamic load from the earthquake were defined. Six layers that mostly consist of sandy soils were determined based on the SPT data in 16 locations. The average values of N-SPT were calculated for further parameter correlations based on these values. Furthermore, analyses based on the Limit Equilibrium method and Finite Element Method were selected to analyse the slope stability.<br/>Limit Equilibrium Method using D-Geo stability software based on the Bishop method was taken to define safety factor of slope under uniform load (without earthquake load). The value of safety factor at 1.93 was obtained then compared to the result for the same problem based on the Finite Element Method using PLAXIS 2D with HS Small model that resulted at 2.07 safety factor. Further dynamic analysis was also completed using PLAXIS 2D with UBCSAND model to calculate the total displacement at slope crest without and with geotextile application. The strengthening method using geotextile (500 kN/m tensile strength, 5004 kN/m axial stiffness, 30m length in 5 layers) decreased the total displacement from 0.543m to 0.434m. However, the impact of geotextile is very limited in this case that only decrease 0.109m or about 20% from the total displacement without geotextile. Weak foundation, silty clayey sand layer (AC1) and liquefied layers (AC1 and fine sand AS22) below the slope were observed as the main reasons for this small impact of geotextile. Therefore, geotextile method is not recommended to use in this project given its very limited impact on the total displacement. Furthermore, the soil improvement methods were proposed to tackle these two reasons, such as replacing the soil material (AC1) with stronger soil for the foundation under the slope and/or construct sand pile to minimize the liquefied layer below the slope until AS21 depth, about 6 meters.<br/>Further analysis based on combination of five values of geotextile strengths, four difference lengths, and three number of layers were made to get the optimum used of geotextile by comparing the total displacement at the crest. The first factor that has to be considered is the strength of geotextile because this factor gives more influence in the final total displacement. Secondly, with the high strength of geotextile, the length should be considered first rather than the number of layers based on the impact of both factor on the influence of strength to the total of displacement.","Slope Stability; geotextile; Earthquakes; Japan; Plaxis; D-Geo Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-18","","","","Geo-Engineering","","38.181387, 140.941295"

This research aims to build a bridge between non-technical and technical decision makers to accelerate blockchain innovation in the mortgage securitisation process. The study is supported by six interviews and four discussions with experts in the field of securitisation and blockchain technology. The viable BPMN model determined that blockchain is able to transform the securitisation industry, but not with a public and permissionless network. <br/><br","Blockchain; Securitisation; BPMN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-09-01","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The purpose is that the proposed methodology covers all phases of development, from planning to operation, not only to minimize but to avoid impacts and to maximize benefits.

This methodology for developing a greenfield Green Port, covering the stages of planning, design, construction and operation (and management) is based on several top green philosophies in which all criteria that contribute to any green goal are based on. These criteria can be evaluated by means of a proposed evaluation framework, giving a final score to get an insight on how green the port is, which is tested and refined with a case study for the planning phase. <br/>As a conclusion of the case study application, several implementation issues of Green Ports have been identified and some possible solutions for the success of the sustainable option are proposed, for which a general shift in mentality is required. <br","Sustainability; sustainableports; ports; greenports","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","","",""

(TU Delft Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science)","Doerr, Christian (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The internet is rapidly growing, and with it grows the number of malicious actors. For many attacks, the attacker first scans the internet to detect vulnerable devices. In order to evade detection, the attacker distributes the scanning over a large number of machines. Because attackers are distributing this scanning and there is no way to find these scanners, we have no knowledge of what groups are actually scanning the internet and what they are up to. This thesis proposes a method to identify and fingerprint these distributed scanning groups. It does so in order to detect and analyze slow scanning groups that are actively trying to remain undetected by companies. The data used for this thesis originates from a large network telescope operated by the TU Delft, which contains packet data aimed at the TU delft network range. First, this data is analyzed in detail and several patterns are discovered. Using the analysis, a method is created to cluster the dataset without losing critical information needed to identify scanning groups. After the clustering, the resulting smaller datasets are analyzed in more detail. To do this post-processing, a new method of analyzing scanning behavior is created. This method is called XOR-analysis and works by looking at different patterns that scanners use to re-identify their packets. From the analysis, groups are extracted and fingerprinted. These fingerprints can ultimately be used as Indicators of Compromise to detect and mitigate scanning behavior in order to deny adversaries the possibility to learn about weaknesses of a system.","Cyber Threat Intelligence; Scanners; XOR sequence number; APT; TTP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis of hydrological response often requires the correct use and interpretation of temporal parameters such as lag time adapted to complexities and requirements of urban environments.<br/>In this thesis, the development of a hydrological response methodology that avails itself of the statistical framework of IAT for the hydrological response analysis is suggested by proposing a new lag time definition based on IAT. This new definition was evaluated through the analysis of discharge and precipitation time series of fifteen years. The IAT lag time results were compared against classical methods used to define and compute lag time such as centroid-to-centroid (C-to-C) and peak-to-peak (P-to-P) methods. Finally, a validation procedure is carried out to assess the validity of the proposed IAT lag time definition.<br/>Results from the computation of hydrological response values using each of the three methods showed some relevant similarities but also exhibited varying behaviours and limitations based on the proposed methodology for the definition of the hydrological events. Statistical distributions of the IAT lag time method and C-to-C method had similar distributions, in contrast to what was observed for the statistical distribution of P-to-P values. Results from the IAT lag time method suggested a more stable and flexible methodology compared to the classical methods.<br/>The IAT lag time method can potentially be used to have a more dynamic and tailored interpretation of the hydrological response behaviour in urban areas.

Another important limitation continues to be the low transverse strength of unidirectional composite plies, which can lead to premature failure in common laminates such as the cross-ply. A tool that promises improvements on both of these fronts is computational modeling. With ever increasing computing power, today’s multi-scale-models are able to simulate the various failure modes across the relevant length scales, and allow a new level of optimization by accurately determining the contributing material parameters.<br/><br/>To fully exploit this capability, we propose a ‘smart’ framework, combining Computational Modeling, Design of Experiments, and Neural Networks. It is developed with the aim to create analytical surrogate models of complex material properties, in a fully automated way, and based on a minimum amount of computer simulations. While such a framework can be universally applied, we will showcase our results for one possible application: the prediction and optimization of the transverse strength of a unidirectional composite ply.<br/><br/>Generating Statistical Volume Elements of the material at microscale, we use a Computational Micromechanics model to compute the ply’s strength under transverse loading. By Design of Experiment principles, we then explore the interdependent influences of the main geometrical and material parameters. Finally, we obtain an analytical surrogate model of the transverse strength by employing a Neural Network.<br/><br/>Putting to use the developed ‘smart’ framework, the effects of the following parameters were studied: constituent strengths (matrix, fiber-matrix-interface), fiber volume fraction, shape of fiber cross-section (circular or non-circular), and fiber diameter. The results confirm and quantify the primary influence of the constituent strengths, followed by the secondary effect of the fiber volume fraction. Non-circular fiber cross-sections were found to increase transverse compressive strength, and mixing of different fiber diameters may increase slightly both tensile and compressive strength.<br/><br/>In addition to presenting the resulting surrogate models, challenges in the development and automation of the framework will be discussed, and the case will be made for wider application of such a framework.","Design of Experiments; Computational Micromechanics; Neural Networks; Composites; Transverse Strength; Fiber Shape; Hybrid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The project team consisted of 6 core- members from both Sohar University and TU Delft along with 5 more students, together appointed to help find an answer for a problem stated by Sohar Industrial Port Company and Majis Industrial Services.<br/>This paper proposes a deep seawater intake for the cooling water system of Sohar Industrial Port, Oman. In the region’s summers, surface water temperatures tend to rise to very high levels. Among other things, this results in inefficient cooling of the processes associated with the steel manufacturers, petrochemical plants, refineries and power plants present in the port. The proposed inlet subtracts water 4 km offshore at an average temperature of 24.9 ±C. Using this colderwater, the demand is expected to go downwith approx. 2% in the winter and 16% in the summer, saving system capacity and pumping costs. The 2,148 MW generated power at Sohar port is expected to increase efficiency by 0.72%. Furthermore, the coastal waters are vulnerable to algal blooms. These toxic algae can not be filtered out efficiently and lead to temporary closure of the desalination plants (mainly Reverse Osmosis) causing a threat to the drinking water supply in the entire north of Oman. This paper concludes however that there is not an (economically) feasible inlet location that is unaffected by the algal blooms. Other water characteristics such as turbidity and organic content are also expected not to show significant improvement at the proposed inlet location but more elaborate measurements should validate this.<br/>A technical feasibility study was conducted to find the optimal system design. Multiple alternative materials being metals, alloys, HDPE and concrete have been investigated to serve as water conveyors to transport the water from the inlet to the shore. A possible design for the off-shore water inlet structure was made as well as a recommended design for the connection of the pipelines with the current facilities. Site selection, material selection, friction head loss calculations, pipeline sizing, concrete ballast weights, seabed pipeline stability and planning have been discussed in this report. Finally, a financial feasibility study has been conducted. A model was built and costs have been quantitatively estimated based on the technical design. Benefits have been quantified where possible and if not, were qualitatively described. It is concluded that it is not financially feasible to build a deep seawater intake for the entire port. Building a limited-scale variant, only providing RO and power plants, is a better solution but still unfeasible. Recommendation is done to scrutinise the processes within power plants and RO-plants further as their potential benefits are considerable.","Feasibility study off-shore seawater intake","en","student report","","","","","","Master Project Report","","2020-10-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","MDP269","24.3, 56.7"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The thesis investigates the possible space application of a commercial 3D NAND memory as a radiation monitor. Literature has indicated that both traditional 2D and 3D flash memories are sensitive to ionizing radiation. Where the track of particle could be seen passing through the 3D architecture. A flash memory cell stores data with a collection of charge of which some is lost after a particle event. This loss can be measured as a shift in the threshold voltage. A relationship exists between the energy of a particle and the threshold voltage shift. A methodology was developed to measure the threshold voltage of memory cells in a Micron 64 layer 3D NAND memory. By modifying the threshold voltage of boundary separating two logic states, a bit flip can be introduced. A page of memory cells will be reread multiple times, each time with a slightly increased or decreased voltage offset. It is determined that a measurement could be made with a theoretical error as low as 7.5 mV. Based on literature on 3D NAND memory architectures and die and SEM images for the Micron device, the corresponding physical size of a memory cell, page and block were estimated. A memory block measures 7360 ¹m (depth) x 3.37 ¹m (height) x 9.5 ¹m (width). A set of SPENVIS simulations estimate that a single block may see less than one GCR particle event every ten days. If it is possible to detect protons, 104 events may be seen in an ISS orbit, up to 109 events for a MEO orbit. In order to validate the proposed measurement methodology, a test setup was developed with which instructions can be executed on a memory. Requirements for this development were based on the ONFI specification, which standardizes the software and hardware interfaces with memories. The setup features a ZedBoard FPGA, where a VHDL memory controller generates the requested control signals. The interface between the FPGA and memory is provided through a custom designed PCB, which also powers the memory. A memory is placed in a socket such that different devices can be tested. Python scripts generate the correct sequence of commands to execute voltage threshold measurements. A Micron SSD was acquired, from which the 64 layer 3D NAND memory packages were unsoldered. These memories were then used for testing. A first set of tests prove that it is possible to perform voltage threshold shift measurements. The general measurements show the expected voltage distributions. Interesting observations were made when investigating the measurements for a single cell: they do not always transition immediately from one logic state to another. A second interesting observation is that the same cell returned different voltage readings for consequent read cycles. These behaviors should be investigating in further research, as they will impact the errors in the measurement. Concluding, a methodology is proposed and validated to measure the threshold voltage. A test setup was developed and proves the in house capability of making these measurements. It is possible to advance with the study of the radiation effects on the memories. Based on these results, further developments could lead to a future space radiation monitoring payload based on 3D NAND memories.","3D NAND; floating gate; Micron; space radiation; radiation detection; flash memory; ONFI; 3D NAND memory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In addition, the increasing occurrence of human-induced earthquakes in the province of Groningen due to gas extraction, arises uncertainties regarding the seismic behaviour and earthquake resistance of existing bridges in this area. The Nieuwklap bridge is a reinforced concrete solid slab bridge located in the Groningen province, combining both characteristics under investigation.<br/>In the course of this research, the first two Levels of Assessment have been applied for the static analysis of the slab part of the deck of the Nieuwklap bridge, which was found to have sufficient shear and bending moment resistance under the application of the traffic loading defined by the current standards. The equivalent proof load tandems, that generate the same shear and bending moment stresses, for each load combination level have been found with both approaches, proving that localized phenomena at the area of load application are more intense when the field experiment takes place. Furthermore, by obtaining the equivalent tandem loading that leads to shear and flexural failure of the concrete slab, it has been concluded that flexural failure due to yielding of the reinforcement will occur first in case of exerting the collapse loading on the flexure-critical positions or on the shear-critical positions next to the end-supports. However, in case of applying the tandem loading on a shear-critical position next to a continuous support it is difficult to define which failure mode will precede. <br/>Regarding the seismic evaluation of the Nieuwklap bridge, the simplified fundamental mode method and a modal response spectrum analysis have been used. The bridge deck has been found to have adequate resistance against the vertical component of the seismic excitation, which cannot be considered critical, generating nearly the half stresses compared to the traffic load (LM1) combination defined by Eurocode 2. The piers and the pendulums supporting the bridge deck have been also evaluated against the two horizontal components of the seismic excitation, for two different earthquake return periods, discovering that they are able to withstand the generated forces without additional measures. Finally, from the performed modal analysis it has been obtained that movement of the bridge on the longitudinal direction can be observed in lower frequencies compared to the vertical and the transverse direction and that more than 10 modes are necessary in order to describe accurately the bridge behaviour.<br/>This Thesis describes the framework that can be used to prepare collapse tests at multiple Levels of Assessment, and for the seismic assessment of existing bridges in regions with recently initiated seismic activity.<br","Slab bridges; Collapse test; Finite element analysis; Seismic response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

When a pipeline is laid to the seabed, both ends of the pipeline are sealed with an end-piece. This end-piece fulfills an important role when the pipeline is being commissioned. In order to be accepted, the pipeline has to undergo Flooding, Gauging and Testing. For the hydro-test, water is pumped into the pipeline from the supply vessel through a flexible hose. The connection between the flexible hose and the end-piece is made with a so-called hot stab. To align and to connect male and female sections of the hot stab, a Remotely Operated Vehicle is used. This alignment, and stabbing process is proven to be challenging and sometimes resulting in damaged equipment and project delays. This thesis comprises a conceptual design and motion analysis for an improved concept of the subsea hot stab operation specifically developed for large diameter flexible hoses and heavy stabs.<br/><br/>The approach for this thesis starts with a research to find out limitations of the current equipment used. As a result, it has been concluded that a high stiffness of the flexible hose is the main cause of time consuming alignment and related problems, experienced by the Remotely Operated Vehicle operator. Various concepts have been generated, combined and rated using a Multi Criteria Analysis. The solution that scored the highest rank has been analyzed in order to predict the dynamic behavior of the whole system. System parameters have been optimized to reduce the undesired motions and to minimize forces that are required for alignment of a stab by the Remotely Operated Vehicle.<br/><br/>Combining the obtained knowledge from the research, the concept study and the analytical model, the following is concluded: it is beneficial to use a vertical orientation of the hot stab, instead of a commonly used horizontal orientation, in combination with buoyancy modules to support the flexible hose in an ‘S’ shape orientation as it reduces the loads during a subsea hot stab operation. This solution is adaptable for large range of water depths and does not exceed the maximum load capacity for the manipulators of the Remotely Operated Vehicle thereby preventing damaged equipment and project delays.<br","hot stab; subsea; pipelaying","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-31","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Its alarming impact on global climate has prompted the United Nations (UN) to set up its sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ERC) is one of the solutions of carbon neutral cycle, which can be driven by renewable energy sources for utilizing CO2 to produce high energy density fuels/feedstocks. In this way, CO2 becomes a carbon source for the production of renewable fuels/feedstocks. However, ERC in aqueous solutions is a severely mass-transfer limited process, mainly due to low CO2 solubility in such solutions. Flow-cells have been found to be promising in mitigating this problem as compared to H-cells, making them more suitable for the commercial realization of ERC. Moreover, high pressures and continuous flow of electrolyte have been shown to lower the mass-transfer limitations. However, their simultaneous influence on ERC in flow-cells has not been explicitly analyzed. <br/><br/>This work primarily focuses on ERC using tin (Sn) electrodes, in which formate is the main product of interest. During ERC in aqueous electrolytes, CO2 is known to undergo an electrode reaction as well as a homogeneous reaction. This dual action increases the modeling complexity. In this study, a simplified analytical 1D model is developed to find the conditions under which the previously mentioned CO2 homogeneous reaction can be safely neglected. It is found that CO2 can be assumed to undergo only the electrode reaction at low current densities (lower than 7 mA/cm2). However, the current densities for commercial realization are about 100- 200 mA/cm2, which therefore requires incorporating the CO2 homogeneous reactions in the model.<br/> <br/>Therefore, a multiphysics model of a flow-cell is developed. The model demonstrates how different pressures, velocities and cell potentials influence the current densities and the faradaic efficiencies of different products as well as pH near the cathode (surface pH). At atmospheric pressure, for a constant cell potential, increasing the velocity by an order of magnitude is observed not only to increase the faradaic efficiency of formate by about 20% but it is also found to lower the surface pH. In addition, at a fixed velocity, to maintain a constant faradaic efficiency of formate at high total current densities (for instance, 100 mA/cm2) requires using higher pressures. The results from this work will help future modeling studies to simplify their models when investigating low current densities, and it will guide the experimental studies on flow cells to select appropriate operating conditions.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WPT is gaining popularity because it presents several advantages over the power transfer through cable, such as the galvanic insulation between the power source and the load, the possibility of on-road charging for private electric vehicles, and it obviates the need of bringing around bulky cables of portable devices, especially the ones not standardized yet. <br/><br/>The subject of this thesis is an e-bike WPT charging system, using electromagnetic power transfer with resonant coupling. The WPT works through two coupled ferromagnetic coils with compensation capacitors. In particular, this thesis focuses on the control of the inverter of the e-bike WPT charging system. <br/>Initially, some background on the WPT is given. Then, the problem treated in this project is defined, explaining the whole e-bike WPT charging system with its goals and constraints. The inductive and the resonant coupling are explained, including the possible compensation networks. Moreover, two different definitions of the bifurcation phenomenon are analyzed and compared. After this, power electronics topologies for both the primary and the secondary converters are presented, and the most suitable ones are chosen. Two possible operations for the inverter are discussed: the fixed frequency and the auto-resonant frequency operation. Additionally, a survey on the existing communication standards for WPT is presented, focusing in detail on the Qi specification from the Wireless Power Consortium. <br/>The main contribution of this thesis is then explained in detail, which is the design of the control loop for the inverter, such that it works at auto-resonant frequency by automatically changing the operating point to achieve ZCS. The e-bike WPT charging system working at auto-resonant frequency gives a higher efficiency than when it is working at fixed frequency. Another crucial part of this thesis is also the validation of the theoretical model with measurements on a laboratory set-up. Finally, the main conclusions on the inverter control for the e-bike WPT charging system are given, together with recommendations for future research on the topic.<br","Wireless; Charging; Control; Bifurcation; Resonant coupling; WPT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-29","","","","","",""

They are a hot wire of polysilicon with constant temperature profile that used as the IR light source, and the LVOF which is aimed at IR spectral range. In order to have the desired IR source, the hot wire should have temperature distribution as uniform as possible based on black-body emission. Thus, the thermal mechanics inside the hot wire is fully studied including heat generation, conduction, convection and radiation. The thermal energy is electrically generated by voltage and current source. While the heat loss causing non-uniformity on temperature is mainly induced by heat conduction between the hot wire body and substrate, and to surrounding air. For the first one, the geometry including the length, width and thickness, the resistivity profile of hot wire and the meander bridge at the end of hot wire body are designed. The meander bridge works as the connection and interface to substrate which to some extent determines the heat conduction through it. Moreover, it can bear tensile force induced by thermal expansion. Besides, the meander middle bridge is added to hot wire as well in some design plans for stronger mechanical stability. On the other hand, since the temperature on hot wire is significant related to air pressure due to heat conduction to surrounding air, all hot wires are designed to operate in vacuum environment. Finally, a bunch of hot wires with different geometry, resistivity and TCR are designed and fabricated. To design the LVOF aimed at IR band, the working schematics and properties of LVOF are firstly studied in depth. All factors such as reflectance, incident angle, cone angle and so on that might affect its performance which includes the most important transmittance are researched. The LVOF is also designed in different length and tilt angle. The case that the LVOF with the hot wire as IR source is paid special attention to. Eventually, the electrical property and optical performance of hot wire is measured in vacuum chamber by FLIR IR camera. So far, the hot wire that has best performance is the one comprised of array of short hot wires.

Since online privacy is becoming more crucial than ever, it is essential to preserve the privacy of individuals whenever possible. Therefore, anonymous attestation of digital credentials should be feasible, where provers can selectively disclose attributes and create abstractions over attributes in their credential, in order to solely disclose the minimum amount of information required to complete the goal of verification.<br/><br/>Many schemes in the field of attribute-based credentials consider a single root authority issuing credentials to provers. This is coherent to the traditional way of the issuance of credentials since the process of producing physical documents is costly to distribute to multiple issuers. Digital identities provide the opportunity for authorities to distribute credential issuance rights (consecutively) to smaller entrusted entities.<br/><br/>To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first protocol which combines both anonymous attestation with attribute-based credentials and the delegation of selective signing rights for the issuance of these credentials. Root authorities could delegate signing rights for selective attributes consecutively to trustees, which are able to create anonymous attribute-based credentials with the acquired attributes for provers. Verifiers are able to verify presentation tokens with solely the public key of the root authority, without gaining knowledge about the identities of the prover and intermediate delegators. We introduce three adapted signature schemes based on existing work in order to realize a concrete instantiation of the protocol. Anonymity is achieved by incorporating Schnorr's zero-knowledge proof of knowledge with bilinear pairings to efficiently prove the correctness of presentation tokens.<br/><br/>We realized a prototype of our concrete instantiation and optimized the verification algorithm in order to achieve optimal pairing performance. Complexity analysis of the protocol shows improvement in efficiency by aggregating attribute signatures throughout signing right delegation. Experimental results demonstrate a degree of practical feasibility for the verification of presentation tokens on commodity hardware within the challenging public transportation access control time bound of 300 ms.<br","digital credentials; anonymous attestation; delegatable signing rights; digital identity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

Such a face-off is called a standards battle. This level of competition can slow market adoption and increases costs for all those involved. It is therefore important to better understand standards battles and analyze possibilities to better approach them in the future. Scholars have worked to create frameworks of factors for dominance and some have even combined these with a view of the dominance process to reach a progress-based overview of battles in general. Such an overview can help standard supporters, those firms that introduce and promote a standard, to identify and leverage factors in their battles at the correct time. <br/><br/>This research is a continuation of this approach, working towards a general template for future battles and attempting to validate previous results. A literature review was conducted to select a framework of factors for dominance, to find a selection of phases to divide the progression of a standards battle, and to review previous research’s statements regarding the importance of factors during specific phases. The framework constructed by v.d. Kaa (Van de Kaa et al., 2011) was selected as the framework of factors and the division of phases as described by Suarez (Suarez, 2004) was chosen. An overview of the existing literature on the combination of both factors and phases was then constructed. This provided a reference against which the results of this research were later compared. A selection of factors was then made for each phase using previous literature and an expert interview. Ten experts from the consumer electronics, information technology and telecommunications industries were selected using convenience sampling. The experts were asked to weigh the selected factors against each other in each phase using the Best-Worst Method. This is a Multi Criteria Decision Making method that provides a set of weights from two different comparisons made for each phase. From the responses, the weights of the separate factors were calculated. From this calculation a consistency indicator was also derived. All results met the required consistency. The sets of weights were combined to reach average weights for each phase. These results were analyzed and interpreted to provide further understanding. The highest rated factors are: technological superiority for the first and second phase, timing of entry for the third phase, complementary goods for the fourth phase and installed base for the fifth phase. A comparison with existing literature was performed. This showed an indication for dynamics observed by den Uijl (Den Uijl, 2015) and a general match with statements made by Suarez (Suarez, 2004). <br/><br/>The novel approach of this research to consider factors for dominance in combination with the phases of a battle using expert interviews to reach a view on battles in general has not been used before. It therefore also has interesting implications. The results of this research provide a partial validation of claims from other scholars regarding the importance of factors for dominance during phases of a standards battle. They also provide additional information on the progression of the contribution of factors and are the first step towards a progress-based template for battles in general. It was shown that there are similarities and differences between different industries in which standards battles take place. The findings of this thesis can be used by industry actors to better adjust their standard and standard supporter characteristics to what is required at each stage of a battle. It will also help them identify factors that competition may be lacking, opening up new possibilities for targeted competition. Future research is this field is required. A fully quantitative approach using a complete set of factors can give a more definitive answer to the posed research questions. This research provides the starting point towards a cross-industry applicable selection of highly contributive and lowly contributive factors depending on the stage of the technology. More research could be done on the differences and similarities between industries using a historical approach.","Standards; Battle; Factor; Dominance; Phases","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If Pd-based membranes are designed in nanoscale, then the introduced high volume fraction of grain boundaries can act as fast diffusion paths for hydrogen atoms that leading to an increase of hydrogen separation rate. However, due to the substantial amounts of grain boundaries, the nanocrystalline material tends to show a rapid grain growth at operating temperature (that leading to the coarse grains), which may lead to the failure of this membrane in further applications. However, grain growth could be effectively inhibited by thermodynamic stabilization method-that is solute segregation to grain boundary region. In this thesis, a thermodynamic grain boundary segregation model is developed and is applied to many types of metallic binary alloys, including the Pd-Cu, Pd-Zr, Pd-Y, Fe-Zr, Y-Fe and so on. From this model, the segregation tendency of alloying constituents is determined, and the solute concentration in grain boundary is obtained. Moreover, the grain boundary energy (GB) of investigated alloys can be calculated via this model, by comparing the calculated GB energy with that of pure Pd, we are able to determine whether these alloys can be stabilized by the segregation-introduced thermodynamic stabilization. These calculated results have been compared with those reported in the literature, verifying the predictability of this model. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, including the XRD residual stress measurement and X-ray peak broadening analysis have been performed on both Pd<sub>0.7</sub>Cu<sub>0.3</sub> and pure Pd thin films, the experimental results will help us determine whether the solute segregation occurs and whether this alloy can be stabilized by the solute segregation.","Modelling; Grain boundary segregation; Grain growth; Pd-based alloys; Pd-Cu","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-01","","","","","",""

However, Bitcoin and altcoins are not issued by the central banks or other central authorities, making it difficult to regulate. At the same time, in several countries, the use of cash is declining to a very low rate. As the response to these economic phenomena, central banks in some countries are investigating the possibility of introducing their own version of digital currency which is called central bank-issued digital currency or CBDC.

The interviewees were the experts from central banks, commercial bank, regulatory bodies, and relevant NGOs in the European developed economies. The results of the interview sessions showed several findings. First, according to the experts, there are three main CBDC design options: Retail CBDC, Wholesale CBDC, and Full-reserve Depository Banks CBDC. Second, among the three transactional dimensions of TCE (uncertainty, transaction frequency, and asset specificity), the uncertainty aspect provides a significant contribution to overall transaction costs. Third, the central bank and commercial banks are the ones that bear most of the transaction costs, especially in Retail CBDC design option, while the households and non-financial institutions do not need to bear any transaction costs.","Central bank-issued digital currency; CBDC; transaction cost economics; TCE; transaction costs; digital currency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In the case of urban mobility, this trend is subsequently followed by the existence of high-frequency bus transit service since last decades. This service is more prone to the bus-bunching problem since the headway between the consecutive buses can be very short, and the passenger demand is typically higher. It becomes very important to keep the service reliability in an adequate state. Applying a headway-based control strategy is an alternative to obtain an efficient and reliable high-frequency bus operation.<br/>Different issues could be found before applying control strategy in a transit system. In the early stage, selection on which control to apply can be dilemmatic. Among different category of control strategies, holding control is the preferable one to mitigate the irregularity problem. However, there are several contrary arguments on this and stating that speed adjustment as a form of “holding”, could obtain a better impact on passengers. Once the strategy is chosen, another issue might appear during the strategy development. To whose perspective the control strategy has to be built. Most attention is usually given to the passenger, while the others are given less attention. Drivers and network impact are the two factors that are often ruled out, even though both are important in determining the performance of control strategy during the implementation. While the attention is all concentrated to yield high serviceability, the practicality is usually forgotten.<br/>Depart from these problems. Thus, the goal of this study is to develop a headway control strategy based on a combination of several measures and to evaluate it from a practical point of view.","Public Transport; Control strategies; Holding control; Speed adjustment; Transit operation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To support and speed up the transition phase from fossil fuels to renewables it is necessary to decrease the costs. Offshore Wind Turbines are widely used for the production of renewable energy and several Offshore Wind Turbine projects are planned for the future. Most of the Offshore Wind Turbines are founded by monopile, large steel tube, to support the wind turbine. Nowadays, these monopile be installed by either jack-up vessel or moored floating vessel. However, these installation method come with a major drawback: the installation procedure is time consuming. A new installation method is propose to reduce the installation time. This thesis focus of the feasibility to install the monopile with a dynamically positioned (DP) vessel. The<br/>required station keeping situation is faster achieved with a DP vessel. Due to the footprint of the DP vessel relative to an earth fixed position, a vessel motion compensated pile gripper is used to maintain the upright position of the monopile and to decrease the interaction forces between vessel and monopile. Adding the monopile to the vessel is an off-design condition for the DP controller. During the early hammering phase of the monopile, the monopile have limited interaction with the soil and is unstable. The upright position is maintain by the gripper frame. The forces from the gripper frame on the monopile are reaction forces on the vessel. Beside these forces, environmental forces are acting on the monopile and via the gripper frame acting on the vessel. The forces on the vessel could lead to unstable behavior and/or increased vessel footprint. A simulation model is build to investigate the behavior of the DP vessel during the operation. A industry used DP simulator and a simulation model of the Bokalift1 is used. A model of a typical shallow water and deep water monopile is build. A hydraulic based gripper frame is simulated with an inclination controller and a induced vessel motion controller which need<br/>to maintain the upright position of the monopile. The inclination controller is tuned with a higher bandwidth compare to the bandwidth of the DP controller to prevent motions of the monopile is the same frequency range as the linear motions of the vessel. The forces from the gripper frame are fed into the Kalman filter of the DP controller. This is done to prevent a drift of the vessel when the gripper frame starts acting on the vessel. In all simulation cases with governing environmental conditions, the vessel could maintain stable behavior. The rotations of the monopile are in the same frequency as the first order wave forces on the vessel. This relative high frequency motions to not significantly amplify the position of the DP vessel. However, despite the fact of feeding the Kalman filter, a larger drift is observed in case of the large, deep water monopile in the operation stage when the gripper frame force is introduced to the vessel. This increase the requirement on the envelope of the gripper frame. The requirement on the gripper frame is given in terms of power, force and envelope based on governing environmental conditions. The requirements on the gripper frame are assumed to be within an acceptable magnitude. The operation seams to be promising in the future.","Monopile foundation; Dynamically Positioned vessel; Vessel motion compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Furthermore, it is likely that these kinds of events would become more recurrent due to the stranded expansion of aged Electrical Power System (EPS) infrastructures in Europe for coping with the increased societal and environmental pressure for massive deployment of adopting Renewable Energy Source (RES)-based generation, which is known for having a variable characteristic. It is expected that RES will become the dominant factor in the power grid and will gradually replace Conventional Synchronous Generation Units (CGU), and it is known that Offshore Wind Farms (OffWF) are more suitable for large-scale generation applications. However, RES, including Wind Farms (WF), are not well aligned to work with EPS that were designed fifty - to - sixty years ago, due to reduced inertia, reduced short-circuit power, and limited control capabilities that imply the integration of RES. Moreover, more grids will contain more renewables, and thus more risks of outages could arise as one fault can trigger another one as a domino effect, deriving in widespread disruptions, including regional blackouts. <br/><br/>In this context, the contemporary control systems that regulate WF inject power to the grid via Power-Electronic Interfaces (PEI), and their schemes are designed to not interfere actively with the safe and secure regulation of a large-scaled EPS. On the contrary, they are just limited to inject a predetermined power injection setpoint with a current-injection control method that assumes all the time this power has load demand to go (grid-following control). However, this is not the case when unplanned islanding or an outage arises in an EPS, as the WF currently do not possess a control system that regulates the frequency of an island. <br/><br/>This MSc Thesis Project presents the design, implementation and testing of a control system attached to type-4 Wind Turbines (WT) that can manage and tightly ensure the load and generation balance during any circumstance, including a massive blackout. This control method can successfully regulate voltage, reactive power and frequency, which can be adapted automatically to the real-time conditions of the grid. The scheme takes the grid-following control approach as a starting point, which was modified in order to have Grid-Forming and Black-Start capabilities. The proposed new control approach for grid-forming and black-start design was implemented in DIgSILENT PowerFactory 2018, where a total of seventeen large-scaled type-4 WF are located into a three-area EPS. The Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) WF containing the proposed grid-forming control system are accompanied by Hydro, Nuclear and Thermal Plants, accounting CGU. Additionally, the three-area EPS also contains two HVDC Transmission Systems composed each by two Voltage-Source Converters (VSC), which also have similar grid-forming and black-start capabilities, and seven Battery-Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which give auxiliary power to the Black-Start Units and frequency support to the areas with loss of generation. The WF, BESS and the HVDC stations are interfaced via modelled Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) controlled voltage sources. <br/><br/>The proposed grid-forming and black-start capabilities of the three-area EPS were tested with several EMT simulations reproducing severe short-circuit faults followed by a loss-of-generation scenario, the blocking of the HVDC converter stations and a massive relay protection program, resulting in the full outage and isolation of the area responsible for the largest power supply in the three-area EPS. After the blackout, the three-area EPS performed a Restoration plan, from the generation resetting and the reconnection of lines, transformers, etc., to the final (cold) load pick-up stage. In order to evaluate the advantage of using utility-scaled WF with grid-forming controllers to execute a conjunct Black-Start and Restoration plan, two operational scenarios were performed: one with 90% wind power share and another without any participation of wind power. As a consequence of the implementation of the proposed grid-forming control systems, the simulation results endorse that an EPS with 90% wind power share can steer a Black-Start and Restoration operation when required.","HVDC technology; Offshore Wind Power; EMT Model; PowerFactory; Battery Energy Storage System; Power System Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Today fear is embedded in the physical characteristics of the urban space and how it is perceived by its inhabitants. It transforms the spatial behaviors of the contemporary citizens into introverted spatial biographies of fear, where the public spaces have become the ’dangerous outside world’ (De Cauter, 2004) to be avoided when possible. The most crucial outcome of this ongoing trend is the loss of any democratic public domain in contemporary cities. Departing from that, this thesis focuses on the dominant ecology of fear in the long-established central public space network of Istanbul comprising Gezi Park, Taksim Square &amp; Istiklal Avenue where the citizens are disconnected from their democratic public domain in the last decade. The research aims to approach fear as an urban phenomena rediscovering and inventing tools to investigate fear in space, decode it in the context of Central Istanbul and discuss the role and range of influence of the urbanist in finding solutions to mitigate fear and establish a new constructive dialogue between the citizens of Istanbul and their public domain under extreme societal and political conditions that Central Istanbul exemplifies.","fearscapes; spatial biographies; democratic public domain; contemporary public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-31","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","41.036753, 28.984765"

It has the potential to create new products and services,like visualizing future buildings or objects that will decorate a place, which creates new opportunities for applications in both the public and private sector. The architecture and construction fields are particularly interested in investigating this innovative technology to engage stakeholders, such as designers and engineers, in every stage of decision making and to minimize discrepancies between the original design of a building and the final outcome. Portability is one of the greatest advantages of Head-Mounted Display (HMD) AR technologies, but there are limitations regarding the amount of data which can be visualized using the computational power of the current generation of devices. Also, automated methods and approaches that can cope with the intricacy of the models have to be produced and tested to make the usage of augmented reality feasible.Within this thesis, a methodology is developed to isolate each storey of a Building Information Modeling (BIM) model and its exterior envelope. Firstly, the model was converted, from the Revit file format, to the open standard Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which made the file human readable. Only semantic information was used to isolate each storey of the building, while for the extraction of the outer shell geometrical calculations were performed. This extraction took place by sending rays from one side of the model to the other and checking the intersection of the rays with the model.Afterwards, the storeys and the exterior were visualized through an AR device,the Hololens. The Unity platform, which provides many tools for holographic development, was used for the configuration of the scene where the final user will interact with the created models. Scripts in the C# programming language were developed to allow interaction between the user and the holograms. I created a simple and intuitive menu, consisting of 3D buttons to allow the user to visualize only the desired parts of the model. After having visualized the model, the user has the ability to scale and rotate the model using the corresponding buttons. In the same way, when the user stares at an element of the building, this element is high-lighted and by making the tap gesture, he/she can visualize metadata information about this element as text above the model. Finally, spatial perception functionality is provided by virtually placing the model on horizontal planes identified by the device.The proposed methodology was tested in a use case on a sample BIM model, and specifically of the Amsterdam Medical Center. The large size of the file and the high complexity of its geometry made the model a challenging test that made it possible to highlight the limitations and efficiency of the developed approach. Despite the positive results of the process, the accuracy is affected by the computational power of the current generation of hardware. Nevertheless, the clear perception of a construction coupled with the interactions capabilities provide an immersive experience which can actively involve the user with the visualization process","BIM; Hololens; Simplification; Raycasting; IFC; Augmented Reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The result is a game that provides clients with a first insight into the new form of trust relationships that blockchain brings. <br/><br/>In recent years blockchain has gotten attention from public, business and politics. It is said to decentralize the exchange of value, similar to what the internet did for information. For this blockchain addresses the key topic of trust. In the past decades trust has evolved from local to institutional to partly decentralized. Blockchain takes this further and assumes distrust among peers and enforces exchanges through hard code. Instead of having to trust a peer or a third party, people can trust the veracity of the process. Although proclaimed to be trustless, trust still needs to be placed in the technology itself. The goal of this project was to design an experience that allows people to build (initial) trust in blockchain technology. Understanding the role of trust in a blockchain ecosystem was achieved through a literature study on trust in technology, a decomposition of blockchain and a case study of one of Cognizant’s blockchain projects for a multinational shoe retailer on inventory sharing. <br/><br/>From a theoretical perspective results show that trust still plays a role in blockchain ecosystems: A lack of computer literacy prohibits people from understanding the open source algorithm code. Governance of a blockchain protocol can be fuzzy, making individuals unable to control changes. Blockchain propositions often include human interaction or physical products which cannot be affected by a blockchain system. Data that is fed into a blockchain system cannot be checked for correctness by a blockchain system, thus providers of this data still need to be trusted. Transfers done on a blockchain cannot be undone placing a heavy weight on someone’s personal trust (self-confidence). If a crypocurrency is used, participants need to trust that it will maintain its’ value.<br/><br/>Another key challenge is nudging trust towards a justified trustee. Blockchain appears to bring forth a new form of trust that is not peer-to-peer nor institutional. Rather, trust has to be placed in a collection of components (code, cryptography and protocol) that is controlled by an algorithm and collective group. It will take time for people to adopt this new form of trust as social norms need to (be) developed.<br/><br/>Results from the case study show that adopting blockchain technology is not only a technical or business feat but also an emotional and social endeavour. Setting up a blockchain ecosystem forces the initiating company to engage with competitors in a more direct way and seems to feel like they have to open up. It creates interactions that companies might be uncomfortable with as it often concerns sensitive data. Next to this, it seemed hard to really grasp or experience the value of blockchain technology which can be a barrier when designing with it. Clients also appeared to approach the technology using ‘old’ trust concepts, which might result in missing out on the technology’s real potential.<br/><br/>Cognizant could play a key role in making clients comfortable with this new form of interaction by offering direct experiences with blockchain rather than only knowledge transfer. Also acknowledging the emotional/strategic challenge of cooperating with competitors more closely is something where Cognizant should build activities around. Eventually the company could position itself as an ‘ecosystem builder’, providing support to not only the client but also the partners in shaping the ecosystem and relationships.<br/><br/>To support this role, an interactive game called ‘Viral Art’ was created that provides clients with an initial experience of the new form of trust and ‘coopetition’ that blockchain brings. Experiences from the game can lead into a discussion on the impact on a clients’ own business network and shape the further activities of a project. In the game participants simulate a digital museum and compete for the most valuable (unique) art through trades. Throughout the game players go through all three different forms of trust.<br/><br/>A final evaluation with Cognizant led to recommendations for further development including digitization, stronger facilitation and the extension to a workshop format.","blockchain; trust in technology; design for trust; game design; consultancy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Control of wastewater treatment plants has received more attention as a method to improve nutrient removal processes. Improved nutrient removal, results in an increased eﬄuent quality, whilst minimising the energy consumption. Aeration control of oxidation ditches often focuses on adjusting the aeration intensity based on the nitrogen removal process, using ammonium measurements. The control systems do not incorporate biological phosphorus removal. Biological phosphorus removal, on the one hand, needs suﬃcient aeration and on the other hand, can deteriorate when subjected to excessive aeration. The complex relation to aeration, makes control of biological phosphorus removal diﬃcult.<br/><br/>This research investigates the control of biological phosphorus removal in an oxidation ditch using simple sensors. Control systems often require expensive instrumentation. To limit the costs, cheap sensors using alternative monitoring variables for biological phosphorus removal are desired. Literature research was done to investigate the principles of biological phosphorus removal, possible alternative monitoring variables, current control systems and existing mathematical models and benchmarks that could contribute to a renewed control strategy. Some important variables found in literature were potassium, pH, ORP, ortho-P, nitrate, ammonium, conductivity, and DO. A measurement campaign was set up and executed to measure the trend of these variables throughout the oxidation ditch and to obtain more information on the state of the variables in the (un)aerated zones. A full-scale operating wastewater treatment plant in Hattem was made available to execute the measurement campaign.<br/><br/>The results obtained from the measuring campaign did not point towards alternative monitoring variables for biological phosphorus removal. Relationships between the variables and phosphorus found in literature, could not be directly derived from the measurement results. However, nitrate and ammonium measurements can give an insight into the biological phosphorus removal process. A change in ammonium and nitrate indicates an anaerobic, anoxic or anaerobic environment. Nitrate can in addition contribute to a control system by making sure that the zone before withdrawal from the oxidation ditch is anoxic, to inhibit P-release. However, it cannot on its own monitor the biological phosphorus removal fully as it cannot indicate the eﬀect of the aeration intensity on biological phosphorus removal directly. The results from the measurements indicated a low biological phosphorus removal activity. From literature, it is known that several factors can influence the biological phosphorus removal, such as insuﬃcient anaerobic zone and aeration settings.<br/><br/>To investigate the response of the WWTP to these factors, a BioWin model was constructed. This model simulates the performance of the treatment plant and investigates the impact of several adjustments, such as altered aeration and an extended anaerobic zone.<br/><br/>The simulation results showed that the DO setpoints of the aerators influenced the process in several ways. Increasing the aeration improved the results to a certain extent, after which the biological phosphorus removal deteriorated due to over-aeration. An extended anaerobic tank improved the biological phosphorus removal.<br/>Unfortunately, a control system for biological phosphorus removal, using alternative monitoring variables, was not obtained. A benchmark of an oxidation ditch is suggested for further research and the implementation of biological phosphorus removal in a benchmark of an oxidation ditch was started.","Biological phosphorus removal; Oxidation Ditch; Simple sensors; Aeration Control; Wastewater treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in agriculture, the consequences are devastating leading to reduced yields or crop failure with further implications for economics, politics and society. Being able to monitor and predict agricultural droughts is an important step to reduce agricultural vulnerability and secure livelihoods. However, few drought indicators measure the actual crop response towards the hydrological conditions. Remote sensing bears great potential for this challenge due to its worldwide continuous coverage and relatively low costs. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), a remote sensing method, is a measure of above-ground vegetation water content based on passive microwaves, which are not affected by atmospheric distortion. The present research aims at analysing the potential of VOD as an agricultural drought indicator. A case study on pepper fields in Indonesia was conducted using daily VOD data between 2012 and 2018 at a downscaled spatial resolution of 100 x 100 m. Correlations between VOD anomalies and anomalies of other meteorological drought indicators were calculated. VOD was found to be correlated with the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) by 0.47, with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by -0.46 and with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) by -0.46. These correlations indicate that other factors influence the VOD, which should be considered as an independent dataset. This study provides evidence that VOD is capable of capturing agricultural droughts. A cross-comparison was conducted with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is often compared to VOD as an alternative measure. Results in the investigated area suggest that, although VOD has a lower spatial resolution, it performs better than NDVI. Finally, a roadmap was proposed towards developing a drought indicator based on the VOD anomalies. This roadmap aims at modelling future VOD based on the relation between SPEI and VOD by using the added value of VOD that this study reveals. This study is especially relevant for other tropical areas with a high cloud density.","Drought; Drought monitoring; Remote Sensing; Vegetation Optical Depth; Water Resources Management; Agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-2.3650, 106.1900"

The opportunities of the applications and technologies of Industry 4.0 have been researched (Hermann, Pentek, &amp; Otto, 2016; Zhou &amp; Liu, 2016). However, in practice, different industrial sectors, e.g. the fast moving consumer goods manufacturing industry, still lag behind on the possible application and implementation of the possibilities of Industry 4.0 (Fry, Mortlock, Firsova, &amp; Moore, 2017).<br/><br/>The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) manufacturing industry is one of the largest industries globally (Celen, Erdogan, &amp; Taymaz, 2005). The FMCG manufacturing industry is influenced by trends, such as individualisation of consumer demand, digitisation of operations, etc., throughout its whole value chain from the FMCG manufacturer to the consumer. The construction projects of FMCG factories are also assumed to be influenced by these trends, but are not able to respond to them (Küper, Kuhlmann, Köcher, Dauner, &amp; Burggräf, 2013). Therefore, this research tries to answer the following research question:<br/><br/>What can be done to future-proof the output and process of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry within the context of Industry 4.0?<br/><br/>By means of an explorative research methodology, firstly, data is collected through exploratory interviews and a multiple-case study. Combined with data from a literature review, the current situation of the output (i.e. the FMCG factory) and process of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing is researched. Furthermore, the trends, challenges and opportunities of Industry 4.0 defining the transition from the current to the future situation, are researched by conducting a literature review. And finally, with all data collected, a design for the future situation and a design for a transition roadmap to the future situation, are made.<br/><br/>The overarching problem of the current output of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry is not being able to manufacturer the specification, volume, moment and location of the demand of the FMCG value chain. The overarching problem of the current process of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry is defined as a poor project process in the perspective of one or more actors in the project organisation. Main actors in the project organisation of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry are FMCG manufacturers, service suppliers (e.g. engineering, design etc.) and process product suppliers process (e.g. original equipment manufacturers).<br/><br/>A PESTE (i.e. political, economic, social, technological and environmental) analysis is used to identify the trends affecting consumer demands, leading to manufacturing challenges in the FMCG manufacturing industry (The World Bank, 2017; United Nations, 2017). Fierce global competitiveness, a big pressure on time, cost and quality, an increasing demand for changeability and integration, are found to be the manufacturing challenges for the FMCG manufacturing industry (Brettel, Klein, &amp; Friederichsen, 2016; Hermann et al., 2016; Kasriel-Alexander, 2012; Zhong, Xu, Klotz, &amp; Newman, 2017). These manufacturing challenges also result into challenges for the construction projects of these factories (Oesterreich &amp; Teuteberg, 2016).<br/><br/>The Industry 4.0 trends defined as opportunities related, to the challenges are: increasing data acquisition, computational power and connectivity, increasing data analytics and intelligence, increasing advanced conversion to the physical world and increasing advanced human-machine interactions. These four trends are linked to specific Industry 4.0 technologies (Küper et al., 2013; Scalabre, 2018). <br/><br/>For the future situation, changeability and integration are introduced as additional project drivers for construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry (Davies &amp; Sendler, 2018b; Wang, Wan, Li, &amp; Zhang, 2016; Zhou &amp; Liu, 2016).<br/><br/>For the future output of the specific construction projects, four design concepts are defined: cyber-physical manufacturing, smart manufacturing and modular manufacturing (Hermann et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Thramboulidis, 2015). For the future process of the specific construction projects, the Industry 4.0 technologies are mapped out on the different project phases, leading to different durations, a different project organisation and different information management methods (Oesterreich &amp; Teuteberg, 2016).<br/><br/>A transition roadmap is designed for the transition from the current to the future situation of construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry, by enhancing the opportunities of Industry 4.0. Different transition steps for the FMCG manufacturer, service supplier and process product supplier eventually lead to the final step of the transition roadmap: co-create a coherent Industry 4.0 strategy, based on the learnings from the previous steps of each actor.<br/><br/>To answer the research question, the generic components of the previous steps of all actors are considered. All actors are recommended to focus on specific Industry 4.0 trend. Moreover, the specific Industry 4.0 strategy, linked to the specific capabilities needed for this strategy, could lead to further exploration and implementation of specific Industry 4.0 technologies. By implementing changeability and integration as additional project drivers, all actors can start developing changeable and integrated parts of their services and products. The realisation of an eco-system of service suppliers and process product suppliers around the construction project of a FMCG manufacturer, in combination with standardised cloud-based documentation and standardised communication strategies, could then be the next step towards future-proof construction projects in the FMCG manufacturing industry.<br/><br/>Limitations of the research context, research design, data analysis and data collection are discussed. The limitations are mostly caused by the combined knowledge fields of the FMCG manufacturing industry, construction projects and Industry 4.0, since not many literature nor theory exists on these combined knowledge fields. Therefore, several recommendations for future research are made, focusing on a more specific part of the combined knowledge field.<br","Industry 4.0; fast moving consumer goods; FMCG; Manufacturing; construction projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasingly larger number of vehicles on the road, safety is, now more than ever, a topic of paramount importance. It is estimated that every year 26,000 people are killed on European roads, corresponding to a social cost of 100 billion euros. In the last two decades, awareness about this issue has however increased substantially, and great effort is now put into improving these numbers.<br/>The introduction of driver assistance systems in recent years has led to a significant decrease in fatal accidents. One of the first implemented ones was Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), introduced on the market in 1978. ABS is an active safety system nowadays mandated on every new car sold in Europe. By preventing wheel lock during emergency braking, the system allows for shorter braking distances and steering ability retention. Despite the fact that forty years went by since ABS introduction, the control strategy behind it has changed very little, still retaining a rule-based approach. Extensive review of literature of the subject, highlighted the possibility that significant improvements could be achieved if the control strategy was to be redesigned in a way that takes advantage of the many technological improvements achieved in the last decade.<br/>The aim in this thesis is to verify this statement and quantify any potential improvement in Anti-lock Braking System. In order to achieve the research objective, a novel ABS algorithm was designed. The controller, based on state-of-the-art hardware, uses a model predictive control approach and potentially available wheel force information as the pillars of its design.<br/>A supervisory activation logic is also developed to replicate full ABS functionalities and keep the driver in the loop.

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a base-load renewable electricity technology that has the potential to contribute to a sustainable power supply on a world-wide scale. OTEC creates sustainable power utilizing the temperature difference in different depths in the ocean. The relative small temperature difference between the heat source (upper layer of the ocean) and cold sink (lower layer of the ocean) is the power resource. To obtain cost effective electricity from this small temperature difference is one of the major challenges of this technology. In order to determine an optimum power plant plant under specific environmental conditions, a techno-economic optimization model is developed, where the geometries of the components is input in the off-design model. The off-design model determines the operating conditions of the OTEC cycle with respect both the working fluid, the geometry of the components and the mass flows of the system. Nowadays, a simulation model predicts the steady state point of a test set-up at the TU Delft, despite of a lack of knowledge in the off-design performance of the OTEC cycle. Especially in the off-design performance of the turbine. To investigate the influence of the turbine performance on a 10 MW OTEC power plant, the off-design model is now equipped with an axial turbine and applicable for larger scales. As a result, the model determines the pressure drop over the turbine and the performance of the turbine. The model uses the currently best correlations for the heat transfer and the pressure drop prediction of the components to predict the influence of the off-design turbine performance on the overall performance of the system. Ultimately, the cost per produced $kW$ as optimization criterion is calculated and compared for the different power plants during warm seawater temperature fluctuations over a year or seawater mass flow fluctuations. As a final conclusion, the influence of the turbine is calculated to the overall power performance. The results of varying the warm seawater temperature results in a specific power curve, which shows proportional behavior to the temperature difference. The turbine influences the pressure drop in the system and therefore it is recommended to optimize the position of the vanes, especially when the vapor flow is higher than its design value. Ultimately, the different power curves are derived for every specific power plant. Within the relatively small range of temperature differences, the non-linear effect of the off-design performance of the turbine is too small. This leads to the conclusion, the seasonal fluctuation of sea water temperature difference have a significant impact on the net power production, while the performance of the turbine is rather constant. Variations in seawater mass flows show non-linear characteristics. The turbine performance influences the cycle performance, especially if the seawater mass flows drop significantly. This results that the cycle efficiency drops non-linearly downwards as the mass flows decrease. Finally, the turbine performance remains constant during off-design conditions. Therefore, the accessibility of a thermal energy from the ocean is one step closer. This is an important step in creating a renewable energy powered world.","OTEC; Off-design; Turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-26","","","","","",""

Tri-generation systems utilizing an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) can offer a reliable alternative towards that direction. In particular, the solar Organic Rankine Cycle can reduce down to zero the footprint of such systems. In this study, an ORC is designed such so that the rejected heat by its condenser can be used to drive a sorption heat pump. The design process of the hybrid system includes the selection of the heat transfer fluid flowing through the collectors, the working fluid and the design conditions of the ORC as well as the design conditions of the sorption heat pump. The system is evaluated for its performance in the regions of Athens, Greece and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Two configurations have been evaluated in respect with the auxiliary system; one using the existing gas boiler to provide additional heat to the sorption heat pump and one using the conventional air conditioning units to directly provide the excess of the thermal load. Moreover, the investigated scenarios include both residential as well as utility buildings in both regions. The results are compared with the ones from conventional systems, using a gas boiler and air conditioning units. Multi-objective optimization has been conducted towards the maximization of the exergy efficiency and the minimization of the payback period by determining the optimal storage tank’s volume and the solar collector’s area. The results indicated that the proposed system is operating more efficiently in Amsterdam, in which is also achieving a payback period as low as 14 years, when a gas boiler is used as the auxiliary system. The performance of the system is slightly worse in Athens, mainly due to the higher cooling loads, during which the sorption heat pump operates with low COPs. <br/>Apart from the solar thermal cooling, a solar electric cooling system is evaluated for all the aforementioned scenarios, utilizing a PV field driving a conventional vapor compression chiller (VCC). According to the results, the PV-VCC system is a better solution in terms of the payback period, reporting payback periods as low as 6 and 9 years for Athens and Amsterdam, respectively, in the case of a residential building. In a similar way to the solar thermal cooling, for the case of utility buildings the performance is slightly worse, resulting in a payback period of approximately 10 years for Athens, while the respective value for Amsterdam is around 21 years, mainly due to the lower availability of solar radiation.<br","Trigeneration; Organic Rankine Cycle; Adsorption Cooling; Absorption Refrigeration; Techno-economic analysis; Genetic Algorithm; Solar cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steel-concrete composite beams are extensively used in multi-story buildings and bridges due to their competitive construction and efficient material use. Currently the composite action is mainly achieved by headed shear connectors welded to the top flange of the beam, obstructing the non-destructive demountability. Demountable shear connectors can be used in order to open up the composite con-struction for reusability. Demountable shear connectors can take the form of a bolted connection which requires a tight control of construction tolerances. This thesis is fo-cused on studying a bolt coupler connector which is seen as a valuable alternative to the more conventional embedded bolt. The proposed shear connector consists of a bolt and coupler embedded in prefabricated concrete decks which are connected through the top flange of the steel section by an injection bolt.<br/> Full-scale experiments have been performed to investigate the feasibility of construc-tion of a demountable car park. The demountable flooring was obtained by large pre-fabricated concrete decks in combination with tapered beams. Experimental research has confirmed the possibility of assembly and disassembly of the system if construction tolerances are appropriately designed. The most influential factors were quantified based on experimental observations, measurements and finite element models. The hole clearance should be designed keeping in mind the deformability of the system during construction, the manufacturing tolerances and the speed of construction. Experiments show that resin injection can be reliably and labour efficiently used for large oversized holes which allow for higher fabrication imperfections and reduced construction while at the same time enabling composite action of the connectors under live load.<br/>The reusability of the structure was confirmed by a set of eight four-point bending tests considering uniform and non-uniform connector arrangements. Finite element models closely match the experimental results in terms of deflection, stresses and curva-ture. However, the end slip is overpredicted which is in line with research performed by other authors. The efficiency of the non-uniform connector arrangements was studied experimentally and numerically to reduce the construction costs. Concentrating the shear connectors toward the supports will bring the highest benefit in terms of beam bending stiffness without the need of a large number of connectors to prevent uplift. <br/>An extensive cost analysis was performed based on a database of 15500 beam solu-tions generated by a design algorithm develop as part of this thesis. The case study provides a preliminary cost assessment of two demountable steel-concrete composite floorings in order to quantify their economic viability. It was shown that the system constructed with prefabricated solid slabs is more viable compared to the demountable profiled sheeting slab. The most influential contribution to the final cost of the struc-ture comes from the steel work and the labour intensive manufacturing.<br","Demountable structures; Composite beam; Steel; Concrete; Feasibility of construction; Mechanical behaviour; Cost assessment; Design algorithm; Non-uniform shear connection; Fabrication imperfections; Injection bolts; Reusable structure; Circular Economy; Car park; Finite Element Analysis; Bolt coupler connector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High resolution experimental studies are required to investigate high Reynolds number flows where the scales of turbulence are very small. This is of particular importance in addressing the theoretical issues in studying high Reynolds number wall turbulence which finds applications in transport, energy, and aerospace industries. Hot-Wire Anemometry (HWA) is often employed to reach very high spatial resolution. Early research in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), a qualitative flow visualization technique, was not able to achieve a higher resolution as comparable with that of HWA. However, recent developments in PIV allow high resolution measurements, using information on the time averaged ensemble correlation.<br/> The ensemble correlation can be used to reduce the size of the interrogation windows employed in a PIV analysis, without compromising for the particle image density in an interrogation window. This is achieved by using a large number of image pairs. In this thesis, ensemble correlation is used to study the turbulence in two specific cases: a turbulent jet and high Reynolds number pipe flow. The ensemble correlation, though being a time averaged quantity, contains information on the velocity Joint Probability Distribution Functions (JPDFs) which can be used to estimate the turbulence statistics. This information can be retrieved from the shape of the ensemble correlation. It is assumed that the ensemble correlation is the convolution of the auto-correlation and the velocity JPDFs. The velocity JPDFs are retrieved by estimating the second moments of the ensemble correlation by fitting a Gaussian profile, and further using a correction for auto-correlation. The second moments can be used to estimate the Reynolds stresses in the flow.<br/> The proposed method is validated by implementing it to study the turbulent jet. For this purpose, 9000 image pairs are acquired. The results show that the retrieved moments predict the Reynolds stresses accurately. Further, high Reynolds number pipe flow experiments are performed in the Alpha Loop facility at Deltares. The bulk Reynolds number is varied from 0.3 to 0.6 million, acquiring 20,000 image pairs per measurement series. Also, the pressure drop is measured across the pipe along with the PIV measurements to estimate the roughness of the pipe. The results from the PIV measurements show that the mean velocity profile follows a similar trend as observed in the literature. A small bias is observed between the mean velocity obtained from the ensemble correlation and that obtained by averaging the instantaneous velocity vectors, in regions of high velocity gradients. The Reynolds shear stress estimated from the shape of the ensemble correlation is underestimated. However, the streamwise turbulent fluctuations estimated follow a trend, similar to that observed in the literature.<br","PIV; Ensemble correlation; Turbulence statistics; Wall turbulence; Deconvolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","TKI project ‘Turbulent pipe flow at high Reynolds number’, Deltares",""

(graduation committee); Zaaijer, M B (mentor); Langelaar, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The design of an offshore wind farm (OWF) is multidisciplinary in nature as it involves the design of many disciplines such as the wake effects, support structure, electrical cables etc. For the optimal design of an OWF, an optimization procedure is required where all the disciplines are optimized simultaneously. The objective function plays a significant role in optimization as it expresses the main aim of the model which is to be either minimized or maximized. So far, cost of energy (COE) and annual energy production (AEP) are one of the commonly used objective functions for OWF optimization as far as the author is aware. However, there might be other objective functions that may influence the optimal design of an OWF as well. This may include maximizing the profit, minimizing the environmental impact, reducing their carbon emissions etc. Hence, this thesis investigates the overview of different objective functions and understand its impact on the optimal design of an OWF.<br/><br/>An inventory of different objective functions is prepared, and relevant ones are selected for further study. It is observed that even though some objectives are dissimilar, they still depend on the same wind farm parameters and are therefore expected to give similar design results. From the list of objective functions, net present value (NPV) and risk management objectives are chosen for further research.<br/><br/>The selected objective functions are then formulated in a metric for optimization. The price of electricity plays a significant role in determining the NPV. It is learnt that electricity price varies with the power supply depending on the site conditions. The electricity price is low if the supply of power is high in a region where there are many OWF’s and vice versa. Moreover, OWF investors value constant power output without any fluctuations. Hence, taking all these aspects into consideration, the electricity price in the NPV function is modelled for a constant value, wind variability and wind power predictability.<br/>The risk management function, on the other hand, aims at minimizing the uncertainty associated with an OWF project. The risk here refers to the uncertainty associated with the profit obtained from the OWF. A set of annual average wind speeds is computed using monte carlo simulations and the AEP and NPV are estimated. The mean( NPV_mean) and standard deviation ( NPV_std ) of NPV are then calculated. NPV_std represents the uncertainty in this scenario and is minimized to reduce the risk.<br/><br/>A suitable method is then identified to deal with multiple objectives. The NPV function is maximized for maximum profit and this objective is evaluated using a single objective optimization technique. The risk management objective involves the calculation of NPV_mean and NPV_std. Both objectives are contrasting in nature as a significant reduction in NPV_std corresponds to an undesirable reduction in NPV_mean. A tradeoff between both these objectives is the best possible solution. Therefore, a multi- objective optimization technique is used, and a list of solutions is obtained by generating a pareto front.<br/><br/>The new approach is then evaluated by implementing different case studies. It is observed that optimum rotor diameter and number of turbines for the single objective optimization technique are influenced by economic indicators such as the real interest rate and lifetime. However, they are not influenced by variation in the electricity price. Nevertheless, the NPV function is sensitive to the economic indicators and variation in the electricity price. <br/><br/>For the multi - objective optimization technique, multi criteria analysis was used to determine the weight to the objective functions while moving along the pareto curve. It was observed that the improvement of one objective led to the deterioration of the other objective. Hence, the pareto front provides opportunities to investors to negotiate and decide on the weight they want to specify for their objectives.<br","Wind Energy; Optimization; wind farm optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Although plausible, the direct reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels entails huge energy expenditure thus requiring the implementation of catalysts. Unique in its ability, palladium reversibly reduces CO2 to formic acid making it an interesting candidate for the reduction reaction. In addition to the production of formic acid, palladium is also know to produce carbon monoxide (CO) which completely deactivates the surface preventing further reactions from occurring. <br/><br/>Thus the aim of the current study is focused on analysing the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on palladium thin films using surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to better understand the deactivation mechanisms of CO on the palladium thin film. The smoothness of the as- sputtered 15 nm palladium thin film with a RMS roughness of 0.511 nm and partially coalesced islands were ascertained, thus requiring surface activation to introduce the enhancement mechanism. Experimental analysis of CO2 reduction on the palladium thin film was performed to unearth significant insights through the combination of electrochemical analysis techniques with surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. Results obtained through implementation of these methodologies provided substantial information not only on the influence of the palladium-hydrogen system on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 but also on the impact of alkali metal cations on the palladium-hydrogen system and the CO2 reduction reaction over the sputtered palladium thin film. CO formation, accumulation and desorption coupled with hydrogen evolution and desorption were some of the few avenues that were enumerated upon during the experimental investigation. The identity of CO chemisorbed on the palladium thin film along with bicarbonate direct/ indirect reduction to form CO was confirmed through the utilization of N2 saturated C13 NaHCO3 solution.

On the other hand, numerical simulation studies have tried to simulate the IDD behaviour with methods based on weak coupling of a reservoir flow simulator and an external chemical module. This study presents a fully implicit coupled chemical-compositional-flow implementation to simulate the permeability reduction through silicate gels, since IDD is essentially a coupled flow-chemical process.

Sensitivity of the oil recovery, and IDD characteristics such as moles of silicate, to design parameters of the IDD process is discussed as well. Since adjoint gradients are not typically available for the parameters describing in-depth divergence and the uncertainties are expected to be large, the optimization study uses an ensemble-based methodology to find optimal IDD reservoir management strategies. In addition to discussing IDD strategies in a deterministic setting, the design of optimal IDD strategies under geological uncertainty is investigated. This study will demonstrate that the in-depth divergence process can be used to extend the reservoir field production life time when timing, size of the Sodium Silicate batch and concentration is optimized.

These underwater exhaust outlets are located on the side of the hull close to the dynamic waterline. It consists of an external appendage called ""scoop"" which creates a low pressure region for the exhaust outlet. During recent sea trials of the Feadship yachts, undesirable variations in the exhaust back-pressure were observed at the underwater outlet. These undesirable variations led to a situation with either too high back-pressure or too low back-pressure. An excessive back-pressure will increase the fuel consumption and will damage the diesel engine.

Acknowledging the importance of both port development and existing endangered ecosystems, a more integrated coastal design is needed. Possible solution could be found through the Building with Nature approach, in which natural processes and ecological needs are included in the design. This requires a good understanding of the governing processes as well as the requirements from society, ecology and engineering perspectives.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a preliminary study was performed into a more sustainable alternative for the planned Tongzhou Bay Port, in which a basic connection was made between engineering and ecological point of view. A hydro-morphodynamic numerical model was made available and further developed for the modelling of the governing processes in the development of the intertidal mudflats at Tongzhou Bay. The model showed satisfactory results with respect to observations and net flow and transport features were closer analyzed. The different ecosystem types at Tongzhou Bay were quantified with ecotope classification and further validated with satellite-tracked data of two endangered shorebird species. Based on this validation, high-value ecotopes were determined based on these species and was used as an indication for the performance of alternative port configurations with respect to ecology.<br/><br/>With a better understanding of the governing processes for the development of the intertidal mudflats and ecotopes, a series of alternative port designs were conceived through several design cycle iterations. Guiding principles were the preservation of high-value ecotopes, the enhancement of these area’s development and the potential area created for future port development by each variant. Results showed that by understanding natural transport and siltation patterns, not only could alternative port configurations lead to the preservation of existing high-value ecotopes, but a stronger development of these areas with respect to the natural development could be realized as well. The preliminary results of this thesis show the potential of more sustainable alternative port designs through the Building-with-Nature principle, in creating benefits for both economic and ecological development of Tongzhou Bay.","Building with Nature; Reclamation; port design; Ecology; Ecotope; Jiangsu; Shorebirds; Yellow Sea; Tongzhou Bay; East China Sea; Coast; Sediment transport; Numerical modeling; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","32.238035,121.468706"

It can be seen in all branches and it seems as if every company is shifting towards a business model where they do not only sell products, but offer service, financing and advice. The security branche is no different. With companies wanting to focus on their core business they do not longer want to buy security cameras, locks and gates. Their real need: the ability to work and store on a secure location. Part of this is having a secure entrance that fits with their needs. Boon Edam is a company that claims to be: ‘your entry expert’. Following the servitization trend they want to invest in a service for their clients and create a competitive advantage in the market. The goal of this thesis is to create a strategy for Boon Edam that creates this competitive advantage in the market. This strategy is based on a model for finding opportunities for security services, as designed by the author. This model is iterated several times during the thesis as more information is found from practice. The author uses customer driven design to create a service that fits with the demands and needs of Boon Edams client. First a research is conducted to provide a starting point for the graduation project. This also provides a general understanding in different aspects related to Boon Edam and security entrances, as well as a first view on requirements for the design. The research consists of various methods to understand and visualize the position of different stakeholders. After this, six stakeholders of Boon Edam are interviewed to provide qualitative insights in the customer needs. This results in reviewed thoughts on assumptions made in the research phase, as well as a framework for the design of the service. Using the framework and the information of the interviews a service is proposed which should provide Boon Edam with the competitive advantage. The service focusses on improving the customer relationship by offering them more support in their decision making and evaluating and improving their entrance solution. According to Baines et al. (2017) this can be seen as advanced services, which should lead to: - Growth in revenue and profit - Improved responses to customer needs - Improved product innovation - The building of new revenue streams - Increasing customer loyalty - Setting higher barriers to competition After the design of the proposed service is explained an implementation plan is written for Boon Edam to adopt the service within their portfolio. With this implementation plan it should be possible to have the service fully implemented at the end of 2019 latest.","Servitization; Security; Entrances","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though these artificially engineered structures have not been prominently used in many applications, they have been theoretically studied to have a variety of applications in many sectors. Acoustic metamaterials have the capability of manipulating sound waves in order to achieve the required unique properties.<br/>The aim of the project is to design an active acoustic metamaterial consisting of an array of Helmholtz resonators to assist in reduction of noise levels in aerospace applications using the method of 3D printing.<br/>This project presents an active Helmholtz resonator based design that can attenuate a broadband range of targeted frequencies in the low-frequency regime. To this end, a passive metamaterial consisting of an array of Helmholtz resonator unit cells, with a single varying design variable, is designed and tested to establish the effectiveness and region of performance. The selected design variable for change is identified through the frequency response for each parameter of the Helmholtz resonance equation, to achieve a broadband frequency range of the metamaterial. An active model of this design is then fabricated and tested. Two actuation mechanisms are presented for this design. The resulting acoustic systems are capable of providing an attenuation of up to 20 dB, for an open system, and up to 35 dB, for a closed system, at frequencies between 150 Hz and 500 Hz. Unlike most other studies conducted, this active acoustic design is capable of attenuating isolated frequencies as well as multiple frequencies simultaneously. The added control that is achieved through the incorporation of the electric linear motor based actuation allows for the advantage of accurate frequency targeting along with the base attenuation levels of the passive resonant acoustic metamaterial.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Such services are based on detecting and recognizing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) by using diverse types of sensors at the elder's home that transmit activity data to a remote backend for processing. However, these have a limited reach due to high costs, mostly due to elevated prices of the hardware required, as well as the installation costs. Meanwhile, Smart Home technologies are reaching more homes every year. These are based on identical sets of sensors as those prescribed for remote health monitoring systems. Extensive research has taken place in recognizing ADL given the sensor signals. However, these methodologies require prescribed sensors, the floor plan of the house and the location of the sensors.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we first propose a generic IoT interface that enables the backend to connect to arbitrary sensors, such as those typically found in Smart Homes. Regardless of the brand and communication protocol they use, the sensor data is transmitted to a backend where it can be processed by the ADL recognition algorithms and other telemonitoring services. We evaluate our design in the Philips HomeLab environment where generic sensors are installed. The system correctly transmits the activity detected by the sensors to a remote cloud service. Then, we propose a methodology based on Multidimensional Scaling to estimate the location and distribution of sensors based entirely on monitored sensor activity. Finally, we propose a methodology combining heuristics and Support Vector Machines to classify and label the sensors by the type of room in which they are placed, such as Kitchen, Bedroom or Bathroom. We train and test our model based on 4 different houses where volunteers had sensors monitoring their activity for at least 80 days. Our proposed methodology correctly identifies 5 different key locations and fully characterizes the interior of the house. Our heuristic classifier achieves a sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.98. The SVM classifier achieves a precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.78. This results in an automated method of generating the configuration data needed by the fore mentioned ADL recognition algorithms. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using the IoT paradigm for remote health monitoring systems by reusing existing sensors found in smart homes, reducing burden and costs which can potentially have an impact on a broader adoption of these kind of monitoring services.","IoT; Sensors; Telehealth; Remote Sensing; Multi-Dimensional Scaling; SVM; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-20","","","","","",""

A high versatility in their mode of growth ranging from photoheterotrophic to dark fermentation gives them various potential applications. Their nature of being phototrophs require them to obtain light as energy source for growth and for that they require photopigments essential for light to ATP conversion. In contrast to pure culture of PNSB, the effect of different illumination on mixed culture PNSB is partly revealed. The response of altering light intensity on mixed culture of PNSB and the change of photopigments were to be answered in this study. Mixed culture of PNSB were grown in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operation of 8 h cycle. Four different light intensity settings were used to identify the effect of light on their growth and nutrient removal rate. Light distribution model was constructed to simulate the growth and nutrient removal of pure culture Rhodopseudomonas palustris in order to compare with mixed culture PNSB results. To track the growth and nutrient removal trend, biomass and nutrients (acetate, ammonium, and phosphate) concentrations at different points during reaction phase were measured. Bacteriochlorphyll content as major photopigment was analyzed with two different methods; micro well plate reader and reverse phased HPLC. It was shown that both growth rate and nutrient removal rate were significantly diminished as light intensity decreased. The decrease of growth rate with decreasing light intensity indicated that with the given conditions, light intensity was the growth rate-limiting<br/>factor for the mixed culture PNSB studied. In comparison to simulation results, it was shown that the mixed culture PNSB was showing faster growth and higher removal rate. Bacteriochlorophyll content in the micro plate reader showed an increase to 75% intensity condition and then a decrease to 25% intensity conditions. Bacteriochlrophyll content analyzed by the two different methods showed relatively high deviation between each other as large error in both analyzing methods were present. The effect of changing light intensity on mixed culture PNSB with respect to its growth, nutrient removal and pigment content was studied. Further investigation on both higher and lower light intensity to identify the photo-inhibition level and saturation level is necessary. For a better approximation of the simulation to experimental data,<br/>further works on precise measurement of light distribution in the photobioreactor is required. Photo-pigment analysis methods should be either replaced by a spectrophotometer using standardized cuvettes to minimize measurement error or be optimized to obtain reliable data.","PNSB; Light Intensity; Microbial Growth; Nutrient Removal; Mixed Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-24","","","","","",""

The emphasis is on scaled cylindrical shells due to the expensive nature of full scale launch-vehicle cylindrical shells and the size constraints of experimental testing equipment. The work as presented in this thesis is part of a framework of a collaboration with NASA Langley. The main objective was to investigate if a scaling method, which is developed as part of this afore mentioned collaboration, results in representative scaled cylindrical composite shells. These scaled cylindrical composite shells will be validated by experimental tests at NASA Langley. The scaling of structures can be a challenging process, as a scaled model which shows full scale representative behaviour is difficult to design due to constraints such as manufacturability. The buckling of cylindrical shells is considered to be a structural problem which is yet to be fully understood. The cylindrical shells show a high imperfection sensitivity, but the exact influence of imperfections caused by different manufacturing processes is a source of uncertainty. The thesis will focus on two scaled cylindrical shells which resulted from the scaling method, next to the full scale CTA 8.1 cylindrical shell they are based on. The CTA 8.1 is a sandwich cylindrical shell with a honeycomb core which is designed to be representative for a launch-vehicle structure. The first scaled cylindrical shell consists of a solid laminate and the second scaled cylindrical shell consists of a sandwich with foam core.

Other recent studies and proposals suggest to use checklist-based training methods to prepare pilots for puzzling and surprising scenarios, but effects on flight crew performance have yet to be published. Therefore a simulator-based, between-subjects experiment was conducted to explore the effects of a four-item checklist-based training on pilot performance. Training elements focused on managing stress and enhancing situation awareness, as well as improving sensemaking and decision-making processes. It was expected that trained pilots would exhibit better overall performance in test scenarios involving off-nominal, surprising situations. Nevertheless, results indicated no significant difference in pilot response to an initial disturbance, but did show significant performance improvement in scenarios involving a second, ensuing upset compared to the baseline group. This suggests that checklist-based training methods offer a structured problem-solving approach, resulting in better response to consecutive disturbances in select scenarios.","aerospace; engineering; aviation; startle; surprise; intervention; training; upset; pilot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-24","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This thesis will contribute to the understanding of the System, speeds-up the design process and makes it possible to see the impact of fluctuating weather conditions throughout the year at different locations on earth. The System as it was at January 1, 2018 is implemented in the Simulation Tool and its production determined for Tucson, Arizona in the year 2005. The result is an average daily production of 3.0 mole methanol with fluctuations from 1.0 mole during a cloudy winter day to 4.2 mole during a sunny summer day. The minute by minute production is found to be influenced by all System design parameters. They must thus be designed together to make sure the System performs optimally. The Alkaline Electrolysis uses the most energy of all subsystems. Four options to improve the System are identified. These are 1) improving the power the Solar Panel produces, 2) improving the efficiency of each subsystem, 3) improving how the System is controlled and 4) integrating heat. A selection of these improvements shows that it is possible to produce 4.8 mole methanol per day. The observed seasonal and daily fluctuating methanol production demonstrates the importance of the dynamic model developed in this thesis. Compared to the steady-state model it gives a more realistic view of methanol production and can be used to improve System design. However, to reach the business case target more technical improvements are needed. It should be realised that the design decisions will be based on technical, economical and political arguments.","Renewable methanol; Standalone PV system; Renewable fuel; CO2 capture; Direct air capture; Alkaline electrolysis; Methanol synthesis; Capillary cistillation; Preliminary design; Dynamic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-24","","","","","",""

Apart from the importance of reducing the amount of plastic entering the ocean, clearing the rivers from debris is important for societal concerns, such as health related issues and flood risks. The interaction between riverine debris and the hydrodynamics of water systems plays an important role in the construction of trash racks that can block water flow in the river. These clogged trash racks lead to an increase in upstream water level and can cause regional flood risks. This study was set up to investigate the amount and accumulation of riverine debris in the Cikapundung River in Indonesia, one of the tributaries of the Citarum River.<br/><br/>The Citarum River is one of the world’s most heavily polluted rivers, predominantly caused by industries and households dumping their waste directly in the river.

The river flows through three reservoirs and the area upstream of these reservoirs is called the Upper Citarum River Basin. The main contribution of pollution comes from this area, as the city of Bandung is located in this area. The Cikapundung River flows through the city of Bandung and is one of the tributaries of the Citarum River. This river was selected for the field measurements in this study as it allowed measurements to be performed in river parts with rural and urban areas neighboring the river. <br/>Up until now, many studies of riverine debris accumulation are predominantly focused on organic debris accumulations at bridges and gates.

Scaled laboratory tests were carried out, to (1) monitor the blockage growth process for different debris compositions, (2) investigate the influence of different parameters on the upstream water level and (3) determine the impact of a blocked trash rack on regional flood risks. <br/><br/>From the field measurements, an increase in downstream direction was found for the debris flux, but the debris composition varied in both time and space. The plastic debris mass varied between 11\% and 78\% of the total debris mass. <br/>Based on the laboratory tests, the behavior of riverine debris is studied during normal flow conditions and in front of a trash rack. One of the key findings from this study is that plastic debris causes a faster blockage than organic debris, as the plastic blockage contains fewer voids and therefore has a higher blockage density. In the formation of a blockage in front of a trash rack, a mix of organic and plastic debris behaved more similar to plastic debris. The shape of the blockage was also found to be different for plastic and organic debris: a high amount of plastic in the debris lead to an angular blockage shape, whereas mainly organic debris produced a curved blockage shape. <br/>The most important indicators for flood risks related to debris accumulations were found to be the debris load, loss coefficient, initial flow velocity and initial flow depth. By rescaling the results to the case study location in Bandung, it was found that a backwater rise within the hour of O(1 m) is plausible for a blocked trash rack.<br/><br/>This study forms the stepping stone to further quantifying riverine (plastic) debris and investigating its relation to changes in the water system behavior, including its influence on regional flood risks.","Riverine debris; Macroplastic particles; Debris accumulation; Gate and carpet formation; Flood risks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Single-stage radial inflow turbines appear as suitable expansion devices for this type of application. However, supersonic conditions can be reached in the stator of these devices, causing non-ideal fluid-dynamic behavior. This makes it necessary to explore unconventional architectures, for which only a limited number of design methods have been proposed. <br/>In this context, the principal activity of this study was to formulate guidelines, and thereby reduce the preliminary design space, of supersonic radial stator vanes. This was done by first identifying the relevant loss mechanism and design parameters through an examination of the available literature. This led to the formulation of a research hypothesis, which was studied by means of two-dimensional, steady computational fluid dynamic simulations. <br/>To this end, a parametric study was devised, in which any design parameter can be varied to study its effect on the blade performance. This is done analyzing the trends resulting from the post-processing of simulation generated data. The data production is based on a workflow consisting of finding a condition-specific convergent-divergent nozzle, which is used to build a mean-line radial vane, for which a mesh grid is generated and utilized by a previously validated numerical solver to perform the simulations. The complete process was overseen by a semi-automated design chain constructed to manage and execute the necessary steps. <br/>It was assumed that profile losses would be the most influential loss characteristic, given that two-dimensional flow is predominant in mean-line geometries. According to the literature, both its major components, viscous dissipation and mixing losses should have an impact on the stator’s efficiency. Likewise, the degree of expansion along the embedded nozzle present between adjacent blades, was identified as the main design specifications to be analyzed. A trade-off between the contribution of the main loss mechanisms based on the variation of this parameter was predicted to exist. <br/>Applying the generalized research method on a candidate test case resulted in the generation of data from almost 500 different simulations. This led to several findings, including that it is not possible to vary the nozzle design Mach number without causing simultaneous changes to other relevant geometrical features, such as the throat width. This rendered invalid some of the initial assumptions used to set up the experiments. <br/>Similarly, this finding was expected to be the reason behind large differences between the calculated and imposed pressure ratio on the boundary conditions, as well as large variations in the mass flow of each set of blades. Additional simulations were required to analyze these deviations, based on varying other relevant parameters, including the imposed pressure ratio and outflow boundary location. The results seem to suggest that, due to the supersonic nature of the flow, an additional geometrical constraint influences the expansion process. <br/>Performance analyzes were then possible by adapting the definition of valid designs to blade configurations matching or exceeding the imposed pressure ratio. Based on these results, the relevance of the post-expansion ratio (defined as the ratio between the pressure level at the nozzle exit and the stator outflow) became apparent. This was also the case when this ratio was manipulated by changing the imposed back pressure on the system. Moreover, when quantified with respect to this parameter, the flow deviation showed a linear behavior and the losses exhibited a plateau of higher performance. <br/>Finally, this project provides a foundation for this line of research, both in a theoretical and practical sense. Future studies should focus on validating claims made regarding the supersonic expansion process and extending the data to determine the generality of the found performance trends. Only then will it be possible to conclusively establish the dependence between design parameters and performance for this unconventional type of blade.","ORC; Radial inflow turbine; Supersonic; Stator vanes; Meanline design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The implementation of thermal storage in large-scale, existing, district heating networks was researched in this study. Thermal storage was found to enable the incorporation of sustainable heat sources and optimise fuel usage in DHN. Two storage configurations were investigated: a centralised configuration where the storage is located at the primary heat generation equipment and a decentralised storage configuration where several storage vessels are distributed throughout the network. Water was selected as storage material due to economic and operational advantages over the alternatives.<br/>A thermodynamic model was designed, in MATLAB, based on the dimensions of the district heating network of Utrecht in The Netherlands. All generation assets, heat transfer equipment and transport pipelines were modelled and validated using measurement data. With the proposed model, the thermodynamic behaviour of the network was optimised over 6, carefully selected, scenario weeks.<br/>The simulations of realistic centralised and decentralised thermal storage configurations resulted in a maximal thermal peak reduction of 101 MW and 106 MW respectively and an equalised thermal generation profile over the course of each day. The heat generation of backup boilers was reduced with 20% simulating centralised storage and 58% by decentralised storage. The network temperature was decreased simulating decentralised storage but increased in the centralised configuration.<br/>The development of the thermocline in a thermal storage vessel was investigated through a data analysis over the Ypenburg (Den Haag) thermal storage vessel (1500 m3). With the implementation of adequate control, the volume percentage occupied by the thermocline can be maintained below 10%. Trends in rapid thermocline growth were observed when only 20% to 40% of the buffer volume was frequently refreshed.<br/> Lastly, an economic optimisation was performed over the year 2017 using the cooperative Eneco and TU-Delft software Linny-R. The net result over 2017 was improved with €306000 simulating centralised storage and €583000 simulating decentralised storage. Decentralised storage enabled a decrease in supply temperature which generated an additional revenue of €104000 over the 4 modelled scenario weeks in 2017.<br/>As a partial result of this work, Eneco is in the process of the actual implementation of decentralised thermal storage in the Utrecht district heating network.","Thermal storage; district heating; phase change material; Eneco; Utrecht; network; sustainabilit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

With the level of free expansion as the input, the model is able to simulate the restrained ASR expansion by taking into account the effects of physical restraints. The retrained ASR expansion in reinforced concrete cubes and beams are simulated. Numerical expansion obtained from this new model showed a good agreement with the experiments. Then, the expanded beams are loaded in shear to simulate the shear behaviour of ASR affected concrete beams. In this new model, ASR damage is embedded through a realistic simulation of ASR expansion. Whereas, in the traditional method, ASR damage is taken into account by a direct reduction of the input material properties and the expansions are not simulated. According to the data obtained from experiments, even though the mechanical properties of concrete are reduced due to ASR, but this not necessarily leading to the decrease in the capacity of the beams. In some experiments the change of failure mode is observed where the unaffected beam failed in shear but the ASR affected one failed in bending. This is because in ASR affected beams, the increase in shear load results in the enlargement of the existing ASR cracks instead of generating new diagonal shear cracks, and thus the shear failure is prevented. In the precracking method, the effects of ASR cracks on the capacity and the failure mode are taken into account in the model since the ASR cracks are simulated.

Previous research shows that a DRF disturbs sensorimotor functions even eight weeks after finished treatment, which could influence neuromuscular control. The neuromuscular system exists of a sensory, motor and integration part, which all interact with each other as a closed-loop system. This study researches if a history of DRF disturbs neuromuscular control and if so, which part of the neuromuscular control system is the origin of this impairment. Nine healthy participants and eleven participants with a DRF history (who finished their treatment 0.2 – 4 years ago) executed posture tasks and reproduction tasks with a wrist perturbator. A posture task with force perturbations was done to test neuromuscular control. Changed environmental dynamics were applied to test the adaptation of the participants during the posture task. A position and force reproduction task were executed to test sensory position and force feedback. To test the motor part of the neuromuscular system, muscle activity was measured during the tasks with electromyography. The responses to the posture task did not differ between the groups. The position reproduction task was found to be significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, people with a DRF did not adapt to changed environmental dynamics while control participants did. This implies that processing of sensory position feedback does not work properly in people with a DRF history while neuromuscular control during a posture task with small deviations is still intact. A possible explanation for these results is that different neural networks are used during reproduction tasks and posture tasks. It is concluded that sensory feedback which is used in cortical processes is disturbed in people with a history of DRF while peripheral reflexes are still intact.","Neuromuscular control; Distal radius fracture; Proprioception; Wrist joint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Heart valve replacement surgery is no exception to this phenomenon; every year 280 000 heart valve replacement surgeries are performed worldwide.Despite the success of heart valve replacement surgeries, various notable drawbacks hinder its advancement. Mechanical heart valves require anticoagulant therapy to reduce the risk of thromboembolisms, thereby also introducing anticoagulant-induced haemorrhage. Further-more, the need for anticoagulant therapy makes the mechanical valve undesirable for woman who desire a pregnancy. Bioprosthetic heart valves suffer from structural valve deterioration and therefore need to be replaced after less than 15 years. Replacement surgery is dangerous,with an increased mortality rate of up to 20%. Furthermore, heart valve prosthetics do not allow for native cell tissue ingrowth, limiting their ability to self-repair and grow, the latter being of especially high importance in pediatric heart valve surgeries.A promising new concept is the tissue engineered prosthetic heart valve, which would hypothetically remove the need for anticoagulent use, allow for self-repair and growth and increase the durability of heart valve prosthetics. The process of creating a Tissue Engineered Heart Valve (TEHV) is, however, complex, and an optimal scaffold is yet to be found.Bacterial Cellulose (BC) is hypothesised to be a feasible scaffold and material for use in heart valve prostheses. BC is a biogenic polymer with a chemical structure not unlike collagen. The material is produced by, among others, the bacterium Acetobacter Xylinus. BC has been shown to have considerable mechanical strength and low thrombogenicity. Furthermore,a study in rat models has indicated no inflammatory or foreign body response to implanted cellulose. Bacterial cellulose is already successfully in use as wound dressing, and has been utilised to produce feasible vascular grafts.

However, BC cultured using the rotary device is unstable and fragile. The rotary culturing protocol needs to be improved in order to result in feasible BC tubes for the production of heart valves.The BC shows strain levels slightly stiffer, but relatively similar to those of human pericardium. Furthermore, creep behaviour is, as with pericardium, insignificant under cyclic loading conditions.More patches need to be cultured in order to increase the sample size, and thereby produce more conclusive results.

Research applications range from assessment of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products to the modeling of pathological skin conditions. For example, psoriasis is a complicated skin disease that strongly concerns the scientific community because of its unclear pathogenesis and the current inability to cure it. The Pharmacogenomics Lab of ETH has been working on the development of psoriatic skin models in order to investigate the driving mechanisms of the disease and to later implement high-throughput drug screening to explore treatment possibilities. However, the manual production into transwell inserts results in unstable, self-contracting and inconsistent skin models, pain points that the Pharmacogenomics Lab would like to eliminate. A recent collaboration between the Product Development Group and the Pharmacogenomics Lab has been recently initiated in an attempt to standardize the fabrication of the psoriatic skin models. For this purpose, this Master Thesis focused on the investigation of the potentials and limitations of automated injection molding, a method developed by the Product Development Group, in the generation of consistent and representative dermo-epidermal models for psoriatic skin. <br/>After a series of experiments, it was seen that in-mold fabrication achieves homogeneous and consistent dermal hydrogels that maintain their dimensions throughout the whole cultivation period regardless of the collagen concentration employed for the dermal matrix, while automated injection molding allows the utilization of collagen concentrations higher than the unstable 5mg/ml, traditionally used in the manual fabrication method. All collagen concentrations exhibited similar biological performance, but the optimum fibroblasts viability was achieved in case of 5mg/mL, meaning that the whole injection molding process should be faster and even simpler to fully prevail over manual fabrication of skin models and better fit the requirements of skin disease research. Keratinocytes viability and differentiation was similar for all mold designs, all collagen concentrations and both fabrication methods. Development of a first psoriatic model, consisting of psoriatic fibroblasts and healthy keratinocytes, did not show any direct effect of diseased fibroblasts on keratinocytes proliferation and differentiation as the epidermal layer of the psoriatic model was very similar to this one of the healthy model.<br/>Evaluation of the automated seeding of keratinocytes for further standardization of the process and elongation of the psoriatic model’s cultivation period for a more thorough study should be the next steps. In the long-term, incorporation of all the psoriasis-related cells and molecules in a simple and fast way, as well as further advancements in the mold design to facilitate a direct high-throughput drug screening should be considered.<br","automated injection molding; bioengineered skin; psoriasis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-10-22","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

Almost all bicycle street crossings are controlled by priority markings or by the priority rule: traffic coming from the right has priority.

For the research two crossings were observed. One crossing with priority markings and one without priority markings, both with traffic from four directions.<br/>At both crossings a camera recorded the cyclists passing the crossing for one hour at three different moments in the day. The conflicts on the footage are investigated in the analysis. Firstly, It was investigated if priority was given when it should have been given. Also the severity of the conflicts and the behaviour of the cyclists who had to give priority were classified. Finally the influence of the kind of crossing (crossing or merging), the influence of groups and the influence of scooters were addressed.<br/>The results show no relation between the presence of a scooter in a conflict and the percentage of cyclists not giving priority while they should have given priority. Also merging and crossing conflicts show no large difference in priority behaviour. But when groups are part of a conflict, priority is less often given while it should have been given. After these three influences, conflicts in general are compared for a crossing with priority markings and a crossing without priority markings. The observed crossing without priority markings shows a larger percentage of severe conflicts. Also the cyclists who had to give priority show more often reckless behaviour in conflicts. From these results it is concluded that priority markings control the priority on a crossing better than the priority rule: traffic coming from the right has priority.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To increase overall physical activity, the Dutch government wants to stimulate active travel. Active travel has two important benefits: the accessibility effect and the health effect. Yet, the effect of active travel on the total net health benefits is not completely understood and “wrong” conclusions can be made if the complex causal relationships between active travel and health are overlooked. In this research, two hypotheses are tested that are a possible explanation for active travel to not have the same health benefits as physical activity: 1) active travel substitutes for other forms of physical activity, 2). there exists a causal bi-directional relationship between active travel and health. Leisure physical activity is used to examine other forms of physical activity. BMI and general mental health are used to examine health. To test the hypotheses, the Cross-Lagged Panel model is used and is estimated on the LISS Panel data. The findings indicate that there exists a positive effect between active travel and other forms of physical activity. Furthermore, this research indicates no relationship between active travel, BMI and mental health. Especially, the findings of the positive effect of active travel on other forms of physical activity are uplifting. This means that the current health benefits are underestimated. We recommend that these values will be changed in future reports regarding the health benefits of active travel.","(Random Intercepts) - Cross-Lagged Panel Model; Physical activity; Active travel; Health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

One up-and-coming application of additive manufacturing is monolithic compliant joints, which use the elastic deformation of the flexural arms as a mechanism for to complete the desired function. With additive manufacturing becoming more prevalent, it is essential that parts are able to withstand the mechanical and environmental stresses that occur during use. Understanding a material’s response to cyclic loading and unloading is important, as the majority of parts will experience fatigue behavior. Fatigue is a progressive and permanent structural change that could result in a crack or complete rupture, making a part unable to perform its desired task.

However, limited results about the benefits of synthetic fibres in the reinforced warm-mix asphaltic materials, and the exact mechanism of reinforcing the binding part in pavement structures is still unclear. This research aims firstly to examine the material at the warm mixed mortar level using a combination of two synthetic fibres (aramid and polyolefin) to conclude its fracture performance. Several laboratory tests were performed using specially designed experimental tools. Samples of three different fibre contents (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% of specimen weight) and two fibre lengths (19 and 38mm) were evaluated. In particular, pull-out tests, whose objective was to explore the interaction of fibre-matrix demonstrated a matrix-type of fracture; meaning that the adhesion of fibre-matrix is higher than the strength of the matrix itself, which implies a benefit of adding fibre to a mixture at high service temperature.<br/>Summary<br/> Moreover, direct tension tests were carried out with both monotonic and cyclic loading to measure the effect of the synthetic fibres on tensile strength, fracture energy and fatigue life of reinforced warm mixes under monotonic and cyclic tension load, respectively. These tension experiments concluded improvements on mechanical characteristics of warm mixed asphalt mortars when fibres were added, mainly applying higher dosages than the recommended by the fibres supplier. Overall, the current results elucidated that implementing dedicated material studies at micro-scales can assist on understanding the material performance and tailoring systems beyond sometimes recommended reinforcement dosages by the suppliers. Finally, a semi-circular bending test was performed as the largest scale of this research using various fibre amount composition as well as fibre length inside the bituminous mix, and the final results mainly correspond with the other examinations that have also been conducted. Therefore, the research methodology utilised in this thesis has been able to examine the reinforcement effect brought by the integration of synthetic fibre to failure performance of the warm mixed asphaltic mixture specifically regarding the cracking resistance extensively.","Fibre; Warm Mix Asphalt; Mortar; Tension; Aramid; Polyolefin; Direct Tension test; Pull out test; Semi-circular bending test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Both its panel fitting and yield prediction functions have been validated with existing systems monitored by Solar Monkey. The calculation times of different parts of the algorithm were measured and decreased while keeping the accuracy of the algorithm in the desired range.<br/><br/>First, a new approach to determine the roof segment orientation was introduced, using both the normal vector and the longest side of the roof segment polygon. A visual inspection was carried out, in which recent aerial images were compared to 3D roof segments that were provided by Readaar. For 145 roofs, the roof segments on which PV was placed were manually selected, such that they could validate the quick-scan. From the visual inspection it was deduced that in-roof obstacles were often not detected. Sometimes the customer had no desire to use the full potential of the roof, or preferred a rectangular panel layout instead of fitting the maximum amount of panels. Another finding was that the distance kept from the roof segment edge was much smaller than initially expected. For pitched roofs, there was virtually no distance between the roof edge and installed panels, while for flat roofs around 20 cm was kept. Using zero distance from the roof edge, the panel placement algorithm still underestimates the roof potential by 17.5% on average, with a relative standard deviation of 46.3%.<br/><br/>Three yield calculation methods were compared: the Solar Monkey method, the SVF &amp; SCF method, and the method without obstacles. The predicted performance or final annual AC yield was compared with the actual measured performance, both measured in kWh/kW<sub>p</sub> per year. For the three methods, relative standard deviation values of 7.2%, 7.5% and 9.1% were found respectively. The three methods could generate yield predictions for 91.0%, 92.7%, and 93.1% of the 145 roofs. For highly shaded roofs with Sun Coverage Factor values above 0.25, the method neglecting obstacles performed significantly worse. Additionally, the performance of large roofs with an average segment area above 70m<sup>2</sup> was generally under-predicted, while the relative standard deviation was highest. It is expected that using one obstacle view is not accurate enough for large roof segments. <br/><br/>The computational speed of the panel fitting algorithm for pitched roofs without internal obstacle segments was found to be 20.1± 5.0 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, whereas for flat roofs it was found to be 56.9±12.0 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. In order to optimise the quick-scan algorithm in both speed and accuracy, two filtering steps were carried out. Segments with a pitch angle over 10° and an orientation between 0° to 60° or 300° to 360º were filtered out, since they would have an annual performance below 650 kWh/kW<sub>p</sub>. Moreover, segments with an area less than 8.4 m<sup>2</sup> were filtered out, since they were observed to fit less than 2 panels. The quick-scan calculation times for different yield prediction methods were found to be 15.50±1.01, 14.58±1.13 and 2.75±0.44 seconds per roof, respectively. These times were measured for data sets that had around 2 segments per roof after filtering on segment area and pitched segment orientation. It can be concluded that the method without obstacles is preferred when the calculation time is a limiting factor, whereas for accuracy the Solar Monkey method is preferred.","PV systems; Algorithm; PV potential; Quick Scan; PVision; validation; Solar Monkey; Panel fitting; yield prediction; quick-scan; final annual AC yield; rooftop PV; Readaar; SVF; SCF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-19","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","PVision",""

Having a priori knowledge on the playback signal renders adaptive filtering a well-suited speech technique. Therefore, the class of least mean squares (LMS) algorithms is studied and assessed. Among other techniques of this class the transform domain LMS (TDLMS), due to its inherent signal decorrelation properties, is shown to achieve the best performance in terms of noise suppression and improved speech intelligibility as well as word error rate. The results of this study correspond to a set of simulation incorporating real impulse responses measured in both an anechoic and a reverberant environment.","speech enhancement; smart speakers; Adaptive Filtering; Speech separation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Currently the top layer is covered with a synthetic antiskid material called ASK. But the strong weather limitations for the installation of this material have opened the door for alternatives. Heijmans has proposed an innovative asphalt mixture that is able to provide similar and in some cases better surface performances compared with the ASK. This asphalt mixture is called Flightflex R and is a stone matrix asphalt. Consequently it is affected by the variability of the construction process. This thesis project focuses on the analysis of the best quality control procedure for this asphalt. The pavement surface needs to meet specific requirements and it is of interest to define a sampling methodology for the evaluation of the Texture Depth (TD). In particular the research aims to define the minimum number of samples that provides the highest reliability for the definition of the Mean Texture Depth (MTD) of the surface. To achieve this goal a theoretical approach is adopted. Starting from the collection of a consistent number of samples, the properties of the surface are analysed. In this process it is of interest to define the influence of the construction process on the surface quality. The information obtained are used to simulate bigger surfaces on which different sampling methodologies are tested. In particular three different methodologies are analysed: the current methodology called CROW, a Uniform methodology and a random methodology called Hammersley methodology. Thorough testing these sampling methodologies on the simulated surfaces it is possible to evaluate the relative error between the MTD of the simulated surfaces and the MTD of the samples taken. A Monte Carlo type of approach helps to define precisely which methodology performs better. The one with the lowest relative error and minimum required number of samples will be considered the most efficient. The simulation of the surfaces and the analysis of the sampling process highlights a correlation between the manufacturing signature and some sampling methodologies. In case of a correlation the reliability of the methodology decreases. In particular the CROW and the Uniform methodology present a form of correlation and thus have a lower reliability. The Hammersley methodology aims to simulate a random selection of samples and for this reason it does not enter in correlation with the surface patterns. The three aforementioned methodologies are in the last part of the research applied on a 500 m long section of the runway Polderbaan at Schiphol Airport. Although the Uniform methodology is less reliable it provides a 1% of relative error with only 70 samples. The Hammersley instead needs 180 samples to reach the same relative error but with a higher reliability. The CROW is the least performing. In fact it has a lower reliability than the Uniform strategy and it needs 170 samples to reach 1% relative error. The research helps highlighting the correlation between the manufacturing signature left by the construction process and the sampling strategy adopted. It also highlights the fact that a random distribution escapes this correlation and provides more reliable results. To conclude, the companies are suggested to use the Uniform methodology in case of short time available for the quality control measurements. This comes with a lowest reliability that has to be accepted. But in case a high reliability is required and sufficient time is available, the Hammersley strategy is considered more appropriate.","pavement engineering; Schiphol; asset management; Texture depth; asphalt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regrettably, because of their small size and the fact that the largest groups of asteroids in the solar system are situated tens of millions of kilometers from Earth, ground based observations yield limited data, mostly confined to surface characteristics. To date, space missions traveling to asteroids, or other SSSBs, have also been principally focused upon collecting data from the surface, or within approximately 2m thereof. More penetrative interior survey methods exist in terrestrial application, but methods like seismology and core drilling would require specific equipment and direct landing on the asteroid. Muography potentially presents a means of going in-between these two extremes of the study of asteroid interiors. High energy galactic cosmic ray primaries constantly, and randomly, impact all objects in the solar system, generating secondary showers of particles when they interact with stationary matter. Of primary interest to this project, unsurprisingly, are muons. These particles have a considerable mass, are generally very energetic (&gt;200 MeV), and exist in positive or negative species with a charge magnitude equal to that of 1 electron. These factors contribute to a very low energy loss through conventional mechanisms like ionization,bremsstrahlung, or pair production, making muons very penetrative. Their high energy, highly penetrative nature, and relative abundance as GCR secondaries present an opportunity to perform radiography of the inside of rocks of very large dimensions. Prettyman et al, who have performed initial analyses of the space-bourne tomographic methodology itself, estimate that the interior of asteroids up to 1km in diameter may be surveyed with this technique. This thesis details the project of a feasibility study for a small-scale hodoscopic detector of the type that could be flown with a somewhat standardized satellite bus no larger than the commonly-used ”small” or ”micro” satellite categories for use in just such muography.","Asteroid; muon; tomogrpahy; space mission; particle radiation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Tock is written in Rust, a novel system programming language enforcing type safety at compile-time, and takes advantage of Rust's strong safety features. However, since Tock allows user-level applications to be written in any language, Rust is not sufficient in guaranteeing memory safety for user-level Tock. To obtain memory isolation, Tock takes advantage of MPUs provided by recent microcontrollers. Although Tock is supposed to be fully architecture agnostic, it is at present only able to support the MPU of the Cortex-M architecture. The lack of an architecture-agnostic MPU interface, process manager and the corresponding MPU implementations is the biggest remaining hurdle in making Tock architecture independent. In order to create such an interface, this work performs an analysis of state-of-the-art MPUs, comparing their key features and constraints. A feasibility study for the design of an MPU interface in Tock is carried out, resulting in a number of general changes to the current implementation of Tock, and leading up to the design, implementation and evaluation of two MPU interfaces. The first is a region-based interface, aiming to have an abstraction that is straightforward and completely agnostic of what the MPU is used for. The second interface is a process-based interface, that utilizes knowledge of what it is applied for in order to provide a solution that is more efficient given the constraints and optimizations of an arbitrary MPU. Implementations for the Cortex-M, Kinetis K and nRF51 MPUs are created that match these interfaces, and in addition fundamental adaptations to process management in the Tock kernel are made. On the Hail development board, these changes reduce context switching time by 25.34%, but lead to a cost of 848 bytes or 1.0% in flash memory overhead. Most importantly, with the introduction of these interfaces, the biggest hurdle for Tock in becoming a multi-architecture operating system is overwon. <br","Tock; IoT; embedded systems; Rust; MPU; memory; protection; unit; Management; interface; region; process; region-based; process-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

As a result of the drought, multiple research is conducted related to the hydrological and environmental<br/>impacts. However, the role of the root-zone storage capacity during the drought period is not investigated well. This root-zone storage capacity is the water available for plants to transpire and to grow. It influences the partitioning between the transpiration and the run-off rates, which controls the fundamental<br/>processes in ecosystem functioning (such as floods, droughts and groundwater recharge). Scientific evidence is growing that this root-zone storage behaves dynamically. The underlying assumption is that plants adapt their root system to climatic and environmental changes. One of these changes related to drought is the availability of snow, which is an important source of the rivers in California. It is important to know how the rootzone is changing due to the snow cover changes during the California Drought to understand the hydrological<br/>behaviour of the Californian rivers. For that, the Merced River basin in the Sierra Nevada is analyzed on the relationship between snow cover and root-zone storage capacity.<br/>To analyze these relationship, this research consists of two parts: trend analysis and hydrological modeling.<br/>The purpose of the first is to see whether there is a change in snow cover, temperature and precipitation and to learn about the dynamics between precipitation, temperature and snow cover. This is done by conducting a trend analysis with the Mann-Kendall test for precipitation, temperature and snow-free days. These snowfree days are calculated based on snow cover data from a MODIS satellite product (MOD10A1) and a method of regional snow-line elevation. Additional to this, a multivariate regression analysis was executed to related snow-free days, precipitation and temperature to each other. Furthermore, scenarios for snow-free days were conducted to analyze the effect of the CaliforniaDrought. The purpose of the second part is to relate the change<br/>in snow cover to the root-zone storage capacity. This is done by building a hydrological model calibrated on the snow cover data. By doing this, the maximum soil moisture deficit over a 15 year interval could be calculated,<br/>which is an estimation for the root-zone storage capacity.<br/>The trend analysis showed a clear downward trend in winter precipitation, but not a significant trend in temperature. The snow-free days are increasing at all elevations, but only significant up to 3300 m.a.s.l. The maximum trend related to the observed snow-free days was 7 days/year at 2300 m.a.sl. and the average for the whole catchment was 4 days/year. The multivariate regression analysis showed that the temperature influence ismore important than the precipitation input, however the maximum R2 was around 0.7. At higher elevations it was not so clear whether precipitation or temperature described snow-free days well enough. The scenarios re veiled the enormous effects of the California Drought on the total amount of snow-free days and confirmed the importance of temperature during this extreme event. At 2300 m.a.s.l. it differs 40 snow-free days with a situation with normal winter temperatures. The effect of temperature is also visualized in the hydrological model, where the maximum soil moisture deficit was not found in the drought period but slightly before it. This is caused by the combination of small precipitation amounts and a low temperature (no melt). In the drought period the soil moisture deficit was limited by the melt from the snow. This is also confirmed by the analysis of the snow storage in the hydrological model. However, the maximum of the soil moisture deficit is gradually increasing of the past 30 years which hints to the adaptive behaviour of the root-zone.<br/>The trend analysis and the hydrological model showed that the amount of snow in the Merced River basin is decreased due to the California Drought. At 2300 m.a.s.l., the snow-free days are changed from 170 to over 250. The maximumdifference in snow storage before and after 2010 is 100mmaveraged over the whole basin.<br/>The decrease of snow during this period had a limiting effect on the soil moisture deficit. Due to the melting water, no maximum values of soil moisture deficit were found. However, slightly before the California Drought<br/>a maximumwas found. This maximum is related to a cold but dry period, where not a lot of melting water was generated. Overall, the maximum of the soil moisture deficit is increasing over the past 30 years. This hints to the adaptive behaviour of plants. In summary, the California Drought caused a decrease of the amount of snow and resulted in limiting of the soil moisture deficit. Simultaneously the soil moisture deficit is increasing.<br/>The limiting effect of snow melt on the soil moisture deficit gives plants the time to cope with the changes.","Hydrological modeling; Snow cover; Root-zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","37.414705, 119.205354"

Typically, enhancement techniques like supply modulation or load modulation are used when dealing with envelope modulated communication signals, which increasingly have high peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPR). Supply modulation is most favored in handsets. Techniques like ""Envelope Tracking (ET)"" or ""Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER)"" are employed to generate high efficiency over a large power back-off range. These techniques are robust to antenna impedance variations compared to load modulation techniques like Doherty. However, the downside of supply voltage modulation is the need for a dynamic supply modulator. Such supply modulators are very difficult to implement for systems with video bandwidths &gt;20MHz. For modern communication systems like 5G, video bandwidths for both the base stations and handsets are drastically increasing (up to ~1GHz). 5G communication is also going to operate at very high frequencies, commonly known as mm-wave. This degrades the efficiency of the transmitter because of increased losses in the output conductance of the active device and from any power combining network. Furthermore, due to the use of (massive) MIMO/smart-antenna techniques in these 5G base stations, there will also be undesired time-fluctuating antenna impedances due to PA back-coupling through the antenna array, which are extremely difficult to handle in efficiency enhancement techniques based on load modulation. In this thesis, a new type of wideband ""supply voltage modulation"" has been investigated. The aimed concept uses multiple constant supply voltages rather than a single time variant dynamic voltage supply. Several ""parallel"" PA devices are connected to different DC supply voltages while their RF output terminals are AC connected. The PA connected to a lower DC supply is used in the low power region, while the PA with a higher DC supply is used in the high power region. This ensures that the DC power consumption is output power dependent. By gradually controlling the amplifier branches through their RF inputs, proper transitions can be made between the different amplifier branches (i.e., from low power to high power region and vice versa)","mm-Wave; 5G; Power Amplifiers; FDSOI; efficiency-enhancement; Supply interpolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","gENESIs",""

However, immense challenges are accompanied with the closure works of large basins. This research treats the closure strategy to close the Gulf of Khambhat in India. The project is known as ""Kalpasar"", which aims to create of a fresh water reservoir in the Gulf of Khambhat by constructing a 35 km dam across the estuary. The Kalpasar project<br/>has been on the Indian Governments agenda since 1986. Royal Haskoning was involved in the pre-feasibility study, which was presented in 1998. However, due to an alignment change to a more northern position, earlier proposed closure work designs are now considered out of date.<br/>To avoid irrelevance of this research through time and assist the Kalpasar development project with optimizing a new design for the closure works, this research treats the development of a fundamental parametric optimization tool to quickly perform a first-order evaluation of possible closure strategies on costs. <br/>The tool as a product along with case results are delivered to the Kalpasar development project for further design optimization.<br/>Closing the tidal basin involves closing a certain wet cross section along the chosen dam alignment through which large tidal currents penetrate caused by tidal differences up to 11 m. Complexity is caused by increasing tidal flow velocities due to increasing constriction of the wet cross section during the closure. The developed optimization tool can evaluate and compare six pre-programmed strategies to close a multi-sectional wet cross section in time on costs of three fundamental design requirement or ""cost factors"": Required dam material, bed protection and equipment. Using a multi-sectional storage model to compute the flow velocities in the gap, the channels and tidal flats can be individually modeled after which they are linked as a system. The model reacts as a system to changes in flow area by closing certain cross sections (a channel or a tidal flat). The individual cross sections can be closed strategically by defining their closure method (horizontal, vertical or sudden), execution phase and construction capacity. These are called ""strategic input parameters"". Defined for all sections, they determine the closure sequence of the system in time. Optimization is achieved when the strategic input parameters define a closing sequence which minimizes the combined cost of all cost factors. <br/>Subsequent to the storage model, three computational models are introduced to quantify the required dam material, bed protection and equipment. Based on earlier research, the material model utilizes only quarried rock for gradual closures and sluice caissons for sudden closures. The equipment model utilizes large dump trucks for horizontal closures and ships or a temporary cable-way/bridge system for vertical closures. The construction capacity is linked to material and bed protection models, since both design requirements are time dependent. Increasing construction capacity can therefore decrease these requirements.<br/>Since subsequent models largely depend on the flow velocity, an attempt to validate and calibrate the storage model was performed using results from previous research and a 2D-H Delft3D model. Deviations with respect to the Delft3D model were significantly large (factor 2-3), because storage models can only be utilized if the basin size and the remaining gap are small (usability limits). Therefore, calibration was performed by introducing an artificial contraction factor to compensate for the error in the flow velocity. An exponential relation was determined linking the error to the constriction percentage of the gap. With increasing constriction percentage, the error decreased due to increasing validity of the storage model usability limits. The artificial contraction factor can be used to optimize the closure of the Gulf of Khambhat. However, for general use, the model should be calibrated to each specific site.<br/>Case study results show that using multiple cross sections to model the bathymetry with respect to a single cross section, the optimal strategy can change from fully vertical to a combination of horizontal and vertical with a specific capacity. Utilizing the developed model for the Kalpasar case is therefore recommendedbecause the complex bathymetry creates many possible strategies and can’t be reliably modeled with single cross-sectional models. The strategy that showed the most potential for further optimization is: First closing the tidal flats horizontally by forward dumping of rocks, while closing the channels up to 40% of their depth with dumping ships after which the remaining gap is closed vertically by a cable-way or bridge system. This strategy is commonly suggested by existing literature, thereby increasing reliability and validity of the optimization model. <br/>A second case study showed negative effects of increasing construction capacity on the total cost. However, these case results are based on assumed costs and cost functions for equipment, which should be verified by contractors first. Bed protection requirements did decrease significantly by increasing construction capacity, showing potential for development of high capacity closure equipment to avoid these costs. Further future development should focus on vertical closure equipment to decrease both material and bed protection costs.<br/>To conclude the recommendations, more case studies should be performed to quantify influences of parameters already included in the model, such as the permeability of the dam, the presence of a tidal power facility and the use of a sudden caisson closure to relieve the final closure. Secondly, further validation of the storage model is essential to generate more reliable results. Furthermore, research should be performed into cost functions of several existing or new high capacity equipment for vertical closures, relating costs to construction capacity to improve usability of the optimization model.<br","Khambhat; closure dam; closure works; optimization; kalpasar; tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","Kalpasar Project, Royal HaskoningDHV","21.993060, 72.318580"

There is a disconnect between the black-box character of these models and the needs of the users. A sub-field of explainable machine learning has emerged to fix this disconnect but it is still in its baby steps. In this thesis we have developed a new method called LEAFAGE that is able to extract an explanation for a prediction made by any black-box ML model. The explanation consists of the visualization of similar examples from the training set and the importance of each feature. Moreover, these explanations are contrastive which aims to take the expectations of the user into account. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of LEAFAGE to reflect the true reasoning of the underlying ML model. LEAFAGE performs better than the current state-of-the-art method LIME, on ML models with non-linear decision boundary. At last, we performed a user-study to evaluate empirically how useful example and feature importance-based explanations are, in terms of perceived aid in decision making, acceptance and measured transparency. It showed that example-based explanations perform significantly better than providing no explanation and feature importance-based explanation, in terms of transparency, information sufficiency, competence and confidence.

Composite materials present a higher specific stiffness and strength than metal alloys. In addition, composites show a high corrosion resistance and damage tolerance. However, the failure mechanisms of composite materials are highly complex due to their anisotropic nature. The simulation of damage in composite materials is one of the pressing engineering issues of today. In fact, there are still multiple failure cases that have not been successfully modeled. One of these failure cases is the crushing of the material, which triggers a combination of failure mechanisms that include delamination, matrix cracking, fibre tensile fracture and fibre kinking, and friction. Bolted joints are currently the main option to join composite to composite in civil aerospace structural applications. Accurately predicting the crushing behaviour of composite materials is of special interest for the simulation of bearing failure in mechanically fastened composite joints, which in turn, would allow for more optimal and less dependent on experimental testing joint designs. In this work, the Gutkin continuum damage model, which was developed with the aim of simulating crushing of uni-directional fibre reinforced composite materials, was implemented. The implemented subroutine was validated against the results published by the author. The different features of the model were evaluated and a parametric study was conducted. The Gutkin subroutine was integrated into the existing Fokker subroutine and tested under cyclic tensile-compressive loads. Finally, a compression test on a small laminate was conducted.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One of Allseas’ vessels is Pioneering Spirit. The main activities of Pioneering Spirit can be subdivided into pipeline installation, topside installation/removal and jacket installation/removal. The equipment of the first two activities has been successfully put into operation. The equipment to install and remove jackets (Jacket Lift System (JLS)) is currently under development. The mechanism to upend/tilt-over the Jacket Lift System is the subject of this graduation project.<br/> <br/>The design challenge of Pioneering Spirit’s Jacket Lift System is to install or remove a jacket with a height of at least 70 meters and a mass of up to 20 000 mt (in air) in a single lift/operation. In this thesis project, an additional design solution has been investigated and developed. The objective was to investigate the feasibility and favourability of various principles and concepts to upend/tilt-over a jacket using Pioneering Spirit. Key topics in the development of the design solution were the controllability of the operation, the compatibility of the system in the current appearance of Pioneering Spirit’s, the complexity of the operation and the investments costs to construct, operate and maintain the system. <br/><br/>The design solution found in this graduation project consists of a tilting system that rotates over the stern of Pioneering Spirit. The system is driven by a pushing system installed on the reinforced transverse frames on the aftdeck of Pioneering Spirit. The system must be movable to relocate the centre of gravity before upending or after tilting-over of the system. The system is controlled by two winch systems, one attached to the tip of the tilting lift beams (Derrick Hoist system, consisting of 10 winches) and the other to the upper pivot point of the pushing system (Upend/Tilt-over Mechanism, consisting of 8 winches). The system can be controlled in both rotational directions using the two winch systems. The tilting lift beams and pushing system are connected by means of a roller/slider connection. <br/><br/>The maximum forces, stability and controllability of the system were checked with a coarse dynamic mathematical model. The natural frequency of the system with and without jacket appeared to be in the same frequency range as the excitation response spectra. This was solved by stiffening the system by increasing the effective diameter of the winch systems and by applying pre-tension. Subsequently, the system appeared to be possibly instable during the first/last 18 degrees of the tilting operation. This was solved by applying an auxiliary construction during the first/last 30 degrees of the tilting process. The maximum response amplitude of the system was calculated by means of a calculation of the maximum excitation in the frequency domain (regular waves) and for time series (irregular waves) for the positions in which the Jacket Lift System can be positioned and all incoming wave directions. The maximum response amplitude of the system occurs in beam waves when the system is positioned vertically. Although the maximum response amplitude of the system is small, mainly because of the stiffness, the maximum forces in the system are exorbitantly large. To give an indication, the maximum tension in the Derrick Hoist System is 4125 mt. At a certain moment in the tilting procedure, the entire mass of the Jacket Lift System (15 000 mt) and Jacket (20 000 mt) is applied to the pivot points at the stern of Pioneering Spirit. In general, the static forces deliver the greatest contribution to the total force. The maximum loads are considered feasible, although strengthening measures must be taken.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-18","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

However, some of these aspects are scoring below target. One of these aspects that weighs heavy on the overall assessment is the (process of) baggage reclaim. Aside from the actual waiting time, the most mentioned pain point within this process step is the ‘course of events’, rereferring to issues with crowding and congestions. Research shows that waiting in a crowded environment will cause discomfort and strengthen negative emotions. Problems with crowding are in many cases related to human behaviour. Most of our behaviour follows from subconscious decisions and mental shortcuts. As such, pedestrians automatically take the shortest route, the route of least resistance, the most direct route or just follow others. These behaviours can explain multiple bottlenecks and issues with crowding within the current reclaim areas. To prevent or mitigate these issues it is required to achieve a behavioural change on the passengers’ side. Behavioural interventions can be used to steer these automatic decisions and nudge the desired behavior. This project explores if- and how behavioural interventions can mitigate or prevent problems with crowding in order to smoothen the course of events. The insights can be used to enhance the passenger experience for the development of the A-area as well as the existing infrastructure. The preliminary design of the A-terminal is compared on similarities with the current reclaim areas in order to determine the probable bottlenecks. It resulted in six objectives that - if achieved - either create a better distribution of passengers or prevent crowding around the baggage carousels. A behavioural intervention is proposed for each of these objectives. By means of a field experiment one of the interventions is tested and validated. An overwhelming majority of passengers in reclaim area 1 tend to use only one out of two exits. It leads to a messy customs process and stagnation in passenger flow. The intervention aimed to redirect passengers to the second exit by making use of floor markings and additional signage, prompting passengers to ‘skip the queue’ when it started crowding. The first results suggest that nudges are indeed capable of steering passenger movement and path choice. However, iterations should be made on the design in order to improve its effectivity. If the effect is strongh enough, it might make crowd controllers at this area unneccessary. Overall, behavioural interventions seems to be a promising area for experiments and innovation within AAS, especially when congestions and process time are mostly dependent on passenger behaviour.","nudging; behavioural; design; Flow-control; passengers; airport; reclaim; Interventions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-17","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

As a case study, the Amalia bridge near Waddinxveen (crossing the Gouwe channel) is used. Two alternative design propositions are presented. The thesis has been subdivided into several parts, which are introduced below. The first part consists of several expositions. It examines the built up of a movable bridge, the material FRP &amp; its properties together with methods of connecting an FRP deck to steel girders and the rules &amp; regulations required for bridge design in the Netherlands. The second part is the design study, which contains an overview of the original Amalia bridge and the designs created based on adaptions of the original. The designs have been made to have a lower total weight than the Amalia bridge. A lower bound approach has been used, not an optimisation. Thus, leaving room for improvement. Two alternatives are discussed: a hybrid and a non-hybrid solution. A hybrid solution is defined as a solution with the full interaction between the FRP-deck and steel girders: allowing for shear transfer between the two and enabling the deck to function as the top flange of the steel girders. A non-hybrid solution only allows for the transfer of vertical forces and limits the transfer of shear, resulting in the structural separation between the deck and the girders. The design study has led to a weight reduction for both the hybrid and non-hybrid solution of 24 and 16% respectively. It can be concluded that both alternatives clearly illustrate the potential of FRP in bridge design, given the objective to reduce weight.

It responds to growing concerns over the mass deployment of surveillance cameras that are enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) which are turning the cities into digital panopticons (Sadowski &amp; Pasquale, 2015). Such concerns are amplified by the central role played by multinational corporations in developing the technologies that are said to render the city “smart”.<br/>The technologies behind AI-surveillance are proprietary and the nature of it is inherently a “black-box” which inhibits public from understanding it and having a say in its deployment. Due to this reason, the citizens that live in the cities with smart surveillance are often left behind not informed enough about the consequences of the pervasive technology in their environment.<br/> This research addresses this lack of awareness by creating an escape room like experience around the city where players locate hidden surveillance cameras, discover algorithmic biases, and try to fool facial detection algorithm in order to go against a fictional all-seeing AI-surveillance system. Consistent with Flanagan’s (2009) critical play model, the 8 problems of AI-surveillance defined in the research are communicated by the game’s procedural rhetoric (Bogost, 2007).<br/>It also questions whether critical pervasive games — which are the combination of critical design (Dunne &amp; Raby, 2013) and pervasive games (Montola et al., 2009) — is possible of merging the ordinary world with the fictional game world to create a safe space to explore complex socio-technical problems in compelling, relatable ways. <br/>Through the play-test, it was made clear that by providing the players with interactive feedback on how AI-surveillance would perceive the world, the players were able to get a sense of the black boxed nature of AI and ask critical questions about their necessity and consequences. Also, the in-situ experience outside created a heightened awareness of existing surveillance infrastructures.","Smart City; Critical Design; Pervasive Games; AI; Computer Vision; Critical Play","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electricity supply needs to adjust to demand in real-time, at least until energy storage becomes commercially viable, otherwise the energy security is compromised. Hence, the dilemma for energy policies is to continue to promote the expansion of renewables at the same time they secure the provision of flexible sources. One well-known technology for such is the combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT). It has been used for a long time, however now there is concern over its economic viability due to the merit order effect of renewables. Germany is a front-runner in the energy transition and, recently, it enacted the Energy Market 2.0 to lay out a market design to accommodate the increasing intermittency. The underlying belief is that a competitive environment will allow market forces to provide the necessary flexibility in an economic efficient manner. Hence, the success of the Energiewende in this new policy framework depends on how the generation firms perceive the market conditions and investment incentives. This research investigates how these market actors and the federal government will perceive CCGT generation competitiveness, using generation costs as a criterion and external costs to account for social efficiency. A tailored Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) calculation is used to evaluate a CCGT power-plant in the context of a high presence of renewables. The method is broadly used and conveys the complexities of investment appraisal in a relatively simple manner, however there is no prior research that applies it to the described scenario. Energy storage is also investigated for comparison purposes. This research finds that CCGT generation firms in Germany will not have sufficient incentive to invest in new power-plants between 2020 and 2030. It is also found that the technology is not a cost-effective option for flexibility from a societal perspective either. Energy storage is more cost-advantageous than CCGT, especially when external costs are considered. Therefore, CCGT plants are expected not to be attractive for generation actors under the German energy policy framework. Vanadium batteries pose as a promising alternative for the system after 2030, but its uncertain cost development requires public investment to guarantee it effectively becomes competitive. Policies to incentivize CCGT generation seem economic inefficient and are not advisable, as the implementation of new plants during the next ten years would create long-term lock-ins.","Energy Transition; Energy Policy; Renewable Energy Integration; CCGT Generation; LCOE; Energy Storage; Natural Gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Eisma, Y.B. (mentor); Dodou, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","b>Introduction</b>. Air traffic controllers (ATCo’s) are responsible for a safe and efficient air traffic flow, and therefore, they are required to be excellent in conflict detection. Various studies have uncovered relationships between conflict geometry (e.g., conflict angle) and operators’ abilities to detect conflicts. However, little is known about the underlying perceptive and cognitive processes during conflict detection tasks. Knowledge of these processes could give insight into how ATCo’s could be supported. In order to discover how people look at typical air traffic control (ATC) situations, a simplified ATC scenario was presented to novice participants in which two dots (representing aircraft) moved towards each other. <br/><b>Methods.</b> The eye movements of 35 participants were recorded during an experiment in which they had to indicate whether a conflict was present or not. Each participant watched 36 different videos with a duration of 20 seconds and different air traffic geometries. The independent variables were: (1) conflict angle (2) configuration (3) closest distance of approach, and (4) discrete vs continuous moving stimuli (2 Hz or 30 Hz). <br/><b>Results.</b> The results show that continuous moving trials obtained a significantly higher performance score, and more and shorter fixations were found compared to discrete moving trials. Furthermore, in accordance with Neal and Kwantes (2009) and Remington et al. (2000), participants performed significantly better with a conflict angle of 30 degrees compared to larger angles. However, it was found that the performance score with a conflict angle of 100 degrees was lower and the self-experienced difficulty was higher, compared to 150 degrees. The eye movement variables showed a monotonic relation with the conflict angle: when the number of fixations increased, the fixation duration decreased with the higher conflict angles. Furthermore, participants sampled more often from one dot to the other and exhibited less pursuit movement with increasing conflict angles. Moreover, it was found that conflict detection was significantly easier when one of the dots moved diagonally. Finally, the results show that for trials in which no conflict occurred, participants exhibited more fixations and sampled more from one dot to the other, compared to trials with a conflict. <br/><b>Conclusions.</b> We conclude that novice participants are better at detecting conflicts with continuous moving stimuli compared to discretely moving stimuli. If further research shows the same increase in performance with continuous motion in real ATC, flight radars could be adjusted accordingly. Also, it is concluded that the conflict angle has influence on eye movements. Indications are found that conflict angles close to 0 and 180 degrees are easier for detecting conflicts. Further research with various conflict angles is recommended. Furthermore, indications are found that diagonal movements might be easier for conflict detection. Moreover, we conclude that in our experiment pursuit movements are preferred with vertical movements compared to horizontal movement. Finally, we conclude that participants sample from one dot to the other when the dots are further away from each other, but when they come closer to each other, pursuit movement is often used to follow both dots at the same time.<br","Collision detection; Eye movements; Eye tracking; Visual attention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It can enable storage and balancing for surplus in electricity production from intermittent resources as solar energy and wind power. Electrolysis converts green electricity into hydrogen. Hydrogen is suggested to be introduced into the current natural gas grid as sustainable replacement of natural gas in households. This allows for reduction of CO2 emissions and heating buildings that are not easily insulated. The number of poorly insulated homes is difficult using electrical low temperature heat pumps. <br/>Even though hydrogen offers many functional advantages, there are potential barriers that may restrain the introduction of hydrogen into the energy system. Often siting of large-scale renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels, causes anxiety and societal opposition. The reason for opposition is often distrust in institutions and technology that fails to equally distribute costs and benefits amongst stakeholders, authorities and residents. <br/>To prevent this for hydrogen infrastructure, this research studies how hydrogen technology can incorporate local values. This allows for adapting technology to local needs and involving households in decision making. Acceptable technology and a responsible process increase trust and acceptance when the infrastructure is actually adjusted. This research answers the question which technical design choices provide for an acceptable and responsible design of hydrogen distribution and domestic use to households in Stad aan ´t Haringvliet. <br/>Stad aan ‘t Haringvliet is used as case to research how to identify values and capabilities that play a role when designing hydrogen infrastructure for a specific local context. A participatory modelling approach is developed and executed. The approach involves stakeholders and households in the process of developing an Agent-Based Model. The model simulates the acceptability of hydrogen technology for households and identifies issues to be addressed in the next project phases. The Capability Approach and Value-Sensitive Design form the conceptual basis of this research. The effects of technology on households is assessed in terms of valuable capabilities and individual well-being. Capabilities create well-being as they allow users to choose e.g. how to heat and what technology to buy.<br/>The outcomes of this research are specific local requirements and general knowledge on how to develop acceptable technology. Hydrogen infrastructure is acceptable when it has only a small impact on households and offers comfort and security against the same costs as the current system. Higher costs are possibly acceptable when the new system reduces CO2 emissions or offers higher comfort. However, technology alone is not able to incorporate the whole set of important values. Additional institutional measures as for example information, participation and support are required to gain long term acceptance.<br","Acceptability; Agent-Based Modelling; Capability Approach; Value-Sensitive Design; Participatory Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Nowadays, a handful of people and companies are actively working on this subject. Most approaches use the ship’s navigational radar to first predict the wavefield surrounding the vessel and then calculate the motion response. One of the methods used to calculate the ship’s motions is a linear ship motion model based on a frequency-domain approach. The downside of this approach is that the accuracy of the motion predictions is affected by (for example) uncertainties in the Response Amplitude Operators. In this thesis, it is shown that estimating transfer-functions from measured motions and a so-called ""now-cast"" prediction of the forces will counteract for such uncertainties. For the estimation of these transfer-functions, different methods and smoothing techniques are evaluated. Based on sea-trial data, it is shown that the accuracy of the motion predictions increases with ~ 1-10 % when estimated transfer-functions are used, compared to the solutions obtained by pre-calculated transfer-functions.","Motion prediction; Real-time; Frequency domain calculations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-16","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The main challenge was to find out what the obstacles were at the end-of-use. During this research it became clear that many consumers don’t do anything with their old phone when they buy a new one. These old iPhones are left forgotten in drawers. For a circular economy to work, consumers need to bring back their old phones to the store. In this way, valuable material won’t go to waste. To understand the user’s perspective, in dept interviews have been performed. It showed from these interviews that many users keep an old phone as a spare phone for when their current phone dies. But that after some time, these spare phones get “replaced” by other old phones. In this way the drawer with old phones is being created. After a while, these phones are left forgotten. The users often don’t know what data is on these phones. They don’t know what to do with it but can’t take distance from it. After the consumer research, the design goal of this research was created: “Users should be able to comfortably and efficiently back-up their data and then delete their personal information, while feeling reassured and confident. The interaction should become a trustworthy and standard operation”. The focus of the project was backing-up data from the iPhone, so that the users could feel reassured and confident about deleting data from their old phones, because they had stored their data somewhere save. This resulted in the final design of this project: BackUps. BackUps is an app where all old iPhones a user has had, are stored. The iPhones stored in BackUps are looking the same as they were when they were in use. To have this overview of old phones, the user might become less attached to the physical device, because they now see that all data has been stored in the BackUps. The data stored is stored in the iCloud. An implementation plan is also given. When users return their phone to the store, they will get storage as an incentive. This storage can be used for the data of their old phones.","Circular Economy; Apple; end-of-use; consumer experience; interaction; application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

By obtaining this delivered power, the performance of the antenna-coupled QO system is analyzed, including pattern, directivity, common efficiency terms, and gain. In addition, the performance calculated in reception is validated by CST and GRASP full-wave simulation software.

Current solutions to the problem are often more focused on optimality, and a fast algorithm is required to handle large quantities of passengers in real-time applications. We propose an algorithm that combines fast and efficient heuristics with clustering and parallelization techniques that is able to solve large problem instances within several seconds. The small response time of the algorithm is able to provide feedback to the customer rapidly, which makes it very suitable for ridesharing in real-time.<br/>A segmentation of the customers is implemented to speed up the search. This method divides the customers into subareas based on pickup location such that each subproblem contains a similar number of customers. This division also bounds the size of each subproblem to ensure a solution can be found in real-time. <br/>The primary search strategy uses a combination of effective local search heuristics to improve solutions for these subproblems rapidly. A technique reminiscent of variable neighborhood search is also implemented for diversification that can solve smaller instances to a greater degree. The full approach can handle problems containing over 5,000 requests and can effectively manage on-demand ridesharing in Manhattan where the current demand for yellow taxis has tripled.","Ridesharing; Route planning; Taxi; Clustering; Scalability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The study presented in this thesis investigates the capabilities of in-situ reflectance spectro-polarimetry for the purpose of the characterization and classification of the largest known M-type asteroid, named (16) Psyche. The research has a twofold goal: the selection of a stable satellite trajectory capable of gathering ample reflection properties and secondly, to investigate the characterization of surface properties through the simulation of spectro-polarimetric measurements taken in the selected orbital configuration.<br/><br/>In order to identify an attractive, stable orbit configuration for a satellite to best conduct spectro-polarimetric measurements in the vicinity of (16) Psyche, a grid search technique is used to perform an analysis of a three-dimensional orbit design space.

All cases are numerically evaluated with respect to their stability characteristics and coverage performance. <br/><br/>By simulating spectro-polarimetric measurements, this research outlines some of the benefits of in-situ over Earth-based polarimetric observations. It is shown that a stable, low-orbit trajectory, capable of gathering ample surface reflection properties in a wide range of local illumination and viewing geometries, is possible in the dynamic environment of (16) Psyche. Furthermore, the data simulations indicate that there is indeed great scientific significance in the analysis of in-situ spectro-polarimetry for the characterization and classification of bodies without atmospheres.

Daarnaast is het gewenst om de berekening geheel automatisch te kunnen laten draaien, waarbij het zo gebouwd is dat zowel de sondering als de variabelen random gegenereerd worden, zodat elke student een unieke opgave te zien krijgt. Tot slot is het hierbij ook de bedoeling dat het systeem de mogelijkheid biedt de student te trainen tijdens het oefenen. Dit kan door middel van tips en hints of door het bieden van verwijzingen naar de bijbehorende theorie.<br/>Om dit te bereiken zijn Excel en de programmeertaal Python gebruikt voor het leggen van de basis van de berekening. Hierin zijn synthetische sonderingen geplot en is in Python een gemiddelde conusweerstand in het eerste afschuifvlak van een paal berekend. Dit is gerealiseerd door tussen de datapunten van de sondering, lineair te interpoleren naar een discreet aantal elementen van de grondlaag.<br/>In Maple TA is vervolgens geprobeerd dit proces op dezelfde manier te implementeren. In de omgeving van Maple TA op het web zijn vragen opgesteld aan de hand van de formules en variabelen, afkomstig uit de methode van Koppejan. Ook hier is een synthetische sondering tot stand gekomen. Het werken met datastructuren bleek in Maple TA echter lastig in gebruik vergeleken met Python. In verband met het tijdsbestek van het Bachelor Eindproject en het complexiteit is het helaas niet gelukt een complete berekening te coderen en tot voltooiing te brengen.<br/>Het is daarentegen wel gelukt om in Python de gemiddelde conusweerstand in het eerste overgangsgebied te bepalen. Hier kan een geheel willekeurige sondering gemaakt worden waarbij zowel numeriek als grafisch de conusweerstand bepaald kan worden. Aangezien bij de berekening een discreet aantal elementen is gebruik, kan de gemiddelde conusweerstand zeer nauwkeurig worden berekend.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this master thesis, a method is proposed and implemented that defines localized tangential vector fields on a mesh surface, which allows for the designing of vector fields on the triangulated surfaces of these meshes. Similarly, as with 2D radial basis functions for function values, it is possible to accurately approximate, compress and design vector fields using the localized tangential vector fields with an applied radial basis function scalar. The proposed system constructs multiple localized tangential vector fields on the surface and creates a basis from them that covers the entire surface. Other works have already suggested methods for the designing of tangential vector fields but most did not allow for both soft and hard constraints to be used when designing fields in real-time. One approach was able to design fields in real-time but had the bottleneck that it required a lot of precomputation time as it was using spectral processing techniques and a spectral transform to work in the spectral representation. Using the proposed localized tangential vector fields basis in this work also allows for the real-time modeling of tangential vector fields without to much precomputation time. However, it should be noted to fully optimize the proposed system several improvements on the current techniques used in this work have to be made to compete with the spectral representation. The proposed system is the first to our knowledge that uses localized tangential vector fields on meshes for the designing of tangential vector fields.","Vector Field; Vector; radial basis functions; tangent vector field design; tvfd; basis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The uncertainty and difficulty of properly conducting cyber risk management processes do not make it easier for organisations to cope with cyberattacks.

Furthermore, barely any literature is available on the insurance policies that insurers can utilise to positively influence the ecosystem. Additionally, the researches in current literature, whilst providing useful insights, still lack the chaos, interconnectedness and unpredictability (dynamicity) that characterises the cyber security ecosystem. In order to close this knowledge gap and tackle the issue of dynamicity, a modelling study was conducted utilising agent-based modelling. The agent-based model was built to simulate the cyber security ecosystem and to test the effects of various cyber insurance policies. The main findings from this research were that the various insurance policy options had positive but rather small influences. The combination of several policy options into a synergetic design provided results with more observable effects on ecosystem level.

An increasing amount of research is dedicated to the consideration of tour formation in freight simulation models, but these tour formation models lack statistical calibration on empirical data, do not represent shipments explicitly, or focus on a narrow segment of freight transportation. This paper presents a novel shipment‐based approach to model tour formation behavior. We developed an algorithm that constructs tours through iterative allocation of an additional shipment. Two choice models provide an empirical foundation to this algorithm. Parameters of these choice models are estimated on a dataset with information regarding over two million shipments. This information is gathered automatically from the planning systems of carriers transporting goods in the Netherlands. With this model we are able to reproduce observed tour patterns excellently for a given set of shipments. In addition, the model considers many objectives and constraints that determine the tour formation process and acknowledges differences between goods, vehicle, and location types. For example, shipments at ports tend to be transported with direct tours, while tours starting at a distribution center have more stops. This model can be applied in a shipment‐based freight simulation framework to construct tours for large third‐party carriers in the Netherlands.","tour formation; freight transportation; freight transport; behavioral model; Transport modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Non-verbal communication between drivers and pedestrians seems to play an important role in the mitigation of collisions. The emergence of autonomous vehicles in traffic in the near future presses the need to investigate objective measures related to pedestrian crossing behaviour and the efficacy of communication devices on autonomous vehicles that might replace the nonverbal signals of the human driver. In order to objectively investigate the efficacy of communication devices on autonomous vehicles, 24 participants in this study were immersed in a virtual reality environment, via the use of an Oculus Rift and an Xsens Link motion tracking device. In this virtual reality environment, participants were presented with 18 series of autonomous vehicles. Each series represented one unique combination of independent variables and contained a total of five vehicles. The vehicles were either equipped with a Text display or Frontal Braking Lights that indicated the yielding intentions of the vehicle, or were without any external interface. Furthermore, the inter-vehicular distance between the second and the third vehicle in the series varied between 20, 30 or 40 meters. The participants were instructed to cross the road onto the zebra crossing in the virtual environment when they deemed it was safe to do so. The experiment was designed in such a way that the only crossing opportunity for the participants was between the second and third vehicle when the third vehicles yielded. The road crossing decision of the participants, operationalized by the objective measure of their forward gait velocity, was earlier in time when there was either a Text display or Frontal Braking Lights present on the third vehicle in the series, when the inter-vehicular distance between the second and third vehicle was 20 meters and the third and subsequent vehicles yielded. Congruently, the self-reported ability of participants to predict the behaviour of the oncoming vehicles was significantly better when the third vehicle had a Text display compared to when there was no external interface. However, no significant difference in self-reported ability to predict the behaviour of the oncoming vehicles was found for the Frontal Braking Lights. Furthermore, the forward gait velocity was significantly greater in the presence of a Text display compared to when there was no external interface present for the condition in which the inter-vehicular distance between the second and third vehicle was 30 meters and the third and subsequent vehicles yielded. This work shows that besides the current standard of subjective validation by pedestrians of external human-machine interfaces on autonomous vehicles these interfaces can objectively be validated through the recording and differentiation of body motions.","External Human-Machine Interfaces; Autonomous Vehicles; Non-Verbal Communication; Pedestrian Crossing Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (graduation committee); Hordijk, D.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Shear failure is one of the most critical failure modes of reinforced concrete members, especially for those without shear reinforcement. Despite the extensive research programs in the last decades, there is still no general agreement on a rational theory to assess their shear capacity. In the recent years, researchers have focused on developing mechanical models for shear design that are based on a predefined crack pattern and kinematics assuming that the shear force can be transferred through a critical shear crack by various shear transfer mechanisms. These mechanical models need to be validated by detailed kinematic measurements taken from experiments. This information could not be acquired before, however, in the recent years, new measurement technology has developed quickly, amongst others, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) provides new opportunities to obtain the crack pattern and kinematics through the displacement field of the whole surface of the target specimen. In this research, the possibility of using DIC measurements to apply a detailed analysis on the contribution of the shear transfer mechanisms (uncracked concrete, aggregate interlock, dowel action, and arch action) is explored in order to obtain a better understanding of the shear failure process. The analysis is based on ten representative tests on reinforced concrete beam specimens with a height of 1200 mm. The tests are selected from an experimental program designed to study the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete slab strips without shear reinforcement. A new algorithm is developed to automatically determine the contributions of the different shear transfer mechanisms along a crack from the displacement field obtained by DIC measurements. A comparison between the experimental results and the sum of the calculated contributions yield to a reasonable agreement, with an error of 40% when the shear failure is presented just after the formation of the flexural shear crack. With the help of the new algorithm, new insights on the three different shear failure modes observed in the experiments (flexural shear failure, shear compression, and dowel failure) are discussed. Flexural shear failure is attributed to the loss of aggregate interlock when a sudden increase of the shear displacement of the critical shear crack is observed. However, such decrease occurs earlier before the actual failure occurs. Therefore, the actual shear failure mechanism should be studied at an earlier stage. In a shear compression failure, the arch action turns out to be dominating. For members with large depth and exceptionally low reinforcement ratio (&lt; 0.3%), a different failure mode may occur: dowel failure. Which is defined by the opening of the secondary branch of a major flexural crack along the tensile reinforcement. In the three failure modes, the importance of the crack opening in vertical and longitudinal direction is demonstrated, since the increase of them directly result in the drop of shear force that can be transferred through aggregate interlock. Finally, the results are a valuable input to further improve the Critical Shear Displacement theory. It is suggested that the assumed simplified crack profile is modified to a crack with an angle between 60° to 70° to represent more accurately the results and to allow for larger shear displacements. It is demonstrated that an increase of the shear displacement is critical to triggering the shear flexural failure as proposed by this theory and the actual value of the critical shear displacement is larger than the proposed value based on regression analysis.","Shear Failure; concrete members; without shear reinforcement; DIC; kinematics; shear transfer mechanisms; Critical Shear Displacement theory; aggregate interlock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Bifacial PV modules make use of the irradiance that is incident on both faces of the module, leading to higher energy yields. Several techniques are used in order to enhance this bifaciality effect, one of them being the use of reflectors. On the other hand, floating PV systems offer multiple advantages with respect to conventional in-land PV systems such as land saving (a big issue for vastly populated areas), higher efficiencies and lower water evaporation rates. The advantages that these technologies provide as well as the big market opportunities that they offer, make them very attractive for new investors.<br/>The uncertainties related to floating PV and bifacial modules are higher compared to conventional power plants. In order to minimize these uncertainties, accurate modelling tools are essential. The most widespread software suites such as PVSyst or System Advisor Model, offer limited flexibility to the user. Therefore, the user is not able to adapt the simulation to very specific cases such as the addition of reflectors to the system. Additionally, they perform simulations only at module level, without performing an analysis at cell level.<br/>Aiming to fill this gap, a Toolbox that is able to model and simulate the annual energy yield of a PV module, considering the physical effects from cell to module level, was developed by the Pho- tovoltaic Devices and Materials group of TU Delft. This Toolbox allows the integration of the work done by different members of the group and it offers great simulation flexibility to the user. The goal of this thesis is to continue the work carried out by former PVMD members and create a new and improved version of the Toolbox.<br/>During this thesis project, several improvements were carried out in the optical models of the Tool- box. Multiple mistakes were discovered and corrected, and new features that improve the Toolbox were added, making it suitable for its use in real projects. Besides that, the thermal part has been improved by adding the option to utilize a thermal model developed in COMSOL Multiphysics that allows to study the temperature distribution in a bifacial PV module. Finally, the Toolbox was ap- plied to the INNOZOWA project, where several simulations were carried out to find the ideal design of a floating PV plant that consists of bifacial PV modules and reflectors. It was found that the chosen design for this type of system can provide a bifacial gain of 18%.","Floating PV; Bifacial PV; Toolbox; Innozowa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Therefore, producing renewable and<br/>sustainable energy is necessary to protect the viability of this planet. The most well-known and promising form of renewable energy is that of wind power. The limited space in terrestrial areas yielded motivation to the growth of offshore wind industry. Offshore wind turbines (OWT) are most often founded on large-diameter monopiles (MP). Despite of the significant amount of units installed, their design engages Soil Structure Interaction (SSI) models based on slender pile response. The current research focuses on developing a nonlinear nonlocal 1D effective model able to predict the nonlinear response of such a foundation under static loading, incorporating their rigid behavior. This is considered a first step so as advanced nonlinear SSI is incorporated in the design of monopile foundations.<br/><br/>The 1D model is based on Timoshenko beam theory, assuming the beam (representing the MP) is founded on a distributed, Winkler-type foundation, consisting of two types of fully coupled springs, lateral and rotational. These springs allow the model to capture the 3D continuum reaction of the soil towards rigid behaving monopiles.<br/><br/>This type of behavior mobilizes a large volume of the continuum. The term<br/>nonlocality describes this global soil response towards the pile. In a nutshell, perturbations in a 3D Finite Element (FE) continuum are performed to capture the global reaction.<br/><br/>The soil profile considered in this study is homogeneous sand. In the Finite Element model it is modeled with a nonlinear constitutive model. This means that a nonlinear relation between the loading on the monopile and the respective displacement exists. The resulting nonlinear response should be captured in the 1D effective model. This is achieved by calculating the stiffness terms of the 1D model for more than one loading combinations on the MP. The obtained nonlocal stiffness matrices contain a 3rd dimension along which the nonlinear soil response is captured. The nonlinear nonlocal stiffness matrices are directly applied in the 1D effective model.<br/><br/>To visualize the performance of the developed model, a comparison between<br/>horizontal force - head displacement and overturning moment - head rotation curves calculated by 3D Finite Element Analysis and computed by the 1D effective model is made. The comparison is promising for the examined cases. However, there are still steps to be taken in order to further validate the method and expand its applicability.","nonlinear soil; nonlocal response; monopile foundation; 1D effective model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-22","","","","","",""

Furthermore, it was discovered that as long as there is no movement in the system, the BLE signal reception at a specific channel has low variations and so, even a few samples can be representative for each channel. The evaluation of the translation functions was quite promising. Ultimately, by taking advantage of a specific Android's behaviour during the training phase, it became possible to identify the channels of incoming BLE signals.

To meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals, 4th Generation District Heating (4GDH) networks are expected as sustainable heat energy system solution. The concept relies on optimally matching the heat energy supply of sources such as waste heat, combined heat and power (CHP) plants and geothermal energy, with the demand of consumers such as households or greenhouses, whilst using the flexibility of buffers such as aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) systems. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a cooperative multi-agent system (MAS) hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) implementation is presented as smart controller for 4GDH networks, and as alternative approach to improving TNO’s HeatMatcher (HM) algorithm with the proposed algorithm of PowerMatcher (PM) that relies on locational marginal pricing (LMP). The model predictive control (MPC) approach is chosen mainly due to the advantage that it optimizes over a prediction horizon or time span, instead of a single time step. This allows to take into account heat energy demand predictions, time-based constraints, and the inherent dynamic characteristics of 4GDH systems such as buffer flexibility and the variable time delay present in the heat energy exchange.<br/> <br/>The centralized model predictive control (CMPC) control problem is formulated as a deterministic, MAS, mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) optimization problem and is subsequently distributed based on the Optimal Exchange Problem formulation using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Hybrid system modelling theory is applied to model the agents’ subsystems and a simplified heat energy exchange model with constant time delay is assumed. The latter was chosen as decoupled thermal and hydraulic equations proved to be non-linear in the valve positions and mass flow, iterative due to the friction factor and the Reynolds number, and dependent on a variable spatial sampling to accurately track the thermal propagation through the network.<br/> <br/>The CMPC and HMPC algorithms are applied on an academic initial design case study to test desired controller behaviour under perfect heat demand prediction, and on a more realistic case study of the WarmCO2 heat grid involving 5 greenhouses with non-perfect heat demand predictions during a summer and winter scenario. <br/><br/>The initial case study confirms that both algorithms perform as desired with the exception of a small shortcoming of the hybrid modelling, and that they are similar in their optimal solutions as expected. The same holds for the WarmCO2 case study. However, it also showcases that the deterministic optimization can become infeasible due to the time delay modelling and non-perfect heat demand predictions, and that therefore a stochastic optimization approach is preferred. Furthermore, good quality local optimal solutions of the NP-hard problem could be found within a relatively short computing time limit, using the heuristic methods of the Gurobi solver. And lastly, the importance of developing a non-cooperative MPC algorithm to accurately represent the individual optimization goals of different stakeholders.<br","Hierarchical; Model Predictive Control; Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming; District Heating; Optimal Exchange Problem; Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers; Multi-Agent System; MATLAB; Time Delay; Hybrid Systems; Deterministic Optimization; Greenhouses; Cooperative; Heat Energy Exchange Network Model; HeatMatcher; Locational Marginal Pricing; Sustainable Energy; Flexibility; Receding Horizon","en","master thesis","","","","","","The work in this thesis was supported by the MCS department of TNO.

Ultimaker B.V. is a 3D printer company located in Geldermalsen, The Netherlands. Users of 3D printers are presented with a multitude of action possibilities. However, these action possibilities are not yet translated into easy to understand controls that match user intentions. The goal of this project is to design a means for the user to match the intended outcome with the printed result. Eight design opportunities for intent-based 3D printing approaches are defined based on desk research and user experiments. The desk research focuses on the material extrusion process, the 3D printing workflow, user groups, market trends and intent facilitation techniques. The user experiments analyse the role of user intent in the 3D printing workflow. The eight defined design opportunities are: goal-oriented print preparation, reducing the knowledge threshold, component level control, promotion of 3D printing affordances, management of 3D printers, user education, intent communication and feedback. Ideation is applied to these design opportunities to create three concepts, of which the highest scoring concept is further developed. The proposed design is a software plugin for the Cura engine based on product configuration systems used in retail. The software architecture consists of six modules that work together to analyse the model geometry, retrieve requirements and wishes based on the communicated intent, recommend profile selections and user actions, validate the print preparation process and guide the user towards ideal printer configurations and process parameters. By using the 3MF file format, models are separated into several components, which can be configured individually by means of ‘component profiles’. Component profiles are developed by Ultimaker, companies and individual users to present a subset of print settings that facilitate an intended 3D printed result. A software plugin for Cura 3.3.1 is developed as a prototype for testing the designed intent-based 3D printing approach. Due to the scope of this research, testing is limited to component-level manipulations and control of goal-oriented settings. From the user test, it can be concluded that print preparation using component profiles significantly improves user guidance and the educative experience of print preparation. Especially beginners are more confident that their configuration leads to the desired part qualities. The objective plugin reduces the feeling of control, but even expert users show confidence in the final result. Within the plugin users can better voice their intentions through selecting component profiles. These profiles present meaningful feedback to users that both guides and educates them. Of course the realized plugin has its limitations: it does not use intent information that can be included in the supplied model files, nor does it offer all the designed guiding features. Even though these limitations exist, this study represents a step forward in the journey from process-driven to intent-based 3D printing.<br","Additive Manufacturing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Intent","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The need to maximize the concrete strength and utilize it's complete potential is the main focus of researchers even in today's modern age. It is thus, important to restore the existing structures apart from developing new materials and technology to build new structures. The advancement in scientific research and technology has helped us understand the different mechanisms to strengthen the existing concrete structures such as slabs, beams, bridge decks, walls etc. One such strengthening technique is application of overlays to existing concrete structural elements. An overlay of High Strength Concrete (HSC) above a Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) slab without shear reinforcement, proves to be a successful approach in some cases. One such experimental study is performed by Dr. Randl on a composite slab with a HSC overlay on top of NSC Reinforced Concrete (RC) slab. A four point bending test is executed in the experiment on eight such slab specimens. To understand the behavior of a composite slab undergoing shear failure, an analytical study is performed using three different shear models, Eurocode 2, Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) and Critical Shear Displacement Theory (CSDT). Shear resistances are obtained using these models for each composite concrete slab specimen, considering two separate cases of homogeneous slabs, one with substrate properties and other with overlay concrete properties. The average shear resistances obtained from these two limiting cases are compared with each other and their accuracy with the experimental results is also tested. Furthermore, appropriate guidelines are proposed to evaluate the shear capacity of composite concrete sections with the help of these homogeneous slabs with some validation by a numerical analysis. One shear model among the three, depending on the accuracy of results and the least Coefficient of Variation (COV), is chosen to further give a foundation to the analysis of composite concrete slabs. The composite concrete slab is modeled and a four point bending test is simulated by finite element analysis using ATENA. Although CSDT is developed for homogeneous cross-sections, in this research CSDT provides good estimation of shear behavior for composite slab cross-section. The theory also explains the experimental results better than any other analytical model with an accuracy of almost 90 % with the least COV of 2.53 %. Crack propagation is observed considering two different homogeneous slab specimens and some changes in the formulae given by CSDT are proposed. A slab factor is also introduced to explain the increase in shear capacity of concrete slab specimen. Effect of bond strength on the shear distribution along the composite slab cross-section is studied with the help of analytical models and equivalent area method. Striking resemblance in the shear stress distribution is observed in case of NSC homogeneous slab and composite concrete slab thus, further validating the idea that shear capacity of a composite concrete slab can be estimated by considering the substrate homogeneous concrete slab properties. Effect of the HSC overlay is not significant in this study. Two limiting cases are considered for further check for de-bonding/delamination of the interface between the two concrete layers. First case with perfect bond and second with no bond between the two concrete layers are considered. No delamination is observed in case of monotonic loading which agrees with the experimental observations as well.","Shear Strength; Interface; composite structure; Analytical approach","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to fulfil the component requirements, a method named topology optimization can be applied. This is a mathematical design method which can be used in the early phases of the design process.At IHC there is an interest of applying topology optimization for their equipment development process. Therefore the possibilities and limitations of the method should be investigated thoroughly.<br/><br/>The research covers the optimization process of a motion compensated gangway. A motion compensated gangway is a walkway which can be used to provide access from the transport vessel to the offshore structure. Its function is to transport people and cargo safely from the ship to the offshore structure or vice<br/>versa. The goal of this research was to determine to what extent topology optimization can be used in the design of a motion compensated gangway. Finding an optimized result in terms of weight and stiffness by using this mathematical method which satisfies all the requirements. The structural optimization is carried out with several commercial software packages which are compared by using a multi-criteria analysis.<br/><br/>During the optimization process it has been found that there are essentially two stages in the optimization process. In the first stage, the topology or beam orientation of the structure is defined by the topology optimization process. In this part the concept of the design is generated. Variation of the optimization parameters was used in order to develop an efficient structure. The objective for the optimizer was to minimize the compliance of the structure for a certain volume fraction.<br/><br/>In the second stage, the dimensions of all the beams and elements are defined by performing a size optimization. A line model is generated which represents the orientation of the members in the structure. During the size optimization the shape and the dimensions of the members are defined in order to fulfill the<br/>objective. The objective is to minimize the mass of the structure while constraints are defined for the maximum allowable stresses in the members and the maximum vertical deflection of the structure. This post-processing step is required in order to obtain a feasible design. The structural stability of the gangway was improved by performing a linear buckling analysis and by adapting the structure in order to reduce the buckling behaviour.<br/><br/>In the final step of the optimization process, a CAD drawing is generated. This model is analysed by performing a finite element analysis. This showed that the new optimized design satisfies all the requirements which are stated by the DNV for designing a motion compensated gangway. The combination of the topology and size optimization resulted in a new design which yielded a weight reduction of 36,4% compared to the current design. The weight was reduced from 13,08 ton to 8,31 ton, while still satisfying all the constraints. Therefore it can be concluded that this methodology can be used in the optimization of a motion compensated gangway structure","Optimization; Topology optimization; Shape optimization; Motion compensated gangway; Structural Optimization; Optistruct; Hyperworks; Size optimization; Design methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-09","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The emissions of amine from capture plants is one of the biggest challenges faced by this technology. These emissions typically occur by means of aerosol/mist formation. To develop effective countermeasures, it is crucial to understand the dynamic behavior of aerosols within the column, which is currently not well understood. This manuscript presents the results from a study aiming to understand the mechanism of aerosol growth and its behavior along the absorber column in terms of particles number concentration, particle size distribution, and amine emissions. For that, a series of experiments were performed in TNO's bench scale CO2 capture plant using 30 wt% monoethnolamine (MEA) as solvent. For a SO3 and CO2 concentrations of 5.25ppm and 12.5 vol.% in the flue gas, MEA emissions at the top exit of the column were recorded as 1051mg/Nm3 (with vapour emissions of 201mg/Nm3). In the absence of SO3 in the flue gas, inlet particle concentration was 2.71 x 107/cm3 and resulting MEA emissions reduced by 63.5% to 383mg/Nm3. From the bottom of the column until the point of maximum temperature, the MEA content in the vapour phase (&lt;200mg/Nm3) was consistent with the volatility of the solvent. After this point it drastically increases to 1051 mg/Nm3. Both the number of particles and the total particle mass has lowered from the bottom to the top of the column. For the benchmark test, inlet and outlet total particle concentration were found to be 6.24x 107/cm3 and 2.3x 107/cm3 respectively, while total particle mass is 2.22mg/m3 at inlet and 1.32mg/m3 at outlet. Particles with a diameter below 0:006 μm contribute the most to total particle concentration both at the inlet (50%) and outlet (32%), while particles with diameter of 0:087 μm contributes the most to the total particle mass at inlet (47%) and outlet (55%). The measured total mass of particles was in the order of magnitude of 1mg/m3. This is much lower than the expected aerosol mass emissions, in the order of magnitude of 1 g/Nm3 based on FTIR emissions. Increasing the solvent temperature entering the absorber column to 50C caused an increase in total MEA emission (1345mg/Nm3). An increase in total MEA emissions (1793mg/Nm3) during an increase in solvent ow rate (26kg/h) was also observed due to the presence of excess unreacted free MEA present in the solvent. No particles larger than 0:147 μm were recorded, which might explain the low total mass recorded. The cause for this is still under investigation, but it suggests that the sampling procedure may induce systematic errors to the measurements. Nonetheless, the observations from this study have given further insight into the aerosol dynamics in the absorber column and corresponding emissions.","CO2-sequestration; Amine; Emission; Aerosols; MEA; CO2 capture; SO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

As a result, at the bottom of the valley, an extensive system of shallow lakes, lagoons, and swamps was formed due to precipitation and permanent river’s discharge from the Sierra Nevada mountains. This lacustrine system occupied around 1000km2 of the total surface of the valley. Lakes Zumpango, Xaltocan, Chalco, Xochimilco, Texcoco, and Mexico were distinguished. The capital of the Aztec empire, Tenochtitlan, was founded and built on an island in the middle of Lake Mexico.<br/><br/>The Aztecs were known for their impressive constructions and hydraulic structures. At the time of the Spanish conquest, they had a complex system of approximately 95 hydraulic structures (Palerm, 1973), of which the most impressive one was the Nezahualcoyotl dike. This structure was roughly sixteen kilometers long, eight meters’ height and three and a half meters’ width. Its principal function was to protect the city of Tenochtitlan from high water levels in Lake Texcoco.<br/><br/>Nowadays, there are no remains of the dike and most of the lakes were drained. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize the lacustrine system and the Nezahualcoyotl at the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico City dike by using historical documentation and present-day climate and terrain data. This in order to assess the reliability of the dike as a flood defense mechanism and to compare it to modern safety levels. The dike was tested for one failure mechanism: Overflow. A Markov chain and Copula models are proposed in order to create a synthetic time series of precipitation and evaporation. Through a hydrological balance, the water elevation at Lake Texcoco was obtained. In this way, it was possible to provide an estimation of the water level fluctuation in the lake each year during the wet season. In total, a thousand years of synthetic data were generated. <br/><br/>To the author’s knowledge, this is the first time that an attempt is made to compare the Aztec design criteria with present time standards. This research illustrates, from an engineering point of view, the possible design criteria of the Nezahualcoyotl dike and the uncertainties surrounding it. This work can be used as a guideline to assess the reliability of other ancient structures or present-day constructions all over the world whose design is largely based on informal criteria where information for the reliability assessment is scarce.<br","Reliability analysis; Overflow; Dike; Nezahualcoyotl; Texcoco","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","19.432608, -99.133209"

With RI known, corresponding parameters in both time domain (respiratory rate) and frequency domain (respiratory power) can be extracted to indicate the health condition. However, the monitoring technologies available in the clinical environment commonly work obtrusively, which can result in discomfort for patients during a long-term monitoring. Meanwhile, these technologies also possess<br/>high false alarm rates, especially during movement of the subjects. Thus, designing an unobtrusive equipment suitable for moving patients that could collect as well as the algorithm to analyze such signals to provide<br/>an accurate and robust estimate of respiratory information obviously becomes very interesting.<br/>The base signals of interest for estimating respiratory information are two commonly used bio-medical signals, Impedance pneumography (IP) and electrocardiography (ECG). Impedance pneumography is a commonly<br/>used method for respiratory rate monitoring. Electrocardiography is a measurement of the electrical activity of heart and respiration modulates the ECG in both time domain and frequency domain so that it is feasible to estimate the RI also from ECG. These two signals can be utilized with the same measurement electrodes attached to the surface of the body from the same device which provides a potential wearable method for real-time RI monitoring.<br/>This thesis investigates the feasibility of using these two unobtrusive bio-medical signals, IP and ECG, to monitor respiratory rate (RR) in home environments especially during various movements. Algorithm development focused on creating accurate and robust respiratory rate estimates both from impedance pneumography and ECG-derived methods based on the modulation of respiration. Furthermore, the RI estimate from individual signals will be further fused by the way of information fusion and investigate the feasibility of giving more accurate respiratory information than that obtained using one signal alone. Finally, we also<br/>investigate the feasibility of using acceleration recordings (Acc) to attenuate the motion artefact distorting the underlying signals.<br/>Signal quality indicators (SQI) and respiration quality indicators (RQI) together play a key role in providing a more accurate RR estimate. Performance of all methods is evaluated against spirometer recordings, as a golden reference, based on a set of typical statisticalmetrics.<br/>The main results are that IP signal can provide a more accurate RR estimate compared with the ECG signal. Furthermore, the derived signal quality indicators, SQI and RQI, could distinguish data of good quality from bad quality and the RR smoothing process could improve the result both of IP and ECG-derived methods<br/>with the help of signal quality indicator. Another main finding is that the correlation between the motion artefacts and Acc recordings is not high enough, resulting in that Acc is not a proper reference signal for motion artefacts attenuation. Finally, it’s also found that information fusion methods could improve the overall estimate from multiple signal sources.<br/>For the future work, a better reference signal for motion artefacts attenuation should be explored.

Auditory disturbances happen approximately every 12 to 15 minutes, and this is preventing patients to get into their deep sleep during for example the nurse's lunch break. Being able to get into deep sleep has been proven to be very useful for recovery, and obtaining it is possible. Five minutes extra between auditory disturbances could already make all the difference. <br/><br/>From all different auditive sources of the disturbances, it turned out that the main contributors were speech, incidents and alarms. These contributors mainly seemed to be induced by nurse behavior. When questioning why actually these disturbances were present, it was not the case that nurses deliberately were very loud. On the contrary, they love their job and caring and curing patients. It turned out that the loudness of the nurse could be related back to the same phenomenon as alarm fatigue. As nurses are working in a loud environment continuously, they become unaware of what actions actually cause loud noises. Through psychological theories was also found that nurses do not like to continuously be each other’s point of remark, and they rather not say to each other when they are loud. That is the part where I could help. <br/><br/>What was needed within the Intensive Care, was a device that could help get nurses informed about the auditory environment, and whether it has been quieter or louder over the past time. Through multiple rounds of testing, it could be concluded that the best way of getting someone's attention was through visualizations, and when someone wanted more information, there was the need for a written explanation. To describe the loudness of an environment, this could best be done through the hostility of a visualization, and a more distinctive 'loudness-state' could be obtained through adding differences in clarity, color, and speed of such a visualization. All these findings have been included in Doplor, an interactive painting, helping nurses understand the auditory environment a bit better. Doplor listens to the environment by measuring decibels via Quietyme’s sensors, and determines what sort of visualization represents the auditory environment best.<br/><br/>Through testing with both students and nurses, a proper understanding and a small effect could be found. Both parties expected themselves to be quieter with Doplor being around, they understood better what the causes of auditory disturbances would be when Doplor showed a loud visualization and lastly, both parties liked Doplor's appearance and would see him as a real helper in quieting down as a team. Even though more testing should be performed to understand the full effect and change of behavior in nurses, it is believed that Doplor could be a great addition in quieting down as a team within the critical care context.","Doplor; auditory; disturbances; measuring; sonic; environment; artful; warnings; visualisation; hospital; Intensive; Care; Critical; Alarms; Lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

Unfortunately, this process is rarely applied in practice because the campaign analysis models available in literature rely on manual investigation by security professionals. This approach can become quickly too expensive, both regarding time and human resources.<br/>In this thesis project, we improve the state of the art by automating a popular campaign analysis framework introduced in 2011 by Lockheed Martin security researchers Hutchins et al. We do not only automate the process: we also improve its recall performance to provide security analyst with more interesting and complete findings. Hopefully, this will empower all organisations, of any size an security profile, to perform their threat intelligence. Lowering the adoption threshold is a fundamental requirement that is inescapable if we want security to improve horizontally throughout all industry sectors. Widespread adoption of campaign analysis would lead to a broader and quicker understanding of threat campaigns and goals, contributing to a safer society.","Cyber Threat Intelligence; killchain; campaign analysis; Density-based clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-12-31","","","","Computer Science","",""

In addition, rail is concerned as a sustainable mode of transport that can also achieve economies of scale due to its ability to haul large quantities of goods. This study investigates cooperation policies that affect actors’ behavior to better utilize the rail use and lead to a more efficient system. We propose an innovative approach that combines gaming, simulation and optimization as a mixed method to test and evaluate these policies. The port to hinterland freight transportation system in the range of Port of Rotterdam is used as a case study. First, gaming sessions are organized in order to observe actors’ behavior and collect data. The game that is used was initiated by Port of Rotterdam, especially to identify the problems in this system. Subsequently, by assessing the observed data, a simulation model is developed and different policy scenarios are simulated to quantify their performance. In addition, the optimization model is developed, which sets the upper bound for performance and used as a solid base for comparison between the policy alternatives. Finally, the explanation of the difference between the policies’ and the optimized performance can give an insight on what are the root causes of the inefficiency, what is the best allocation of the resources and where the solutions should be focused.","cooperation; Policies; Collaboration; Freight Transport; Port; hinterland; gaming; simulation; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

This device was set up to continuously take hourly full coverage measurements of a one kilometre stretch of beach from a hotel rooftop. <br/> <br/>As sea-levels rise, interest in the morphological processes that take place on beaches is growing, so that coastal safety can be continued to be guaranteed in the future. As a result, it becomes increasingly relevant to understand the transport of sediment towards the beach. Existing studies on the subject focus on timescales of years to decades, often making use of GPS measurements. However, no thorough research has been performed on sub-annual timescales in over a decade, leading to the following main research question for this thesis: How is beach volume growth distributed on sub-annual time scale, both in spatial and temporal dimensions? <br/> <br/>To validate the data obtained by the TLS, an accuracy check was performed which proved the standard deviation of the measurements to be much smaller than the observed morphological change. A rotational instability of the scanning device was discovered and corrected, however a higher measurement accuracy could be obtained by developing a more detailed correction method. The applied correction method did however no longer allow for the study of smaller fluxes such as aeolian transport, as they are overruled by it. It was investigated how the raw 3D data obtained from the TLS should be processed to obtain a clean timeseries of cross-sections. A framework is presented that includes noise detection and removal, object filtering, interpolation and subsampling. Subsequently, timeseries of 132 cross-sections were extracted from the data by selecting a daily low tide scan for 132 days along 4 different transects. <br/> <br/>The resulting timeseries clearly display morphological activity such as intertidal bar migration and storm erosion, and volumetric computations have displayed periods of beach growth. These periods generally occur between storms, during calm wind and wave conditions. The main driver for this growth is the onshore migration of intertidal bars. As bars enter the intertidal zone, they migrate onshore and grow, increasing the volume of the beach. A swash bar that formed high in the intertidal zone during neap tide was found to migrate at increased rate during the neap-spring tidal cycle and welded to the beach, as compared to a different bar which migrated during the springneap cycle. Following spring tide, the bar ceased onshore migration and an offshore expansion occurred. This offshore expansion had a great effect on the volumetric growth of the total beach profile and showcases the influence of tide in the migration of swash bars. However, due to the great number of factors that influence beach growth, only few significant correlations were found between beach volume changes and boundary conditions such as tide, and wave and wind forcing. <br/> <br/>Over the entire research period, only limited growth of the beach has occurred (2.6 m3 over all transects). Periods of growth (up to 20 m3 in under a month) were followed by storms, which eroded the gained volume. No general linear trend in growth was observed, indicating the dominance of variability over trend on the regarded time scale. This result contradicts findings of studies that use monthly or yearly data. When regarding daily data for several months, the beach volume is very much influenced by bar migration and storm erosion which lead to much more variation in the volumetric signal.","Beach growth; terrestrial laser scanning; Morphodynamics; CoastScan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","CoastScan","52.070616, 4.219599"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","With evermore stringent requirements towards pointing accuracy and platform stability, in both commercial and scientific missions, AirbusDS has initiated the development of micronewton class ion engines for applications in attitude control systems. Here the Friedrichshafen branch of AirbusDS pursues the development of a downscaled version of the High EfficiencyMultistage Plasma Thruster (HEMP-T), an electric thruster type currently flown on OHB’s smallGEO bus. In contrast to cold gas systems, which can deliver comparable thrust levels and are currently used as means of attitude control on such highly complex missions as LISA pathfinder, these micronewton HEMP-Ts exhibit a higher performance in terms of specific impulse as well as thrust controllability. With this they enable extended mission lifetime or propellant mass reductions while also increasing attitude control precision. Within the scope of this activity a test facility was developed, consisting of a vacuumchamber containing a thrust balance aswell as the supporting equipment such as vacuum control and data acquisition hardware. In addition to direct thrust measurements performed on each of the design iterations of the thruster it is necessary to investigate the thruster plume geometry and ion energy distribution. While direct thrust measurements, via the highly precise thrust balance already included in the existing test facility, allow for the determination of the thruster performance they do not give an insight into the specific loss mechanisms which cause the observed thrust level or specific impulse to deviate from the ideally attainable values. Here the plume shape can give an indication of the divergence losses encountered by the thruster while the energy of the expelled propellant ions can indicate deficiencies in the thruster design concerning the complex internal magnetic topology necessary for the proper operation of this type of thruster. Building on the experience gathered using an existing, rudimentary, plasma diagnostic system, as well as an extensive literature survey, this document describes the design, development and testing of a plasma diagnostic system based on a novel sensor concept which enables both plume shape determination as well as ion energy distribution measurement in a compact package. This effort includes the redesign of the sensor positioning hardware as well as the associated data acquisition system. Initially an overview of the technologies relevant to this work is given. This includes the description of the basic working principle of the thruster under investigation here, the plasma diagnostic probes which have been deemed viable candidates as an outcome of the preceding literature survey as well as a detailed overview of the existing test facility, indicating potentials for improvement with the introduction of the new diagnostic system. This introduction is followed by the description of the system engineering approach taken in the the scope of this work in order to facilitate the development of this complex diagnostic tool within the temporal and monetary limitations imposed on this project. The main portion of the work described in the following focuses on the development of the novel sensor, which is identified as the optimumsolution in the preceding system engineering section. With the supporting systems for sensor actuation, data collection and post-processing in place the work closes with an exemplary thruster test which derives an indirect thrust measurement from the data collected with the new system and comparing it with a measurement taken by the validated highly precise thrust balance. Good agreement between the two values is shown.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

While there are already many conventional structural strengthening methods that are proposed and being implemented in the affected area, the study of a new innovative strengthening method by using an active control system is attractive and intriguing. The current structural upgrading strategies mainly focus on improving the structural strength and stiffness of the load bearing elements. The active control, on the other hand, could provide an additional dissipative energy mechanism to any building by counteracting the damaging force by the control force produced by the actuators.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of the active control is assessed with multiple time history seismic events in the Groningen area to see the robustness of the control system against seismic excitations with various characteristics. Checking of the structural response with consideration of Significant Damage Limit State is conducted. The control goal is to prevent significant damage of the structure so that the cost of repair, demolishing, or even re-construction of new dwellings could be reduced or even prevented. The terraced house is modelled as a single residential unit by a 2D finite element model. Only the façade wall is analysed as the terraced house is vulnerable in the out-of-plane direction and in a direction parallel to the façade wall because the façade piers are considerably narrow.<br/><br/>The active control application is realized by putting a steel truss at each façade wall that is connected by pneumatic cylinder actuators. The control strategy follows the closed-loop control scheme where the control force is calculated based on the feedback of the structural response. The control force is calculated by the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm. The structure needs to be represented into a state-space representation for the LQR algorithm to calculate the control force. The structural response is solved by the Newmark Beta numerical integration. The time delay effect is also taken into account to consider a more accurate representation of the actual system. Simplified soil-structure interaction cases are also studied to see the effect of the soil conditions towards the control performance. Eventually, the preliminary dimensioning of the steel truss and the pneumatic cylinders is conducted to see the practicability to provide a small scale and realizable control system.","Active control; Unreinforced masonry structures; Terraced house; Groningen; Human-induced seismicity; Earthquake; Linear Quadratic Regulator; Seismic response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However such approaches do not score well in terms of SWaP criteria. <br/>Very simple proportional feedback control laws using single optical flow vectors from very basic high frame-rate low-resolution cameras provide a promising path to achieve aforementioned tasks. <br/>This thesis shows that in theory these control laws are well suited for stabilising a FWMAV, and could be used for a high-drag adapted quadcopter MAV within bounds. Simulations confirm these findings and illustrate robustness to noise and additional emergent behaviour such as sideways wall avoidance and trajectory following, however simulations also show that disparity between walls can lead to unintended rotational behaviour during vertical translation. <br/>The system is tested in experiment on a quadcopter-like setup with onboard processing, using only ADNS 9800 computer mouse optical flow sensors for flight control. Results show that the system behaves similarly to simulation, however the sensory configuration used is highly dependent on texture in environment and light conditions. <br/>For future work it is recommended to investigate optical flow sensors in more detail to obtain reliable output on a vibrating platform (such as a FWMAV) in a broader range of texture and light conditions. Preliminary results from theory, simulation and experiment indicate that the addition of derivative feedback could strongly enhance performance on a quadcopter MAV and remove the requirement for high drag.","Optical flow; MAV; FWMAV; Micro Aerial Vehicle; Flight Control Systems; Bio-inspired; quadcopter; Atalanta; Embedded Systems; Optical flow sensors; Stability Analysis; PD control; P feedback; PD feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This thesis has generated several potential low-cost air bearing system concepts. The two most feasible concepts, which are the Multiple Smaller Bearings (MSB) and the hover concept, are investigated on their feasibility, where the latter concept has shown a higher potential. The hover concept is a combination of (a) hover(s) and (an) air bearing(s), which combines the hover's high-load capacity and low-cost characteristics, with the air bearing's high-stiffness characteristics, to create a high-load, high-stiffness and low-cost radial air bearing assembly. To investigate the concept's feasibility, an air bearing and hover model are established. The air bearing model is able to calculate the air bearing performances, where a proposal is made on the race tolerance relaxation factor. Concurrently, a hover model is investigated on its static load capacity, stiffness and flow consumption. From the feasibility study, it was expected that the hover concept consumed a significant amount of flow and required a control system. However, its (costs) potentials have been the tolerance reduction on the counter surface and using significantly smaller sized air bearings. Afterwards, an experimental setup is designed and manufactured, to measure the individual and combined static performances of the air bearing and hover and to verify the results with their models. It is verified that the air bearing model is able to predict the overall trend of the measured air bearing performance. Subsequently, two different hover types are investigated, where the experiments have provided insight into the hover's performance. It is shown that the hover model is able to estimate the load carrying capacity at lower hover heights and is able to estimate the order of magnitude of the hover stiffness, but is insufficient to provide the hover air consumption. For the combined performance, it is observed that the hover is able to carry a partial load of the air bearings and that the combined performance of the air bearing and hover, can be well predicted with the individual air bearing model and the individual hover performance obtained from measurements. Finally, a conceptual design of a new low-cost radial air bearing system, which combines two air bearings and five hovers, is proposed and has its potential to reduce the current radial air bearing system costs by 17 %. The current hover concept is not only potentially applicable for the current CT-scanner but in general for high-load applications, where low friction and a high-stiffness is required, with the focus on a low-cost oriented design.","externally pressurized aerostatic bearings; high-load applications; high stiffness; low friction; air casters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Vrijdag, A. (mentor); Duinkerken, M.B. (graduation committee); Boonen, E.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The need for advanced ship propulsion control systems is constantly increasing as the demand for high vessel performance is growing at the same time. Speed trials are considered as an operation during which the vessel has to achieve the highest performance by attaining the agreed maximum ship speed. However, sometimes vessels have to sail in waves during speed trials. In such case, resistance and wake field disturbances act on the vessel’s propulsion plant causing fluctuations of the engine’s operating point in the engine operating envelope. When these fluctuations are large enough to reach the engine’s operating envelope limits, the propeller pitch control is activated to effectively protect the engine by reducing the propeller pitch. This decrease results in reduced average delivered power, reduced average generated thrust and finally in a drop of maximum average ship speed. This work focuses on investigating the possibilities to refine the existing control system by means of gain scheduling the Diesel engine speed governor. The ultimate goal is the re-sizing and re-orientating of the engine’s operating point fluctuations in the engine’s operating envelope, keeping the propeller pitch control deactivated and thus, the maximum average speed retained. First of all a linearised model of the ship propulsion system is derived which is used for the analysis of the Diesel engine’s operating point dynamic response in terms of engine torque and engine speed fluctuations in case of regular waves. More specifically, this thesis investigates the impact of the direction of the ship with respect to the waves, the Sea State and the system operating point on the dynamic response of the engine’s operating point in the engine’s operating envelope. Based on the analysis of the dynamic response of the engine’s operating point with respect to the three above mentioned factors and by making use of the linearised model, the refinement of the Diesel engine’s dynamic behavior is achieved. In the first place, a static solution is given with the derivation of suitable plots. The derived plots provide the opportunity for manual governor gains scheduling, depending on the wave induced disturbance. In the second place, a gains scheduling algorithm is obtained by combining the linearised ship propulsion model with an optimization algorithm. The developed algorithm, after being integrated in the non-linear simulation model of the ship propulsion system, is capable of dynamically scheduling the governor gains in case of regular and irregular waves. Both obtained solutions achieve the ultimate objective of this work. The fluctuations of the Diesel engine’s operating in the engine operating envelope are effectively re-sized and re-orientated. As a result the activation of the propeller pitch control is prevented and the average ship speed is retained.","Ship propulsion system; Propulsion system dynamics; Ship sailing in waves propulsion control; Linear ship propulsion model; Optimal control; Optimal governor gains scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

The results showed that urban planners are worried about introducing AVs, but despite these worries, the introduction of AVs is not included in most strategies and policies. The actions that are preferred by most of them to manage potential negative AV impacts are stimulating car-sharing, public transport and bicycle use and discouraging private vehicle use by parking policies.

These devices often need to operate for years while keeping mobile objects, such as animals or vehicles, connected to a larger system. Therefore they will be battery-powered, energy efficient and, their position will be tracked. Therefore, connecting these devices requires low-power, long-range communication that can also be used for localisation. Because of the scale of the IoT industry, manufacturing and infrastructure costs need to be considered. The low cost, long range and energy efficiency that is required exempts many wireless communication and localisation solutions such as WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth because they are not as suitable as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN's).

We evaluate the localisation algorithms on a proprietary LoRa network which also provides a localisation service that we use as a benchmark. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms over a large, mostly urban, region of The Netherlands. Using mobile LoRa devices, we show that for 80\% of cases, our proposed algorithm has a position error less than 925m.

This feature is desirable in a variety of<br/>scenarios, such as in enterprise hybrid-cloud deployments, where some data may be stored remote on the cloud while other in the local file system. This feature introduces questions as how to design, implement, and handle various file system semantics, such as different consistency levels and operational performance between the remote and local storage. For instance, a POXIS-complient block based file system is strongly consistent and does not pose the same semantics as a more relaxed eventual consistent object-based cloud storage. Further, it is interesting to benchmark how such an integrated remote storage solution performs and what potential speedups that might be possible.<br/><br/>To examine such questions and provide the remote storage feature in HopsFS,<br/>a scale-out metadata HDFS distribution, this thesis presents an Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation that enables the local file system to be transparently integrated with an external remote storage. The PoC is storage provider agnostic and enables a HopsFS client to on-demand pull in and access remote data from an external storage into the local file system.<br/><br/>Currently, the solution works by mounting a snapshot of a remote storage into<br/>HopsFS, a read-only approach. For write and synchronization work, frameworks<br/>that layers stronger consistency models on top of S3 may be used, such as s3mper.<br/>Performance of the implemented feature has been benchmarked against remote<br/>Amazon S3 buckets, showing results of fast throughput for scanning and persisting metadata, but slower (4 Mb/s) for pulling data into the cluster through the Amazon cloud connector S3A. To improve performance, caching by replication of the remote files onto local disk storage has shown to drastically increase the read speed (up to 100x). The work done in this thesis shows a promising PoC that successfully serves remote blocks into a local file system, with future work including supporting writes, improved caching mechanisms, and reflecting off-band changes between the remote and local storage.","Mounting; External; Storage; HopsFS; Distributed File System; Cloud; Amazon S3; NDB; HDFS; File System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","Cloud Computing and Services",""

Though this is easier said than done. The energy transition involves a variety of initiatives which are at the same time highly dependent on each other. Whilst the increasing scarcity of available area and resources result into the situation that a decision will have to be made. As long as this decision is not made, it leads to high uncertainty on which activities are going to take place in the PoR and at which point in time they are expected. <br/><br/>To support the decision making on which activities to should focus on, there is an urgent need for a decision tool at the PoR authority. <br/><br/>The main conclusion, however, is that it is impossible to develop a decision tool which is able to make a choice among different activities. This decision is impossible because every activity has its own demands and requirements and differs in the contribution it has to the strategic goals. Besides this, the set requirements cannot be expressed in a single unit, leading to the situation that a comparison cannot be judged. <br/><br/>Following from the above, it is being discouraged to develop a decision tool. The allocation process and the involved requirements are too versatile to be simplified in a single tool. If such a simplification is made, this will result in missing essential opportunities and potential bottlenecks in the sequential project phases. <br/><br/>Based on the above conclusions, it is investigated whether it is possible to provide the PoR authority with guidelines that support the comparison of different activities. To do so, the involved requirements in the allocation process are substantiated. These requirements are evaluated from three different points of view: demand side (client), resources side (Port of Rotterdam authority) and their priority in the decision making. By means of the evaluation, the aspects have been identified that must be implemented into the guidelines. <br/><br/>In addition to the requirements, it is important for the PoR authority to incorporate its communicated strategy into the daily activities. To do so, the commercial strategy has been developed. At first sight, the integration of the commercial strategy is not acknowledged to be a requirement in the allocation process. Though, as the research proceeded, it turned out that the commercial strategy has a more important role in the decision making than anticipated. Resulting in the situation that if the PoR authority is really looking to fulfil its climate targets, the commercial strategy should function as a self-contained requirement in the allocation process. <br/><br/>From the conclusions, the recommendation for the PoR authority is to develop a central team that involves the experts of the relevant requirements to judge the potential activities. This team will have the primary task to evaluate and judge the potential activities prior to entering the project phases. The judgement of the potential activities will be founded on four main themes for evaluation: demand, supply, priority and contribution to the commercial strategy. <br/><br/>Though, this recommendation is not aimed at making the decision itself. The main focus is to supply the evaluations on the potential activities to the decision makers. The decision itself will be based on the supplied evaluations through which a decision can be made on which activities should be allocated in the PoR. <br","allocation; requirements; Port of Rotterdam; Port of Rotterdam Authority; Energy Transition; Strategic contribution; Sustainable industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.905,4.485"

Generally, estimators’ experience plays a critical role here, and the availability of historical cost data is also crucial. The process is significantly dependent on an export-driven approach. However, decisions made by experts can be subjective and error-prone especially when the relationships between cost drivers and the target cost are not fully understood or even identified. Consequently, cost estimation to a fair level of accuracy is hardly possible to achieve manually within a restricted time.

The size of the different types of errors that occur depend on the goodness of fit to the zero levelset curve, the skewness of the triangles and the size of the triangles of the mesh. To fit the mesh basic methods where designed by Javierre, Den Ouden and Verbeek. These methods adjust the mesh only locally and add many edges in the process. The aim of this research was to find better ways in which to adjust the mesh, without having to add new edges. First quality measures were set up: the maximum skewness, average skewness, standard deviation of skewnesses, maximum size, minimum size, standard deviation of sizes, where the sizes and skewnesses are taken over all the triangles in the mesh. Then the existing ‘cut’ method was analysed in depth and an extension called the ‘flip’ method was added. Afterwards a new approach was used, using shortest path algorithms to decide which points to move, and orthogonal projection to the level-set curve to move them. A second method was designed using a physical model, modelling every non-fitted non-boundary edge as a spring, in order to improve the rest of the mesh. These last two methods combined improved the quality of the created meshes greatly, with its only downside being its more limited applicability.","Level Set Method; Finite Element Method; numerical analysis; Partial Differential Equations; mesh fitting; Shortest path","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Electronic voting methods could resolve much of the controversies and difficulties regarding conventional elections.

The blockchain is perfect for voting application for two crucial aspects. First and foremost, due to its inherent public nature, everyone can verify the facts on the blockchain. Verifiability should be a critical requirement for any modern voting system. Secondly, the consensus mechanism allows anyone to participate in the validation and recording of the election process. Furthermore, being distributed, no single entity has full control over the infrastructure.<br/><br/>In the context of voting, verifiability is as valuable as privacy. If the body of literature indicates that verifiability is an inherent property of the blockchain, this is not true for privacy. We propose a scheme that satisfies the strong privacy requirement of receipt-freeness.

Literature on improvement methodologies from different industries suggest that a reduction of system complexity can lead to a more efficient assembly process. A less complex system in terms of assemblability can be achieved by modularization of these systems. Literature suggest that the performance of a modular strategy can be further elevated by with a strategy called “design for assembly”. The System Coupling Level Index is adapted for shipbuilding. A reduction in the complexity results in less human effort on-board. This enables the LSSI (Large Scale System Integrator) to positively change the value-time curve of the assembly process. The shift from on-board to a workshop enables the LSSI to outsource the production of the modules, this is indicated with the Production Multiplier (PMP) adapted from the 3C model. The outsourcing of these modules leads to a higher Gross Margin (GM) on the system for the LSSI. Moreover, the time effect is a reduced lead time of the engine room. A different machine install strategy can reduce the idle time of equipment in the engine room. This reduces the risk on damage of equipment and gives the suppliers more time to produce the modules.","Modular outfit; Modular assembly; design for assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-04","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","","52.2177642,4.5569149"

In this situation, synchronization can be achieved via adaptive protocols (with adaptive feedback gains, or adaptive coupling gains, or both). However, as state-of-the-art synchronization methods adopt a distributed observer architecture, they require to communicate extra local observer variables among neighbors, in addition to the neighbors' states (or outputs). The distinguishing feature of this work is to show that synchronization in heterogeneous and uncertain multi-agent systems is possible without the need for any distributed observer. This can be achieved by designing adaptive distributed synchronization protocols, based on homogenization reasoning. Specifically, ideal gains are defined (feedback and coupling gains) that could lead all the heterogeneous agents to a desired homogeneous behavior and thus synchronization. However, since these gains are unknown in view of the unknown dynamics, we design adaptive laws for these gains that lead the agents toward synchronization. In this thesis, different control protocols are designed to address both leaderless and leader-follower synchronization of linear multi-agent systems. The protocols are then extended to achieve synchronization over a special class of nonlinear multi-agent systems, whose units are modeled as Kuramoto-like systems. Throughout this work, convergence of the synchronization error to zero is shown via Lyapunov analysis, and numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.","Adaptive control; Distributed control; Multi-Agent systems; Uncertain systems; Synchronization; Kuramoto oscillators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Nebulizer technology uses the respiratory system to administer a wide variety of medication. Nebulizer technology creates microscale droplets that can be inhaled by the patient. Different types of nebulizer technology exists, and the vibrating-mesh nebulizer is one of them. A mesh with over a thousand nozzles, each with a diameter of 4.3 micrometer, vibrates against the liquid reservoir with a frequency of 128 kHz. This technology has already been proven to work, except for the use of one particular liquid, pure water.<br/>The relation between the concentration of salt in a solution and the performance of the vibrating-mesh nebulizer was researched by Beck-Broichsitter et al. (2014). They found that a significant drop in performance takes place when the salt concentration of the solution decreases from 1 mM sodium-chloride to 0.01 mM sodium-chloride. <br/>This research first investigated the theory on the properties of these solutions, and how these properties change when the concentration decreases from 1 mM sodium-chloride to 0.01 mM sodium-chloride. It was found that the hydrodynamic properties of the fluid do not change significantly over this range, but the electrostatic and -kinetic properties do change significantly over this range. This led to the hypothesis that the electrostatic and -kinetic effects have an influence on the formation of droplets and therefore the performance of the nebulizer. Three different hypotheses were contrived on how these effects influence the formation of droplets. The first hypothesis was that charged induced wetting causes the liquid from the nozzle to spread out over the surface at the end of the nozzle, instead of forming a droplet. The second hypothesis was that due to electrostatic forces in the neck of the droplet formation process, the neck is prevented to decrease in diameter, no pinch-off takes place and therefore no droplet is formed. The third hypothesis was that a droplet was formed, taking with it an electrostatic charge. The next droplet is then prevented from exiting the nozzle, by the electrostatic force the first droplet exerts on it. These hypotheses where based on engineering intuition, rather than experimental data.<br/>Two different types of experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. First the mass flow rate of the nebulizer was measured using different electrolyte solutions. Second, images where recorded, with various imaging speeds and magnifications, of the nebulizer while it was in working. <br/>The results of the first type of experiments indicated that there is indeed a relation between the electrostatic and -kinetic properties of the fluid and the performance of the nebulizer. The results from the second type of experiments showed that the first hypothesis, the charged induced wetting hypothesis, was false. The results did not prove the other hypotheses to be false or true, but rather led to a new hypothesis. The new hypothesis was that the increased viscosity or decreased diameter of the nozzle, due to the electric double layer, bring down the mass flow through the nozzles or causes a portion of the nozzles to be inactive. As a prove of concept, an experiment was conducted where the viscosity of the liquid was decreased by increasing the temperature. This experiment gave the indication that the new hypothesis can be true.<br","electrokinetics; nebulization; vibrating-mesh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first category are extensive investigations with the goal to learn from failure by investigating all aspects: technical, human and organisational. The second category are investigations that focus mainly on technical causes and the investigation goal is often determining the failure cause including designing repair measures. For this category, little information is available on used investigation processes.<br/><br/>In literature, several investigation methodologies have been described. However, they often describe only a very general process or on the other hand very specific material related laboratory tests. Descriptions and recommended techniques on how to perform the proposed steps of an investigation are scarce. To a client ordering a damage investigation, the most important parts of the investigation are the conclusion and the recommendations. The client expects that the conclusion is correct. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the used investigation process results in a reliable (consistently good quality and able to be trusted) outcome. Basic knowledge of bias may help to indicate possible threats to the reliability of investigations. Techniques used to increase the validity and reliability of case study research can assist in developing strategies to achieve reliable forensic structural investigations. Therefore, the question of this research is: what is a reliable methodology to perform investigations into the technical cause of damages to concrete structures? <br/><br/>The research question has been answered by studying available literature on structural forensic investigation techniques, interviewing investigators, researching investigation techniques used for aerospace accident investigations and fire cause determination, studying human error theory and case study research and concrete damage mechanisms. <br/><br/>Based on the resulting information from studying all these disciplines the conclusion can be drawn that using a structured investigation process is essential. Therefore, this information has been used to develop an investigation methodology called the ‘investigation process model’. The model recommends the following phases: orientation, data collection, hypothesis generation, hypothesis analysis, conclusion, reporting and follow-up. These phases are split into individual steps that guide the investigator through the process. Each step contains suggestions for specific techniques varying from taking meaningful photographs on location to using a standard layout for reporting in order to execute the step properly. The investigator can select the most appropriate techniques for the project. Special attention has been paid to provide techniques to generate and analyse hypotheses in a reliable way. An example is the tool ‘Concrete Damage Handbook’ to assist the investigator in linking visual damages to possible causes. As a common thread through the model measures have been provided to limit the negative influence of bias (based on the Delft approach). <br/><br/>Validation of the model with 1) a test case based on a real damage file, 2) comparison with real investigation reports and 3) scientific papers proved that the model relates to the daily working practice and is usable, practical and functional within the scope of the defined criteria. <br","Forensic structural engineering; Investigation methodology; Concrete damage; Delft approach; Damage investigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially since Business as Usual (BaU) scenario studies project that the emissions due to shipping could increase by 50 [%] to 250 [%] in the period to 2050 (IMO, 2015), shipowners face a potential regulatory threat. Major climate regulations for shipping already entered into force, and a range of possible instruments may be applied going forward. Possible instruments are among others, tightened EEDI limits, port discounts, ETS, or a Carbon Tax. Besides the risk of direct regulation, there is also a risk of being indirectly impacted by energy and/or climate regulation in other sectors. The direct and indirect regulations can adversely impact the operations, cashflow, and economic value of enterprises of existing shipowners and charterers of ships. Shipowners and financiers that are unaware of these developments, or that do not take timely mitigating actions, may potentially face considerable financial losses.<br/><br/>This research investigated and ranked the level of Carbon Risk for shipowners across several sub sectors. The objective of the research was to: define, measure, and reveal the level of Carbon Risk for shipowners and to assess mitigating strategies as part of the assessment of the bank’s exposure to Carbon Risk. Typical core drivers, factors, and dependencies have been studied from literature in order to come up with an effective approach to capture the threat of Carbon Risk. As a result, a Carbon Risk framework is been developed, showing (inter)dependencies between all Carbon Risk factors. By developing the framework, this research contributed to the current understanding of the (inter)dependencies between Carbon Risk factors. In addition to the framework, typical Carbon Risks have been identified for the shipping industry.<br/><br/>This research focuses on Structural Risk. A Carbon Tax is used as a proxy for Regulatory Risk and demand substitution (i.e. a 20 [%] reduction of cargo) is used as proxy for Substitution Risk. By distinguishing vessels by type and size, we account for different technical, operational, and market characteristics. We focus on crude oil tankers, container ships, and bulk carriers because they are the three most significant sectors from a CO2 perspective (IMO, 2015). The presented findings about the difference in impact between sub segments could have implications for risk premiums which financiers can set on loans. Also, given that the DCF of fuel-efficient investments is positive related to a Carbon Tax, it is assumed that fuel efficient technologies and retrofits become more viable. Even before regulatory certainty, it is advised that shipowners and financiers (as part of their Carbon Risk mitigation strategy) research fuel efficient mitigation options (technological investments) under different Carbon Tax levels. Even without Carbon pricing, efficiency measures generate significant cost savings. When there is certainty about future market-based measures, early adaptors/investors of viable fuel-efficient measures (under future regulatory conditions) will benefit most of the investment and improve their competitive position. Also, when shipowners act sooner than competitors, they lower the risk of scarcity of resources (yards, engineers).","GHG emissions; CO2; Carbon Risk; Carbon Risk framework; Climate change regulation; Carbon Tax; Demand Substitution; Financial impact; Mitigating strategies; Fuel efficiency investments; Shipping; Maritime Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations | Shipping Management","SDPO.18.043.m",""

The main aim of this research was to investigate some relevant parameters to accurately model corrosion of reinforced concrete structures, such as which are the locations where corrosion pits are more likely to initiate as well as if the Elastic modulus of corrosion product depends on the concrete mix that the reinforcement was embedded in. Each scale of characterization had a specific goal: the macro-scale characterization aimed to analyze the state of the specimens after 20 years of outside (unsheltered) exposure through Non-destructive techniques (i.e. potential measurements, corrosion rate, resistivity of concrete), visual inspections and analysis of historical records. Also, since specimens were mis-labelled during the years, the cement type that each specimen was cast with was identified through polished sections of concrete portions analyzed under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The meso-scale characterization of the reinforcement aimed to quantify the volume loss of the steel as well as to investigate which were the locations where corrosion pits occurred the most. Out of each reinforced concrete specimen, a core of 20 mm diameter and 100 mm height has been drilled, embedding a steel bar of 8 mm diameter. Each core has been then analyzed through X-ray Computed Tomography (CT-scan) and image analysis was performed. Apart from revealing different volume loss for bars embedded in different mixes (i.e. CEM I was the most corroded, CEM III/B the least), this characterization suggested that the most influencing factor for corrosion pits to form is the presence of defects (i.e. air voids) at the steel/concrete interface. Finally, the micro-scale characterization of corrosion product aimed to investigate the relation between Elastic modulus of corrosion product (퐸cp), its micro-structure and its chemical composition, with regard to the different concrete mix that steel was embedded into. 퐸cp was measured through Nano-indentation, while chemical composition was measured through SEM/EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectrometry) elemental mapping and spot analysis. This phase of the research revealed that differences between Elastic modulus of corrosion product generated in different mixes are not significant, and that the relation between 퐸cp and Fe/O seems to be (linearly) proportional.

Then, graded bandgap energy a-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H solar cells are fabricated to investigate the optimum grading width. The bandgap energy is linearly graded from 2.1 eV to 1.96 eV. It was observed that, when fabricating graded bandgap energy a-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H solar cells, the grading width at both the ends of the absorber layer should be as small as possible. A 10-nm thick grading at the front end and 20-nm thick grading in the rear of the absorber layer showed the best result among all the graded bandgap cells developed during the optimization, with an efficiency of 8.2 % (<i>V<sub>OC</sub></i> : 0.96 V, <i>J<sub>SC</sub></i> : 13.36 mA/cm2, FF: 0.64).<br/><br/>The effects of grading the bandgap energy on the performance of a-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H solar cells were also investigated. For instance the bandgap variation within the graded region was investigated.

When increasing the thickness of the graded bandgap energy absorber layer for a-SiOx:H, <i>J<sub>SC</sub></i> as high as 14.4 mA/cm2 was achieved. Also, the increase in the thickness of these graded bandgap energy absorber layers did not result in a drastic drop in efficiency as seen for a-SiOx:H solar cells without bandgap energy grading.<br/><br/>Finally, optical simulations of graded bandgap energy a-SiO<sub>x</sub>:H solar cells were attempted.

Insulated rail joint (IRJ) is one important structural component in a railway track. IRJs serve the railway system with two crucial functions: dividing track into sections for signal control and enable the detection of broken rails. An IRJ generally consists of two fishplates, insulation layers between the rails and the fishplates, and an end-post layer between two rails. The fishplates are assembled using pre-tensioned bolts. Although the IRJ plays an important role in the railway system, it introduces discontinuities in stiffness and geometry to wheel-rail rolling contact and is thus considered one of the weakest parts of the railway track. Maintenance of IRJs has been an issue of great concern for the rail operators worldwide. Over the past few years many studies have been conducted on monitoring, modelling and analysis of IRJs. Both numerical and experimental studies have been performed in order to gain better understanding of the behaviour of IRJs under static and dynamic loads. Considering that dynamic wheel-rail impacts occur at IRJs, the dynamic behaviour of IRJs should be carefully examined.<br/>This M.Sc. thesis studies the dynamic behaviour of the IRJ experimentally and numerically. Two three-dimensional finite element (FE) track models with different types of IRJ, i.e. a new NRG-joint and normal joint, are developed. Rails, fishplates, insulation layer and sleepers are represented in the models as detailed as possible, while the rail-pads and the ballast are simplified as spring and damper elements. The NRG-joint consists of two fishplates and six pretensioned bolts, while the normal joint consists of two shorter fishplates and four bolts. Implicit FE analyses are first performed to calculate the initial stresses and displacements of the track models, which are then used as initial conditions for the explicit dynamic FE analysis. Field hammer tests are performed on the track line between Zwolle and Meppel. The tests are used on one hand to calibrate the stiffness and damping parameters involved in the rail-pad and ballast models, and on the other hand to validate the dynamic behaviour reproduced by the FE IRJ models. The comparison between the simulation and the measurements shows reasonable agreement of the results. Based on the validated FE models, optimisation strategies of the dynamic behaviour of the IRJ are proposed by a parametric study. The varied parameters include stiffness and damping of the rail-pads and the ballast as well as sleeper span. Implementation of non-uniform sleeper span seems effective for reducing pinned-pinned resonance. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations for further research are made.","insulated rail joint; explicit finite element modelling; pinned-pinned resonance; hammer test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","","","","","",""

The PLL was designed to have a loop bandwidth above 200 kHz and phase margin above 70 degrees, to reduce the frequency overshoot and have a relative fast lock. The system was tested and generated sweeps successfully for slow ramps, but failed on operating in the proper sweep bandwidth for ramps faster than 10 ms. The limitation on sweep time, lower transmit power and lossy circuitry were factors which made the radar system not suitable for human motion detection.","Dielectric resonator antenna; optically transparent; radar; FMCW radars; Light Bulb; Human presence detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-03","","","","Electrical Engineering | Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

While the results of a stochastic approach are favorable, they tend to lack the detail that is necessary to fully understand the different aspects of the reservoir, more precisely, the inclusion of heterogeneities. A possible solution to this problem is the use of process-based models. Process-based models utilize the physical processes involved in the transportation, deposition, and erosion of sediments. As a result, the models generated are more complex in nature and better represent what is found within the subsurface. The use of process-based models within reservoir modelling is a a relatively new process that has yet to be fully utilized due to the difficulty in calibrating the models with well data. Before process-based models can be tested on their viability to include the multi-scalar heterogeneities, the model must be calibrated to match the real-world data. To test this, a combination of field work, lab work, and computer simulations is required. In this experiment, the Roda Sandstone Member, a Gilbert-type delta deposit in Northern Spain, was chosen as the unit of focus. The Roda Sandstone consists of multiple prograding sand lobes, with Roda Y being chosen as the focus of this experiment. The Roda Y sandstone exhibits a predominately medium and coarse grain distribution in the central locations of the sand lobe, and a fine and very fine distribution in the distal locations. Five simulations were run within the process-based modelling software ""Delft3D"", each with varying sediment input parameters, to observe the effects on the results. The results for the simulations show a strong calibration for each of the five simulations for coarse and medium grained sand, with a percent difference between the model results and the field data of 4-8%. The fine and very fine data contain a higher average difference between the two data sets, ranging from 18-23%. The difference for mud averages around 11%, with predominately more mud being deposited within the simulations. The large differences for the fine and very fine grained can be attributed to the difference in the size and shape of the sand lobe produced by the simulations. In locations were the two data points are equivalent in regards to depositional location within the sand lobe, a high correlation is observed. The results indicate that process-based models have the potential to be a very useful took within reservoir modelling. As this is the first step in a series of steps, additional testing is required for the additional aspects involved in utilizing process-based models to better incorporate heterogeneities within reservoir models.","Delft3D; Process-based modelling; Roda Formation; Heterogeneity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

One of the outpatient clinics of location VUmc is the radiotherapy department. Radiotherapy utilises X-ray radiation to damage cancer cells. During their treatment period, cancer patients visit the department once a day to receive a radiotherapy treatment. Before the radiotherapy treatment can start an extended preparation process is executed. Improving the patient order flow in the radiotherapy preparation process is the subject of this research. <br/><br/>The preparation process is a complex process: Many different process steps are necessary to prepare the radiotherapy of a patient. Due to the presence of a waiting queue before each of the process steps, the flow is restricted and errors occur in the corresponding information flow. Often, the reason is the limited insight in the other process step. No overarching control is available to control the flow between the different sections. Interventions occur, but does not rely on organized control structure. The available control is only taking into account the own process step. <br/><br/>The fact that the radiotherapy department is too much functionally organised is the main reason for the existence of these problems. The functional design is a requirement for the radiotherapy system. However, within the outline of the functional design, improvements are possible. These improvements have to create an improved flow of patients with a transparent and coordinated execution.<br/><br/>The main solution for the problem is the design of control structure based on the matrix organisation theory. The functional control structure remains and a patient order control structure is designed. The functional control structure is elaborated by the measure of the length of the waiting queue of the previous process step. The patient order control structure controls the flow of the patient orders throughout the preparation process. This control is executed on the basis of the date of the start of the radiotherapy treatment. The start of the radiotherapy treatment is the end of the preparation process. This date is determined earlier in the process and the different process step due times will be adapted according to that date. \newline <br/><br/>The solution is able to improve the transparency in the department. The patient order progress is monitored during the preparation process and the different process steps will have more insight in the upcoming flow. Especially the patient order control structure is able to coordinate the flow based on the determining of the date of the start of the treatment in an earlier phase.<br/><br/>For the examination of the effect of the proposed patient order control structure, a simulation model is built. The simulation model shows the positive effect on the flow of the patient orders through the department: The variation in the waiting queue length is reduced, the variation in the process time is reduced and the variation in the number of patients who will start their treatment on a certain day is reduced.","Logistics; Radiotherapy; Preparation process; Outpatient clinic; Functional organisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-02","","","","Mechanical Engineering","","52.3345742, 4.8576271"

(mentor); Petermeijer, S.M.

Take-over requests containing directional information of hazardous surrounding cars could aid the driver in taking over the vehicle faster. However, whether the directional information should be presented ipsilaterally or contralaterally is still inconclusive. In this study, 34 participants were presented with animated video clips of traffic situations on a three-lane road, ending with a near-collision in front after 1,3, or 6 seconds. In each video, one lane was free to maneuver to safely. Participants were instructed to make a safe lane-change by pressing the left or right arrow key. At the start of each video, participants were provided with verbal auditory feedback: (1) ‘Go left/right’ (ipsilateral), (2) ‘Danger left/right’ (contralateral), and (3) Non-directional beeps as a baseline. 80% of the trials provided valid auditory feedback (i.e., relevant to the video situation). 20% of the trials provided invalid auditory feedback (i.e., feedback opposite to the video situation, so left instead of right and vice versa). Auditory feedback ‘Go/Danger left’ was always presented from the left speaker, and ‘Go/Danger right’ was always presented from the right speaker, whereas the non-directional beeps were presented from both speakers. Participants’ keyboard responses and first gazes were recorded in each trial. It was hypothesized that when there was 1-second to respond, ipsilateral feedback (‘Go’) would lead to fastest responses because little time is available to detect the hazard. For 3 and 6-second-to-respond situations, it was hypothesized that contralateral feedback (‘Danger’) would lead to a faster detection time of the hazard, because it facilitates visual detection. The results showed that for 1 and 3-second videos, ipsilateral feedback led to significantly faster responses compared to the baseline, and for 3 and 6-second videos contralateral feedback ‘Danger’ led to significantly faster responses compared to the baseline. ‘Go’ and ‘Danger’ did not yield a significant difference in response time between each other in all videos. First fixations seem to be placed on the most salient visual stimuli, independent of the audio feedback. In 1-second time-to-respond videos this was the center of the road (the location where the potential collision is happening. In 3-seconds, this was the hazard coming from the left or right lane. And for 6 seconds the first fixations were more distributed. In conclusion, verbal auditory feedback ‘Go’ and ‘Danger’ can aid in taking over a vehicle, by reducing the take-over response time compared to baseline warnings. However, this may not be the result of facilitation of the visual detection of the hazard, because visual behavior seems to be influenced mainly by visual stimuli, independent of auditory stimuli.","take-over requests; auditory; directional; ipsilateral; contralateral; HAD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

This paper is aimed at developing an adequate GHG emissions accounting methodology for cross-border multi-modal logistics at Heineken and at generalising the findings to a broader context. It investigates current developments and challenges by means of a literature study and an in-depth case study at Heineken, accompanied with interviews with similar industry players. The numerous challenges that are identified within this research relate to the assessment boundaries, the calculation and allocation approach, the internal activity data, and the external default data. In an effort to deal with the challenges, the GLEC framework has been developed to create a universal framework for calculating logistics emissions by integrating existing methods and tools. The GLEC framework is applied as cornerstone for the design of an updated methodology. Moreover, its ability to positively contribute to the accounting principles: materiality, completeness, accuracy, comparability and verifiability, is assessed. The findings indicate that the alignment with the framework solves some of the challenges, but others remain unresolved. The reported total carbon footprint of Heineken’s outbound transport is increased with 7.5% if the operational improvements with regards to the GLEC alignment are implemented. Additional operational and strategic improvements are suggested, which require effort from Heineken and other stakeholders within the supply chain: political parties, research institutes, LSPs, carries, and shippers. The majority of the suggested improvements can be generalised to industry peers with a multi-modal and crossborder supply chain. Moreover, the findings contribute to the scientific field of research by indicating that the GLEC framework has potential to increase the ability to adequately account for GHG emissions of logistics operations. However, enhancements to increase its potential are proposed.","accounting; calculations; GHG emissions; ogistics; transportation; supply chain; standardisation; methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2015), who found that for prosthetic hands a complex wrist mechanism worked functionally equal to a multi-DOF hand mechanism, new work has been set in motion to extrapolate and test this hypothesis. The goal of this work consisted of building a multi-DOF wrist mechanism, while it was crucial to keep the mechanism small, light, and efficient. A study preliminary to this work has found a single, synergetic relational ""path"" between all degree of freedom of the human wrist, thereby proving a three dimensional, functional output of orientation by a theoretical mechanism, driven by a single input. This work seeks to design such mechanism, capable of following the proven synergy while remaining small, able, and effective.<br/><br/> Starting from scratch, several theoretical mechanism are tested on their ability to create general, non-linear translations. Some of these theories are worked-out into concepts after which a selection is made of the most promising. Further developing these concepts into adequate designs, a set of prototypes, digital and physical, have been used to prove their competence in re-producing the path as found by the preliminary study. Finally, after a fusion of two designs, a final design is developed to a state-of-production. Though the production of a prototype was scheduled, it was not accomplished within the period of this work.<br/> <br/> This reports finishes with a final design proven theoretically to be successful in re-creating the theoretical synergetic path through a set of compound mechanics. The mechanism thereby proves the mechanical feasibility of the theoretical synergetic path. Though at a greater cost of size and weight, the mechanism is fully able to function as a prosthetic wrist mechanism as required by two individual partner projects. Due the lack of a physical prototype of this final design, testing and result-checks have been limited to a theoretical and digital environment.<br/> <br/> In the discussion, several options of improvements are given, as well as speculations on a parallel, alternative design course for future work. After outlining a set of important decisions made in this design, an alternative set of decisions is mentioned which are hypothesized to work without some of the sacrifices needed in this design, predominately the volume. Whether this alternative design proves successful, if at all feasible, remains to be attempted. Whether the wrist mechanism has benefited from the synergetic approach remains unanswered as well. Due the lack of physical testing several questions around functionality cannot yet be concluded. After the acknowledgement of this design's drawbacks, and the hypothesis of an improved alternative, no statements on the mechanical benefits of the synergetic approach have been made either. After the mechanism succeeds in proving that the theoretical synergetic relation is physically achievable, it is stated that such (alternative) mechanism without the mentioned drawbacks would, in a mechanical sense, be outstanding.","Wrist prosthesis; Synergy; multi-DOF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It contains flight trajectories and aircraft states which were previously only available for air traffic control and aircraft operators. This paper uses ADS-B and Mode S data to derive an accurate meteorological model and uses this model to determine aircraft performance parameters, which are usually not publicly available. A Meteo-Particle model is used and validated with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. For wind speed, wind direction and temperature the mean absolute error are 2.73 m/s, 7.73 degrees and 1.32 K respectively. The true airspeed is the actual airspeed that the aircraft experiences. It is required to determine aircraft performances. The true airspeed can be obtained with the wind derived in the Meteo-Particle model and ADS-B ground speed. Using the true airspeed information, aircraft performance parameters for climb, cruise and descend phase are determined for 16 aircraft types. These derived aircraft performance parameters, based on a large quantity of ADS-B and Mode S data, are a good alternative to the close-sourced performance parameters.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-08","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

Since fibre ropes are less stiff than steel ropes, heave compensation by the BHS using conventional control methods may impose problems. To check this, both a passive- (PHC) and active heave compensation (AHC) method have been analyzed in which the fibre rope performed as desired in normal operating conditions while the system stability was assured.","Fibre Rope; Cyclic Bending over Sheave; Internal Friction; Heave Compensation; Heavy Lift Vessel; Constant Tension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-01","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Most developed counties shrink and age, especially Japan, which has major impact towards transportation and land use. Applied is a backcasting approach, which includes these both trends and evaluates their impact along the transport dynamics within an adjusted ‘land use and transport feedback loop’. The outcome shows that with regulative policies towards motorization and population densities a sustainable development can be initiated. Required is a change in the design of streets, public transportation and urban structures in order to maintain social integration, environmental protection and stable independent economy.","Mobility; Elderly; Sustainable Transportation; Design; Compact City; Japan; Miyagi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
