The combination of a suction system and a water injection dredger is called central suction-WID system. This thesis analyses the sediment return volume, necessary pump power, greenhouse gases production and necessary costs for implementing a central suction-WID system. Three different reallocation sites with different distances for central suction-WID are assessed: Inside of Nieuwe Waterweg, Outside of Nieuwe Waterweg, and Verdiepte Loswal..<br/>Delft3D-Flow numerical model is used for modelling the hydrodynamic and the sediment return volume. The simulation is run for 14 days period in order to simulate spring and neap period. The numerical model result shows that discharging the sediment at the inside of Nieuwe Waterweg leads to the most sediment return, while discharging at the Verdiepte Loswal leads to the least sediment return volume. Increasing the sediment volume or reducing the particle size does not affect the sediment return rate.<br/>The necessary pump power and energy consumption for reallocating the sediment to each location are assessed. The calculation shows that the major contributor to the energy consumption is the friction between the fluid mud and the pipe wall. Reallocating the sediment to the inside of Nieuwe Waterweg consumes the least energy while transporting it to Verdiepte Loswal needs more energy as it is the furthest reallocation site alternative.<br/>Using a WID vessel produces fewer greenhouse gases than hopper dredger as it consumes much less fuel. Costs analysis shows that using a central suction-WID system is more expensive compared to hopper dredger. The costs of using a central suction-WID system increases as the distance between the sediment trap and the reallocation site is higher. However, combining it with another dredging method can be an alternative as it reduces the operational costs.","Water Injection Dredging; Dredging; Slurry transport; Ports and Waterways; DELFT3D; Numerical Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The impacts that the construction industry has on the environment has become an element of concern worldwide. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) claims that building activity has the potential to dramatically alter land’s surface (Sikra, 2017). This is mostly because many construction projects include destroying vegetation and digging, which extensively pollutes the area’s surroundings. Additionally, due to their high embodied energy contents, construction materials like concrete, aluminum, and steel are directly to blame for significant amounts of CO2 emissions. Uncomfortably, building activities account for one-sixth of world freshwater consumption, one-quarter of global wood consumption, and one-quarter of global waste. They also consume half of all natural resources that are taken from the environment. 40% of drinking water contamination, 50% of landfill waste, 23% of air pollution, and 50% of climate change are all caused by the building industry (Sikra, 2017). And these are just some of the aspects in which the construction industry is involved, but it is enough to realise that solutions are needed to heal planet Earth and in fact contribute positively to it.<br/><br/>One approach to this problem is to leave room for nature to manifest and express itself and then to be inspired by it. Natural creatures are an example of living and thriving on Earth by striking a balance between themselves and the surroundings. They are constantly integrating and optimizing themselves in order to produce life-friendly settings (Oguntona and Aigbavboa, 2017). The lessons that can be learned from nature are summarised in Bio-mimicry Life’s Principles. One of them suggests how natural organisms evolved with the logic of optimising rather than maximising by developing a multi-function design (De Pauw et al., 2010a).<br/><br/>This report deals with two key principles: sustainability and multi-functionality. The aim is to develop a methodology that allows, in an objective manner, the identification of the best tailored building strategy in terms of maximisation of the level of sustainability achievable with one single solution.<br/><br/>The project follows 6 steps: research, development, investigation and improvement, validation and testing. The methodology is designed within Microsoft Excel and integrates the sustainability criteria of LEED green building rating system, a program for assessing the green level of buildings that is already widely used internationally. The LEED program appears in all project phases but particularly in the research, development and validation phase. The latter is conducted by the method of comparing data obtained from the tool in Excel with verified data from LEED-certified projects. After the development phase, it emerges that the tool while based on a well-structured, widely used and tested program such as LEED, is prone to subjectivity. Much of the time is therefore devoted to making sure that the tool is project-dependent and not user-dependent. As for the investigation and improvement phases, these are carried out by means of a survey built in Google Forms. Finally, the process of testing the tool is performed by applying it to a real case which is offered by the engineering and architecture company OneWorks. It is the General Aviation terminal at Orio al Serio airport (Bergamo, Italy).<br/><br/>To conclude, time is a crucial aspect when it comes to reducing the impact on the environment. So, this thesis aspires to provide a new methodology that can help designers, engineers and architects to shorten the time it takes to choose the best tailored strategy in terms of sustainability and multi-functionality.","Sustainability; Multi-functionality; LEED program; Environmental impacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

But now, this is challenging since material streams are not synchronized in terms of space and time. Building material hubs, a location where materials are gathered, examined, and momentarily stored before being packed and sent to the building site which, are a way to better organize the flow of goods between parties, might be the answer as they have a positive effect on fewer transit movements, reduced traffic, and better air quality in the city or region.<br/><br/>By identifying building material hubs in relation to the realization of a circular build environment and by defining the factors that shape the emergence of the hubs, this study fills a gap in the literature. The primary research question is therefore: ""What different building material hubs in relation to a circular built environment exist, and what factors explain their emergence?"".<br/><br/>This study identified six primary factors that explain the establishment of construction material hubs, based on 26 sub-factors. These primary factors include (1) land-based, (2) economic, (3) logistical, (4) technology and knowledge, (5) social, and (6) governance factors. Every circular construction material hub begins with a circular business case that demonstrates how the materials may be used more effectively and with more efficiency. The hub's strategic location connects the supply and demand of building materials, ideally used ones. The building material hubs are shaped by a variety of knowledge and experience as well as logistical accessibility to the main road network. The initiator from the hub contributed equally by raising awareness and offering white label facilities. In relation to the circular built environment, there are four distinct typologies of circular building material hubs: (1) the circular craft centre, (2) the circular multimodal building material hub, (3) the circular building material hub and (4) the circular raw building material hub. This study emphasizes the development of typologies and their connections to relevant territorial factors that explain their emergence, something that, as far as is known, no other study has done. This study is consistent with the body of research from research organizations on the topic of (circular) building material hubs and its potential. The report's findings provide an intriguing parable for cities and regions that have set the challenging objective of attaining a circular built environment. A reasonable next step when enhancing the circular activities in a region may be to implement a CBMH.","Circular economy (CE); Circularity; Built environment; Circular building material hub","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is considered a powerful tool for the study of these processes. In the context of microscale phenomena these processes refer to the transfer of heat and mass in the indoor and outdoor urban environment, and can be observed up to ≈1km above the surface of the Earth. Their development takes place inside the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL), which for the case of urban areas is referred to as the Urban Boundary Layer (UBL), and is formed due to the interactions between the surface obstacles and the wind flows. In CFD simulations the surface of the Earth and the encountered obstacles are represented with the use of 3D models, as well as estimated values that are used to implicitly represent their roughness. In this thesis the aim is to investigate relevant to CFD parameters that could be used as 3D model semantics. For this purpose, a list of parameters was identified. From this list roughness length was selected and a methodology was developed for the assignment of roughness values for the open-source software OpenFOAM. The developed methodology that was built using built-in functions of OpenFOAM, is based on an octree data structure that is used to store the input triangulated model in obj format. The roughness length landuse names are stored in an mtl file that complements the input obj and the roughness length values are specified as a user defined parameter using the landuse names. The process is semi-automated and it entails the assignment of non-uniform roughness at the bottom of the computational domain. Additionally, a methodology to assign non-uniform roughness at the inlet of the domain was developed. The results showed that the assignment of non-uniform roughness at the bottom of the domain was successful for cases of flat terrain, however, under the restriction that the input geometry model abided by certain geometry guidelines, such as no self-intersections, no gaps. For the case of non-uniform roughness at the inlet the process also produced satisfactory results in terms of the assignment process, however the impact of multiple roughness values at the inlet on the calculated flow parameters requires further investigation.","CFD; GIS; 3D city model; semantics; roughness length","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Goyal, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Fossil fuels play an important role as an energy source in the world. The high use of fossil fuels does not come without environmental and climate challenges. The development of renewable energy technology is seen as one of the solutions to tackling these challenges because of its non-carbon-emitting characteristic. Renewable energy technologies required governmental support to grow because of their high costs compared to their fossil fuel counterpart. Countries adopted different renewable policy strategies, resulting in different photovoltaic development trajectories. When observing these photovoltaic development trajectories in countries, a recurring pattern occurs in which development starts and stops. One of several examples of this pattern was when photovoltaic development in Germany began to increase in 2003 with an annual capacity added of 175 MW, then peaking at 8161 MW in 2012 and decreasing to 2633 and 1190 MW, respectively, over the following two years. Another instance was in Spain in 2006. Photovoltaic development started to take off with an annual capacity added of 78 MW, peaking at 2890 MW in 2008 and decreasing to 39 MW the year after. This pattern results in development stagnation and harms the country's markets, jobs, and investor confidence. If the renewable policy strategies adopted by countries result in stop-and-go patterns of development, causing the aforementioned negative impacts, why do countries adopt them? The process of policy-making across countries is believed to be subject to different factors such as the country’s natural resources, culture or beliefs, history, pressure groups, or external events. What could be considered an important reason for one government to adopt or cease a renewable policy may not be important for another country, given the different factors and external events. What are the reasons these different countries adopt these stop-and-go policies? To understand the underlying cause of the stop-and-go policies in different countries, we take a closer look at the photovoltaic development trajectory in several countries. First, we identify the reasons countries started and stopped developing solar PV in the literature. After identifying these reasons, we analyze each country to determine which of these reasons were important for the countries to start or stop developing solar PV. Last but not least, we compare which of these reasons were important for starting or stopping the support of solar PV across countries. Data was collected through literature review and desk research. This thesis analyzed seven countries, nine go events, and four stop events. The countries analyzed in this thesis were France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the USA. The volume of data analyzed consisted of approximately 277 documents. The analyzed documents were governmental policy documents, peer-reviewed scientific papers, and reports from global organizations such as the IEA, IRENA, REN21, and GWEC. The findings indicated that improving the security of supply and stimulation of the economy were extremely important reasons countries developed solar PV. Countries with abundant domestic fossil fuel resources developed solar PV to stimulate their economies, while countries with scarce domestic fossil fuel resources developed to improve their security of supply. Improving the security of supply as a reason alone was enough in some instances for countries to start developing solar PV. Countries stopped developing solar PV due to an economic crisis or the prioritization of other economic sectors or energy technologies. However, the same economic crisis that caused certain countries to stop developing solar PV was the reason for some countries to stimulate their economy. When countries decided to stop support of PV, some countries took a more aggressive approach to reduce support than others, causing PV capacity added to decrease at a different pace. Nuclear disasters were initially thought to be a reason why countries started developing solar PV though the evidence was limited. However, upon further investigation, it became evident that PV development started before the accident to improve the security of supply and create an industry but was accelerated after the accident. Stop-and-go policies can occur in different countries because the countries can be triggered by the same external events that influence energy policy, for example, the 1970s oil crisis, the 2008 economic crisis, and the reduction of PV costs. Stop-and-go policies also occur due to the election/appointment of new governments that reduce or increase support for solar PV. As a recommendation for policymakers, policymakers should monitor PV capacity added and PV cost trends in the short term to amend PV support policies. PV development increased between 2008-2010 due to falling PV costs and lagging policy amendments leading to explosive growth. This explosive growth happened during an economic crisis. In the context of an economic crisis, the levies on electricity bills for PV support received increasing negative attention. On the other hand, taking a too-aggressive approach to decrease solar PV support may negatively impact investor confidence and the future development of PV in a country. Thus, countries must monitor developments closely and adjust support accordingly. Recommendations for further research on this topic are provided in the conclusion.","Policy; Solar PV adoption; stop-and-go cycles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

As this type of spreader cannot be used for performing certain lifts, such as the handling of hatch covers, switches between single spreader and tandem spreader are inevitable. However, there is no method in current literature nor in practice to determine when the spreader changes should be performed. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a model that calculates the optimal moments to switch spreaders. As the performance of tandem lifting depends on the cycle times, a cycle time prediction model is developed first. This Artificial Neural Network model predicts the cycle time based on the type of lift, the actual position of the container(s) on the ship, the weight of the load and the current wind speed. The predictions yield a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of less than 11%. Afterwards, the cycle time prediction model is used to develop an optimal spreader switching strategy model in the form of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. A case study, in which several different bay layouts of a container ship need to be handled, shows a decrease in handling time of up to 22% compared to the traditional spreader switching strategy.","Quay crane; Tandem; Container terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The economic and social importance of such projects is widely acknowledged, but there are growing concerns about the possible environmental impact of the dredge plumes that form as a temporary by-product of these activities. Suspended sediment blocks sunlight, and sediment that settles on the seabed buries coral and other organisms. These effects accumulate over the duration of a dredging project, and should be minimized.<br/><br/>An important step towards this goal is predicting plume formation and development. Here, we focus on an overflow plume from a trailer suction hopper dredger (TSHD). Although this subject has been studied for years, much is still unknown, due to the complex interaction of the processes involved. Because of this complexity, it is not uncommon in the industry to use rules of thumb, derived from empirical studies.<br/><br/>One such rule of thumb, based on an influential publication by Becker et al. (2015), relates to the fraction of the overflow plume that is still (or again) in suspension once the developing plume moves from the dynamic near-field to the passive far-field. This source term fraction (STF) is important, because the large-scale area models that model plume development in the far-field require information about the characteristics of the plume entering the far-field zone. Becker et al. (2015) presented a realistic range of 0-20% for the source term fraction. This range is based on a combination of measurements and expert opinions. Although Becker et al. (2015) recommend characterization monitoring at the start of a dredging project to determine whether the 0-20% range needs adjusting, this is not always done in practice, due to time pressure, costs, complexity or lack of necessity. <br/><br/>Building on the work by Becker et al., this thesis aims to support a more informed implementation of TSHD source terms on the computational grid of far-field models. In order to explore the behavior of SHD dredge plumes, numerical simulations were carried out using computational fluid dynamics model TUDflow3D. In these simulations, the values of three model input parameters – the water depth, the overflow density and the crossflow velocity – were varied to gain insight into the behavior of the plume under the conditions studied. For each of the three parameters, three representative values were chosen on the basis of expert advice, and all combinations were tested, leading to 27 numerical simulations.<br/><br/>The results of the numerical simulations show that the amount of sediment in the plume has reduced to less than 20% of the sediment in the overflow plume at 11-42 minutes of plume development, corresponding to a distance of 0-1895 m from the dredging location (500-3800 m from the moving vessel), depending on the specific conditions. It is important to note that (only) three conditions were varied<br/>in this study. These conditions were all steady state (e.g. no tidal flows). In real-life situations, many more (combinations of) conditions and hence a wider range of results are possible. Conditions where the plume was found to travel relatively long and far into the far-field, are a high ambient current, a low water depth and low overflow densities. The effect of these factors corresponds with existing studies.<br/><br/>The contribution of this work lies in the broad characterization of the developing plume under these various conditions: not only the magnitude of the plume is investigated, but also its vertical and lateral<br/>distribution. Specifically, the contribution of the bottom 6-13 % of the water column to the total plume flux is highlighted. This is particularly of interest, as this zone is typically not included in ADCP<br/>measurements. This increases insight in the processes underlying plume development and supports the appropriate determination and implementation of the far-field source term, including a more informed<br/>use of the 0-20% source term fraction range proposed by Becker et al. (2015).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

After noised-based calibration and model-based decomposition of the polarization covariance matrix, with regenerated measurement slow-time data, a variety of targets in heavy clutter with signal power comparable to the target are detected by polarimetric algorithms in the environment of strong clutters. Starting from numerical simulation and comparison of different detector algorithms, this work has validated the feasibility and accuracy of each detector in realistic scenario. The measurement result agrees with the simulation result that with the use of radar polarimetric information as a priori knowledge, target detection can be improved<br/>by polarimetric detectors.","Polarization; clutter; Target Detection; Polarimetric characteristics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Also, the materials being used have unfavorable consequences for the environment. A new type of battery made from sea salt has recently been invented. The sea salt battery could potentially be a better, cheaper, and greener battery. This thesis aimed to explore the feasibility of the sea salt battery technology for electric rickshaws in New Delhi, India, in order to answer the following main research question: How can the sea salt battery become a feasible technology for electric rickshaws in New Delhi, India? <br/><br/>This study showed that energy density, and thus range, is one of the most important parameters for evaluating e-rickshaw batteries. Furthermore, the literature and case study demonstrated that the Indian battery market is highly price sensitive, which makes a low energy cost per kWh of battery storage very important when aiming to be competitive. In contrast, the sea salt battery showed positive results in other aspects. The study showed that the sea salt battery outperformed commercial batteries, in terms of cycle life. More simulations and lab research need to be done on this, but this could potentially save drivers a lot of costs, if they have to buy a new battery much less frequently. In addition, it was found that the sea salt battery is suitable to be placed in an e-rickshaw. Furthermore, outcomes of the case study showed that it is desirable to integrate the sea salt battery with a BMS system, which facilitates and improves the operations of the e-rickshaw operators. Due to the very low toxicity of the sea salt battery, compared with its competitors, the sea salt battery performs very positively in terms of social acceptance. To conclude, sea salt batteries are feasible for use in e-rickshaws if the energy density and cost per kWh of battery storage are improved and come close to that of commercial batteries. The sea salt battery is an environmentally friendly battery source that, due to its long life and performance in hot climates, could potentially be promising for e-rickshaw drivers in India.","Sea Salt Battery; E-Rickshaw; Feasibility Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It is a way to take power and create a city that is truly based on what the residents want, rather than it being opposed on them. <br/><br/>Right now there is a growing movement in the Netherlands where municipalities want to embrace bottom-up initiatives and give the citizens the opportunity to contribute in shaping the city through participation. Citizens are invited to express their opinion or to receive support for their own ideas.<br/><br/>The citizens themselves have to take action to make bottom-up participation happen. However, many citizens are not familiar with the possibilities. As a result, only a small number of citizens participate. Most of the power of participation falls in their hands. This leads to outcomes that are non-inclusive and are often only beneficial for this select group of citizens. <br/><br/>There is, however, a growing group of people who are indeed interested in bottom-up participation but do not act on it as they experience too much resistance and too many obstacles. An opportunity can be found in enabling these interested but inactive citizens to get familiar with initiative information and take action towards durable bottom-up participation. The aim of this project is, therefore, to carefully navigate the present obstacles and explore how to address them with design. <br/><br/>The exploration consists of iterative design sprints combined with the research through design approach, which allows me to chart the citizens participation landscape in a practical and experimental way.<br/><br/>Research through design is the main approach of the thesis in order to get as close to the experienced obstacles as possible. On the basis of fast iterative design sprints several prototypes are tested that actively involve stakeholders. The prototypes are tools to navigate deeper into the context, gain insights and create a clear foundation for the final design.<br/><br/>The knowledge gained through the explorative design sprints ultimately give shape to the following design goal: Design a tool that can enable interested but inactive citizens to get familiar with initiative information and take action towards a durable initiative.<br/><br/>The goal results in Growing the Movement, which is a new participatory tool that guides interested citizens through the biodiversity initiative landscape and its possibilities. Through the tool citizens will acquire a personalized set of cards.

Moreover, there is a need to establish adequate membrane pore sizes throughout the cell culture duration.

Moreover, stiffness of POMaC was in the expected range, and the bioimaging properties were found to be suitable. The degradation results did not support the hypothesis that a structural pore size could increase, which likely impedes the increase of pore diameter necessary for immune cell transmigration.

At the core of such applications lies the Helmholtz equation, which represents the time-independent version of the wave equation. Simulating a Helmholtz problem numerically with accurate numerical solutions for large wave numbers is challenging. Numerical solvers for the Helmholtz problem have to balance having accurate numerical solutions, requiring a number of iterations to reach convergence that is independent of the wave number and solving with linear time complexity with respect to the grid nodes. Currently, there is no numerical Helmholtz solver that can satisfy these requirements at once. <br/>We developed Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners which leads to wave number independent convergence for wave numbers in 2D and 3D, while remaining to have accurate numerical solutions. The preconditioners use two-level Schwarz preconditioners, with the coarse problem being constructed using higher-order interpolation with quadratic rational Bézier curves. The developed domain decomposition preconditioners are designed to leverage parallel computing in the future in an attempt for the preconditioners to acquire the ability to solve with linear time complexity.<br/><br/>In this research, the preconditioner resulting in wave number independent convergence and the lowest iteration count is the two-level scaled hybrid Schwarz preconditioner with a coarse problem constructed using higher-order Bézier interpolation. This preconditioner uses a deflation method to remove unwanted eigenvalues. Removing these unwanted eigenvalues results in a clustering of the eigenvalues which is more favourable for GMRES. Currently, all the developed preconditioners suffer from high computational cost for large wave numbers, due to the coarse problem becoming large. Decreasing the coarse problem size of the preconditioners, while remaining to have wave number independent convergence, has shown to been unsuccessful. To better understand the required conditions for wave number independent convergence of the preconditioners, we investigated the relationship between the number of coarse grid nodes and the wave length, too see if there is anything generalizable about this relationship and wave number independent convergence of the solvers.<br/>In conclusion, the balancing for a Helmholtz solver to have accurate numerical solutions, requiring a number of iterations to reach convergence that is independent of the wave number and solving with linear time complexity<br/>is again shown to be difficult. This work provides the initial development and testing of promising wave number independent Helmholtz solvers, from which more research should follow that tackle its biggest computational problems.","Domain Decomposition; Helmholtz equation; Deflation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Patients with neurological disorders usually require multi-dimensional rehabilitation, involving physical, cognitive, psychological, and medical help. Children with trunk control problems arising due to some of these neurological disorders also require such multi-dimensional rehabilitation. A major part of this is administered to the patient through the activities of a physiotherapist in the clinical context. But the limited number of physiotherapists result in exercises often being prescribed for patients as in-home rehabilitation. During in-home rehabilitation, the patient and the primary care-giver may not be able to comply with the prescription without feedback from a physiotherapist.<br/>To address this challenge, this paper proposes an automated method for assessing movement quality of children during trunk control rehabilitation exercises. We adopted a Human-centered AI approach to the development of our system. We identified the needs of physiotherapists for assessing patient’s functional abilities through semi-structured interviews with six physiotherapists. As a result, we co-designed and developed an artificially Intelligent decision support system that automatically assesses the quality of motion. We created a trunk-control rehabilitation exercise movement dataset based on a protocol co-designed by the authors and the physiotherapists. The data was collected<br/>from 15 typically developing children (mean age 7 years, range 4–10 years) using a ZED-mini stereo-camera and the quality scores as ground-truth were obtained from a physiotherapist. The exercises involved reaching targets kept on a table in front<br/>while being seated away from the table on a stool. We investigated the performance of Random Convolutional Kernel transform and XCM, two state-of-the-art multivariate<br/>time-series classification algorithms on this dataset and achieved a quality prediction f1-score of 65% on the test dataset and similar promising results on the detection of compensatory movements in the exercise motion. In addition, to increase the trust-worthiness of our AI solution, we have provided explanations on the predictions of the black-box algorithms, which can aid the users of the system to understand the causal relationships between the input and output to the AI algorithm.","automated assessment; trunk-control rehabilitation; trustworthy AI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The reversible Solid Oxide Cell (rSOC) is considered to be part of the solution due to its high efficiency, good scalability, and ability to balance the energy grid. The rSOC is a high-temperature, electrochemical device that can convert both power-to-gas and gas-to-power during its Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) modes. The integration of the SOFC with a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) features exceptional synergies. Although the synergies of the SOFC and CCGT have already been widely reviewed, the combination of an rSOC and a CCGT has remained unexplored.<br/><br/>The research objective of this study is to assess the benefits of retrofitting an rSOC to an existing CCGT by simulating its exegetic performance, relative GHG emissions and gross profit, and comparing these results to those of an existing CCGT. During the integration of the rSOC (operating in SOFC mode) with the CCGT, the performance of the reversed SOEC mode must be taken into account because it will have to operate with the same operating conditions and the same system components. In order to decrease the system investment cost, this work examines to what extent the rSOC can be retrofitted into the currently deployed CCGTs.<br/><br/>This research optimizes the process plant design and scrutinizes the effect of various operating conditions on the system performance. The optimization is performed through exergy analyses of a zero-dimensional Aspen Plus model. A case study, in which the proposed system is inserted into an energy resource allocation model of the Amsterdam metropolitan area, is used to examine the gross profit of the proposed multi-energy system. <br/><br/>The optimization of the SOFC-CCGT system results in an exergy efficiency of 61.5%, generating 518 MWe, which enhances the performance of the existing CCGT by 3.8% and decreases the GHG emissions [CO2e t/MWh] by 21.3%. When the combined heat and power (CHP) mode of the CCGT is considered, the resulting SOFC-CCGT CHP system achieves an exergy efficiency of 61.2%, while generating 474 MWe and 103 MWth. The SOFC-CCGT CHP outperforms the exergy efficiency of the original CCGT CHP with 4.2%, while emitting 13.2% less GHG emissions. The same operating conditions of the SOFC were applied to the SOEC, which manages to operate with an exergy efficiency of 84.3%.<br/><br/>Implementing the rSOC-CCGT CHP system into the energy resource allocation model results in a 118% increased net present value (NPV) of the gross profit compared to the original CCGT. The proposed multi-energy system is able to adjust its operating mode to anticipate the price variations in the energy grid and thereby increases the gross profit. Adding a thermal energy storage system decouples the consumption and production of heat, which enhances the NPV of the gross profit by an additional 1.4%. <br/><br","rSOC; CCGT Generation; Retrofit; Multi-energy system; Hydrogen; Electrochemical cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

One such method is to use effective and renewable working fluids in power and refrigeration cycles. Research in this field during the past decade has placed supercritical CO2 (SCO2) in the forefront due to its non-ideal properties and abundance in nature but, to fully understand their heat transfer properties, insight into boundary layer flow and hydrodynamic instabilities are crucial. Experimental setups such as closed loop wind tunnel contraction facilities are needed which provide a laminar steady flow to take boundary layer measurements. However, using a contraction causes various problems such as formation of secondary flows like boundary layer separation, Gortler vortices, cross-flows and non-uniformity’s. In this study a novel 1D contraction shape with curvature on only one side is pro- posed. This will completely eliminate the risk of Gortler vortices on the bottom plate and make it a suitable candidate for boundary layer experiments. Nevertheless, the risk of the other secondary flows and Gortler vortices on the top wall disturbing this laminar flow remains. Hence, the present research aims to optimise this 1D contraction to reduce the risk of such secondary flows and analyse the growth of Gortler vortices on the top wall using numerical simulations.<br/><br/>Steady state laminar simulations were performed to optimise the design of the 1D wind tunnel contraction. Optimum contraction and settling chamber lengths were found by identifying the risk of flow separation and boundary condition effects respectively. For the optimisation of the contraction wall shape, a family of transformed fifth order polynomial curves with varying inflection point distances were selected. To identify the curve with least risk of boundary layer separation and lowest flow non-uniformity, a multi- objective optimisation procedure was implemented. The procedure found that a curve with inflection point of 101mm downstream of contraction inlet gives the best performance.<br/><br/>To analyse the effect of Gortler vortices on outlet uniformity, unsteady laminar simulations were performed on the contraction by forcing sinusoidal perturbations of different wavenumbers. This study found that perturbations form symmetrical steady steam-wise Gortler vortices in the contraction. The most unstable wavenumber was found to be &#x1d706;=83.33 &#x1d45a;<sup>-1</sup> which formed secondary vortices of high vorticity. However it was also seen that for all wavenumbers, the vortices lose energy as they exit the contraction and do not affect the bottom boundary layer. Further, the effects of a side wall on the formation of Gortler vortices were also investigated. The results showed that the Gortler vortex closest to the wall is absorbed into high vorticity corner vortices, while those close to the centreline develop into steady Gortler vortices. No effect on the centreline velocity profile was seen due to the vortices making the 1D contraction suitable for boundary layer experiments. Finally, it was also seen that the 1D contraction shape produces asymmetrical Gortler vortices due to alternative perturbation methods such as random inlet perturbations.<br/><br/><br","Contraction Design; Optimisation; Boundary Layer Flow; Gortler Vortices; Numerical Simulation; Secondary Instability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

During the installation process of an offshore pipeline, the pipeline is most often located in a trench and covered with backfill material. The burial of the pipeline ensures onbottom stability as well as mechanical protection. With a Trailer Suction Hopper Dredger (TSHD) sand can be deposited in the trench, thereby covering the pipeline in a relatively controlled manner. One major risks associated with this backfilling method is the risk of vertical upward displacement of the pipeline during the backfilling process. The vertical upward movement of the pipe is referred to as pipeline flotation and may result in unprotected or damaged pipes. With the rising use of small diameter and lighter pipelines this risk has become more prevalent.<br/><br/>Pipeline flotation is induced by augmented buoyancy which originates from the presence of the water-sand mixture around the pipeline. The particle concentration of the water-sand mixture and the embedment rate of the pipe are leading in the assessment of the buoyancy force acting on the pipeline. The weight of the pipeline is the major force counteracting buoyancy force. In addition, a friction force, resulting from the contact between the pipe and the new formed sand layer around the pipe, counteracts the buoyancy force.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to develop and validate a simplified numerical model for the analysis of offshore pipeline flotation during sand backfilling with a TSHD. The numerical model has been validated against the small-scale physical experiments of Eikhout (2021). The small-scale physical experiments have been developed and used by Yang (2020) and Eikhout (2021) to simulate a simplified sand backfilling process.<br/><br/>The numerical model is developed to simulate the sedimentation process and has been developed in the finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics. The model is capable of effectively simulating the simplified backfilling process from the small-scale experiments by Eikhout (2021). Moreover, the sedimentation model is able to simulate the inflow of material over time in the physical domain. The sedimentation process has been modelled with a convection equation in which the settling velocity of the water-sand mixture is described with the hindered settling formulation proposed by Metha (1986). The hindered settling formulation describes the velocity of the suspension as a function of its local particle concentration. The numerical data has been processed and used in a force balance which is able to predict the occurrence or absence of pipeline flotation.<br/><br/>The parameters in the hindered settling formulation as well as the numerical settings have been described from a theoretical perspective as well as their practical impact on the numerical solution. After validation against the small-scale physical experiments the numerical model has been used to simulate a more practical scenario.

Additional expert interviews provided country-specific insights on the strategies, utilization, and evaluation of hydrogen supply chains in the near future (2030). <br/><br/>The system analysis on hydrogen supply chains showed that the socio-technical landscape, regime, and niche levels contain drivers, barriers, and facilitators to their adoption. The main drivers for hydrogen supply chains in the Netherlands are affordability, sustainability, and acceptability. When considering the performance of the supply chains according to the performance criteria, it becomes apparent that there is no universal supply chain portfolio that can fulfill all stakeholders' objectives in the Netherlands. The key trade-off identified is that higher sustainability comes with higher acceptability but leads to lower affordability. <br/><br/>Comparable results in literature confirm that each supply chain has trade-offs on a techno-economic and socio-political dimension that need to be weighed by stakeholders depending on the use case and objective. To accelerate the implementation of hydrogen to reach national climate targets and improve energy security, additional policies are needed in the Netherlands to overcome the existing barriers and uncertainties.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","During specific operations, offshore marine contractor Heerema Marine Contractors reduces the draft of their Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel (SSCV) such that the floaters are submerged in close proximity to the free surface. This draft is also known as inconvenient draft. At this draft the motions of the vessel do not fully comply anymore with the computed prediction using linear diffraction theory. A proper motion prediction is required to ensure a safe execution of the offshore operation. The key issue is the submerged part of the floater, since discrepancies occur as soon as there is only a small water column on top of the floaters. Motion RAOs are computed via the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave loads. The reason why this leads to discrepancies in the motion RAO is not yet known. In addition, qualitative hydrodynamic data should be gathered for an object submerged in close proximity of the free surface. <br/>Therefore, in this study the cause of the discrepancies in motion RAO is studied on an experimental basis for an object submerged in close proximity to the free surface. The scope is narrowed down to a two-dimensional cross-section of a SSCV-floater. Numerical simulations using linear diffraction theory are performed in WAMIT. The results are compared to experimental data obtained via model tests performed at the towing tank facilities at the faculty 3mE at Delft University of Technology.<br/><br/>Based on experimental data is concluded that linear diffraction theory does not predict physical phenomena that satisfy the boundary conditions and that underlie principles of the theory. Despite the fact that the experimental data does satisfy the boundary conditions of the numerical simulation, discrepancies occur at the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave load. As a result, it can be concluded that linear diffraction theory malfunctions at the inconvenient draft region, and therefore is not the correct theory to determine RAOs for an object on inconvenient draft.<br/>Discrepancies in motion RAO are found to be dominated by the discrepancies the wave load, except for the frequency at which the added mass equals negative inertia of the body. Discrepancies for added mass are less significant than for the damping coefficient and wave load. At higher frequencies inertia becomes dominant over damping and damping deviations affect the RAO less. <br/>The pitch motion about the center of the cross-section does not represent a rotational motion about same the degree of freedom for an SSCV. However, it allowed to experimentally investigate the global numerical extremes. In addition, it led to the finding that it seems that the rotational data is more affected than the heave data.<br/><br/>There is a strong suspicion that poles in the complex plane are the cause of the discrepancies in the hydrodynamic data, which result of the used Green's function by Wehausen and Laitone. This suspicion is based on characteristics of the numerical data in combination with findings in literature and the experimental data, accumulate.<br/><br/>Currently, an approach that makes use of free surface damping is applied to predict the motion of an SSCV at inconvenient draft. Based on experimental data can be concluded that the use of free surface damping without further modifications does not result in an accurate motion prediction. <br/><br/>Lastly, the effect of nonlinearities when increasing the oscillation or wave amplitude. The wave load is found to be more prone to nonlinear effects than the hydrodynamic coefficients.The force signal remained dominantly harmonic, but higher harmonic forces did show up. Furthermore, with the exception of most tests at the largest tested submergence, higher harmonic waves were measured and visually observed during the tests. These higher harmonic waves arose at the transition from the shallow to deep water regime and vice versa. These forces were found to have hardly any effect on the force signal.<br","Hydrodynamics; Model tests; Diffraction analysis; Inconvenient draft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The kato katz method was, and still is, an invaluable tool to diagnose schistosomiasis mansoni en masse in high and medium intensity infection areas that are economically backward. Due to the current sensitivity capabilities of 24 EPG, the standard kato katz method is unable to diagnose very low intensity infections. And even though alternatives are sought, none are as affordable, cost-effective and easy to use as kato katz in the context of LMICs.<br/>As the goals of the world health organization shift from disease mapping and treatment, to post treatment surveillance and eradication of S. Mansoni, more sensitive means of egg detection are necessary. The lack of a cost effective diagnostic tool will mean a rebound in the prevalence and intensity of infection, as medication cannot be given without a diagnosis. An accurate, cost effective, and easy to use method such as the currently used kato katz thus becomes a necessity. In this light, it was thought to be prudent to explore the idea of improving the kato katz process itself, in terms of sensitivity, ease of use and sustainability.<br/>The context of this project was strictly limited to the sample preparation process only, and the seven steps recomended by WHO were classified into filtration and smearing phases. Three concepts were generated for each phase, and evaluated relatively using the harris profile. The template filter and the draw down smearing method were chosen to be the most desirable, and were finalized for prototyping and evaluation.<br/>Material selection was based on their ability to withstand multiple cycles of cleaning using water and regular soap. Silicone strips with a stainless steel mesh insert and PLA for draw down smearer were chosen for their resistance to soap as well as economical value. Preliminary testing with synthetic feces showed that silicone strips were too flexible during the filtration process and did not allow for consistent deposit of fecal sample onto the glass slide. Hence the material was changed to a more rigid polycarbonate.<br/>The components were taken to Nigeria to be tested on field by one of the stakeholders, Mr. Prosper Oyibo. He let two experienced lab technicians test the components using actual feces, and took notes of their feedback, based on a questionnaire prepared before hand. Overall, the lab technicians found the improved kato katz method to have potential for on field use, given that a certain amount of changes were made, such as reduction in the amount of fecal sample, and changing the template so that feces do not collect at the corners. It may be concluded that with certain steps taken in the future, the improved kato katz method will certainly be useful.","kato katz; Schistosomiasis; Microscopy; mass drug administration; eggs per gram","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Procel Moya, P.A. (mentor); Isabella, O. (graduation committee); Dong, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Perovskite/Silicon tandem cells are gradually becoming more promising in the field of photovoltaic technology since they have already surpassed the theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) limit of single junction (SJ) silicon cells (~30%), while they can be commercially compatible. Several architectures of Perovskite/silicon devices were proposed. The most known of them are four terminals tandem (4TT) and two terminals tandem (2TT). Which are well researched and have already surpassed the highest efficiency achieved by SJ silicon cells. On the other hand, 3TT is less known architecture which have received less attention in research than 2TT and 4TT but seems to combine the advantages of both and eliminate their disadvantages. Although of the few research done on 3TT, they revealed great potential of achieving high efficiency. Yet it is still practically challenging to design and fabricate stable 3TT devices that bring 30% PCE’s goal to reality. To continue unveiling the potential of 3TT perovskite/Si device, more research needs to be done in areas that haven’t been investigated before. And that was the target of this project.<br/>The 3TT device structure proposed in this work is a perovskite top cell on a c-Si IBC bottom cell. And the focus of the project was to investigate and optimize the design parameters of the perovskite top cell as well as the IBC bottom cell to improve the overall efficiency of the tandem device using 2D modelling. To achieve these Objectives, a 2-D simulation model template was built for the mentioned tandem device with the help of Sentaurus TCAD. Further, the model template has been validated. Subsequently, the validated model was used to conduct a comparison between the proposed 3TT device and an identical 4TT device to examine the compactivity of the model with other tandem configurations. This has shown that the 3TT model has performed as good as the 4TT model. Both models showed capability of achieving efficiency beyond 30%.<br/>Then, the performance of the 3TT model was examined under different thicknesses of Perovskite layer. This revealed that the 3TT device has the highest efficiency when the perovskite layer has a thickness between 0.5 - 1.2 µm where efficiency higher than 30% can be achieved.<br/>The next step was to investigate and redesign the IBC bottom cell to improve the 3TT performance. First, the device performance under different pitch values in the IBC bottom cell was examined. It was found that the lower the pitch is, the higher the performance becomes. It was also found that the pitch value doesn’t influence only the bottom cell but also the top cell. Which makes the performance of 3TT device more sensitive to pitch values than the SJ IBC cell. Second, the rear emitter to base ratio in the IBC bottom cell was investigated. Which showed that the emitter/base ratio has less influence on the 3TT behavior when the pitch value is within or less than the range of the diffusion length of the bulk material. But the influence of the ratio grows up when the pitch is higher. The 3TT device has its peak performance when the ratio is between 2:1 to 4:1.<br/>After that, the tandem model was redesigned to corporate all the outcomes that was found in previous steps. This resulted in several scenarios based on best parameters to design 3TT models with the best outcome. Four scenarios have been suggested where each of them can achieve PCE higher than 31.5 %.<br/>Finally, we have studied the effect of surface recombination on the performance of the 3TT device. Which revealed that most of surface recombination losses are coming from the interfaces between perovskite layer and ETL or HTL layers. Therefore, if these surface recombination losses are suppressed, that will lead to a PCE higher than 33 %.<br","opto-electrical modelling; Three terminal tandem; Perovskite/c-Si tandem module; Sentaurus TCAD; optimization; GenPro4; IBC solar cell; Pitch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Kiselev, Sergey (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This work describes the benefits of exploiting cold hydrogen in a 2 MW liquid hydrogen-electric powertrain. Hydrogen is stored in a liquid state in the aircraft at its boiling point of 20 K (at 1 bar). Fuel cells require an input temperature of at least zero degrees Celsius to operate. The heating process can either be done by drawing current from the fuel cell to power an electric heater that heats the hydrogen, or it can be done by using fuel cell waste heat in a heat exchanger. These two powertrain configurations<br/>are referred to as ’baseline’ and ’proposed’, respectively. It is hypothesized that 2.5% of the hydrogen’s energy content can be saved by opting for the latter. This corresponds to an estimated 6.3% shaft efficiency gain. The case study uses a flight mission that is typical for the ATR 72. A power balance is constructed that contains all power consuming or producing components in the liquid hydrogen-electric powertrain. This set of components consists of the fuel cell, compressor, pumps, motor, inverter, and<br/>heat exchangers. A model structure is conceived showing all interdependencies between the various components. The research methodology describes the theoretical basis for analysis of all the individual components. The scope of the analysis is thermal and thermodynamical behavior. A systematic trade-off is made to select a concept solution for the hydrogen heat exchanger with the help of a morphological overview and a multi-criteria analysis. This resulted in the selection of a heat exchanger located outside of the LH2 storage reservoir that uses FC waste heat which is transported by a liquid One chapter has been dedicated to the exploration of power regeneration possibilities. It is shown that the hydrogen flow has a high exergetic potential but that it is hard in practice to exploit this effectively. Hence, no power generation cycle is implemented in the proposed configuration. Model validation has been conducted for all components of the power balance except for the humidifier. Normalized root mean square errors ranging between 0.01 and 0.23 have been identified. The effect of the stack pressure on the fuel cell performance is also evaluated. It is explained why a constant compressor pressure ratio of 3 is targeted. The sizing process for the components that are used in the model is explained as well as the flow control strategy. The powertrain uses two separate cooling loops, a high temperature and a low temperature cooling loop (referring to the average coolant temperatures within the loops). The model results show that the shaft efficiency of the powertrain on average increases from 0.367 in the baseline configuration to 0.409 in the experimental configuration. The model uncertainty is less<br/>than 1%. This is because the component models with a high normalized root mean square error have a small effect on the overall power balance while the most dominant components have been calibrated to a high level of accuracy. This leads to the conclusion that using fuel cell waste heat for hydrogen heating substantially increases the shaft efficiency in the ZA2000 powertrain and in liquid hydrogen-electric powertrains in general. Other observations include a strong increase in FC performance and a decrease in the parasitic load. The flight mission requires an average of 2.1 MW of shaft power during which the cold hydrogen flow provides 204 kW of cooling. Finally, recommendations are made for further research in the fields of enhanced heat dissipation methods, weight optimization of hydrogen-electric powertrains, and aerodyanmic analysis of the effect of hydrogen-electric powertrains on aircraft.","hydrogen; Turboprop; efficiency; Liquid hydrogen; Fuel cell; PEMFC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The chemical analysis of archaeological residues can offer valuable insights into the technical complexity of ancient hominins, thus opening a window to their cognitive complexity and socio-economic exchange networks. The scarcity of residue findings in the archaeological record bears the need for non-destructive analytical tools. Various combinations of non-destructive techniques, for instance optical microscopy, infrared or Raman spectroscopy, have been implemented. These techniques are also often combined with destructive GC-MS analysis, which is the most common analytical method for these organic materials. However, currently, there is no systematic proposed way to analyse archaeological residues non-destructively. This project aims to verify the organic nature and test the reliability of identification of archaeological adhesive materials with a combination of non-destructive methods. For this purpose, SEM-EDS, FTIR microspectroscopy in reflectance mode, Raman microspectroscopy and XRD are implemented. A set of experimental adhesive replicas of pure materials and mixtures are examined in pristine form, but also after a three-year-long weathering experiment. The materials tested are pine tar, birch tar, pine resin, beeswax and mixtures of pine resin with beeswax, as well as pine resin with beeswax and ochre; these materials are representative for archaeological finds. Additionally, a set of archaeological samples were studied, consisting of Mesolithic bone/antler points with adhering hafting adhesive residues, form the Dutch North Sea. This research shows that the effectiveness of each method varies with the different materials and mixtures tested. In addition, degradation negatively influences the reliable verification and identification of the organic residue constituents significantly. A single method is usually unable to reliably identify weathered and degraded samples, creating the need for consideration of combined results from multiple methods. A protocol is eventually proposed for the systematic non-destructive analysis of unknown archaeological residues, based on the observations of this research. The protocol recommends SEM-EDS as a starting point of analysis for verifying the residue’s organic nature. The combination of micro-FTIR and micro-Raman follows, to reinforce the verification of organic matter and identify the residue constituents. Lastly, XRD can identify additives to the residue mixture and phases related to the artefact’s environment of burial.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Around this time, several structural problems were noticed during inspection which have led to performance deterioration and durability issues of the tunnel. Often large- scale maintenance was required to meet the design life of immersed tunnels. To counter these problems and improve the constructability of tunnels several design changes have been developed over the past two decades. Furthermore, the current monitoring plan lacks in terms of frequency, accuracy and often requires tunnel tube closure. This thesis aims to improve the life cycle operation of immersed tunnels based on long-term structural problems encountered during their design life. <br/><br/>To achieve this, common structural problems encountered were initially identified by reviewing literature and maintenance reports of past projects. Excess deformations, joint gap opening/closure, concrete cracking, corrosion and leakage were determined as the five typical structural problems. These problems were then further analysed based on construction technique, geotechnical engineering and design flaw from a mechanical and structural perspective. Once the structural problems were identified, recent design changes were inventoried based on element material, cross-section design, transverse prestressing, foundation treatment, waterproofing and joint formation. The primary objective of this step was to understand the impact of these design changes in mitigating structural problems.<br/><br/>Following the structural problem study, an improved monitoring plan was developed to serve as an early warning system for structural problems. Firstly, the parameters to be monitored were determined based on how they influenced structural problems. These parameters were vertical displacement, transverse displacement, joint width, crack width, shear key force, leakage detection, chloride diusivity, pH in concrete, concrete strain and foundation soil stiffness. Subsequently, threshold limits for each parameter were set to implement quick remedial actions once these limits were crossed. Afterward, an inventory of sensors and monitoring techniques were selected to monitor these parameters based on accuracy, frequency and how helpful they were to contractors in current-day practice. Remediation measures specific to each structural problem were also briefly discussed.","Immersed Tunnel; Monitoring; Sensors; Remediation Measures; Corrosion; Deformation; Concrete cracking; Leakage; Joint opening and closure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-31","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

An output power lower than 2 W, along with good performances in terms of linearity and efficiency, is often required.

(mentor); Bouaziz, Laurène (mentor); Dewals, Benjamin (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In mid-July 2021, heavy precipitation caused flooding for multiple tributaries of the Meuse and Rhine rivers which resulted in many deaths and exceptional damage. The Ahr in Germany, the Vesdre in Belgium and the Geul in the Netherlands suffered the greatest damage in each country. The first step in reducing such high damage from international, minor catchments is to build an understanding of the flood event. <br/><br/>The goal of this study was to analyse how extreme several hydrological aspects of the flood event of July 13-16 were for the Ahr, Vesdre and Geul. Analysing the extremity of an event requires a description of that event which helps with building knowledge. Its extremity places that knowledge into context. A flood with a 10-year return period will require a different approach than one with a 1000-year return period to balance the risk reduction and required effort. Three international catchments have been selected as case studies to allow an in-depth analysis of catchments and compliment current research on the flood event with a transboundary perspective.<br/><br/>The hydrological aspects considered for this study concern the forcing, flow mechanisms and response. For the forcing and response, a data analysis has been performed to study the extremity of the origin, magnitude, spatial and temporal variation of the precipitation, as well as the magnitude of the flow. Characteristics of both were used to determine the flood type. The data analysis on flow magnitude and seasonality has been supplemented by historical information to give more insight. The flow mechanisms have been derived from two models with varying structure and spatial variation by analysing parameter values and internal states. <br/><br/>The origin of the precipitation is considered as extreme since the cold core low, a low pressure area with a cold centre, was accompanied by several factors in a rare combination that likely contributed to the high precipitation amounts. The precipitation amount of July 14, the wettest day of the event, was of extreme magnitude according to the return periods of over 1000 years for several gauges. Although there was a large spatial variation in precipitation and thus their return periods, the spatial pattern showed a positive correlation of medium strength with the climatic pattern and is thus not considered as extreme. The temporal variation of the event is also not extreme. So during the event, only the amount of precipitation was extreme, but the precipitation amount in the preceding month was also extreme.<br/><br/>The peak discharges have been estimated to be around 990, 600 and 90 $[m^3/s]$ at the downstream gauges of the Ahr, Vesdre and Geul. The higher peak discharges coincide with sharper hydrographs and a stronger relief and impermeable soils. The return periods of the peak discharges were over 1000 years. Such extreme return periods are not surprising as such discharges had never been measured before. However, historical reconstructions show that similar flood events have occurred at least once for the Ahr. The assumed rare occurrence of summer floods in the regions was also debunked by historical information as 21 to 44\% of the historical floods occurred during the summer half-year. Another assumption by reports on the flood event was the flood type identification of a flash flood. The large spatial and temporal scale, as well as lag times for downstream gauges of 13 to 24 hours, do not resemble a flash flood, but rather a long precipitation event with a fast response. <br/><br/>Two models, a lumped, simple model based on the HBV model and a distributed more complex model based on the SBM model, have been calibrated for several years preceding the flood event, resulting in a good performance. Their performance for the flood event was low due to a strong underestimation of the peak discharge. This underestimation was resolved by a re-calibration. The re-calibrated parameters and internal states of the models show an increase in fast responding mechanisms, up to unprecedented magnitudes. The SBM model includes more processes and shows a rare amount of overland flow due to saturation excess. The fast response mechanisms, both in magnitude and relative runoff contribution, were unprecedented and can be considered as extreme.<br/><br/>The magnitudes of the precipitation, flow mechanisms and discharge were extreme for the 2021 flood event. The extreme flows were possible due to fast flow mechanisms, most likely overland flow due to saturation excess, which can be linked to the extreme pre-conditions. The strong relief and impermeable soils also seem to play a role in this extreme response. All catchments are capable of a fast and strong runoff response and although the forcing of the event was extreme, a new flood event in the future can not be excluded and so a higher level of preparedness and protection is required. <br/><br/>This study should be considered as an exploratory first step for action on the flood event. In order to move forward and increase the protection of the region, more detailed research is required. Such research can focus on several areas. Varying the study regions could be helpful for specific purpose. Several examples are an analysis of the entire region for a precipitation analysis, one catchment study for flood measures, or a catchment comparison for detecting hydrological influences. The anthropogenic influences can also provide more insight and opportunities and could be included in these future researches. The use of models was limited in this research but their further development is essential for flood risk management. Uncertainty is another topic that deserves more attention. An important factor in decreasing the uncertainty is to construct robust and extensive measurement infrastructure. Nevertheless, without more international cooperation and data accessibility the additional data will not reach its full potential. International cooperation also provides more value to the previous recommendations. This research shows that the transboundary catchments of the case study can be compared and give more insights to the overall behaviour.<br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nowadays, climate change and global warming phenomena are becoming more and more serious issues. In order to sustain the enormous worldwide energy demand, society consumes a high amount of fuel, resulting into the steep increase of the level of CO\textsubscript{2} in the environment. Therefore, the massive greenhouse gases emissions in the atmosphere, generated by burning fossil at a great pace, are the main reason behind the previously mentioned phenomena. Heat transfer augmentation methods can considerably contribute to the decrease of fuel consumption, resulting into a reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions. Therefore, this can be an effective approach to tackle the climate change and global warming phenomena. Particularly, rough surfaces are a well known heat transfer augmentation technique. Such surfaces induce turbulence and thereby the flow is well mixed. This mechanism assists convective heat transfer and as a result, heat transfer is augmented. In addition, buoyancy-influenced turbulent flows frequently occur in many engineering applications. These flows combine natural and forced convection which are due to buoyancy and the bulk flow respectively and contribute both to heat transfer. Particularly, buoyancy-aided flows can promote laminarization and therefore heat transfer deterioration. The main focus of this study is to examine the impact of surface roughness and buoyancy effects on turbulent heat transfer. Initially, a 3D rectangular channel is considered with the streamwise, wall normal and spanwise dimensions being 5.63 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2.815. Subsequently, two different wall roughness geometries are constructed. Both of them have a sinusoidal shape, however the direction of travel is in the streamwise direction for the one and in the spanwise for the other. Moreover, the surface roughness is placed on the top and bottom isothermal walls of the geometry. Regarding the space and time discretization, central differences are used for the former one and second order Adams-Bashforth for the latter one. Finally, the immersed boundary method is utilized in order to incorporate the surface roughness. A series of direct numerical simulations is performed to gain an insight on how surface roughness and buoyancy forces affect the heat transfer. The results display that both roughness schemes enhance heat transfer. Particularly, the Reynolds stresses show an increase in both rough wall cases, signifying that mixing is improved. In addition, the turbulent heat flux as well as the Nusselt numbers also exhibit a growth for both streamwise and spanwise orientation, implying that heat transfer is augmented. Comparing the streamwise and spanwise orientations with each other, both Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux graphs are significantly higher in the streamwise roughness case. Moreover, the streamwise roughness is enhancing the Nusselt number approximately 1.8 times more than the spanwise roughness for the zero-buoyancy case and approximately 1.4 times more for the buoyancy-aided scenario. Noteworthy is the fact that, the results show that the buoyancy-aided case predicts larger Reynolds stresses, turbulent heat flux and Nusselt numbers for all of the surfaces.<br","Turbulence; Mixed convection; Heat Transfer; Rough walls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

However, clinical applications of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) requires sufficient precision; this can be assessed with repeatability studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the repeatability of ADC measurements on an MR-Linac for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Additionally, the relative change in ADC during treatment was compared against the repeatability.<br/>Methods: For 17 patients, DWI was performed once on 3T MRI during pre-treatment, and twice on an 1.5T MR-Linac during each treatment fraction. Manual delineations of the Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) were created by the author. In addition two semi-automatic delineation methods were implemented, which used; a registration pipeline to propagate T2 delineations; a geometric distortion correction algorithm to correct for DWI susceptibility artefacts. Based on visual inspection the most accurate and consistent delineations were used to calculate the ADC; Bland-Altman repeatability coefficient (RC), within subject coefficient of variation (wCV), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Lastly, the relative change in mean and median tumour ADC was compared against the RC.<br/>Results: Manual delineations were determined to have the highest agreement with ADC tumour location and were used in subsequent calculations. The mean and median tumour ADC wCV was 7.6% (CI95:5.5-9.2%) and 8.2% (CI95:5.9-9.9%) respectively, which corresponds with a RC of 21.0% (CI95:15.1-25.6%) and 22.7% (CI95:16.3-27.4%). The reliability of the measured data was good, with an ICC of 0.81 (CI95:0.72-0.87). In 6 out of 17 patients the relative change in ADC exceeded the RC at some point during treatment, which suggest a potential for future clinical applications.<br/>Conclusion: Despite the low precision of rectal cancer ADC measurements, daily DWI imaging on MR-Linac has been shown to be viable for clinical applications in a subset of patients whom show significant ADC changes during treatment. Further studies are required to determine whether the measured ADC repeatability allows for clinically relevant observations.","Diffusion Weighted Imaging; Repeatability; Rectum; MR-linac","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

Nevertheless, component tolerance in practical LC components causes instability problems in the feedback-after-LC Class-D amplifier. This thesis presents a class-D amplifier that suppresses LC filter nonlinearity by 40 dB at least and calibrates the variation of the cut-off frequency (f_LC) of the LC filter between 70kHz and 200kHz. This is implemented in a differential architecture, where the inner loop and outer loop ensure high in-band loop gain and stability, and the unity gain frequency is calibrated by a variable gain amplifier (VGA).

Half of their profit goes to their foundation, building toilet facilities all over Ghana, called The Good Toilet. With the concept of The Good Toilet, they want to provide access to sanitation for all Ghanaians, with an economically viable facility, and with the least environmental impact. They want to build toilets all over Ghana, going from school projects to household and community level toilets. The Good Toilet is a whole community centre with toilets, showers, hand washing stations, and a store. There are already 285 toilets built in a first design. This current design is examined in this thesis, as after a field trip in November 2021 some non-foreseen problems came to light. During this field visit samples of the used borehole water were taken and brought back to The Netherlands. The current treatment system, a solid liquid separator and activated coal filter was checked as well. The water used in the facilities seemed to be contaminated with E.Coli, and the effluent stream was entirely clogged. This raised the first research question, namely how the current system can be free from an environmental and health hazard. Secondly it was examined what a new design for the second version of The Good Toilet could be. For this interviews were conducted with people from the emergency context, professors, and people with experience building toilets in low-income countries. Next to this, a literature research was performed and case studies were examined. With this information and estimated guesses a muti-criteria decision matrix within a framework of requirements was created, deciding upon suitable treatment choices for The Good Toilet 2. Next to technical considerations, the social aspect of building toilets in low-income countries was looked at as well, as this could increase the usage of The Good Toilet and therefore decrease open defecation practices in Ghana. For this, inspiration was taken from the SaniTweaks document of Oxfamwash. Combining the technical and social aspects of building toilets, an advice could be drawn up to The Good Roll for their projects in the future","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

A higher strain-rate dependency and a higher yield stress at lower temperatures are observed in the experimental results. It is of importance to correctly model the stress-strain behaviour of PEEK for future research in long term behaviour of fibre reinforced PEEK by adapting the EGP model to account for these differences. The viscosity of the EGP model is based on the Ree-Eyring equation in which the three Ree-Eyring parameters (activation volume, activation energy and initial viscosities) are constants within the EGP model. It is observed that all three Ree-Eyring parameters are not constant over the strain when the original Ree-Eyring equation is fitted to the experimental data. Thus, non-constant Ree-Eyring parameters should be included in the EGP model. Evolving all three Ree-Eyring parameters leads to accurate stress-strain results, except for the pre-yield regime. The EGP model does not behave as stiff as the experiment in this region. Thus, a higher stiffness is included by evolving the shear moduli over the pre-yield regime. The evolution of the Ree-Eyring parameters is expressed by a $\tanh()$ function and quadratic function, while the evolution of the shear moduli is only expressed by a $\tanh()$ function. The evolution based on the $\tanh()$ function mostly influences the behaviour at small strains and the evolution based on the quadratic function mostly influences the behaviour at large strains. The evolution of the Ree-Eyring parameters at large strains leads to the insertion of viscous strain hardening in the EGP model. The viscous strain hardening qualitatively describes the Bauschinger effect for a cyclic loading case. The Bauschinger effect can be explained as the change of material behaviour when stresses are present. What occurs when the loading direction reverses within a cyclic loading case. An invariant function that is proportional to the strain determines the strain dependency of the evolution of the Ree-Eyring parameters and shear moduli. This invariant function is prevented from reducing for the evolution based on the $\tanh()$ function when the loading direction is reversed but does reduce for the evolution based on the quadratic function to correctly model cyclic loading. Furthermore, the linearization of the stiffness tensor is updated for the changes to the EGP model and a part of the stiffness tensor which was omitted in the original implementation is added.<br/><br/>Including the evolution of the Ree-Eyring parameters and shear moduli with the mentioned characteristics in the EGP model makes the EGP model correspond very well with the experimental results for all investigated temperatures and strain-rates.","FEM; EGP model; PEEK; constitutive model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Currently, over 99% of its CO2 emissions originate from storage terminal activities. Action must be taken to reduce these emissions by converting the current (fossil fuel-based) generation of electricity to sustainable energy.<br/><br/>This study aims to research how we can develop a methodology to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an autonomous solar and storage system to electrify Vopak’s storage terminals? The objective of the method is to develop a system that is clean, reliable, autonomous, and payable (cheap). The selected autonomous system comprises a photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a hybrid inverter to satisfy the energy load of the storage terminal.<br/><br/>The developed method is a techno-economic model using three interlinked components. First, a PV model uses meteorological data and specific technical characteristics to simulate different PV systems. Second, based on the cost of different components of the PV system and BESS, a grid-search system selection method is used to determine the lowest-cost sizing of an autonomous PV and battery<br/>system. Third, the sizing of the system is used to calculate the levelized cost of solar plus storage (LCOSS).<br/><br/>The method is evaluated for three selected storage terminals located in different climates. The lowest cost developed system for Vopak Fujairah Horizon terminal (desert climate), which has a LCOSS of 0.33 [$/kWh]. For Vopak Terminal Laurenshaven (maritime climate), a LCOSS of 0.96 [$/kWh] is calculated. Vopak Panama (tropical climate) has a designed system with a LCOSS of 0.53 [$/kWh]. The calculated LCOSS shows that these autonomous systems are not cost-effective, as they are 3 to 14 times more expensive than average energy prices from the grid for the storage terminal locations. A sensitivity analysis of the system costs and the weighted average cost of capital shows that a 50% decrease in battery costs results in a 38% decrease in the LCOSS. Furthermore, a decrease of 2% of the WACC has the same effect as a total system cost reduction of 10%–15%. Ultimately, enabling the system to<br/>use its dumped energy by selling it to the grid shows the most significant reduction in the LCOSS.<br/><br/>This study clarifies that the cost-effectiveness of an autonomous PV and battery system strongly depends on the climate and seasonal variation of the location as it affects the energy yield of the PV-generating technology and the sizing of the system. Furthermore, the battery system costs are currently two to three times more expensive than a PV system; therefore, to size the lowest-cost system, the sizing strategy rather increases the (cheaper) PV system size to satisfy the load than install an additional battery. This results in oversized PV systems generating a large amount of unused energy. A solution is to enable the system to sell its unused electricity to the grid. An alternative solution would be to add a secondary “clean” energy source, such as a hydrogen generator, to combat these oversized systems and thus reduce the lifetime system costs.<br/><br","Techno-economic analysis; Sizing method; Photovoltaic model; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Levelized cost of energy; Levelized cost of solar plus storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The current research follows up on the recommendations provided by Van Middelaar et al. on the implementation of the COOL procedure which, in some cases, was also found too demanding to execute and somewhat distracting from ensuring a safe flight path. A new procedure featuring the steps Aviate Breathe Check (ABC) was developed to explicitly allow for task prioritisation (i.e. aviating over troubleshooting) and to be shorter in its execution while still addressing stress management related steps. We tested the ABC procedure with an experiment involving 25 airline pilots divided into an experimental group (n=13) and a control group (n=12) both of which experienced the same simulation scenarios designed to evoke startle and surprise. No significant effects of the type of training intervention on flying performance, on stress levels and on mental effort were found. Following events involving a sudden upset, the ABC procedure was overall shown to have a higher implementation rate compared to the COOL procedure evaluated in previous research in relation to the same test scenarios. This suggests that the ABC procedure could be more easily implemented on the flight deck. In an operational environment the ABC procedure could hence be integrated in recurrent pilot training programmes and translated into operational practice, without requiring extensive training. It is recommended to further test the procedure in a follow up experiment involving multi-crew operations and/or pilots with a more diverse training background.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Currently, it is expensive to obtain nearshore bathymetry at regional scales, and therefore this data is not available for many coasts. The data scarcity occurs especially in the global south and big ocean states that are at the highest risk from climate change. Currently the only global bathymetric dataset, GEBCO, provides depth data at approximately a 500 m resolution. This data is of limited accuracy in the nearshore zone because the source data is sparse in nearshore areas. Recent research has found that NASA’s ICESat-2, launched in 2018 to study the cryosphere, can incidentally capture bathymetric data. Some studies have been done in small sites, but the potential for a global product has not yet been investigated. This thesis proposes a method of using GEBCO data as a starting point and incorporating ICESat-2 data via a Kalman filter. This results in a product with a downscaled spatial resolution and improved accuracy without requiring any in-situ data. If other local bathymetry data is available, it can be added as input to the Kalman filter or used for validation of the method. Recent studies in lidar remote sensing have shown that ICESat-2 can capture nearshore bathymetry at depths of up to 20 me in tracks 0–3 km apart, provided atmospheric conditions are good and the water is sufficiently clear. Hence, this data could provide a source of high-resolution bathymetric depth profiles in tropical areas and possibly at higher latitudes. This research project proposes an automated processing chain, written in python, for extracting bathymetry points from the lidar data based on the density of the photon returns in the underwater zone. This method can reliably identify points containing bathymetric signal. To downscale the data using a Kalman filter, first global data from GEBCO is clipped to the area of interest, and then resampled bilinearly to 50 m resolution. Then, the ICESat-2 photon data for the area is processed to generate point estimates of bathymetric depth. To fill in the gaps between these point estimates, the bathymetric points are subsampled and interpolated to the same resolution as the GEBCO data using a universal kriging interpolator. This interpolator results in a raster of the estimated depth, and a raster of the estimated uncertainty. To update the interpolated GEBCO grid, the Kalman gain is calculated for each raster cell and using the Kalman state equation a new bathymetry grid is produced. If other data is available, the process can be applied recursively with other depth and uncertainty grids, allowing the Bayesian combination of any number of bathymetry datasets for the site. To validate the method, the improvement in RMSE is calculated between the resulting bathymetry grid and previously validated, high-accuracy survey data. The validation has been applied at several global test sites to verify that the method is generalizable to other regions. Validation sites are chosen based on the availability of validation data from either USGS survey or survey data from Van Oord projects. The approach was found to improve RMSE compared to validation data by up to 34% in some test sites. However, other sites showed marginal improvement, or increased RMS error. The results of this research could allow easier methods of characterizing nearshore bathymetry in remote areas. It could also be extended to include temporal variation – as more bathymetric data becomes available, it could be used to measure the dynamic changes of coastal systems. However, the method is limited by strict water clarity requirements and missing data due to atmospheric conditions. Despite these limitations, it could potentially be expanded to create a downscaled global bathymetry dataset of clearwater areas.<br/><br/><br","Bathymetry; Remote sensing; ICESat-2; Bayesian statistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

By being able to navigate across large amounts of data, the realized solutions learn on their own and provide results that would be unattainable with other ways. The complex nature of the AI makes the solutions difficult to define. The potential is left untapped, as the solution developers struggle to define product features that would correlate with the user needs. On the other hand, the the potential AI solution users may not be aware of the AI capabilities, possibilities of integration, and automatization of the operation processes.This creates situation, in which the potential of the AI is not used effectively, and areas that could benefit from it are not able to integrate AI systems in their operation.<br/>This research looks at this issue from the perspective of the value proposition design process. This process assumes a definition of potential benefits and uses on the side of the developer, aligning, and communicating them with the potential users. Specifically, the Value Proposition Creation model is used, as it is a method often used by AI startups and university spinoffs. The main question this research asks is “What are the factors influencing the specific value proposition of innovative AI solutions”. By answering this question, the paper hopes to establish a method for understanding the specific aspects of the AI solutions that should be taken into consideration while designing an effective value proposition and communicating it with the potential user.<br/>To answer the research question, an in-depth look is taken at the Artificial Intelligence adoption processes. First, a literature study helps define the factors involved in the AI adoption. A conceptual model is created, which is then evaluated via a series of semi-structured interviews with AI research and development experts. By doing so, the relationships between the factors are obtained and a general impact on the adoption process is understood. This allows for a formulation of the relationship of said factors with the Value Proposition Canvas. Additionally, literature research is conducted on the value proposition frameworks, which allows for a definition of good practices in value proposition design in relation to the Artificial Intelligence solutions. The obtained frameworks are then tested in a single exploratory case study, which looks specifically at the idea of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms used as a decision-making method in the context of road maintenance planning.<br/>The research provides an overlay on the Value Proposition Canvas, obtained through the evaluation of the AI adoption process. Such approach creates a framework, which then can be used to effectively define and clarify the individual values, benefits, gains, and features of an AI product. Moreover, by providing the interrelationships between the adoption factors, understanding of the internal dependencies of factors necessary in the product development process can be obtained. The framework can be used by developers in the field of Artificial Intelligence to assess the necessary requirements of the solution, highlight the key areas that have to be researched, as well as help in communicating of the crucial solution aspects with the potential clients and users. The framework can be best used in the context of an AI startup or a university spinoff, because of its generalist approach. It assumes a fast development of a value proposition, which is necessary in the context of a Minimum Viable Product definition.<br/>The results of the research combine the adoption processes of the AI solution and the method for their value proposition, realized with the VPC. It has been shown that the adoption factors may play a relevant role in the value definition of the potential solutions. Because the adoption models may not be used directly in the VP processes, a framework of questions has been setup for the solution developers to reflect upon during the Value Proposition Creation. Such approach is in line with the general methodology of the VPC, as it uses questions to define the relevant fields of the canvas. The goal of the research was not to modify the canvas itself, as its intrinsic agility and simplicity is the core strength. Moreover, by looking at the common practices seen in other Value Proposition frameworks, good practices have been defined for the VPC in relation specifically to the Artificial Intelligence solutions. These results have been afterwards validated in the exploratory case study for the Deep Reinforcement Leaning decision-making system in the field of road maintenance, indicating the specific steps that the solution developer must undertake and creating an example Value Proposition Canvas for this specific case.<br","Artificial Intelligence; Value Proposition; Entrepeneurship; Spin-off; Product management; academic start-ups; Value Proposition Canvas; Technology management; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Predictive Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The discovery of DNA origami nanotechnology has opened new opportunities in this field due to the versatility of the shapes and sizes that can be generated, the ease of modification and functionalization with molecular resolution, and its biocompatibility. Using Watson-Crick base pairing as the main driver in the self-assembly procedure, DNA origami’s simple assembly process has paved the way for the design of static and dynamic nanostructures. The main methods of characterization are AFM and TEM. While AFM allows the characterization of static and dynamic nanostructures, TEM is only limited to static. However, the TEM’s dynamic imaging ability might be enhanced due to a new technique known as Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy. Graphene, the primary material for the fabrication of Liquid Cells, enables reduced electron scattering, reduced radiation damage and allows enhanced contrast compared to conventional carbon supports. If successful, liquid cell microscopy could enable higher lateral resolution and reduced invasiveness related to AFM measurements while imaging the sample in physiological conditions. However, graphene has been a hostile substrate for DNA origami nanostructures. Due to π−π bonding of graphene, DNA bases react with the delocalized π electrons of graphene and are denatured, causing unwanted deformations in the nanostructures. Additionally, other 2D materials with π −π bonds like MoS2, which was also involved in liquid cell microscopy, have shown similar deformations with DNA origami structures. Various functionalizations have enhanced the biocompatibility of graphene and MoS2 surfaces, reducing the degree of deformation of DNA origami nanostructures. A drawback of all these studies is the lack of similarity between the substrates and the methodologies used for the transfer of 2D materials. This impedes the comparison of the interaction of DNA origami with pristine and functionalized 2D materials. This project aims to qualitatively assess the interaction of DNA origami with pristine and functionalized 2D materials. First, measurements on mica were taken as a baseline for comparison. It was found that the location where the measurement was taken affects the surface’s cleanliness due to the morphology of the cleaved mica. A reduced amount of salt was found present in the centre of the mica compared to the side, which allowed an accurate characterization of DNA origami nanostructures. In addition, rinsing 2-3 times reduced the roughness, increased the adhesion of DNA origami nanostructures and diminished the concentration of salt on the mica substrate. Next, the deposition of DNA origami on graphite substrates has shown a shrinking of DNA origami triangles (≈ 10 nm) due to the melting of dsDNA to ssDNA. A similar deformation was observed in hBN substrates that have a similar shape to graphene but have localized π electrons. Functionalization with poly-l-lysine decreases the degree of deformation of DNA origami nanoarchitectures. However, the values still do not match the ones experienced on mica. Conclusionally, pristine graphite and hBN supports cannot serve as an alternative substrate for imaging DNA origami nanostructures. The optimization of the functionalization protocol might enable the use of graphite as TEM grids.","AFM; DNA origami; 2D materials; Graphene","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

During landing, the UAV should be able to slow down while not affecting its physical design. Currently, multiple sensors are being used to increase the accuracy while landing which might weigh down some of the smaller UAVs. The usage of a single sensor to guarantee safe landing is yet on its early stages of development. It was observed that insects use Optical Flow to maneuver, and this has been used as a method to design UAV's journey and land safely. By dividing each frame, an Optical Flow Difference is calculated which is used as a metric for the UAV to move towards the landing platform. <br/><br/>Once the UAV has positioned itself on top of the elevated landing platform, image dilation is used to safely land the UAV. One of the methods tested used Image Dilation Method using IMU. Using the calculated image dilation, the control input to the UAV is generated and the UAV lands. This method failed in providing safe landing and it also did not take the vision of the UAV into consideration. Then, Image Dilation Method using Features from Accelerated Segment Test (IDMF-AST) was tested. This method tracks features observed by the UAV and calculated an estimate of the image dilation. The estimate of image landing is used to control the UAV. This showed dependency on the landing design platform and the hyperparameters that are used for implementing IDMF for the type of landing.<br/><br/>Different landing designs were tested for different elevated landing platforms. It was observed that concentric circles on a textured landing marker provided the highest probability of safe landing. To tackle the dependency of the hyperparameters, a Classification Model was proposed to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for each possible height of the platform. This trained model was incorporated with the IDMF, thereby designing the Adaptive IDMF algorithm. The Adaptive IDMF was tested against the original IDMF on the metrics of safe landing probability, time taken to safely land and simulation time. Adaptive IDMF performed better compared to IDMF providing an 190% increase in probability of safe landing, faster safe landing and lesser simulation and compilation time.<br","UAV; Optical Flow; Autonomous Landing; Image Dilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","Airborne Data Collection on Resilient System Architectures",""

Metro networks are especially apt at this considering their high-capacity and high-speed operation in urban environments. Comparing different metro networks to one another is a suitable manner for transport planners to gain insights into the characteristics of their networks and which areas of improvement exist. In the field of network science, metro networks have been studied extensively in recent decades. While this provided many new insights in the field of network science, the practical relevance for the field of transport science often remained limited. This limited relevance is primarily caused by the lack of realism of the network representations used, not incorporating the actual operation and service that the network provides. As such, this study proposes a comprehensive comparison of metro networks worldwide including service information. This comparison study includes service characteristics in the form of the total travel time indicator for shortest path calculations, which is a combination of the in-vehicle time, waiting time and number of transfers. The median of this total travel time is taken for each network and compared to that of other networks. This metric in turn is contrasted with network- and city-related characteristics in order to explore relations between these factors and to explain the patterns discovered. From this analysis, it is revealed that the travel time increases with network size. The indicator that is especially apt at explaining the differences in total travel time between networks is the number of stations combined with the average direct station distance. The total travel time methodology applied in this study shows significantly different results to other commonly used methods that rely only on in-vehicle time or hops to calculate shortest path travel times. The waiting time turns out to be the main contributor to these significant differences. Future studies can expand on this by considering other network science indicators and looking further into local indicators. In addition, the methodology could be expanded with more detailed transfer information and other PT modes.","Metro Network; Network Science; Network Topology; Service Information; Comparison Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4121/21316824 Curated L-space representations for 51 metro networks https://doi.org/10.4121/21316950 Curated P-space representations for 51 metro networks","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

First, the future of residential batteries was evaluated in social and technical context by mapping the present situation, its trends, and its possible drivers. Three different battery control strategies were analysed: maximising self-consumption, market price arbitrage, and load peak reduction. The corresponding battery profile was determined with a rule-based approach. Second, load summation was used to simulate battery development scenarios within the distribution network, after which the effect of residential batteries was determined on a selected substation with a load peak analysis. From consumer perspective, residential batteries are driven by the phase-out of the net-metering scheme, increasing wholesale daily price spread, a decline of investment costs, or renewed tariff structures. The results showed that residential batteries become economically attractive when net-metering is abolished and the daily electricity price spread increases. The load profile results of the selected substation show a reduction of both size and number of overload hours for all control methods in case of medium and low emergence of residential batteries. In case the batteries are used to reduce individual load peaks, this reduction is largest and is smallest when batteries are used for market price arbitrage. Battery usage for self-consumption and peak reduction mainly operate during summer months when PV generation is higher. Therefore, demand load peaks in winter are not relieved as much. Although it was found that grid reinforcement is still not alleviated for the selected substation, the maximum and minimum load peak are unified leading to a reduction of required reinforcement capacity. It is found that retail price regulations strongly influence which control method will be dominant. Incentives to increase self-consumption or reduce load peaks will relieve pressure on the grid. However, critical grid congestion moments are not explicitly relieved. Therefore, further research is required to identify methods to utilise the batteries for DSO control during critical peak moments or winter seasons with low self-consumption usage.","DSO; Residential battery; Congestion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

To develop offshore wind solutions in greater water depths, a floating solution is required. The time-domain simulations of these Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) under wind-wave misalignment used in research and industry projects are computationally intensive and limits researchers and industry in their developments. To better understand the sensitivities of the fatigue loads of FOWTs to different parameters and environmental conditions, a computationally efficient method is needed. The aim of this research is to develop a frequency-domain method to quantify the effects of misaligned wind and waves on the response of a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine. Therefore, the following research question is defined: What is the effect of misaligned wind, windsea waves, and swells on the loads at the tower base of a semi-submersible type floating offshore wind turbine?<br/><br/>Several sensitivity studies are conducted to quantify the contribution of yaw-roll coupling effects and aerodynamic damping to the responses and loads. From these studies, it appears that the yaw-roll coupling can increase the response when excited at wind/wave directions in which the structure is asymmetric.<br/>The magnitude of this effect is related to the wave peak period (and the resulting wavelength), the angle of misalignment with respect to the structure, and the apparent length of the structure. Also, the lack of aerodynamic damping in the direction of the rotor plane (side-side direction) leads to a noticeable<br/>increase in the response, directly or through coupling effects. Finally, the frequency-domain method is compared with the time-domain simulations (BHawC-OrcaFlex) carried out by Siemens Gamesa. Although reasonable agreement is found for the load driving rigid body modes, significant differences in the tower bottom loads are found for the lowest and highest production wind speeds.<br/><br/>These results show that misaligned wind and waves can increase the response for headings where the structure is asymmetric due to coupling effects. Wind-wave misalignment leads to an increased response in the direction of the rotor plane due to the lack of aerodynamic damping. In general, the wind-wave misalignment can also have a mitigating effect on the maximum equivalent moment at the tower base, as the aerodynamic damping also reduces the response in the wave frequency range. Furthermore, the comparison shows the need to extend the frequency-domain method with the first tower bending modes and improvement of aerodynamic/mooring property estimation. Based on the findings and the conclusions, the recommendation is to investigate the floater specific sensitivities at an early stage of the design. Future research should focus on: the implementation of tower flexibility, improvement of the quasi-static estimation of mooring stiffness, frequency dependent aerodynamic properties, and implementation of second-order wave forcing.","Floating Wind Turbines; Floating Wind Energy; Structural Dynamics; Offshore energy; Offshore Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

These data can be aggregated to compute useful statistics from multiple sources using data aggregation protocols. However, oftentimes these data contain private information that must be protected from misuse. Privacy-preserving protocols can help to compute the same statistics without revealing the private input data to unauthorized parties. However, most privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes only work in the honest-but-curious model, where participants do not deviate from the protocol. As a result, the computed statistics cannot always be trusted. In particular, the aggregator, which is the party responsible for collecting the data is usually trusted with computing the correct result. However, a compromised aggregator may decide to output any value of its choosing without anyone noticing. Schemes with public verifiability help to counter malicious aggregators who try to falsify the final result by tampering with the inputs of honest users. However, they do not consider cases where both the aggregator and a subset of the users may be malicious, meaning they can deviate from the protocol and collude with each other in order to output results of their choosing. In this work, we develop a privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol to compute the sum of a set of private inputs such that a verifier can efficiently detect tampering even in the face of a malicious aggregator and a subset of malicious users. We also provide two extensions for better performance and for malicious user detection. We show that the scheme achieves the desired properties of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Finally, theoretical and experimental evaluations show that its performance makes it feasible for real-world applications.","Data aggregation; privacy; verifiability; Malicious behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

One of the alternative heating sources identified is residual data center heat. With the project ‘Digital heat in the MRA’ the municipality aims to create a showcase project to stimulate the large-scale use of this type of heating source. Recognizing that there is a strong social aspect to the transition the municipality of Amsterdam aims to facilitate a fair and equitable transition. An important element of this recognition is the understanding that without community support, projects can run into delays or even lawsuits. Therefore, municipalities are now looking into co-creation as a way to include stakeholders in the transition. <br/><br/>However, how to facilitate a fair and equitable co-creation process for the heating transition is still under debate and differs per project. Within the project ‘Digital heat in the MRA’ there is a focus on the role visuals could play to support the process of co-creation. To see if the conditions for a fair and equitable co-creation process are present in connecting two building blocks in Holendrecht this research draws on the insights from energy justice. Furthermore, as it is the organized stakeholders that shape the initial co-creation sessions, it is crucial to investigate if they identify issues with energy justice. In this way injustices can be identified from the start and be alleviated as much as possible to make sure the sessions are set up in an energy just manner. Therefore, the following research question has been formulated for this thesis: What energy injustices are identified by organized stakeholders in the transition towards sustainable heating in Holendrecht and how are visuals used to communicate about energy injustices?<br/><br/>By means of a review of energy justice literature a set of indicators has been synthesized to form the basis of the participatory observations and interviews conducted for this study and formed the springboard for the thematic analysis. In total 13 participatory observations and 5 interviews have been conducted. This led to the identification of 10 energy injustices and the visuals used to communicate about those injustices. These have been subdivided between the three tenets of energy justice namely distributional justice, recognition justice and procedural justice. <br/><br/>With regards to distributional injustice, net congestion, limited space in the subsurface, perceived availability of supply, financial differences between tenants and homeowners, and overlooking long-term impacts are identified as injustices impacting the fair and equitable transition. Regarding recognition justice, labeling tenants to only care about money and disturbance, and not including residents in the surrounding apartment blocks are identified as injustices. Lastly, the limited involvement of those directly affected, limited share of information and an imbalance in power are identified as injustices related to procedural injustice. Furthermore, it is found that visual communication regarding the injustices was mostly related to the physical infrastructure by means of maps and photographs. <br/><br/>By identifying these injustices, a first step is made towards creating the conditions for a fair and equitable co-creation process into connecting the two building blocks in Holendrecht to a district heating grid. Furthermore, the visuals identified are able to serve as tools to communicate about the energy justice surrounding the physical infrastructure. With this, insights are given into the challenge to create a fair and equitable transition from natural gas heating towards sustainable heating within the metropolitan context of Amsterdam. <br","Energy Justice; Holendrecht; co-creation; visuals; heating grid; residual datacenter heat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","","52.305411, 4.975235"

The Dutch government wants to accomplish its ambitious initial objective of using 50% fewer primary resources by 2030. Further, by 2050, the goal is to have a waste-free economy that relies mostly on sustainable and renewable resources and reuses both products and raw materials.<br/><br/>Steel is a fundamental building component in the construction industry. However, due to changing market and industry conditions like lack of availability of raw materials for the production of virgin steel, exponential rise in prices of virgin steel and production of virgin steel being a high carbon and energy-intensive process - the use of virgin steel is becoming a not feasible option. Therefore, to meet the ambitions of the Dutch circular economy and to comply with the changing regulations like the demonstration of the Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI) as part of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the introduction of carbon taxes or EU ETS (European Union Emissions Trade System) is forcing the construction industry to limit the adoption of virgin steel. Thus, the reuse of structural steel elements is discussed highly in the building industry as an alternative. However, the reuse of steel encounters several barriers to its implementation.<br/><br/>A combination of these barriers results in a paradoxical tension during the decision-making process in the design phase of the project is that “whether is it feasible to first locate existing reclaimed/demountable materials available for reuse from the market and then design around them [Material-Driven Design] or design first with the intention of sourcing/ identifying the required materials later during the procurement phase [Form-Focused Design] ?"" The contradictory tension is called the design-acquire paradox. In this research, Biopartner 5, a project which has successfully implemented large-scale reuse of structural steel elements, is used as a case study to analyse the processes involved in adopting the reuse of steel. The successful implementation was facilitated by several favourable conditions that do not match the current market scenario and industrial conditions. Thus, the approaches adopted cannot be used unanimously for all projects that intend to consider the opportunity of reusing steel.<br/><br/>The Ambidextrous Management Approach is identified as a feasible solution to deal with paradoxical tensions. In this research, with the principles of ambidexterity, an intervention is made into the existing industrial practices adopted to develop an Ambidextrous Process Tool. The tool can be used by various parties involved in the design phase of projects which intends to reuse steel. The tool aims to improve the potential and optimise the reuse of structural steel elements in buildings by mitigating the design-acquire paradoxical tension. The process tool emphasises balancing the exploration to improve the traceability of materials available in the market and the exploitation of identified materials. Furthermore, the tool focuses on embracing the potential of both Material Driven Design and Form-Focused Design simultaneously without making a trade-off between them.<br/><br","Circular economy (CE); Reuse of structural steel; Design-Acquire Paradox; Ambidextrous Management Approach; Ambidextrous Process Tool; Material Driven Design; Form Focused Design; Biopartner 5","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The use of IVR nowadays ranges from training surgical operations in a safe environment to neurorehabilitation. IVR implementation for rehabilitation is more task-specific, enhances patients' attention during training, and provides visual feedback. Avatar, a virtual extension of the user, can be used to interact with the virtual environment and aid in postural adjustments during rehabilitation. Although IVR training of upper limbs is often seen, the research is ongoing for lower limbs. Walking activities in the real-world post-stroke are essential for active participation in the community and to reduce potential mental illness. There is ongoing research on how to implement walking activities in VR. <br/>This study aimed to explore the effect of visualizing different ground surfaces on gait patterns. <br/>Twelve healthy young participants were recruited for the experiment. Two scenes with a different ground surfaces -- ice and concrete -- were designed. A male and a female avatar were animated and implemented in the scene. The participants were asked to walk eight times in both. Trackers located at the left and right foot and pelvis were used to obtain kinematic parameters such as stride and step length and gait speed. The participants were asked to answer an embodiment questionnaire, which consisted of questions about body ownership, sense of agency, and location, after each scene. <br/>We found that the first kinematic values of stride and step lengths and gait speed were lower while walking over the virtual ice scene compared to concrete. Overall, the values of body ownership, and sense of agency were higher when compared to the control questions of body ownership and sense of agency, after each scene. The value of the sense of location after each scene was also higher. The present findings show that the participants embodied in both the scenes and the ground surface had a significant influence on their gait modification. Thus, implementing ground surfaces along with IVR in rehabilitation can benefit patients by helping them adapt their gait to the ground surface.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Changes in this significantly large sector are required to achieve the sustainability goals established by the Paris Agreement. Since most renewable energy sources produce electricity, transitioning residential heating systems might cause problems managing national electricity grids. Furthermore, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources leads to an imbalance between supply and demand.<br/><br/>These challenges can be overcome by combining different storage techniques. An example of such a technique is the thermal energy buffer developed by Borg, which focuses on single-household use. This thesis looks into the feasibility of such a system by comparing different scenarios for residential heating systems.<br/><br/>Three scenarios were modelled using Simscape. In scenario I, a natural gas boiler provided all the heating demand of the house. In scenario II, the heating system consisted of Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) panels and the thermal energy buffer. In scenario III, the house was heated by PVT panels, the thermal energy buffer, and a heat pump. In all scenarios, the same house was connected to the heating system.<br/><br/>In scenario II, the system sizes were 0, 1, 2, and 3 PVT panels, combined with buffer capacities of 0, 2, 4, and 6 m3. In scenario III, the system sizes were: 3 PVT panels with 6 m3 buffer capacity, 1 PVT panel with 4 m3 buffer capacity, and 3 PVT panels with 2 m3 buffer capacity.<br/><br/>The total yearly heat consumption of the modelled house was 5109 kWh. In scenario I, 378 kg of CO2 was emitted. In scenario II, CO\textsubscript{2} emissions were highly dependent on the sizing of the PVT system and the TESS and ranged from 20 to 405 kg, based on a heating demand of 9444 kWh.<br/><br/>Scenarios I and III maintained a comfortable temperature during the entire year. The heating system of scenario II was insufficient to heat the house throughout the year for all modelled system sizes; however, the scenario could be acceptable with larger PVT and TESS sizing. By comparing CO2 emissions and payback time, the optimal capacity of the thermal energy buffer was found to be 6 m3.<br/><br/>The uncertainty of the future gas price causes a challenge in comparing the cost of electrified heating systems to traditional heating systems. Additionally, it underlines the necessity of decarbonizing residential heating systems to secure comfortable, affordable housing.","Thermal Energy Storage; Residential buildings; Heating transition modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Keller, A.I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Bever is an outdoor chain store located in the Netherlands. Besides the Bever stores, Bever.nl was introduced in 2011, continuously growing to an extensive webshop enabling users to shop and explore online. Going to the Bever stores results in experienced staff supporting (novice) users with finding the right equipment for their activity. However, online this process is different. A user is designated to a webstore with (written) information about products. Moreover, details to express product features and performance of products can be found on a product detail page (PDP). The goal of this research is to ensure the right product in online searches at Bever.nl. Thus, the main design challenge is: “How to explain product benefits of outdoor jackets to novice users in order for them to make a more informed decision?”. <br/><br/>Discovered Insights<br/>The novice Bever user can best be described as a user who needs much guidance in the selection process because of his low level of product knowledge and context about the activity. When a novice user is in need of a product for a specific activity he enters the web store with this specific activity and product group in mind. When little or no activity related content is shown, it is unclear to a user if a product matches his specific activity since the novice user has little or no prior knowledge or experience with the specific activity and the needed product. When a novice user is searching for his specific product, communication in familiar terminology is of great importance for making an informed and considered decision. Users need to understand the questions (filters), options and product differences in order to do so. Product features do not support the novice user in understanding a product. Therefore, product benefits are of great importance because they show the value a user will gain from a product. Subsequently this results in users understanding a product by understanding the values of the different features because they interpret what the product will mean for them. <br/><br/>Design Criteria<br/>An interaction vision is created to improve the current online shopping experience of a novice user at Bever.nl. This vision focuses on the improvement of three feelings a user experiences when finding the perfect jacket: feeling in control, feeling confident and feeling surprised. This will support the user in a more goal-oriented search with control over the end result, while reading understandable and activity related information without feeling bored due to lots of non-visual long paragraphs of information. Besides the interaction vision several design requirements have been set up related to understandable explanation, activity information, visual presentation and faster exploration. <br/><br/>Concept<br/>The final concept, Bever’s Jassen Kompas, is a decision support that ensures the right product in online searches at Bever.nl. It focuses on the visual aspect of the activity of the user (within his specific context) by answering understandable activity and context related questions. Subsequently a selection of the three best and good choices are presented to the user in order to guide the decision making. <br/><br/>Recommendations<br/>Further studies could evaluate the real case usage of the Bever’s Jassen Kompas with a buying intention of users compared to fictional testing. The second recommendation would be to validate and discuss, together with experts, the questions asked in Bever’s Jassen Kompas. At last, further development and testing of the usability, back-end and mobile design of the Bever’s Jassen Kompas can be explored.<br","online shopping; outdoor; online support; decision support; experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The increase in complexity of mathematical models in an attempt to approximate reality and desire to have near real-time results have emphasized the need for fast numerical simulations. Especially in areas where classic numerical methods struggle to produce valid solutions in reasonable computational time due to their<br/>complex behaviour on multiple temporal and spatial scales, such as (cardio-vascular) fluid modelling, machine learning techniques can be of help. The aim of this study is to construct a single reduced order model, based on neural networks, for time-dependent incompressible blood flow through the aorta that can account for varying velocity inlet conditions, material parameters and geometries (computational domains). The objectives are to minimize the reduction of accuracy of simulated time series with OpenFoam, and to obtain speedup compared to the OpenFoam simulations.<br/><br/>In this study, aortic blood flow during one heartbeat is modelled by Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible, Newtonian fluids. Data for training and testing the neural networks was generated using the finite volume method. The network architecture consists of a convolutional encoder and decoder model for dimensionality reduction, with an additional neural network for time evolution inserted between the encoder and decoder. The network takes one time step as input and predicts five consecutive time steps ahead. Three different networks for time evolution were tested. The best performing network was tested on increasingly complex computational domains. Thereafter, the network’s ability to generalize to varying inlet velocity patterns and new variations of the computational domain was tested, for which the network for time evolution was adapted to take into account varying inlet velocity patterns. The performance of the networks was evaluated on predicting one to five time steps ahead from one input time step, and using the prediction of one time step ahead recursively to obtain the prediction of one entire heartbeat.<br/><br/>The best performing architecture found was an encoder, recurrent neural network with long-short term memory units for time evolution, decoder model combination. The generalizability for the tested material parameter, blood viscosity, while keeping the inlet velocity pattern fixed, appeared quite good. A relative mean absolute error (MAE) of around 10% was obtained for straight, bent and bifurcated channel geometries. When testing the network on varying inlet velocity patterns, the relative MAE in the domain increased considerably to<br/>around 25%. In general, the relative errors were significantly higher in comparison to the absolute errors, and mainly increased by low velocity parts of the domain and time series. In addition, the full height of the velocity peak was not always captured and a spike in the domain MAE was seen for rapidly decreasing inlet velocities. Also, the network was unable generalize to new geometries. <br/><br/>Various attempts to improve the accuracy, including altering the loss function and augmenting the data, were not successful. However, many choices of data augmentations, normalization techniques and loss functions were not tested and could improve the performance. The generalizability to different computational<br/>domains could be improved by adding more geometries and more variation to the geometries in the data. Nonetheless, the prediction of one heartbeat was obtained in approximately 20s, which is equivalent to an achieved speedup of around 20 compared to OpenFoam simulations. In conclusion, this research should be seen as a basis for time-dependent blood flow predictions in the aorta, from which a multitude of different paths can be explored.","Machine learning; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); cardiovascular modeling; Time Series Forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

Furthermore, acknowledging the that the private launch markets is increasingly dominated by partly reusable TSTOs. This thesis aims to evaluate whether next generation rocket engines make an SSTO viable within a foreseeable economical time frame, for the increasingly privatised space industry. From the market analysis it follows that the VT SSTO RLV developed by the private launch industry, with a payload capability of 15- 20 tons to a LEO with an altitude of 200-400 km, is most likely. The evaluation is performed by a two level trade-off. Initially, a literature trade-off is preformed on elaborate range of potential next generation rocket engine, which are subdivided into pure rocket engine and breathing engine. All engines are evaluated on the market requirements, performance, and achievability. Only three engine types are selected. Upon evaluating the propulsion literature it was noticed that no literature cross evaluated advanced propulsion systems with high performance propellant pallets. Therefore, a literature propellant trade-off is performed. For the aerospike, the pulse detonation engine and the precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engine with the propellant pallets H2/O2, CH4/O2, C2H2/O2, and C2H4/O2 a performance analysis is performed. The performance analysis is done by both optimising the engine configurations and the ascent trajectory for a 15 ton payload delivery to an orbit of 400 km altitude. To simulate each engine, three performance analysis are developed, which are all derived from the continuity equations to ensure a consistent comparison. The aerospike is simulated as a continuous optimal convectional via the frozen equilibrium method, although it is found an alternation is needed to account for directional losses. The open-end of the PDE is simulated via a CJ-detonation wave followed by an exponential decaying blowdown phase. The DC nozzle expansion is iteratively simulated via the frozen equilibrium method. The intake and HPC of the precooled hyrbid airbreathing engine is simulated with convectional aero engine performance analysis, while the precooler is simulated ass a counter-flow heat exchanger. The CC and CD nozzle are simulated via the frozen equilibrium method. From the optimised trajectory the representative performance of each engine is extracted and five engine configurations are identified as viable VT SSTO RLV engines. These are the H2/O2 powered aerospike, the pulse detonation engine and the precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engine operating on an H2/O2 pallet, and the C2H2/O2 powered aerospike and pulse detonation engine. The H2/O2 powered PDE is found to be the most promising, as it offers the best performance gain relative to its achievability. Therefore, it advocates that future VT SSTO RLV research utilises the H2/O2 powered pulse detonation engine as the main propulsion system","Single-stage to orbit; Reusable Launch Vehicle; Aerospike; Pulse detonation engine; Precooled hybrid airbreathing rocket engine; literature trade-off; performance trade-off; Market research; Next generation rocket engines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Energy storage solutions overcome this hurdle, and lithium-ion batteries are at the forefront of this. The need for lithium-ion battery degradation studies arises due to the ever increasing use of these batteries in a wide variety of applications.<br/><br/>There exist a large number of empirical and semi-empirical battery degradation models in literature, however their usage with irregular, real world profiles has not been explored. Moreover, understanding where different models can be used and comparing these models is also an area that has not been looked at.<br/><br/>A real world power profile was created in MATLAB based on the WLTP drive cycle. Simultaneously, each model considered was verified against the experimental data for that same model to make sure model predicted degradation values matched the experimental observations. In three models, the verification procedure revealed errors and inaccuracies that were corrected. Implementing an irregular<br/>power profile posed two challenges, first, the stress factors of time and throughput required linearized versions of the model equations to be properly accounted for. Second, the identification of cycles in the irregular power profile is usually done using the rainflow counting algorithm, however, an alternative method is proposed in this study.<br/><br/>The real world power profile was applied to each calendar and cyclic ageing model and it was noted that although the power profile was equalized for each cell based on the model in question, the results were widely differing. In some cases, it was possible to explain the differences but in some cases the differences were not easily explained. Apart from the comparison, each model was individually analyzed to understand how degradation phenomena and stress factors affect the accuracy and use case of a model.<br/><br/>Finally, a toolbox was built in MATLAB to summarize the findings of this study, to help users understand where each model studied is likely to be accurate and useful. It was concluded that empirical and semi-empirical models are highly dependent on the testing conditions of the experimental data they<br/>are built on, and there are extremely limited scenarios in which these models are applicable outside these conditions. Moreover, accelerated testing conditions which are often used in the experimental phase usually cover different degradation phenomena than those which occur under regular use cases.<br/>With respect to the application of irregular (real-world) power profiles to these models, this study details a unique method used to obtain accurate predictions.","lithium-ion battery; battery degradation; Empirical models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

We irradiated zebrafish embryos (4 days past fertilisation) with 116 MeV protons. The aim was (1) to measure the effect, and (2) if the effect were significant, see whether it depended on the oxygen concentration in the tissue, as the oxygen depletion hypothesis (a popular theory on the underlying mechanics of the FLASH effect) predicts. We irradiated embryos with either FLASH or CONV, where a possible FLASH effect would reduce toxicity of the FLASH radiation. We did the same for zebrafish which were deliberately put in a hypoxic condition prior to irradiation. In that case, the depletion hypothesis would predict that the difference between FLASH and CONV disappears. Our biomarkers for radiobiological damage were the survival rate and γ­H2AX foci formation. In our experimental conditions, the radiation effect on the survival rate was<br/>eclipsed by other factors which could not be isolated. We did confirm the possibility of using γ­H2AX foci formation as a marker for radiobiological damage in full­body irradiated zebrafish embryos. There were individual samples that showed clear and localised specific γ­H2AX signal, but these were too<br/>scarce and the signal was too inconsistent across samples to gather meaningful statistics. This was most often caused by limited antibody penetration in the embryo. We were therefore unable to draw conclusions about the FLASH effect. Better and more consistent antibody penetration, e.g. by longer digestion in collagenase before antibody staining, could change this in the future. We further custom­built and validated a hypoxic aquarium to produce hypoxic zebrafish tissue, as well as a computational model of the irradiation setup to simulate the dose distribution in the zebrafish container. We found the dose distribution to be sufficiently homogeneous for our experiment, at least 91.47% uniform for CONV and 90.72% uniform for FLASH.","FLASH proton therapy; FLASH; FLASH radiotherapy; Zebrafish; Proton Beam Irradiation; Proton therapy; TOPAS; Dosimetry; Radiotherapy; Cancer; Health; Hypoxia; Oxygenation; Oxygen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Allseas investigates the possibility to enter the offshore wind turbine installation industry with Pioneering Spirit.<br/>For Allseas’ preliminary wind turbine installation design, wind turbines are assembled offshore, requiring wind turbine components to be brought from shore to Pioneering Spirit by means of a cargo barge. This operation requires a proper mooring procedure of which the mooring system is an essential part. The mooring system secures the barge alongside Pioneering Spirit where it has to stay for multiple days. <br/><br/>In this research a pre-defined vessel orientation is analysed where the barge stern is extended 40m in longitudinal direction from Pioneering Spirit stern, to increase the barge area reachable by the unloading crane. <br/>This barge position is challenging due to limited shielding from Pioneering Spirit, leading to excessive environmental loads acting on the barge. Due to the barge extension, also properly connecting the mooring system to Pioneering Spirit is a challenge.<br/>The above leads to the main objective of this thesis: improve the mooring system to secure a barge alongside Pioneering Spirit in offshore conditions, including an evaluation of the dynamic mooring loads.<br/><br/>The main mooring system design requirements are that the system Safe Working Load and motion limits are not exceeded. <br/>Evaluation of the mooring systems starts with a multi-body diffraction analysis with hydrodynamic matrices and other hydrodynamic properties as output. This data is imported in a time domain model which enables capturing non-linearities, e.g. the mooring system and wind and current loads. Validation and verification steps are required to assure realistic outcome and understanding limitations of the numerical models.<br/><br/>Before new mooring systems are introduced, a base case mooring system is defined and modelled in the time domain.<br/>Finding the limiting sea state for which the Safe Working Load limit is reached enables to compute the workability for the reference location defined. Two reference locations are considered: a wind sea area and swell sea area. Wind and current speed is assumed to be constant over time and independent of elevation. Workability is defined as the percentage of time the mooring system is able to operate.<br/><br/>Evaluating the base case mooring system shows performance of 67% workability for wind sea areas and 16% for swell areas. Next to the base case, four mooring improvement concepts are evaluated from which the Cavotec Moormaster® system shows most promising results. This system consists of three main components: ‘fixed structure - hydraulic cylinder - vacuum pad’ (Figure 2) that connects the barge to Pioneering Spirit. This system is modelled as a link with constant stiffness and damping properties within its operational limitations.<br/><br/>The Moormaster system, shows perspective to improve the workability for both wind and swell seas. Besides workability, the Moormaster system improves the entire mooring procedure by quick connection and safe disconnection upon exceeding operational limits.<br","Side-to-side mooring; Pioneering Spirit; Diffraction analysis; Time domain modelling; Cavotec MoorMaster","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-26","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This research investigated the development between 1965 and 2021 of the beaches and dunes of the Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier (HHNK) area which stretches from IJmuiden to northern Texel. This research used an advanced data analysis on the annual coastal elevation data. The coastline of the HHNK area is maintained by several different measures including nourishments, planting and removal of grass, placing reed fences and building regulations. The aim of this research was to relate the investigated developments of the beaches and dunes to these measures and natural processes.<br/>A literature study was performed first, to get acquainted with the research area and the processes that drive the beach and dune development in the area. In four phases, the developments and their relationships with the drivers were investigated for several subsections of the research area that showed similar behaviour. In phase 1, the coastal profile data was collected for multiple transects spanning the research area. Characteristic parameters describing features of the dune and beach were derived from the coastal profile data. In phase 2, the collected profile data was decomposed into spatial and temporal patterns by a principal component analysis. In phase 3, the transects of the research area were categorised on the temporal development of their coastal profile using the results of the spatial and temporal decomposition. This created subsections of the coast that showed a similar morphological behaviour. In phase 4, the morphological behaviour of several subsections was investigated and related to the natural and human drivers. The relationships between the drivers and the developments were investigated for several subsections, varying in morphological behaviour and drivers, to gain insight into these relationships for the entire research area.<br/>The coastal categorisation resulted in 36 subsections which were mainly continuous in space with the exception of four clusters. Seven subsections were studied in more detail, by investigating the development of several characteristic parameters derived from the coastal profiles, like dune volume, beach slope and shoreline location among others. The shoreline location and beach width showed a strong correlation with the nourishments. The beach slope and width were expected to influence the dune volume changes, which was not supported by the results. The beach width is assumed to be larger than the critical fetch length and the variations in beach slope had a marginal effect on the transport capacity. The presence of beach pavilions limited the dune growth in both height and volume, but regularly moving the pavilions did allow for a seaward migration of the dune front. The effect of small beach houses on the dune volume change was found negligible. Maintenance works of HHNK influenced the dune development locally. The placement of reed fences caused seaward migration of the dune front and the creation of blow-outs increased the dune volume behind the most seaward dune. The strongest dune volume increase was found at coastal areas behind shoals that reduced the incoming wave energy.<br/>The coastal categorisation succeeded in grouping transects with a similar development of their modified coastal profiles. Several modifications were proposed to improve the categorisation of the original profiles and to take into account smaller scale processes. Nourishment was distinguished as most important driver for the development of the coastal area, which has maintained the shoreline location and caused a trend break in several other characteristic parameters. Human influences like buildings, coastal structures and reed fences have a strong local effect on the development of the beaches and dunes. Further research could take into account wave and wind climate, water level variations and grain size quantitatively to get a more comprehensive study of the relationships between the development and the drivers.","JarKus; Coastal development; Dune; Beach; Clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Krijthe, J.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nowadays, software is an integral part of many companies. However, the codebase can grow large and complicated and is often insufficiently documented. To gain insight, tools have been made to infer state machines and process models from software logs. These tools produce different types of models such as automata and Petri nets. The main objective of this research is to determine which tool is the optimal choice for inferring a readable and correct model within reasonable time. Currently, Petri nets and automata are not compared to each other and not all key performance indicators are applicable to both model types. To compare these different concepts, suitable metrics must be identified.<br/><br/>For this work, 8 configurations of 4 programs will be compared. Finite State Machines (FSMs) will be inferred with FlexFringe (AIC), MINT and PRINS (using MINT internally). Petri nets will be mined with ProM using the Inductive Miner, Inductive Miner Infrequent - All Operators, Hybrid-ILP and the Directly Follows miner. The configurations will use 5-folds cross validation to infer models on 9 software logs. Negative traces were synthesised as they were not available. The quality of the models will be measured though inference time, complexity, F2-score, balanced accuracy, fitness and perplexity.<br/><br/>Some of the used metrics were adequate, but others were not suitable. Inference time, F2-score, balanced accuracy could be measured for both FSMs and Petri nets. The complexity was measured with the Petri net $eCFC$ metric and the Cyclomatic complexity CC. The eCFC does not properly express complexity on FSMs. Furthermore, Petri nets can model parallelism, which introduces extra complexity compared to an FSM. This was not adequately expressed by either of these metrics. To measure fitness, both token-based replay and alignment fitness were used. FSMs were converted to Petri nets. Token-based replay (TBR) fitness was not an expressive metric for the FSMs, as the concept of tokens did not carry over well. In addition to this, the external implementation of TBR fitness was flawed for the specific structure of the converted FSMs. Alignment-based fitness is the superior fitness metric as it does not rely on the notion of tokens, which the FSMs do not have. Unfortunately, the time and memory needed for alignment computations was too large for some models. Lastly, the perplexity FSM metric was successfully adapted for Petri nets. It expresses the difference in structure and could be tailored even further for the purposes of comparison by adjusting its parameters.<br/><br/>The results of the comparison showed that almost all configurations could complete inference in feasible time and memory. The time out was set at 4 hours and the available memory was \texttt{16GB}. The MINT and PRINS ran out of memory on one of the larger logs and timed out for one other set. Hybrid-ILP timed out for 2 sets. All other configurations completed inference for all data sets in under 40 seconds. PRINS and MINT boasted excellent performance across all correctness metrics, and were only outperformed by FlexFringe and the Directly Follows miner on perplexity. PRINS and MINT were most suitable for modelling traces of data sets with a low trace similarity and generalising to identify new traces. However, MINT models were a lot larger than those of any other configurations and PRINS models are generally many times larger than MINT models. So, if complexity of models is a big concern, FlexFringe and the Directly Follows miner offer the smaller models, at the cost of a small amount of performance for most sets. However, these two tools perform poorly on sets that are both incomplete and contain dissimilar traces. If time is of the essence, one should use FlexFringe, the Directly Follows miner of one of the Inductive Miners. The Petri net miners used, were not designed to introduce new behaviour in a model. Therefore, FlexFringe is preferable for modelling an incomplete log.","Process Mining; Inference; FlexFringe; PRoM; MINT; PRINS; FSM; Petri Nets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The convenience of carrying, the diversity of interaction and the convenience of resource acquisition provided by e-reading make e-reading more and more popular. However, there is still a lot of room for exploration in this field based on the more reading experience brought to readers by electronic screens, and it is also the direction that more laboratories and companies want to develop. There are many interactions and feedback that cannot be achieved in physical reading, such as how to make readers immerse themselves in the scene and truly feel the objects in the book; the reader establishes an emotional connection with the objects described in the book through touch and generates emotional resonance; or through touch senses attract readers' attention, enhance their reading concentration, etc. And these can be achieved through e-reading. <br/><br/>Furthermore, in the process of reading, because the reading medium is mostly limited by paper books, most people memorize the contents of a book by vision, except for some auxiliary tools, such as bookmarks or dog-earing pages. But with the development of e-reading, readers can have more forms of interaction with e-books, not limited to visuals; at the same time, e-books can also provide more feedback modes. So, will this multi-sensory reading mode provide new opportunities for people's long-term memory of reading content?<br/><br/>This graduate project explores how to improve the readers' e-reading experience and the long-term memory of the content through haptic technology. I gained more relevant information through literature reviews on topics such as haptic exploration and reading comparisons of print and e-books, as well as research with target users. The target group was identified as 20-30 year olds who are familiar with and own electronic reading devices. In order to achieve the design goal, an interaction vision with three qualities of immersed, focused and playful is proposed.<br/><br/>Based on the insights gleaned from the research phase, I designed 5 initial prototypes and tested them with 11 participants. After this, test results are collected and analyzed for a second iteration, resulting in an integrated prototype. Then, the test was conducted again with 3 participants, and the test results were collected and analyzed, resulting in a third prototype. Finally, I tested the third prototype again with 6 testers and finally got the final design. A total of three test evaluations and prototype iterations are used to continuously refine the design prototype to improve its usability and functionality.<br/><br/>The final design of this project is a mobile-based e-reading application. It can transmit the emotional changes of characters in the story through vibration, thus bringing users a more immersive, focused and playful reading experience.","Haptic; Vibration; E-reading; Reading experience; UI Design; Cognition; multisensory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); van Deursen, A. (graduation committee); Dumančić, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this thesis, we have defined a symbolic execution technique to automatically generate test suites for programs written in functional programming languages that can find the behavioural differences between a reference implementation and a set of potentially different implementations. Our symbolic execution technique uses a constraint solver in order to find a model that satisfies all constraints that together represent an execution path through the program. Furthermore, our technique utilises manually defined budget constraints to guide the symbolic execution to more interesting areas of the programs. These budget constraints define an initial budget that dictates when the symbolic execution terminates, and a set of costs associated to certain operations such as calling (specific) functions or performing (specific) pattern matches. This allows the symbolic execution to deplete budgets faster when it explores functions or branches of a program that are deemed ""unlikely to be interesting"". This results in less system resources being used on exploring these uninteresting execution paths, and instead allows for exploration of deeper paths in more interesting areas of the programs. Our budget constraint optimisation strategy works alongside other well-known optimisation strategies for symbolic execution such as early branch pruning and reusing intermediate results, more commonly known in the field of symbolic execution as compositioning.<br/><br/>In order to perform our symbolic execution on functional programs, we have defined a variation of Control Flow Graphs (CFG) for functional programming languages which allow modelling the execution flow between the different expressions that form the body of functions in functional programming. Additionally, our technique uses a constraint solver in order to find what paths through the program are feasible and to generate inputs that will lead to the execution of said paths. To allow us to specify these constraints on a higher-level, we have defined an intermediate Domain Specific Language (DSL), which can be transformed into a lower-level language understood by the constraint solver. We refer to this DSL as our Intermediate Constraint Language (ICL). Our ICL supports working seamlessly with type systems that allow inheritance, rather than only supporting Algebraic Data Types (ADT).<br/><br/>Furthermore, we have developed a symbolic execution engine for programs written in a pure and functional subset of the Scala programming language. This symbolic execution engine implements our proposed symbolic execution technique alongside the other described optimisation techniques. We have used this implementation in order to measure the effectiveness of our symbolic execution technique. In order to do this, we have used our technique in a scenario to automatically generate test suites for real student submissions of introductory assignments to functional programming. We have performed a comparison between the obtained branch coverages and mutation scores with our technique and the manually written test suites that have been used for multiple years. Finally, we have reflected on the feasibility of using this approach in practice by looking at the execution time and the number of inquiries to the constraint solver, required to generate test suites that are able to find an adequate number of errors.","symbolic execution; test suite generation; automated grading; functional programming; compositional symbolic execution; budgeted symbolic execution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This study focuses on cabin cleaning optimization at international airports in collaboration with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Field observation was done at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to construct a practical insight into the process. Then, an agent-based social simulation is proposed to represent a cleaning process. The model is based on a KLM Boeing 777-300 with two seating configurations. Several simulation settings were tested to search for an optimal cleaning strategy. One of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) is the completion or lead time of the overall cabin cleaning process. The simulation result suggested that the optimal number of cleaners is ten for a lead time of approximately 44 minutes. Potential improvements and model extensions such as additional blanket bags and the effect of agent distribution inside the cabin were investigated too. It was shown that with the proposed strategy and resources, it is possible to reduce the cleaning lead time by up to five minutes.","Aircraft Turnaround; Cabin Cleaning; Optimization; ant colony optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This brings a lot of possibilities. As a matter of fact, an automated system is – unlike the human brain – not dependent on food nor sleep and less prone to errors. The efficiencies that could be gained by ‘working’ 24 hours, 7 days a week without a single moment of pause is enormous. An Artificial Intelligence system (hereinafter: AI system) could provide a relief for many sectors. In the literature, the application for an AI system within the judicial system has been advocated for. Nevertheless, the judicial system, especially regarding the rights of a suspect, needs many more considerations than the workload-relief argument alone. In this thesis, the possible implementation of AI – or a robot judge – within the Dutch judicial system will be explored. In this research, a special focus will be given to the rights of a suspect as set out in article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (hereinafter: ECHR). Article 6 ECHR provides the right of a fair trial to a suspect, where relevant, with the following provision: “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law”. From clause 1 of article 6 ECHR, the following components can be extracted: a fair, independent and impartial tribunal. Implicitly, article 6 ECHR also provides the right to an explanation on how this tribunal reached to its verdict. In practice, this is also referred to as the right to transparent verdicts. With the use of the research question “to what extent can Artificial Intelligence be used in the Dutch courtroom while still maintaining the rights for the parties involved, especially as how has been set out in article 6 ECHR?”, an answer is formulated on the question whether the Dutch judicial system is ready for – and capable of – the next judge: a robot judge. This research uses a systematic literature review as a starting point. With such review, information is gathered from both technical as well as legal point of views to answer each sub-question individually. This research also specifically looks at the way other countries have implemented or created a form of an AI tool in and as court. Next to this, four interviews have been held with potential stakeholders as well as persons of interest. The reason why these interviews are held is to confirm and check what has been found from the literature assessment as well as to gain new (internal) insights on this topic. As an answer to this research question, an AI system can be implemented in the Dutch courtroom if it consists of two (main) components: a linguistic system and a machine learning system. Additional rules to use this robot judge are proposed as well, for example that continuous feedback-loops (of the probabilities for example) should be built in and that the system should be continuously monitored (and adjusted) for potential biases. The robot judge can both function as and in court. Additionally, a robot judge can sit at the table of the Dutch Council for the Judiciary and their ambitions to (further) litigate digitally and publish more, if not all, cases online.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The focus in this thesis is on pure metal oxide nanoparticles without any addition of dopants or decorations. Devices are fabricated with different interdigitated electrode dimensions. The effect of electrode width and gap size on the gas response is studied by comparing the sensing performance of the devices. In this work, a very high sensitivity of 1300% is achieved towards 35% relative humidity using a 1x1 mm device with SnO2 nanoparticles. Towards 20 ppm of ethanol, sensitivities of 39% and 67% are achieved using 1x1 mm and 4x1 mm devices with SnO2 nanoparticles respectively, which implies that spark ablated nanoparticles could be a viable alternative to particles generated using other methods. The full recovery time after gas exposure seems to be very long and takes around an hour for some devices at 200 °C. Possible solutions for this are setting a higher temperature (not possible with the used setup), or reducing the particle size (∼20 nm in this study). The electrode finger widths and gap sizes are varied between 2-15 μm for each device. However, no correlation is found between electrode geometry and gas response within this range, suggesting that differences in gas response between devices likely stem from nanoparticle layer quality differences.","nanoparticles; gas sensor; Spark Ablation; chemiresistor; chemFET; SnO2; ZnO; CuO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contemporary models exploit this and can predict what the frequencies are of CRISPR outcomes at predetermined genomic loci.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This work presents a low-noise amplifier (LNA) for miniature 3D ultrasound probes. Time gain compensation (TGC) is required to provide continuously variable gain and compensate for the attenuated echo signal, resulting in decreased output dynamic range (DR). As TGC is embedded in the LNA, a power-hungry LNA is no longer needed to handle the full dynamic range of attenuated echo signals. Compared to the prior art where TGC is applied after the LNA, this structure reduces die area and power consumption greatly. <br/><br/>The LNA with built-in TGC functionality is comprised of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with an exponentially increasing feedback resistive network. Since a transducer with a relatively high impedance is targeted, a TIA is utilized to interface with the transducer and sense the signal current. TGC is implemented in a continuous fashion by tunable resistors so as to alleviate imaging artifacts associated with gain-switching moments. The resistive feedback network is achieved by triode transistors with exponentially decreasing gate voltages. Three parallel branches of triode transistors are varied simultaneously to obtain a 40dB gain range. Each branch consists of two back-to-back triodes to mitigate non-linearity related to the body effect.<br/><br/><br/>The variable-gain loop amplifier employing a current-reuse topology enables constant closed-loop bandwidth in an energy-efficient way. The first stage is a fixed-gain stage with dynamic biasing to save power at the lowest gain setting. The next two stages are variable-gain stages with variable resistive loads. The load resistor is implemented in the same fashion as the TIA's feedback resistor to achieve intrinsic gain matching. The last stage is a buffer to provide low output impedance for stability. <br/><br/>The LNA has been designed in 0.18 $\mu m$ CMOS technology and occupies an estimated die area of 0.0339 $mm^2$. The effective gain range is 40 dB with $\pm 1$ dB gain error. The LNA's noise floor at the highest gain is below 1.15 $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$ and its harmonic distortion is better than -40 dB. During 100 $\mu$s receive period, the total power consumption is 6 mW from a $\pm0.9$ V supply. The LNA featuring a small area and high power efficiency is a promising circuit for miniature 3D ultrasound probes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Our aim is to build a model that can successfully classify new unseen road vehicles as ‘relevant unknowns’, while also successfully classifying harmless unknown birds that are not part of the training set, as ‘irrelevant unknowns’. On the DomainNet data-set, we demonstrate that our novel method can very accurately determine the relevance of unknown classes at test time for both low and high-dimensional data, with AUC scores ranging from 0.99 to a perfect 1.00.","Deep Learning; Machine learning; Computer Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

These system use neural signals arising from covert speech and translate them into text or synthesised speech. Covert speech is imagining to speak without moving any of the articulators and therefore does not rely on actual motor activity. As recognizing covert speech from neural signals is extremely challenging, machine learning algorithms are deployed. To make use of the full potential of machine learning approaches in the field of decoding covert speech and to accommodate real-world deployment of a BCI, a large number of training samples is required to train the networks.<br/>In this study, a novel database is presented containing EEG and audio data from 20 subjects recorded during the covert and overt pronunciation of 15 Dutch prompts. To validate the recorded data, two speaker-independent classification tasks were performed using a ResNet-50 algorithm as classifier with spatial-spectral-temporal features extracted from the EEG signals. The speaker-independent three-class classification of pre-stimulus (rest) trials versus covert speech trials versus overt speech trials obtained an average accuracy of 70.6% and the speaker-independent five-class classification of five covert vowels (“aa”, “ee”, “oo”, “ie”, “oe”) obtained an average accuracy of 19.6%. Even though the five-class classification task did not reach an above chance level accuracy, the high performance reached by the three-class classification task provides support of the existence of discriminative information in the covert speech segments to decode covert speech in the future.<br/>Future research should focus on EMG artifact detection and on determining the performance per subject to improve the dataset. Furthermore, subject normalisation strategies should be investigated to address the challenges of subject-independent covert speech decoding.","Covert speech; ResNet; Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain-computer interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The Lunar Zebro is such a hexapod robot that has been developed to be the lightest and smallest rover to explore the moon. The purpose of the Lunar Zebro is to navigate the surface of the moon where it will encounter difficult terrains such as regolith (Lunar Soil) and rocks. To date, not much focus has been placed on the design of the Lunar Zebro legs to increase the rover’s trafficability on these terrains. Furthermore, the designs of rover wheels are constantly changing, and new lessons are being learnt from each new mission that the guidelines for designing the wheels and legs of rovers are constantly evolving. Using a Biomimicry design framework, the legs of the Lunar Zebro were redesigned using strategies adopted by animals in nature to improve the trafficability of the legs on granular and rocky terrains. Several concepts were created and narrowed down to four final designs (Hair, Web, Paddle and Claw Legs) that were further developed and manufactured. In addition to this, the original leg design and a flat leg with no grousers were developed for testing.<br/><br/>Several different single-leg tests were performed on the legs to measure their sinkage, thrust, rolling resistance and drawbar pull on regolith and rocky surfaces. The results showed that hair has the potential to reduce sinkage on regolith. However, the results from the single-leg tests on regolith also indicated that there is not much difference in the drawbar pull performance of the different legs no matter what features were included on the bottom of the leg or if the leg had grousers or not. In contrast, the results of the experiments performed on rocky surfaces showed that legs with claw-like grousers performed the best.<br/><br/>From there a hybrid leg was designed using the finding of the single-leg tests and this leg was tested on a basic Lunar Zebro prototype against the original Lunar Zebro leg design to determine if the hybrid improves the trafficability of the rover on both regolith and rocky terrains. These tests included testing the drawbar pull of the rover at 100 % slip and measuring the distance travelled by the rover over five steps. The results showed that on regolith terrain, the design of the leg does not have a big impact on the performance of the rover. However, the results showed that on rocky terrain the rover with hybrid legs travelled roughly 10 % further over five steps and had a drawbar pull roughly 10 % larger than the rover with original legs.","Mobile Robots; C-legged hexapod; Moon Rover; Biomimicry; Grouser; Leg Design; Traction; Regolith; Lunar Zebro","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Aviation is an important sector and one of the key contributors to today’s economy. With a forecasted annual growth rate of 4.4%, the sector is expected to expand even more in the coming years. This expansion is however followed by the environmental burdens aviation causes to the environment. Following the anticipated growth of the aviation industry, action to avoid the same trend in emissions is critical. Following the recent introduction of circularity in inflight services airlines are taking measures often labeled as sustainable, seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint. It is important to evaluate whether these measures improve the environmental performance of inflight services or not. To achieve that, the cradle-to-grave approach of the Life Cycle Assessment<br/>(LCA) method is recommended. Furthermore, there is little to no research on quantifying the overall climate impact of inflight services. This thesis is therefore aiming to fill this research gap by conducting an LCA on inflight services offered to passengers and the research question is formed as: “How do inflight services, and measures intending to reduce their climate impact, perform in terms of<br/>carbon footprint and to what extent do they enable sustainability?”. Two baseline cases were evaluated to answer the research question, a short-haul, and a long-haul flight, representing conventional inflight service practices. For each case, five scenarios were constructed based on measures aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of inflight services, namely single-use plastic reduction, food waste reduction, lightweight materials introduction, carbon offsetting, and a combination of all the measures. The analysis aimed to quantify the impact<br/>of inflight services, in terms of contribution to climate change, and compare the applied measures to the baseline cases, assessing whether they enable sustainability or not. Overall, the study can conclude that the evaluated inflight service measure scenarios performed better than the business-as-usual inflight service practices. The total carbon footprint of inflight services per passenger on a short-haul flight was calculated as 10.9 kg CO2-Eq and on a long-haul flight as 50.2 kg CO2-Eq. The combined measures carbon footprint reduction potential could reach the impressive 96% for a long-haul flight and 89% for a short-haul flight reduction. Most of this reduction is mainly attributed to carbon offsetting, 82% for the long-haul flight and 69% for the short-haul flight. The second best-performing scenario was the lightweight materials measure which could reduce carbon footprint by 13% and 19% for the long-haul and the short-haul flight respectively. Single-use plastic and food waste reduction measures did not exceed a 0.4% reduction of the impact. Although carbon emissions of inflight services entail a small fracture of the overall aviation carbon footprint, the studied measures can contribute to notable environmental impact reductions with immediate results.","Life Cycle Assessment; Aviaton; Carbon footprint; Inflight services; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Bunches of bananas are difficult to grasp by a mechanical gripper, as they vary in size and shape and are sensitive to damage caused by mechanical impact. In former research, single bananas have been grasped with pinching- or granular grippers. The gripper proposed in this paper grasps the bunch at its most sturdy part, namely its tip, and uses a hook finger to minimize the chances on damage. The scissoring fingers allow the gripper to handle the variability of the object. Additionally, the scissoring combined with the funnel shaped finger tips ensure that the gripper compensates the position errors of robotic systems. In the evaluation of its abilities the gripper is able to pick up 19 out of 19 bunches of bananas. It has a tolerance for a maximum positioning error of 4.9 cm and causes only minor damage on the peduncles of the bananas. In practical experiments, the gripper performed adequately and showed to be able to cooperate with the object to guide itself to the right location. The novel strategies of hook gripping and the extra degree of freedom of the compliant X-joint show that bunches of bananas can be grasped mechanically, while compensating for some of the shortcomings of current robotic systems.","Gripper; Bananas; Grasping; Agri-food; End-effector; Fruits","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Fundamental knowledge about the interactions between adjacent plies is needed to enhance predictive quality. Several mechanisms can be distinguished during hot press forming of composites. This thesis focuses on the inter-ply friction behaviour which is the resistance against inter-ply slip. The main variable investigated in this study is temperature.<br/><br/>In this research, an extensive friction characterization with UD C/LM-PAEK is conducted at temperatures ranging from 300 to 365 ◦C. The neat matrix material has been studied with DSC and rheometry experiments. In general, a peak response can be seen during start-up in a friction characterization experiment. This peak, or overshoot, progresses towards a steady state friction response after a slip distance of several mm. Reducing the temperature showed similar effects to increasing the sliding velocity in a ply-ply slip system. The peak during start-up increases in magnitude while the steady state response remains approximately constant. Indications of flow induced crystallisation have been observed during friction characterization around the melting point of the material. The timetemperature-superposition principle has been applied to experimental friction data. This enabled to predict the duration of the transition of peak friction response towards a steady state. Several modelling efforts have been compared to the experimental data. The accuracy of the model predictions is similar between 315 and 365 ◦C. Influences of flow induced crystallisation impede the reliability of the specific models around and below the melting point.<br/><br/>The research lead to useful insights in the friction behaviour at relatively low temperatures. Further research is required on the field of flow induced crystallisation for a better understanding of its role in the friction response. Further study with other materials is needed to validate the application of the time-temperature-superposition principle to predict the speed of the transition of peak friction response towards steady state.<br","friction; hot press forming; thermoplastic composites; temperature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-01","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

However, during the same period, the aviation market has tripled the number of flights per year with a consequent and direct increase in the emissions of greenhouse gasses. To fight against climate change due to the global rise in temperature, international policies are pushing towards a greener future for our society, setting specific objectives for reducing emissions, including aviation ones. In order to achieve the critical goal of climate neutrality by 2050, as stated by the European Green Deal [2], and since the number of total flights is valued will double by that year; significant development steps have to be taken in the aviation industry that has to become greener. The best way to decrease aircraft emissions is to increase its aerodynamic efficiency, so increasing the wingspan of the wing in order to reduce the lift-induced drag. Unfortunately, this has two main problems, the increased total structural weight (that will therefore reduce the payload leading to an increase in the number of flights) and the limited wingspan due to existing airport gate requirements. These issues can be solved using a Hinged Folding Wingtip (HFW) that allows an aerodynamic efficient enormous wingspan during flight operations but will fold on the ground enabling the usage of existing gates. Furthermore, the hinge mechanism improves load alleviation capabilities, particularly during gusts, consequently reducing the bending moment transferred at the root of the wing, allowing beneficial lighter structure. This thesis study focused on a precise aeroelastic characterisation (both aerodynamic and structural) of the hinged folding wingtip device using the instantaneous, non-intrusive and whole-field, large-scale Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, with the state-of-the-art Shake-The-Box (STB) Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) algorithm in combination with Helium-Filled Soap Bubbles (HFSB) flow tracers and fiducial markers painted on the wing model. This new technique permits the avoidance of intrusive, conventional sensors used for aeroelastic evaluations, like strain gauges, piezoelectric accelerometers, potentiometers, and load cells that alter the structural properties of the tested object but also Pitot tubes that alter the flow behaviour. Furthermore, only pointwise measurements are possible with these devices. Through a wind tunnel campaign at the W-tunnel facility at TU Delft, using a hinged folding wingtip model in both steady and unsteady conditions, it was shown that the implementation of this device shows very promising potential. Not only from an aerodynamic efficiency (due to the increased wingspan) and energy consumption efficiency (due to lower structural weight) points of view but more significantly in the gust alleviation capacities, indeed the peak load and the corresponding root bending moment can be reduced significantly applying a correct timing on the hinge release.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Specifically, motion planning and control solutions are being developed based on the combination of Artificial Potential Functions (APF) with economic Model Predictive Control (eMPC).

Although preliminary research shows promising results, a performance analysis of this approach, both for AV and CAV, has not yet been published. Therefore this thesis studies the capabilities of this novel APF-eMPC framework by carrying out numerical simulations. Multiple manoeuvres and varying amounts of white noise are utilized to test the controller's limitations. For the AV part, multiple basic driving manoeuvres are simulated: lane-keeping, car-following and lane-changing. The results show that an AV based on this framework can execute these different manoeuvres without precise measurements. The CAV concept is simulated using a platoon scenario. The gap-closing behaviour of the multiple CAVs in a platoon is examined. The state-of-the-art gap-closing APF is compared with an APF based on inter-molecular dynamics and fitted on actual traffic. Various experiments are carried out using a constant time-headway in combination with different time gaps between the vehicles. The results show that the resulting behaviour by the inter-molecular APF better matches human driving behaviour and results in less dangerous gap-closing behaviour than the quadratic platoon APF. The latter has a more considerable change of lateral instability occurring. Therefore the APF based on inter-molecular dynamics and fitted on actual traffic data outperforms the APF based on a quadratic function. Lastly, it was found that the coupling between the longitudinal and lateral dynamics, often neglected in literature, cannot be ignored during platoon stability analysis.","Autonomous Vehicles; EMPC; Artifical Potential Functions; Comprehensive Predictive Control; Connected Autonomous Vehicle; Platoon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is currently a highly suitable manner to treat complex and chronic wounds. NPWT uses controlled negative pressure to stimulate wound healing and requires a vacuum device that is connected to a sealed vacuum dressing by a tube system. However, due to lack of resources in money and medical equipment, this treatment is still inaccessible to marginalised patients in LMICs,<br/>The context of this research is the Green Pastures Hospital (GPH) in Nepal. This test location is typical for LMICs. In GPH a converted aquarium pump (AquaVAC) is currently used as a NPWT device. There are a multitude of complications in relation to this equipment. Therefore, the following design goal is formulated: ‘Treat chronic and complex wounds in LMICs with a device that is affordable, safe and reliable and made out of widely available, replaceable components.’<br/><br/>In order to design such a device, extensive context analysis, literature and expert review has been done in Phase I. It was found that international guidelines for treatment, as well as design standards and safety regulations, assume a western context or high-resources setting, and do not comply with the needs of end-users at GPH. This led to a new set of requirements and design guidance for the WOCA Wound Pump in Phase II. <br/>Analysis of the market shows that NPWT systems are unnecessarily costly, due to the complexity of the devices and reliance on specific wound dressings. Low-cost solutions, such as the AquaVAC, show good results, however, these devices lack reliability, safety and ease of use. The design proposal of the WOCA contributes to solving these issues in several ways. Hence, the design proposal that was developed in Phase III, is based on availability, compatibility and simplicity. <br/>The WOCA Wound Pump is a simple, cheap and robust NPWT device. The battery powered vacuum pump is portable and can be made completely from locally sourced components. The product can be disassembled with standard tools and all individual components are replaceable, which ensure a long lifespan. Special features of this design are 1) automatic pressure control, 2) compatibility with self-made dressings and standard canisters, 3) portable design with a battery that lasts for 15 hours, 4) simple interface for smooth operation and monitoring, 5) easy to repair and made from widely available components. Even so, the WOCA is affordable, the main components are purchased and produced for less than 100 USD. <br/><br/>To conclude, the WOCA Wound Pump has much potential in LMICs. After the evaluation of the final design, it turned out that in therapy most requirements set for a NPWT used in LMICs, were met. However, future steps have to be taken in order to fulfil its potential and make an actual contribution to the healing of chronic and complex wounds in LMICs. Firstly, the prototype needs to be finished. Design iterations should be made in order to fulfil the current dissatisfiers from the requirement list still, such as noise production, shockproof design and cleaning possibilities. Subsequently, the prototype should be validated with end-users and collaborations should be set up for funding, distribution and education. This process would probably take years, but it has the potential to profoundly improve the healthcare for chronic and complex wounds in low-resource settings.<br","LMIC; Medisign; Wound care; Nepal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Weather generators (WGs) based on temporal resampling algorithms are not able to generate new extremes with the same or a higher temporal resolution as the historical data series of the thus far <br/>observed precipitation. This is problematic for catchments with a time of concentration shorter than the resolution of the used data and conflicts with the increasing occurrence of more local, short duration extremes not yet observed.<br/><br/>In this thesis, it was researched if spatial permutation of precipitation could provide a solution to these problems by introducing historical events from related locations into the area of interest. The generated precipitation series were expected to have a larger variety of precipitation events compared to the historical data, thereby representing the current changing weather patterns better and being more suitable for small basins. This is beneficial for insurance companies, governments and aid organizations which rely on long term precipitation series to generate event catalogues and risk predictions.<br/><br/>To develop, improve and widen the knowledge about the effects of spatial permutation, four different questions were formulated for a case study on spatial permutation in the Rhine basin. A literature study showed that precipitation regimes in Europe can be defined based on spatial and temporal variability, precipitation amounts and the influence of controlling factors like atmospheric circulations, topography and climate change. This information was used to built three permutation models. The first model shifted historical precipitation fields over fixed distances and directions. In the second model this fixed approach was replaced by semi-random vectors including spatial and temporal correlation. The last<br/>model used a vector approach with vectors conditioned with historical wind data. The effect of each model on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) and the main characteristics of precipitation for different basins and aggregation times was determined. The July 2021 Meuse flood was used as example to show the working method of each model visually and to better understand the effect of each permutation model on individual extreme events.<br/><br/>The results showed that spatial permutation did influence precipitation patterns, characteristics and statistics. Strongest changes in extreme precipitation events were seen for small basins and short aggregation times. The permutation direction and distance were important determinants for the outcome of each model. Precipitation permutation with semi-random vector fields was shown to be a promising method which allowed for the inclusion of both spatial and temporal correlation. However, the model had a high sensitivity to the initial and boundary conditions. Wind based vector fields were able to replicate the most important historical precipitation characteristics while at the same time generating new extremes. Yet, a clear trade off was visible between similarity of the historically observed and modelled precipitation characteristics and the number of new extremes introduced.<br/><br/>With the knowledge obtained, it can be concluded that spatial permutation is a promising method to generate more divers precipitation time series for the Rhine basin. Both semi-random and wind-based vector permutations can already be used to generate new precipitation series as long as the initial and boundary conditions are chosen carefully. To improve the results, a fusion of spatial and temporal relations and a physically wind-based vector generation method is advised. In addition, possibilities are seen in a combination of the currently used temporal resampling algorithms and a spatial permutation approach. The outcomes of these suggestions are not known yet. Nevertheless, it is expected that a better understanding of spatial permutation, on top of the results presented in this thesis, can advance the current methodologies used to generate long term precipitation series. Therefore, it is hoped that this research provides the incentives to explore spatial permutation of precipitation patterns in more detail and in such, contributes to a more accurate risk profile for the livelihoods of people worldwide.","Weather generators (WGs); Spatial permutation; Extreme precipitation; Rhine basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Projects are becoming larger and more complex, resulting in work being done more in a team environment. Among other industries, the construction industry is project-based as well. For the successful completion of construction projects, inter-organizational teams consisting of representatives from the owner, designer, contractors and other stakeholders need to cooperate. Due to the numerous relationships between the various organizations, construction management faces great challenges. One of these challenges is the encouragement of information sharing. Thus, information sharing in inter-organizational projects has already concerned academia for a long time. However, knowledge of how information flows during the design life-cycle is still limited, and no study has been found to examine that by using social network analysis.<br/><br/>Therefore, this research adopted social network theory to study information flows as its main research activity. By gathering data through a survey and analysing them by performing social network analysis, it was possible to map the communication network of the inter-organizational venture by creating sociograms and extracting some key metrics that would give meaning to these. In parallel with the social network analysis, some participant observations added a qualitative character to how information flowed between the teams. However, these two research activities were insufficient due to some limitations this study was subjected. Thus, the results from the already mentioned research activities were enriched by hosting an expert panel where the experts invited could provide further insights into the networks’ formation.<br/><br/>This research concluded that in the predesign phase, there should have been more involvement from teams that were generating valuable information to balance the control that the most influential team, according to the SNA, had over the flow of information. The different design teams should have had the same degree centrality and probably the same betweenness centrality. However, it may also be the case that one area is more complex and more information-dependent, thus ranking higher in terms of influence in the network. In the definitive design phase, team Management Design &amp; Integration should control the flow of information. However, other teams should also support it since being the only one to have control may become a bottleneck or even a single point of failure. Such teams could be teams of the same subculture regarding their roles and responsibilities in the organization. In the execution-ready design phase, many central figures concerning the construction-related teams exist in the network since many activities take place. There are multiple sources of information; thus, team Management Design &amp; Integration should be able to absorb all of it. Attention must be paid to the various barriers that have been found to impact how information flows. Especially in how the information is being communicated and how to motivate employees to use the various technological developments available since they found to enhance information sharing.<br","Information Sharing; inter-organizational information sharing; Social Network Anaysis; Inter-organizational projects; Construction Industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Carbon, Capture &amp; Storage (CCS) is an unavoidable technique within this portfolio as an intermediate solution. CCS requires transport of CO<sub>2</sub> through pipeline systems and into wells. There are still large uncertainties on the thermodynamics of the CO<sub>2</sub> in flow through valves. The CO<sub>2</sub> flow undergoes significant changes in pressure, temperature and phase distribution when it passes this control valve. Therefore, the behaviour of the CO<sub>2</sub> flow flowing through a control valve is examined in this study.<br/><br/>The simulation of CO<sub>2</sub> in a 3D valve including phase transitions is complex. Furthermore, few validation experiments are available. As a first step, more simple nozzles are simulated. In these devices, the same processes occur and validation data is available. These simulations are validated with experimental data by Nakagawa et al. to examine the accuracy. Three types of models (isenthalpic, Euler and Enhanced Mass Transfer (EMT)) are implemented in increasing levels of complexity to investigate the differences between these models and to consider when complexity is needed or simplifications are valid. <br/><br/>The validation cases show experimental pressure data of high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> flow through converging-diverging nozzles with phase transitions. The results showed that the EMT model matched the experimental data best. A substantial similarity was achieved regarding the pressure data. The mass transfer mechanism, however, needed adjustments in its coefficients to match the experimental data. Finally, after finding the right values, the EMT shows the best technique for modelling flashing or cavitation.<br/><br/>In short, the overall consequences of the transition in a valve are substantial and must be considered. The behaviour of the high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> flow is heavily influenced by flowing through a valve. Substantial amounts of vapour are formed, but only after the throat. This is the same for choking condition, which is achieved in the diverging section of the nozzle. The large expected drop in temperature due to pressure reduction has also been noted.<br/><br/>Although a high degree of similarity between the results of the model with experimental data is obtained, there is room for improvement regarding the model. A flaw was discovered in the handling of the thermodynamic properties of the fluid near critical points. Also, the surface tension has not been considered, but might have a substantial influence. Next steps in the research are 2D and 3D simulations of actual valves, but require experimental validation data.","Supercritical CO2; Valves; Numerical; CFD; CCS; Phase transition; Mass transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Koolwijk, J.S.J. (graduation committee); Bakker, H.L.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the construction industry in the Netherlands as projects came to a stop and project teams struggled to collaborate remotely. To cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and consequential virtual work environment, it is crucial to have effectively collaborating design teams. A renown contributor to team success in design teams is trust. Trust contributes to project success as it aligns the interest of stakeholders, increases the willingness to share information and improves team performance. In previous research it found that prior ties, or interactions in previous working relations could result in an improved level of trust in the design team. Moreover, expectations of future collaboration, or future ties, also improve the levels of trust in teams. These ties could therefore be used to increase the levels of trust and subsequently result in more efficient team processes. In addition, as the design team members were subjected to the restrictions related to the pandemic, it is important to investigate how this virtual work environment affects trust development. This research aims to fill this research gap and utilize its results in order to enable design team members to improve the levels of trust in their teams while coping with the effects of the change to a virtual work environment. By performing the research based on a literature review and a survey analysis, it is concluded that ties are an important factor in the development of trust. By utilizing the individual aspects of these ties, design team members can improve the levels of trust. It is suggested that prior ties are more important for trust development than future ties. However, it should be mentioned that prior ties are no silver bullet. Prior experiences may induce unmet pre-existing expectations and laxity. In addition, the potential non-beneficial effects of virtual meetings on trust in the design team should be considered. To deal with these effects it is advised to organize social and face-to-face meetings as these improve interpersonal connections. The research results indicate that this knowledge is not yet common and should therefore be emphasised. Lastly, it has to be mentioned that when considering this conclusion, it is important to recognize that certain limitations are present. Especially the considerable small sample size of the survey, which resulted in many other limitations like an unequal representation in personal and organizational roles, should be considered.","Trust; Construction; Ties; Inter-organizational; Interpersonal; Design team; Survey; Regression; Moderation; Guideline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","Projects & People",""

A data-driven identification framework based on clustering of system states, probability transition matrices and state space tessellation was developed and tested on six different reduced-order systems. As a final stage, the framework was applied to a two-dimensional model of turbulence (the Kolmogorov flow) which exhibits extreme events in the form of quasi-relaminarisation with extreme dissipation of kinetic energy. The proposed framework provides a way to identify pathways towards extreme events and predict their occurrence from a probabilistic standpoint. The clustering algorithm identifies the precursor states leading to extreme events and allows for a statistical description of the system’s states.<br","Chaos; Extreme Events; Machine Learning; Clustering; Kolmogorov flow; Lorenz System; Turbulent Flow; Dynamical systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","Repository link: https://github.com/UlaCebula/MSc_Code - Repository containing the implemented code for the thesis ""Machine learning-based identification of precursors of extreme events in chaotic systems"".","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Zuurmond, Helen (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","After Facebook renamed itself Meta, the metaverse was brought to the attention of the public eye (Schram, 2021). Newspapers and other news sources started writing extensively about this innovation that would change the world forever. What the metaverse exactly is or might become as it doesn’t exist yet, one can only speculate on. One way to describe the metaverse in simple terms is the worldwide web breaking free of its two-dimensional barriers and becoming three-dimensional through an immersive experience, unlocking many potential possibilities for new customer experiences. In particular, the metaverse has also evoked the interest of the digital customer experience agency TBWA\X. TBWA\X’s mission is to become the agency of the future, so they were curious to explore and investigate what the metaverse could entail for them. With the curiosity and potential of the metaverse for TBWA\X as a main focus, the following research question emerged:<br/><br/>“How can a radical innovation such as the metaverse be used to design a new customer experience for fashion.”<br/><br/>The element of fashion was added to the research question to scope the project. TBWA\X has several clients that operate in the fashion industry. Furthermore, various fashion brands are already exploring the possibilities of the metaverse (McDowell, 2021), paving the way for TBWA\X.<br/><br/>The methods applied to structure the project and achieve the desired results are the double diamond model, the Vision in Product design (ViP) method (Hekkert &amp; Van Dijk, 2011) and the DIVE method (Mejia, 2021). The ViP method was applied to structure the first diamond, the research part. In order to obtain the necessary insights for the ViP process, a literature study was conducted, interviews were held, observations were recorded, news sources were monitored, and informal discussions were held. Next, the research phase led to the design vision. The design vision gives direction to the second diamond, the design phase. In this phase, the last two steps of DIVE were completed to arrive at a vision concept and an implementation strategy. As part of the design phase, co-creation sessions were held, and the end result was evaluated by experts.<br/><br/>The design outcome is a vision concept in the form of a video and accompanying strategy plan. The vision concept is envisioning the online shopping experience in 2032: the VR fitting room. The VR fitting room enables consumers to choose an immersive context, or backdrop, to their liking to achieve a hyper personalized and satisfying experience. To enter the VR fitting room, the consumer has to put on VR glasses. The consumer then moves into a virtual space that contains a digital twin, in other words, a photo-realistic representation of the consumer. This digital twin can try on clothes and the surrounding space can be adapted to the moment the clothes are worn. For example, when someone wants to buy swimwear, the environment can be set to the beach. This means that both the consumer and the digital twin will find themselves at the beach where the consumer can inspect the digital twin from every angle. The literature shows that the richer the context, the better the consumer can estimate whether the clothing meets the needs of the consumer.<br/><br/>This vision concept is a steppingstone for TBWA\X to start creating immersive experiences in the metaverse. TBWA\X requested an outcome that can be applied to all client categories and emerging innovations. Although these requirements do not directly apply to the VR fitting room concept, the individual elements of the VR fitting room and the design process do apply to these requirements. Namely, the software that needs to be understood to create the vision concept is applicable to make immersive experiences. The methods used in the process to build the VR fitting room, are aimed at exploring the possibilities of an innovation for SMEs, such as TBWA\X. Therefore, this thesis can be seen as a concrete step-by-step plan for TBWA\X on how to deal with innovation, as the methods described are applicable to emerging innovations, and where especially the DIVE method is suitable for TBWA\X. <br/><br/>The implementation strategy to make the vision concept a reality is a starting point for TBWA\X to start exploring future possibilities with their clients for creating immersive experiences. <br","Customer Experience; Metaverse; Fashion; DIVE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Missions with autonomous mobile robots are heavily dependent on environmental representations. Representations have been steadily increasing in the richness that they can capture, in addition to geometry we can now represent objects and their interrelations. These richer environmental representations, such as the 3D scene graph, have provided an opportunity to integrate representations with prior knowledge to make them more actionable and improve the SA they provide. The use of such representations for planning is limited. In previous work, the main approach was to augment and extend the scene graph to enable traditional symbolic planning. The limitations of these methods are that they are offline, scale poorly, and require full observability, making them unsuitable for the SAR domain. The main contributions of this work are as follows. First, we propose the behavior-oriented situational graph, a data structure that integrates data-driven perception with prior knowledge following a novel situational affordance schema. This schema connects situations with robot behaviors and mission objectives, allowing for autonomous mission planning. Second, we propose an efficient method to obtain task utilities from the proposed behavior-oriented situational graph through planning. Finally, we propose an exploration component to discover and select tasks online in dynamic environments that are potentially partially observable. This work is evaluated in several simulation scenarios, showing improved efficiency in mission completion compared to offline methods for the specific SAR domain. Finally, the methods are implemented and tested in a real-world scenario using a mobile Spot robot, showing its effectiveness in practice.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","Safe autoNomous systems in the Open World (SNOW)",""

Yet, the study brought up important solutions that can improve safety perception, such as technological solutions like artificial intelligence traffic lights and infrastructure solutions such as the construction of underground crosswalks and refuges islands at long distance crosswalks. A recommendation is that the authorities and transport planners should emphasize to the solutions proposed to improve safety. A further scientific recommendation would the study of the objective safety in the future, comparing it with the perceived safety.

Digital solutions like Building Information Modeling (BIM) can increase an organization's productivity. However, the Built Environment has been slow to adopt digital transformation, due to insufficient information management. Existing literature concentrates on addressing this challenge, by focusing on a single aspect of information management rather than providing a comprehensive picture of all the procedures, parties engaged, information, formats and platforms used as well as their interdependencies. Therefore, the objective of this graduation research is to determine the workflows for information management to allow digitization across the whole lifecycle, by examining multiple aspects. The case study findings lead to the creation of a process map, demonstrating more efficient workflows to be followed, by linking the distributed information between the different parties involved throughout the several project stages, while also considering each party’s digital ambitions. The main processes identified during each project stage concern the production of information deliverables by the respective party, using the suitable format. As both geometrical and non-geometrical information is generated during the different project stages, different formats are used, i.e. information models and documentation. Subsequently and at the end of each stage, the respective information is shared to other parties during specific information exchange moments. A collaborative environment is used by the different parties, both during the production and information sharing. Concluding, as digital transformation becomes even more widespread, a growing number of organizations strive for effective information management. To acquire a more reliable view on the subject, it is necessary to look at several aspects at once, hence the development of the proposed process map. To increase the validity of the outcome, more research and elaboration of the process map's elements is advised. Recommendations for the construction industry, with regard to the incorporation of digital ambitions, are also provided together with suggestions for a further enhancement of the company’s information management.","Information Management; Digitization; Workflows; Lifecycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Aramid fibre reinforced engineering thermoplastics could combine the stiffness of thermoset resins with the ductility of commodity thermoplastics in a novel composite with both high structural and impact properties. In the following thesis work, Twaron and Technora fibres are evaluated for their suitability in such a material. <br/><br/>Processing aramid reinforced materials is a trade-off between the composite consolidation quality and tensile strength retention in the fiber. Good consolidation is required to achieve the required bending properties in structural laminates and requires a low polymer melt viscosity. Strength loss in the yarn is caused by the high temperatures needed to achieve such levels of viscosity, which induce a number of degradation mechanisms if no countermeasures are taken. Oxidation, hydrolysis and a purely thermal component are identified as the main mechanisms causing deterioration. Using a Kapton vacuum bag as well as drying the reinforcement and matrix material greatly improves strength retention during processing. Purely thermal degradation cannot be counteracted and makes Twaron or other para-aramid homopolymers unsuitable for reinforcing polymers with processing temperatures above 250°C. Technora is shown to be more resistant against both hydrolysis and thermal degradation, with only minor strength losses well beyond 320°C. The high toughness of Technora attributes these fibres a high energy absorption potential.<br/><br/>Various Twaron and Technora reinforced engineering thermoplastics are produced to evaluate the influence of the fibre-matrix interface and matrix material on the low-velocity impact response. Higher interfacial adhesion is achieved by using epoxy sizing on Twaron yarn and appears to improve the energy absorbed during perforation through increased fracture toughness. Technora reinforced PPS and PEI appear to have a high energy absorption potential but relatively low out-of plane performance. The eventual feasibility of the novel material will eventually depend on its high impact performance with respect to other, conventional laminates such as aramid-epoxy.","Composites; Aramid; Thermoplastics; PPS; PEI; Twaron; Technora; Impact; Structures; Interface; Matrix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.99053, 4.37673"

(graduation committee); van Nieuwenhuijzen, Arjen (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Wageningen University & Research (degree granting institution)","2022","This study focussed on the position of the Coal-to-Gas (CtG) transition of Almaty (Kazakhstan) within its wider energy goals to become energy neutral in 2060. Within CtG-transition the focus was mainly on the biggest coal-based power plant (CHP-2) of the city, which is planned to convert gas-based energy production.<br/><br/>The methodology consist of a multidisciplinary analysis that includes three <br/>fundamental dimensions of energy transitions, the socio-technical, techno-economic and political dimension. These dimensions are first individually analysed, to later interpret the outcomes and their interrelatedness. The analysis consist of qualitative desk research, and descriptive and correlational quantitative analysis. Research is conducted with secondary data sources. Prior to studying the three dimensions, specifics of the CtG-transition and Almaty’s current energy situation are described. <br/><br/>The techno-economic dimension is characterised by the sufficiency potential of renewable energy in the region of Almaty. Various analysis have concluded that a RES alternative based on solar and wind energy is favourable from a financial and carbon emission point of view. Implementation of solar and wind as compensation for CHP-2 appears to be technically feasible for Almaty. The socio-technical dimension is identified by the emergence of new technologies(RES) within the embedded existing energy system (coal and gas-based). For Almaty, this dimension is typified by being stuck in a carbon lock-in. The obsolete infrastructure and need for financial investment provide a possibility to breach this lock-in and avoid renewed path dependence towards fossil energy. However, currently there is a lack of sufficient RES stimulating measures, and the existing are insufficient to compete with fossil energy. Various arguments promote for RES stimulation on the long term, such as decreasing the fossil fuel dependency, (inter)national climate ambitions, fast energy transition activities of major trade partners, and a change to diversify economic activity. The political dimension explains the political landscape of the city, consisting of current policies, stated ambitions, and political dynamics. For Almaty, action in the political dimension is<br/>required to catalyse the energy transition, promote RES implementation, to breach with the carbon lock-in and to prevent renewed path dependence on fossil energy. Political actors have to decide between short term economic growth and political stability, or long term planning towards a sustainable and diversified energy system. Two policy cycles have to be adapted. First, regulations of fossil fuel energies have to gradually be phased out. However, a gradual and slow change is required since economic growth and political stability are major drivers of these regulations. Second, stimulating policy for RES development and implementation are required. Currently RES cannot compete with fossil fuel alternatives, and therefore cannot penetrate the heavily fossil oriented market.<br/><br/>Current energy systems contains many barriers that oppose to reaching the energy climate goals of Almaty. Most important is to breach the dependency on fossil energy from an economic, technical, and political point of view. This dependency is identified as a carbon lock-in, and additional investments in Almaty’s gas-based energy infrastructure lead to path renewed path dependence on fossil fuels, and a remained carbon lock-in. Implementing solar and wind energy as alternative of the CHP-2 conversion is an important step towards breaching the carbon-lock in and stimulating RES. Therefore local government should considering heavily investing in implementation of renewable alternatives instead of using CHP-2, in order to seriously work towards the climate ambitions, and to prevent another carbon lock-in.","Energy transition; Coal-to-gas; Multidisciplinary approach; Socio-technical; Techno-economic; Political","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

The European Union (EU) has determined that from 2025 the maritime sector must pay per ton of CO2 emission. Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) is an essential player in the maritime sector and plans to have reduced its emissions by 50% by 2025. This thesis aims to build a model in which different emission-abating options can be compared on financial and technical aspects to determine the best roadmap to achieve sustainability.<br/>To do this properly, literature research is done on emissions-abating fuels and technologies/processes applicable to offshore crane vessels. Five sub-questions are answered to find an answer to the main research question:<br/>What will be the future energy configuration of the Heerema fleet and the most technical and financial feasible roadmap to meet the sustainability goals look like?<br/><br/>• What are an offshore crane vessel's main operational energy-consuming modes?<br/><br/>• Which fuel switches and blends are technically and financially feasible, and what are the key characteristics of these fuels?<br/><br/>• What are the key characteristics of the ship-based emission-abating technologies like batteries and carbon capture and storage?<br/><br/>• What are the current vessel-specific levelized cost of Energy (LCOE) and levelized cost of carbon abatement (LCoCA) of the fuel switches and technologies, and how are they expected to develop over time?<br/><br/>• Which emission-abating future scenarios are technically and financially feasible, and how will these sustainable roadmaps look?<br/><br/>With the evaluation of the answers to these sub-questions, the importance of using hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is shown until e-fuels are available.

However, these devices are usually expensive and suffer from high inertia which decreases transparency. The Minimally Actuated Tendon-based exercise Environment (MATE) is a tendon-based rehabilitation device, designed to be cost-effective and minimize inertia effects. The MATE must apply minimal forces to the wearer if the gait cycle is healthy to prevent deviation into an unhealthy gait. Previously a mathematical optimization was performed on the design of the MATE. This thesis aims to make a physical realization of the MATE to investigate the minimal forces during a healthy gait cycle with two experiments. The first experiment attached the tendons to a machine to investigate forces on a non-altering gait. HTC VIVE motion trackers were used to measure the position of the tendon attachments over time. To measure the tension, in each cable inline tension sensors were added. Comparing the measured forces to velocity-based thresholds indicates that the forces applied by the MATE are too high and would cause deviation. The second experiment involved a human walking with and without the MATE. Evaluating the gait cycle trajectory when walking with and without the MATE indicates that the MATE alters a healthy gait cycle, lowering the step height and causing drift. The forces acting on this gait also exceed the thresholds. The MATE in its current design alters a healthy gait. Redesigning the MATE with the suggestions from this thesis will likely show further improvements.","End-effectors; gait; rehabilitation; therapy; stroke","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Approaches to mitigate space debris, such as ADR, are frequently suggested. Most of these proposals suggest a single sensor approach to provide accurate and continuous shape and pose estimation of the target. However, a more robust system can be developed by relying on input from multiple sensors with different modalities.<br/><br/>Compared to earlier literature, several alternative multimodal methods using visual-Lidar data have been researched during this thesis, of which the most promising method has been investigated in more detail. The method suggests to determine the 3D location of 2D features by projecting these on detected 3D planes, thereby fusing the visual-Lidar data at feature level. The visual-Lidar data has been acquired through both simulation in Blender using Blensor and through experimentation using an visual camera, a scanning Lidar and a robotic arm.<br/><br/>To verify and validate the proposed multimodal feature detection method, the detected 3D features are compared to the ground truth directly. Next to that, the method is also verified through analysis of the end-to-end process to estimate the relative pose of an unknown target. Where the resulting 3D features serve as input into an particle filter, combined with an EKF, based on the FastSLAM algorithm.

The aim was to generate a comparative study using a wing rib as a case study and investigate the environmental sustainability of these structures using a life cycle assessment. The project was conducted in collaboration with GKN Fokker Hoogeveen, and the case study used was that of rib 14 within the Wing of Tomorrow project, initiated by Airbus. <br/>The investigated material flows included a sheet formed aluminium rib, a machined aluminium rib, prepreg manufactured epoxy CFRP thermoset rib, RTM manufactured epoxy CFRP thermoset rib, and lastly an out of autoclave consolidated (hot press consolidated) PEKK CFRP thermoplastic rib. The results indicated that the machined aluminium in this application consumes the highest amount of energy and as a result has the highest carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as well, whereas the lowest values are seen for the sheet formed aluminium rib. The composites fall in between these two, with the thermoplastic having the third highest energy consumption and emissions from all materials considered. Lastly, a discussion was conducted on the potential of thermoplastic composites and their recyclability for the aircraft of the future, as well as future steps in the movement towards more sustainable aviation.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Latin American EdTech company Platzi provides online courses related to jobs in the digital economy to a Spanish-speaking audience. Despite many new benefits of e-learning, like on-demand learning, it also comes with new challenges like isolation of learners, lack of community and lack of accountability, which leads to decreasing motivation for learning.<br/><br/>The focus is primarily on students who want to find their place in an ever-getting, more dynamic world and guide them to define what they want in life. Making big life decisions like what career to focus on, where one wants to be in ten years, or what one even wishes to do is extremely difficult for everyone. But especially for young students that learn isolated. <br/><br/>Despite Platzi's great work of forming a unity with their students, there is a significant shortage of guidance in online environments, and students often feel uninspired and without direction. Seeking a structured framework, the Japanese concept of Ikigai was identified as a starting point to help individuals develop clarity in life and increase their general well-being. This framework would enable students to learn how to use their skills best, allow them to follow their passions, and improve the lives of others while building a stable economic foundation. <br/><br/>A new adapted purpose-finding service was developed to help students set goals based on their responses and connect these goals to courses to make the path ahead as tangible as possible. After rounds of experimentation with different approaches, one concept emerged, considering the context and the interests of all stakeholders. <br/><br/>The work was partly executed in Colombia and part remotely in the Netherlands (collaboration with Platzi, user interviews, workshops, and user tests). User research was performed through interviews, surveys, and a workshop at all project stages. <br/><br/>The final solution of this graduation project is an app feature that integrates into the existing platform. It allows students to discover opportunities by taking a playful quiz that points out further self-improvement activities and suggests courses to achieve the identified goals. By utilizing the strengths of Ikigai and simplifying it to reach a broad audience, it engages users and makes Platzi a holistic e-learning provider to transform Latin America.","E-learning; Purpose-finding; Online education; Ikigai; Goal-setting; Latin America; EdTech; Motivation; UX Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

First, our work presents an IL model using spline coefficient parameterisation and offline expert queries to enhance safety and training efficiency. Then, we expose the weakness of the learnt IL policy by synthetically generating critical scenarios through optimisation of parameters of the driver's risk field (DRF), a parametric human driving behaviour model implemented in a multi-agent traffic simulator based on the Lyft Prediction Dataset. To continuously improve the learnt policy, we retrain the IL model with augmented data. Thanks to the expressivity and interpretability of the DRF, the desired driving behaviours can be encoded and aggregated to the original training data. Our work constitutes a full development cycle that can efficiently and continuously improve the learnt IL policies in closed-loop. Finally, we show that our IL planner developed with 30 times less training resource still has superior performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art.","imitation learning; autonomous driving; critical scenario generation; model-based multi-agent simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Radar rainfall nowcasting was proven able to provide forecasts up to 2 to 3 hours in advance on a catchment scale. However, an extensive evaluation of nowcasting skills for urban areas has not been performed yet. In this study, we selected 80 extreme events that occurred in 5 main Dutch cities (Amsterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Maastricht, and Eindhoven) from 2008 to 2021. We evaluated the performance of probabilistic nowcasts with 20 ensemble members applying short-term ensemble prediction system (STEPS) from Pysteps for these cities, focusing on analyzing the dependence on rainfall characteristics and city sizes. Nowcasts in Eindhoven (96 km2) and Maastricht (67 km2) had higher errors because the rainfall intensity of their events was higher. Besides, nowcasts at small areas showed higher error, especially when the size was below 100 km2. We found that forecast errors were higher and the forecast was less reliable for the 1-h event durations than for 24-h durations. Despite these differences, skillful lead times measured by Pearson correlation in all the cities were about 20 to 24 minutes for both the 1-hour and 24-hour events. CARROTS (Climatology-based Adjustments for Radar Rainfall in an Operational Setting) adjusted the bias in real-time QPE and QPF, but QPF still reduced with increasing lead time. Also, CARROTS did not adjust the rainfall spatial distribution much, so the skillful lead time did not change much. The skillful lead time in this study was shorter than the counterparts on the catchment scale because small areas are more sensitive to the displacement of forecast rainfall. Still, such lead time is similar to the findings in other research on short convective rainfall over small areas. Future research could try to apply machine learning, 3-dimensional nowcasting, or blending numerical weather prediction in the nowcasting process to better forecast the growth and decay of rainfall at a longer lead time.","nowcasting; extreme precipitation; urban flooding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

These algorithms require huge quantities of training data which is often in shortage in the healthcare field due to stringent privacy norms. Therefore looking for solutions to enrich clinical data becomes necessary. An alternative currently popular among the Computer Vision community is to use synthetic data for training, created using 3D modeling software pipelines. However, this type of technique often has limitations in data diversity and data balancing as desired variations need to be provided explicitly. In this thesis, we propose a data augmentation method for enriching diversity in synthetic data without using any additional external data or software. In particular, we introduce a pose augmentation technique, which synthesizes new human characters in poses unseen in the original dataset using Pose-Warp GAN. Additionally, a new metric is proposed to assess diversity in human pose datasets. The proposed method of augmentation is evaluated using YOLOv3. We show that our pose augmentation technique significantly improves person detection performance compared to traditional data augmentation, especially in low data regimes.","Synthetic Data; Generative Adversarial Networks; Object Detection; Data Augmentation; Deep Learning; Computer Vision; Pose Augmentation; conditional Generative Adversarial Network; YOLO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

This is found to bear a significant and far-reaching reduction in wind speed upstream of a wind farm. The wind farm blockage is attributed to the cumulative induction effects of multiple wind turbines placed in series. Wind-farm flow blockage has important consequences on energy production because it reduces the available kinetic energy in the incoming wind flow. In turn, this causes leading wind turbines in a wind farm to produce less energy than they each would in isolation. To date, the physics of this global blockage effect is not entirely understood, and they are therefore an active research topic. Due to the increasing demand for wind energy, reducing annual energy production (AEP) uncertainties and power production bias seems to be a challenge for wind energy researchers. Understanding wind farm blockage in complex terrain becomes crucial to account for uncertainties and power production bias.<br/>This thesis set out to perform Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations to assess the impact of wind-farm flow blockage in complex terrain using the open-source software OpenFOAM. A laterally infinite row of turbines is simulated on top of a 2-D hill defined by the mathematical curve ’Witch of Agnesi’. The set of simulations is performed for varying atmospheric conditions: truly neutral and stable free atmospheric conditions. Thermal stratification imposed under stable conditions is of particular interest due to the excitation of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) by the turbine array and the topology. The velocity fields due to the presence of the turbine array on top of the hill are compared to the ones without. The resulting flow reduction is then compared to the cases without the hill in order to assess the impact of complex terrain on wind farm blockage. A series of sensitivity analyses are performed for varying inter-array spacing and hill size variations in order to further the understanding of wind farm blockage.<br/>The results obtained in this study show that the magnitude of wind farm blockage is amplified due to the presence of the hill. Additionally, the excitation of AGWs is seen to have a major impact on the wind farm blockage due to alterations caused to the pressure field. The impact of blockage is seen to be dominant up to at least 10-15 turbine diameters upstream of the turbine array under truly neutral conditions. While the effects are more pronounced and much more dominant under stable free atmosphere conditions. All the stable free atmosphere cases simulated show a reduction ranging from 1-4% at different upstream locations while neutral cases show slightly lower yet non-negligible reduction due to blockage.<br/>This study ultimately concludes that the existing ’wakes-only’ approach for estimating energy losses still has a significant power production bias. Therefore accounting for the blockage effects in the farm upstream is also equally important and must be analysed before commissioning a wind farm.","Wind Farm Blockage; Atmospheric Gravity Waves; Complex Terrain; Atmospheric Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

There are two main reasons for this trend. First, structures are becoming more slender with improvements in materials and construction techniques and modern trends in architectural designs. And second, crowds are getting livelier than previously was the case, their activities can become better synchronized due to the presence of various auditory and visual stimuli at above mentioned events.<br/><br/>In recent years there is also a growing discussion on the strength and stability of event structures. A very common type of structure is an event deck structure. Visitors gather on top of these decks during festivals and in some cases festival organizers place bars underneath them to efficiently use the structure. Personnel working in these bars experience the movement of the structure due to a dancing crowd and tend to feel uncomfortable. Engineers at Tentech are aware of this phenomenon through contacts with clients.<br/><br/>Nowadays, in the Netherlands, event deck structures are designed to withstand a vertical static load of 5 $kN/m^2$, prescribed by Dutch design codes. The amplitude of this static load is based on a dense static crowd. But according to existing literature, a synchronically jumping crowd can cause a vertical load which far exceeds the design load prescribed by design codes. This provides a reason to further investigate the extreme load case of a synchronically jumping crowd on an event deck structure.<br/><br/>A missing element in the standard design of structures subjected to a synchronically jumping crowd is the consideration of dynamic interaction between human and structure. In this research the focus is on how human-structure interaction (HSI) can influence the human-induced loading and the internal stresses caused by that loading in the structure. This is done by building a 3D finite element model in Abaqus.<br/><br/>A 3D finite element model is used to easily vary in the position of a jumper on the structure. Modelling group effects such as the coordination factor is also easier when using a 3D model. And in the case of an event deck structure a 3D model will result in more detailed results compared to 2D models because mechanical properties of an event deck can vary over the third dimension.<br/><br/>A mass-spring system is suggested to represent a jumping person. To simulate a synchronically jumping crowd, multiple mass-spring systems are used. By assigning an initial velocity to the mass in the mass-spring system, it is possible to simulate a similar mechanism as a jumping person colliding with a structure. By analysing the force in the spring over time it is possible to draw conclusions on the influence of human-structure interaction on the impact peak force. And by comparing the impact forces with the reaction forces which are measured at the base of the structure, the effects of structural vibrations on the internal stresses are determined.<br/><br/>It is found that taking HSI into account does influence the impact peak force and the internal stresses of the structure. But for an event deck structure with a natural frequency of 20 Hz or higher, this only accounts for an individually jumping person. It is found that the more people jump on a structure, the less significant the effect of HSI will be, even when a crowd tries to jump synchronically. This is caused by the natural time lag between each jumping person.","Structural Dynamics; Human-Structure Interaction; Event Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Accurately predicting the surface transport in the ocean is crucial for estimating the course of marine pollution, which is considered one of the most pressing environmental issues of the 21st century. In the ocean, floating marine pollution is transported by several mechanisms, including waves. Current models predicting the surface transport set the wave-induced transport component to be equal to the Stokes drift, which is defined as the net drift that a fluid parcel experiences in the direction of a propagating wave. However, Deike et al. (2017) and Pizzo et al. (2019) indicated that the transport induced by the Stokes drift is enhanced by breaking waves. Despite extensive study of the wave breaking phenomenon, it is still not possible to accurately predict the surface transport for breaking waves in deep water irregular seas. Thus, in this thesis, the contribution of the transport from breaking waves to the total wave-induced transport at the surface of a deep-water unidirectional irregular sea is estimated. To do this. a theoretical model is developed. The model computes the transport of individual breaking wave groups from surface elevation measurements of a deep-water unidirectional irregular sea. Thereafter, the contribution of the wave-induced transport from breaking to the total wave-induced transport is defined by an enhancement factor. This enhancement factor shows how much the total surface transport in a wave field without breaking waves is enhanced by the transport of breaking wave groups. <br/><br/>The model that is developed is an extension of the relationship from research by Sinnis et al. (2021). In their research, they defined a transport relationship for isolated breaking wave groups based on the spectral bandwidth and the linear slope of the wave groups. In the model, the transport relation from Sinnis et al. is applied to the breaking wave groups from surface elevation measurements of deep water irregular seas. In order to do this, the surface elevation spectrum was approximated by multiple Gaussian wave groups. From the Gaussian wave groups, the spectral bandwidth and the linear slope could be determined. The breaking waves were identified based on a steepness threshold for the wave groups. The wave-breaking-induced transport was calculated for all individual breaking wave groups. <br/><br/>Additionally, experiments were carried out to validate the theoretical model. The experiments were performed in the Atlantic Basin of Deltares. In this facility, unidirectional irregular waves were generated in deep water. During the experiments, an overhead camera filmed the behavior of quasi-Lagrangian particles floating on top of the waves. The particles were tracked using OpenCV and their trajectories were obtained. Because the particles in breaking waves travel faster than in non-breaking waves, a velocity threshold was used to identify the breaking waves in the trajectories. From the identified breaking waves the wave-breaking-induced transport was quantified. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the theoretical model was validated by comparing the number of breaking waves, the strength of the breaking events, and the enhancement factor with the experimental results. The results showed that all values were in the same order of magnitude and that the wave-breaking-induced transport enhanced the surface transport for non-breaking waves by a factor up to 1.5. Besides, a sensitivity analysis on the relevant parameters showed that the error margin remains within 10% from the mean. In conclusion, the theoretical model gave reasonable predictions of the contribution of the wave-breaking-induced transport in a unidirectional irregular sea. Hence, this framework can be fruitful grounds for further extension of the breaking induced drift in the ocean.<br/><br","OpenCV; Breaking-induced transport; breaking waves; plastic; Python; Gaussian approximation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

But adolescents are not heard sufficiently and receive too little attention in contemporary democracy. Their political participation is very low and not representative for their age group, as politically engaged adolescents often enjoy formal education, do not come from vulnerable groups and have positive role models at home or at school. In the participatory society, which has become the Dutch norm, participation has become vital. Differences in level of participation can result in inequalities for groups who do not sufficiently bring up their concerns. The corona crisis has exposed this is the case for mbo-students.<br/>Involving this group of underrepresented, under-involved and not-heard mbo-students is imperative to achieve the equality necessary for a legitimate democratic system. Increasing their participation will contribute to more social justice. Despite efforts by the government, the political participation of mbo-students does not appear to be increasing.<br/>The lack of participation of mbo-students is a complex problem with many causes. Mbo-students are incredibly diverse in age, ethnicity, interests, and so on, and ‘the’ mbo-student does not exists. There is a gap between politicians and mbo-students, and the current participation system does not fit students’ needs. Furthermore, they have difficulties formulating opinions autonomously and do not know how to translate these into action.<br/>The proposed design intervention is the concept Rake Praat. The process of Participatory Budgeting (where a municipality allocates a section of the annual budget to be spent by citizens) has been altered to more accurately facilitate the needs and wishes of mbo-students. Their experiences form the foundation for the process. With the use of integrated Creative Problem-Solving techniques, students and politicians define potential projects together.<br/>With four co-creation sessions, each with its own focus, mbo-students and politicians navigate together from problem to solution. A session plan can be designed by the municipality and schools with the use of the Activity Cards. These describe different types of (creative) activities, allowing the participants to go through the different stages of the creative process: diverging, reverging, and converging. The activities are shaped so that the creative facilitation does not require experts, allowing students and politicians to go through the process autonomously.<br/>The design makes creative problem-solving more accessible to non-designers, providing policymakers and politicians with the means to shape contacts with mbo-students. Simultaneously, the toolkit gives students the opportunity to express their views directly to people who can make a difference.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","class=""MsoNormal"">The offshore wind sector in Europe has grown significantly over the past 20 years. Following this surge in number of installations, the first generation of turbines is reaching its end-of-life (EOL) phase and thought needs to be put into end-of-life strategies. As the market for lifetime extension is still in its infancy and re- powering is economically unappealing, decommissioning is the most obvious solution. The tower, Rotor Nacelle Assembly (RNA) and electrical cables will most likely be removed by reverse-installation methods, as well as the Transition Piece (TP). Removal of the monopile foundation however, is considerably more diffi- cult due to the large embedded length of the pile in the soil. The common way of decommissioning such piles in industry (mostly the Oil &amp; Gas (O&amp;G) industry) is to cut them at or below the seabed and leave the remaining stumps in place. This research investigates more sustainable methods that remove the foundation completely, as this is more in line with the modern circular economy and regulations, i.e., OSPAR, are getting more stringent, focusing on complete removal of all offshore structures in the future. To remove the entire monopile foundation using only a blunt uplift force, tremendous amounts of force are required. It is thus desired to lower this extraction force by some technique to reduce soil resistance. This research investigates the possibility of reducing soil resistance surrounding monopiles by utilizing pitch and heave vessel motions. Such motions can induce an harmonic force on the monopile during the first mo- ments of lifting. The hypothesis is that low frequency oscillations of about 0.1 Hz can induce plastic strain accumulation of the soil, resulting in permanent displacement of the pile. This hypothesis is tested by con- structing two models, one describing vessel motion in MATLAB, and the other describing the pile-soil inter- action under cyclic loading, which is modelled in the open source software OpenSees. An extensive market study is performed to find a representative maximum set of dimensions of the first generation of monopiles installed offshore. Monopiles with a grouted connection to the transition piece are considered as first gener- ation monopiles, and it is these monopiles that are of interest to the study because they need to be removed the first. The vessel considered in this research is the Pioneering Spirit and the crane its Jacket Lift System (JLS), due its large lifting capacity. After delineating to the monopile size and the vessel, assumptions are made regarding the extraction process. A cranemaster is added to the system to avoid slack in the lines and a connection tool between the crane wire cables and the monopile is selected, assuming a rigid connection between the two. The results indicate that applying a low frequency cyclic load to a monopile can result in the accumulation of plastic strain of the soil and, consequently, to larger monopile displacements than in monotonic load cases of the same magnitude. In the simulations performed in this research, this effect, called cyclic degradation, is observed to be more intense in sands than in clays. It is observed that plastic strain is largest when large forces are applied to the model, hence it is desired to maximize the combination of tension and amplitude of the applied cyclic force. The effect of cyclic degradation however, is stronger if the forcing frequency is increased to a value near the resonance frequency of the pile-soil system. This value lies in the region of 4 to 8 Hz, depending on the force input characteristics because of the non-linear behavior of soils. Achieving fre- quency multiplication of the input force has been considered in both active and passive ways. It is concluded that only active frequency multiplication may deliver the needed cyclic degradation, since passive frequency multiplication diminishes the amplitude of the cyclic force, driving up the resonance frequency of the pile- soil system even further. The applicability of the pile-soil model, and thus these conclusions, is only valid during the first moments of lifting, when displacements are relatively small. The results obtained in this thesis are the result of a relatively conservative soil dynamics model and a non- conservative hydrodynamical model. The reliability of the results could be further improved if the two models are combined in a co-simulation, where at every time-step the pile displacement and vessel motion are deter- mined. Additionally, expanding the OpenSees model so that accurate representations of large pile displace- ments are included, will allow for calculation of longer simulations, where the pile is completely removed from the soil. The hydrodynamic model can be improved by using an entire sea-state as input.","Monopiles, decommisssioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Currently, NAO detection is troublesome to achieve, which can influence the accuracy and effectiveness of clinical surgery. Although several objective measurement techniques are currently available, they are found to be inconsistent with patients’ sensations. In recent years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a novel technique to objectively assess nasal airflow by simulating the nasal airflow of NAO patients. Existing literature has also shown the potential to correlate relevant CFD parameters with patients’ sensations. Nevertheless, there is still debate on the numerical setup for an accurate solution and the CFD parameter to correlate with the subjective measurement. Based on these existing issues, we mainly investigated the boundary configuration (with and without the external nose), the usage of turbulence/laminar models, the usage of steady-state/transient solvers, and briefly discussed the potential of using unilateral pressure drop ratio as a parameter for NAO detection. <br/><br/>To begin with, including the external nose in the nasal airflow simulation is recommended in the nasal airflow simulations. The external nose configuration can affect the flow direction through the nostrils and downstream flow distributions. However, the static (and total) pressure drop only shows a 4% difference compared to the commonly-used plane-truncated boundary configuration. Furthermore, using the laminar model is sufficient for the nasal airflow simulations concerning the static pressure drop prediction. The laminar model shows a difference lower than 15% in static pressure drop compared to the experimental values on 3D-printed nasal airway models. We stress the caution of using the &#x1d458; − &#x1d714; model in the nasal airflow simulations because it tends to overpredict the turbulent viscosity ratio near the inlet unphysically. Moreover, steady-state simulations can also reasonably predict nasal airflow. We observed unsteady effects when comparing the steady-state simulation with the transient simulation with a constant flow rate and the transient simulation with a sinusoidal flow-rate-versus-time profile representing the real-life breathing cycle. Nevertheless, the steady-state simulation achieves an accurate prediction in static pressure drop, with a difference lower than 6% compared to the tested transient simulations. The steady-state simulation can also perfectly match transient simulations in the velocity profile of the recirculation zones and require a much lower computational cost. Last but not least, we also tested the possibility of using the unilateral static pressure drop ratio for NAO detection using CFD. However, we note that future studies should make corrections to account for the nasal cycle effect for NAO detection. <br/><br/>Overall, we conclude that including the external nose and using the laminar simulations with the steady-state solver can give an acceptable prediction for the nasal airflow, especially concerning the static pressure drop prediction. We also state that applying CFD in the nasal airflow shows the potential for NAO detection, although future studies may consider making some corrections to include the nasal cycle effect.","Nasal Airway Obstruction; Physiological flows; CFD; 3D printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

The development of robot fingers with these structures could aid in the further understanding of the functional anatomy and biomechanics of the human finger. It has been suggested that these fibrous structures can be emulated as a set of individual, non-elastic strings. The configuration of these tendon-ligament structures result in the specific motions of the finger. <br/>Aims: The aims of this thesis were to develop and manufacture an anthropomorphic finger prototype with fully anthropomorphic tendon-ligament systems. So the prototype could be functionally actuated as a human finger, and would perform humanoid motion mechanisms, such as the Interphalangeal joint<br/>coupling, an ab-adduction/axial rotation coupling.<br/>Methods: A parametric finger model was derived from CT images of human finger bones, with a focus on the soft tissue connection to the joints and the tendon pulley system attached to the phalanges. The finger segments were designed as a shell structures with functionally anthropomorphic shapes. The finger contained the metacarpal bone, the proximal, middle and distal phalanx and included<br/>humanoid joints, tendons, and ligaments. These finger bone shells had fine rosters of perforations for the attachment of joint ligaments and supporting ligaments, implemented as a collection of individually attached dyneema strings, allowing for the precise and iterative attachment of these strings. The strings<br/>had adjustment possibilities to accurately determine their functional lengths. This model was then produces by FDM additive manufacturing on a scale of 5:1 with PLA as a material. To reduce the friction around the joints, friction experiments were performed, where graphite in an epoxy resin was found to be an appropriate coating for the joint surfaces. The tendons and ligaments systems were developed as a collection of non-elastic Dyneema strings, where the string lengths and positioning were identified according to biomechanical finger models.<br/>Results: The result was the creation of a finger prototype with anthropomorphically realistic pulley systems for the tendons with joint surfaces of minimal friction, so that the finger could be actuated by the tendons to simulate realistic humanoid behaviour. The humanoid motion, and coupling mechanisms<br/>were verified with 2D motion tracking software and manual measurements by performing possible<br/>movements done by actuating the muscle tendons of the finger prototype and by comparing the resulting<br/>motion with that of a human finger.

These non-monostable systems show great potential for deployment in e.g. the medical, the manufacturing and the precision industry. Often the presence of prestress is a requirement for obtaining non-monostability within the realm of compliant mechanisms. This prestress is for example a strict necessity for neutrally stable behaviour, but also various types of bistable systems need it for correct operation. Systematic methods to induce prestress to these mechanisms do not yet exist. Currently, the application of prestress is most often achieved by manual assembly steps. The manual nature of these assembly steps poses problems onto the dimensional scalability, the production scalability and the design freedom of these mechanisms. In this research the possibilities of imposing prestress onto compliant mechanisms during their fabrication, solely by utilizing inherent features of the manufacturing method, are explored. With such a technique at hand, an accurate, scalable and tailorable method for prestressing is obtained. In this work the fused filament fabrication technique is used to create PLA monostable compliant mechanisms. By making use of the heat-induced shrinkage property of PLA, a distributed and variable material shrinkage field can be acquired. By the virtue of this variable shrinkage, elements within the system can selectively be prestressed. Results show that the mechanical stability behaviour of a demonstrator mechanism can permanently be changed from monostable to bistable. The influence of various design parameters on the shrinkage yield and the force-delivering potential of PLA is examined to tailor and maximize both factors. The result of this work provides the onset for the further creation of multi and neutrally stable compliant mechanisms in a systematic way.","Compliant mechanisms; Prestress; Stability alteration; Shape Memory Polymer; Fused Filament Fabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dam, B. (graduation committee); Schut, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The main goal of this thesis is to better understand the photochromic mechanism in rare-earth (RE) oxyhydride thin films. When illuminated, these materials have shown to darken, and bleach to a transparent state when the illumination source is removed. The RE oxyhydride thin films used in this thesis are deposited using magnetron sputtering and are YOxHy and GdOxHy films with different storage (air and vacuum) and oxidation (air and dry air) conditions. The films were probed using Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy, spectrophotometric (optical) measurements, X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic ellipsometry, measured before, during and after in or ex situ ultraviolet illumination. <br/><br/>Series of illumination and bleaching cycles have shown to permanently induce vacancy defects, which are most likely divacancies. The photochromic effect is seen as a reversible process, which leads us to believe that the changes seen in the defects are not directly responsible for the photochromic effect. During in-situ photodarkening and bleaching partially reversible changes are seen, whereby systematic shifts in the positron annihilation Doppler parameters are exhibited. This shift correlates with the photochromic effect, where the irreversible formation of vacancies is seen as a result of UV illumination. This leads us to the idea of the formation of metallic domains that may be attributed to H- ions that become mobile under illumination and may cluster to form metallic domains. Furthermore, the formation of the vacancy defects correlates with an increase in bleaching times seen from optical measurements, suggesting that they could play a role in the memory effect. Another optical property seen is a change in the band gap. We have seen that during photodarkening, the band gap tends to widen and decrease during bleaching. This phenomenon can be associated with the Burstein-Moss effect and can be used to estimate the photo-induced electron density in the conduction band. Despite the changes observed from positron annihilation techniques and optical measurements, no significant differences were observed by X-ray diffraction. The lattice constants of the film before and after illumination were shown to be constant.<br/><br/>There are two hypotheses explaining the photochromic mechanism: the segregation of metallic domains as a result of H- ion mobility and an Anderson-Mott insulator-to-metal transition as a result of overlapping electron wave functions. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, these models were tested for YOxHy. It is shown that the mechanism leading to the darkening of the films is best described by the formation of Y or YHx metallic domains and voids. The percentage of metallic domains and voids grows with illumination time and starts stabilising after 90 minutes of illumination. The fraction of metallic domains (1.9-2.6% after 150 minutes of illumination) is similar in magnitude as seen in previous studies. Furthermore, the voids probed by ellipsometry are much larger than the vacancy-related defects probed by positrons. Such voids could give rise to the formation of positronium in the films, as could be examined in future positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) experiments.<br/><br/>Qualitatively GdOxHy and YOxHy behave similarly when it comes to optical measurements, XRD and DB-PAS data. For both systems, an increase in bleaching time as a function of illumination and bleaching cycles, a widening and shrinking of the band gap and a decrease in contrast are observed. However, there are quantitative differences between these films. The bleaching constant is shorter for GdOxHy and the contrast is higher, which makes it seem more attractive for potential applications. However, GdOxHy could not yet be satisfactorily modelled, in contrast to the case of YOxHy using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The GdOxHy film could not be described by a single homogeneous layer and therefore requires more complex models to describe the behaviour of the film in future work.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

In this paper, the theoretical gap between the field of robotic grasping and the field of kinematic coupling is researched. It is shown that by making small alterations in the way of modelling the design problem, one can lend the performance measures that are used in the field robotic grasping for quantification of grasp performance, and apply these on the design process of kinematic couplings.

(graduation committee); van der Made, Kees Jan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","For certain geotechnical structures, such as dikes and levees, the design quality is heavily reliant on the sampling quality. In addition, the extent of consequences on geotechnical design of using parameters from samples with a certain degree of disturbance in laboratory tests is unclear. While the available literature has been mainly focussed on disturbance experienced by clay samples, the same empirical findings are not always applicable to organic soils such as peat and organic clay. The global objective of this thesis was to gain an understanding of sampling disturbance in organic soils using both established and non-destructive experimental methods. In order to achieve this, the traditional Dutch Ackerman sampling technique was compared to that of a recently developed sampler, the Deltares Large Diameter Sampler (DLDS). Non-destructive methods and 1D consolidation parameters were used to quantify disturbance in organic soil samples.<br/><br/>The results from existing databases showed that organic clay has a clear linear trend between <i>w</i> and <i>RR</i> and peat showed no definitive correlation, although the peat sampled by the DLDS had significantly higher water contents than the peats from the Ackerman sampler. Moreover, 37% of organic clay and peat Ackerman samples had an <i>∆e/e<sub>0</sub></i> below 7%. Meanwhile, all the DLDS results from the Deltares laboratory had an <i>∆e/e<sub>0</sub></i> of less than 4%. The use of this parameter is still questionable for peats, as the higher e0 found in DLDS peats is the cause for low disturbance measurements. However, the <i>∆e/e<sub>0</sub></i> index may be used in conjunction with other destructive and non-destructive disturbance parameters. Furthermore, the trend showed it becomes increasingly difficult to produce high quality samples with increasing in-situ vertical stress. <br/><br/>Using differences in shear wave velocity as a non-destructive disturbance determination technique, it was concluded that the increased shear wave velocity in Ackerman samples relative to the DLDS samples, although slight, was due to densification of the outermost volume of the sample being compressed by the sampling procedure. This effect was further observed in the other non-destructive method use in this investigation, CT scanning. Analysis of micro-CT scans showed that all specimens had higher greyvalue intensities at the perimeter than at the centre of the sample, however the observed effect was 7.4 times higher with the Ackerman specimens than with the DLDS specimens.<br/><br/>The main recommendation is to continue research on the effectiveness of using non-destructive methods to quantify sample disturbance in peats. For the sampling industry, it is advised to increase the diameter of the Ackerman sampling tubes to between 70 and 120 mm when sampling in peat. In addition, in light of the lesser disturbance caused by the DLDS, it is advised to deploy it in shallow peats instead of the Ackerman sampler with the current inner diameter of 67 mm. Furthermore, it is recommended to deploy both types of samplers side-by-side in sampling projects in order to diminish the effect of site-specific variables.","geotechnical sample; disturbance; CT scan; DLDS; Ackerman sampler; shear wave; oedometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The model proposed in this thesis uses the classical factor model, with univariate logarithmic volatility equations to model the factors as well as the asset innovations. The volatility equations for the factors are extended to contain an asymmetric relationship with the factor returns of the day before. In this thesis, a method to estimate this asymmetric model is developed, the method of estimation mainly relies upon MCMC methods. A method to estimate the logarithmic likelihood for the model is provided as well. This method uses a particle filter to estimate the distribution of the volatility. Using the logarithmic likelihood, it is shown that the asymmetry in the data is identifiable, by comparing the likelihood of the model to the likelihood of the classical factor model, as well as to the likelihood of a factor model with a jump extension. Finally, the model is tested on a real data set of daily returns where its effectiveness is again compared to the classical model and the jump model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Financial Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Monopiles are by far the most chosen foundation option for most off-shore activities. The installation of the foundation is commonly done by impact pile driving. The biggest issue of the traditional pile driving method is the sound emission, which reaches levels that are harmful to the immediate environment. Partly because of this, an alternative pile driving method is being developed, namely the Gentle Driving of Piles [1], where the hydraulic hammer is replaced by a GDP-shaker, which drives the pile toe into the ground by means of a torsional force. This is an additional incentive for developing a predictive model for the underwater noise radiation due to a non-symmetric force field. The model proposed in this thesis is similar to the existing symmetric semi-analytical model SILENCE [2], where the model consists of two submodules, namely a pile module and a module that describes the acousto-elastic medium. In both submodules the displacement field of the subsystem is described using its modal field. The procedure for both systems are derived and explained in further detail in chapter 3. To combine the submodules two different mode-matching methods, that account for the azimuthal direction, are developed in chapter 4. One of these methods is the so-called Orthogonality method, which is, similar to [3], based on the orthogonality relations of the acousto-elastic medium. The other is referred to as the Point-Collocation method, which is loosely based on the reciprocity theorem. Both methods have proven to be sufficiently stable to achieve good convergence at least for lower frequencies. The model is tested a small sized pile case study. The results are assessed in chapter 5 through the frequency spectra of the acousto-elastic medium as well as the metrics. The time evolution of the response is also looked at, even though these are considered less reliable, due to the limited frequency range.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

In the optimization, the topology is described by radial basis functions interpolated level set function, and the problem is solved by the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IGFEM). Cracks are assumed to exist on enriched nodes that are added on the boundary of the geometry to increase the accuracy of approximation. The first part of the work assumes cracks to be semi-circular with the crack plane perpendicular to the boundary, and the crack opening direction to be either parallel to the &#x1d44b;&#x1d44d;- or &#x1d44c;&#x1d44d;-plane of the global coordinates. An extended framework that assumes crack opening direction perpendicular to the surface first principal stress is also developed at the end. The energy release rates (ERRs) of the cracks are evaluated with the topological derivative method, which requires only a stress field of the geometry and weight functions that relate the stress and stress intensity factors (SIFs). The weight functions are found by a finite element analysis on a cuboid with a crack. This approach is computationally efficient because it eliminates the need of actually modeling and meshing the crack planes in the geometry during optimization. Moreover, a 3D stress recovery technique (or stress improvement procedure, SIP) is used to recover the nodal stress non-locally to improve the accuracy. The objective function is then established with the &#x1d45d;-mean aggregation of the ERRs. Finally, Numerical examples in 3D, including the famous L-bracket benchmark problem, are performed to prove the correctness and capacity of the framework. In conclusion, this extended framework shows more flexibility and provides more information to the optimized design than the 2D framework by considering an added dimension both in analyzed geometry and crack shape, i.e., the effect of the anisotropy of cracks can be captured.","Topology optimization; 3D; Level set method; IGFEM; Energy release rate; Topological derivative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-18","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Therefore, Sui (2021) developed a simulation model from ‘tank to wake’ of a manoeuvring ship in irregular waves to advice a minimum power limit for regulation purposes. The original model consists of the Kijima model extended with the mean second order wave drift forces of a VLCC tanker published by (Yasukawa et al., 2019).<br/> The research reported in this thesis is conducted as part of this work. Therefore, the aim is to improve the fidelity of hydrodynamics. Therefore, a modular unified model is established where the manoeuvring forces of Kijima model are included as non-linear damping in the Cummings equation. Whereas only the mean second order wave drift forces were included in the original model, the first and second order wave excitation forces, the radiation forces, and the restoring forces are included in the new model. The convolution integrals of the radiation damping forces are circumvented with state space models with the identification method of Perez &amp; Fossen (2009). The input of the forces are the force response amplitude operators, the quadratic transfer functions, and the added mass and damping coefficients in the frequency domain obtained from the diffraction analysis performed on a barge in Ansys Aqwa, because the hull geometry of the benchmark ship is unknown. <br/> Moreover, a wave generation model is included capable of generating sea surface realizations for irregular waves from multiple wave spectra. In this study, irregular long crested wind generated waves are generated from a JONSWAP spectrum. The JONSWAP spectrum is generated based on the wind growth curves and thus depend on the wind speed. Consequently, the significant wave height and the peak period of the spectrum are consistent.<br/> The model is validated against the measurements of the benchmark turning trail and compared to the original model. The original model is slightly more accurate. Nevertheless, both results are considered acceptable, and, it is concluded that that the fidelity of the models is similar. <br/> Thereof, the model is used to simulate a ship escaping an increasing storm based on the case of the Pasha Bulker. Therefore, a turn from beam to head waves starting at a low velocity is simulated in sea state 7, 8, and 9. In the original simulation, the ship failed in sea state 9. With the new model, the ship is able to perform all turns. Therefore, it is concluded that the ship is not underpowered. Consequently, the engine power is reduced. With half installed power the ship fails to escape the storm and it is endangered. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Due to this, the material wastage in the AM process is minimal. In addition, powder feedstock produced from recycled materials can promote a more sustainable L-PBF.

A total of 25 load cases are derived from the certification specifications CS-25, from which 7 critical load cases are selected and used for design optimisation. Preliminary dynamic loads for the landing gear are estimated, and the landing gear parameters are optimised by minimising the load acting on the landing gear bay for different landing load cases, including lateral and one-gear landing. Dynamic loads from the engine arising from an imbalance due to different failure scenarios related to fan blades being lost; the worst failure scenario was used in the design. The selected concept is assembled into a parameterised finite element model containing 30 design variables. The design is optimised using a design of experiments created using Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Four failure modes are computed using a combination of finite element outputs and (semi-)analytical equations accounting for structural instabilities.<br/><br/>The obtained result is a parameterisation of the primary engine mounting structure of the Flying-V, having a structural mass of 3411 kg per half-wing-fuselage and a minimum margin of safety of 0.09 concerning column buckling of a stiffener. This critical margin of safety is found in the lateral landing load case, which introduces a significant moment on the structure. Moreover, the second most critical failure is produced by the maximum thrust of the engine during take-off.<br","Flying V; Engine pylon structure; Landing gear structure; Unconventional aircraft; Unconventional configurations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying-V",""

To achieve a circular economy in the built environment, it has been evidenced in the literature and practice that governance mechanisms in inter-organizational collaboration are required between the multiple parties involved to quickly rethink the purpose of the project, the desired outcome, and the aligned efforts towards the solutions of circular challenges. This research gains insight into the governance mechanisms that have proven to be desirable or beneficial in the collaboration between public clients and main contractors during the front-end phase in building projects with circular values. It is accomplished through two stages: (1) a comprehensive literature review was conducted where 25 articles were selected based on keywords related to inter-organizational collaboration. It brought the most representative knowledge of the existing forms and types of collaboration on construction projects, as well as an existing framework created to analyze the approaches for coordination, adaptation, and safeguarding of exchanges between the focal parties of inter-organizational projects. The literature included a second search of current circular practices in construction projects; (2) a multiple-case study strategy was conducted to explore how the inter-organizational collaboration between public clients and contractors was governed toward the delivery of circular building projects. Data was collected from publicly available documents and semi-structured interviews on the three cases that shared the most similar approach based on applied circular practices. This study's result contributes to the current literature and practice by asserting that governance mechanisms in inter-organizational collaboration between public clients and main contractors facilitate the adoption and implementation of circular practices in building projects. The results expressed that relational and contractual governance mechanisms complement one another in goal-setting, capability building, roles and decision-making, rewarding, coordination, and monitoring. Various governance mechanisms within each of these dimensions can be employed to pursue circular practices under specific contexts, thereby supporting the transition to a circular economy in building projects.","Built environment; Buildings; Circular economy (CE); Management; Governance; Public clients; Contractors; Collaboration; Contractual; Relational","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The results identified after late 2019 show a large change, with flooding from extreme rainfall as a possible cause. The paddy fields may have been completely flooded and the infrastructure destroyed. Policy changes in Rwanda’s agriculture may also be a contributing factor. Among them, the implementation of land consolidation policies can influence some of the farmers’ options, for example, by withdrawing from the rice planting program. The absence of official data and field data makes this project not being able to provide definite reasons for the results. The open discussion of this project makes it exploratory and offers the possibility for potential follow-up studies.

One of the main sources of OMPs is wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. One of the most recent Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) technology is photo-electrocatalysis (PEC), which can produce radicals to oxide OMPs in an aqueous medium driven by solar energy and an external bias potential. In this study, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis was determined as a proper method to fabricate the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction. Then, the prepared photoanodes were characterised by X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), UV-vis and Incident Photo-to-electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE). The results demonstrated the ZnO/BiVO4 heterojunction was successfully fabricated on the Fluorine-Tin-Oxide (FTO) glass. Moreover, the LSV and EIS analysis were carried out in this study to analyse its photo-electrochemical properties. The PEC degradation experiments were carried out in 10 μg/L of 11 OMPs spiked in MiliQ and in real WWTP effluent under simulated solar illumination at 1 V potential bias for three hours. Nine and four of 11 OMPs had achieved more than 70 % degradation efficiency when ZnO/BiVO4 photoanode was conducted to degrade spiked MiliQ and spiked real WWTP effluent. Except for diclofenac and sotalol, the real effluent showed inhibition to the degradation efficiencies and kinetic coefficient of the other nine OMPs. The concentrations of TOC, COD and NO3-N increased after the PEC process. The increase was found to be related to the disintegration of the carbon stick cathode. To further enhance the PEC process, the ZnO@GD/BiVO4 photoanode and adding persulfate were conducted the PEC degradation experiments separately in spiked real WWTPs effluent. Both two approaches showed an enhancement of the PEC process and improved degradation efficiencies. The results obtained in the present work reveal that the PEC process has excellent potential for the removal of OMPs from WWTPs effluent.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-10","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

In a plethora of regions in the Northern Hemisphere, agricultural, industrial, and drinking water supply are highly dependent on seasonal snow. In addition, the melting of seasonal snow regulates the magnitude and timing of high and low flows, controls the length of the growing season, and determines land surface warming via the albedo feedback. The aim of the study is to quantify the local and regional dynamics of snow cover in the Taurus mountain range and to identify the main climatic drivers responsible for the detected snow cover variability. A data-driven approach based on satellite observations is followed for the systematic analysis of large-scale snow cover in the region of interest. Compared to various remote-sensing snow cover studies that focus either on small/catchment scales, with limited spatial context, or on continental scales that cannot provide detailed insights into a specific region, this study investigates local and regional spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of snow cover across a specific mountain range of interest. The objectives of this study are: (a) to quantify the snow cover temporal variability in the different sub-regions of the Taurus mountain range, (b) to analyze the trends and to identify the regional differences, and (c) to examine the sensitivity of annual snow cover duration to inter-annual climatic variability. The Taurus Mountain Range is divided into sub-regions, using the WWF HydroSHEDS Basins Level 3 dataset and the Köppen–Geiger climate classification map, and in100-m elevation bands. The temporal variability of snow cover is quantified by the Regional Snowline Elevation (RSLE). The Regional Snowline Elevation (RSLE) is estimated in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using the methodology developed by Krajci et al. (2014). The temporal trends of the annual number of snow cover days (Dsc), for the different elevation zones in each sub-region, are derived from the RSLE time series and are analyzed using a modified Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test. The sensitivities of Dsc to the inter-annual variability of winter temperature and precipitation and the snow cover duration trends are estimated in each tile and for all elevation bands in all sub-regions. In general, the analysis carried out, considering its limitations and uncertainties, found that there is no reason to be concerned about future water shortages in the area of the Taurus Mountain Range due to the decrease in the amount of water stored as snow. This is a positive outcome that indicates that there are no significant future changes in snow cover patterns and, as a result, the availability of water in the region will not be at risk.","Snow cover; RSLE; Taurus Mountains; GEE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","37.000000, 33.000000"

It is therefore important that PT accessibility is distributed in an equitable, or fair, manner. This thesis evaluates the equity of a PT network according to three distinct distribution principles, defined as alternative ideas of what constitutes a fair distribution of resources. Egalitarianism, proportionality, and sufficientarianism are applied in separate equity evaluations of the same area, resulting in the identification of zones of surplus and deficit accessibility according to each principle. When comparing the results of the three equity evaluations, it is found that both the locations and magnitudes of accessibility surpluses and deficits differ between principles. Some principles have deficit zones in common at the periphery of the study area, indicating that the borders of concessions may have been somewhat neglected in the service planning process. However, overall, the main finding is that a PT network that is equitable according to one principle may not be equitable according to another. It is also attempted to use the results of each equity evaluation to make frequency modifications to achieve a more equitable PT network according to each principle. Equity evaluation according to egalitarianism and proportionality were found to not be possible due to the circular calculations inherent in the methodology. It was possible to use the results of the sufficientarianism equity evaluation in network design, therefore this principle can be used as an input in the network planning process. Although further research is still required, these findings can help to inform the incorporation of equity in future PT planning policy, for example through inclusion in concession requirements.","Public transport network; Public transport modelling; Accessibility; Equity; Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The main focus is given to the low-voltage distribution grid level, and a case study is presented for the Drechtsteden subnetwork operated by Stedin, which, together with the IEPG department at TU Delft, is the promoter of this study. The novelty items of this work consist in the analysis of the waste heat potential of hydrogen conversion assets connected to a district heating network along with the inclusion of electricity and hydrogen markets, all in the contest of an energy system optimization. <br/><br/>The integration between these three energy sectors is assumed to be chiefly driven by the operation of electrolysers and fuel cells. Two other main assumptions set the base for this work: first, the gas sector is assumed to be entirely repurposed to operate with hydrogen and, secondly, the waste heat coming from fuel cells and electrolysers is assumed to be the main thermal energy input of a district heating network. An electricity and a hydrogen market have also been modelled to simulate the interaction of this region with the external grid.<br/>The analysis is carried out by means of a linear optimization algorithm coded using oemof, an open source python package for multi-energy system modelling and optimization. Most of the input data (i.e. energy demand and generation profiles) comes from the Integrale Ifrastructuurverkenning 2030-2050 study from TenneT, Gasunie and the Dutch DSOs, which has been regionalized for the Drechsteden region is order to optimize the investments on the main energy assets (transformers, hydrogen substations, electrolysers, fuel cells, batteries) needed to run the future energy system.<br/><br/>An optimal system configuration is also calculated for a ""reinforcement"" scenario, in which energy sectors remain independent, and a comparison with the system integration scenario is presented. The overall system costs appear to be only about 5% lower for the system integration scenario. The costs imputable to assets is higher with system integration due to the addition of expensive hydrogen conversion assets, but, in this scenario, the operation on the energy market (driven chiefly by hydrogen exports) is more advantageous. <br/>Finally, a sensitivity analysis on the share of heat demand to be satisfied by district heating and on the price of batteries is carried out, along with an investigation on the effect of adding thermal storage to the system.","Energy system optimization; Energy System Integration; District Heating; Waste Heat; Hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-17","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, the defects on the SiC-oxide interface degrades the performance of the device and even get worse at high temperature, such as the threshold voltage shifting problems, limiting the design of the integrated circuits. The thesis models, characterise, analyses, measures and extracts the traps of SiC MOSCAP, to understand the trapped charge transportation and unreliability mechanism under high temperature.<br/>Effectively using SiC materials necessitates the need to understand the physical properties itself. Due to the large bandgap, the inversion layer cannot be observable in low frequency C-V measurement. The electrical field, space charge region, surface potential and C-V curve in SiC devices all differ from Si devices. More importantly, the trapped charges fluctuate the surface potential of the SiC devices. To give insight into the mechanism governing the trapped charges, the mathematical solution of the trapped charges in the whole bandgap is solved.<br/>To be specific, the trap behaviour at a single energy level is then followed. A nonzero transient current is generated due only to the capture and release of the trapped charges when the equilibrium condition is broken. The trapped charges with high energy are thermalized and an equivalent admittance is obtained which further be split into a capacitance and a conductance.<br/>Rising temperature activates the dopant atoms that are not ionised, and the Fermi level shifts towards the midband. The variation of equivalent circuit components and physical parameters responds to the temperature. High temperature expands the SiC crystal and the trapped charges are easy to receive energy from phonons so that the interaction between traps and the conduction band is enhanced and more empty states are waiting for the recombination of the charge carriers.","Silicon carbide; Near interface trap; Temperature dependence; Threshold voltage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-17","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The synthesized virtual environments are beneficial for many downstream applications such as 3D modeling, building inspection, virtual reality, etc. As conventional scene reconstruction methods often require expensive data collections and prior information on the geometry, a learning-based method named Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained a surge of interest within the computer vision community recently for its capacity to achieve state-of-the-art view synthesis performance and achieve photorealistic rendering from only a sequence of RGB images as the input. However, NeRF has a strict requirement for input images with accurate camera poses, which is often not available in real-life applications. To this end, we provide an end-to-end guideline for 3D scene reconstruction using NeRF under a real-world scenario the objective is to reconstruct the HDB facade in Singapore. This guideline requires only RGB images as the input and can achieve photorealistic rendering results which are competitive with the results from the conventional point cloud-based method. Besides, we build our own models upon NeRF and also improve its performance in representing fine details. We first research that the ability to represent high-frequency contents in the signal is limited by its ReLU activations in the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network, and demonstrate that mapping the input to the MLPs from low dimensional space to high dimensional space significantly improves the reconstruction and view synthesis quality. Afterward, We make several attempts to perform input mapping. We first use Gaussian-distributed Fourier features to replace the original positional encoding used in NeRF. Then, we research the activations in coordinate MLP and propose an embedding-less NeRF model equipped with parameterized sine activations called SIRENeRF. Next, we extend the use of parameterized activations from sine activations to a class of non-periodic activations and propose a trainable activation scheme that not only achieves higher scene reconstruction results but also enjoys better flexibility to different datasets. Experiments show that all of the above attempts outperform the positional encoding in terms of scene reconstruction and view synthesis results.","3D Reconstruction; Deep Learning; Neural Radiance Fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Less research, however, has been done to understand the cortical contribution of these M2 reflexes and what affects the muscle stretch evoked potentials. This research investigates the relationship between the stretch evoked potential and the corresponding M2 reflexes. We investigate the effects of the traditional ’Resist’ and ’Let Go’ tasks with a wrist manipulator on the evoked potential and M2 reflex, as well as the effect of longer periods between perturbations. This research showed that between the ’Let Go’ and ’Resist’ tasks, no difference in evoked potentials were present. There was a difference in the late M2 reflex however. The evoked potential was affected by the time between perturbations. A higher time between perturbations elicited a higher cortical response at the motor cortex as well as a higher M2 reflex. This result suggests that besides the task goal, the habituation and time between perturbation can be a significant factor at both the muscle as well as cortical levels. These results facilitate more elaborate research where the effect of these factors is investigated during voluntary movements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Facial expression recognition on head-mounted devices (HMDs) is an intriguing research field because of its potential in various applications, such as interactive virtual reality video meetings. Existing work focuses on building a supervised learning pipeline that utilizes a vast amount of labeled periocular images taken by the built-in cameras. However, the labeling process requires intensive manual work, which is costly and time-consuming. In this thesis, we apply self-supervised learning techniques that leverage unlabeled periocular images to learn representations for facial expression recognition tasks. When the model is trained through self-supervised learning, it is transferred as a feature extractor to form multiple individual inference models. In addition, as most deep-learning models only accept low-resolution images due to heavy computing overload with large input sizes, images taken by modern cameras on HMDs are often aggressively down-sampled to match the model input. To improve the model’s usability and speed up the model, we train the models using the frequency representations of images rather than conventional RGB pixel arrays. We conducted extensive evaluation experiments with a dataset of 23 invited volunteers. The results show that the self-supervised models achieve comparable performance with existing approaches, and, at the same time, the number of labels used is reduced by approximately 99%. By training in the frequency domain, the model is 1.89 times faster in training and 1.23 times faster in inference with reduced input size.","facial expression recognition; self-supervised learning; contrastive learning; image frequency domain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

During the mission, the vehicle uses a motion planning and controls algorithm to follow the planned route while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Motion planning algorithms generally plan over a future time horizon to smoothly follow the route and determine the car's optimal control (steering/acceleration). For planning through a future horizon, one requires the possible positions of all the relevant obstacles in future time-steps. Solutions for predicting an obstacle's future trajectory usually involve neural networks to perform sequence learning and generative algorithms to create multiple possibilities for a pedestrian's future state. This is done by attempting to learn the underlying distribution describing the obstacle motion. However, in practice, one cannot evaluate if this learnt distribution is accurate. This thesis addresses this issue by introducing a fully data-based alternative for trajectory prediction called the Partitioned Experience Method (PEM), which predicts future trajectories based solely on previously recorded data. In this way, it is not necessary to explicitly learn the underlying distribution of the pedestrian motion. The implemented trajectory prediction is validated using two metrics, recall and variance, introduced in this work. The trajectory prediction is also evaluated using a state-of-the-art motion planning algorithm. The results obtained from the motion planner indicate that using the PEM reduces the number of collisions and close contacts with other road users, and the corresponding trajectory followed by the car is closer to the reference trajectory.<br","Trajectory prediction; Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction; Motion planning; Scenario Based Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Grocery e-commerce has been rapidly increasing in recent years, posing a new challenge for retailers as groceries, unlike other goods, have a limited shelf life. Thus, customers expect their orders to arrive quickly and undamaged. Currently, most processes between a customer placing an order and the delivery are performed manually in a warehouse making it labor-intensive and time consuming. The use of autonomous robots in these environments can help improve operational efficiency and productivity while at the same time reducing labor costs and accidents. <br/><br/>One specific process important for maintaining the desired quality of the customer's ordered items and fast delivery is item packing. For an autonomous robot to pack items independently, it must learn and predict possible placement positions that are both geometrically feasible and semantically plausible so that items maintain their desired quality. Retail-related environments are heterogeneous environments containing many different items. Thus, instead of the robot knowing what the item is, it is more beneficial to know how an item can interact with a scene. This entails that robots must learn interactions between items and the scene, which are called affordances, to place items in plausible positions. These so-called object-object affordances describe how an object can interact with another object.<br/><br/>In this thesis, object-object affordances are learned to predict where to place items inside a box in an item packing task. With the use of a simulator called SAPIEN, item packing is simulated, and large-scale interaction data is generated. A model is then trained to predict a placement position by giving as input a complete pointcloud of the item to be placed and a partial pointcloud of the scene. An item packing pipeline is then built that can pack items using the trained model. Several item packing experiments are performed to pack single items and a list of items. The results show that the model successfully learns the semantic relationships between objects resulting in packing items in stable and plausible positions. Several other experiments are performed to evaluate whether the model is generalizable to novel items and real pointcloud data. Results show that the model successfully predicts where novel items should be placed. The model can also adapt to real pointcloud data of a box and predict where items should be placed in a real box containing real items.","item packing; object-object affordances; pointcloud; SAPIEN simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Yang, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Extreme precipitation can often cause serious hazards such as flooding and landslide. Both pose a threat to human lives and lead to substantial economic loss. It is crucial to develop a reliable weather forecasting system that can predict such extreme events to mitigate the effect of heavy precipitation and increase resilience to these hazards.<br/>Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models play the dominant role in the field of weather forecasting. However, due to their long computational time, these models had limited utility in predicting weather conditions in the following several hours. This gap is filled by nowcasting, an observation-based method that uses the current state of the atmosphere to forecast future weather conditions for several hours. Operational nowcasting systems typically apply extrapolation algorithms to rainfall radar observations based on simple physics assumptions. However, the physics constraints also limit the performance, and the methods can hardly capture non-linear patterns in the radar observations. Besides the conventional methods, deep learning models have started to play an essential role in this field. Recent works have shown the promising potential of using deep learning models to tackle the nowcasting task, which is also this thesis's focus.<br/>The thesis work mainly studied in two directions: the development of novel deep generative models for precipitation nowcasting and the application of statistical approaches for better modeling and prediction of extreme events. For the first direction, our proposed model is inspired by recently developed deep learning models from the field of visual synthesis. The model makes use of a two-stage structure: the first stage is a Vector Quantization Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) which compresses the original high-resolution radar observations into a low-dimensional latent space. The second stage works in this latent space. It contains an autoregressive Transformer that models the probabilistic distribution of latent space data. The trained Transformer can predict the latent space representation of future frames. For better modeling and prediction of extreme events, Extreme Value Loss (EVL) is proposed and incorporated with the autoregressive Transformer. The loss function aims at penalizing predicting extreme cases as non-extreme and predicting non-extreme cases as extreme in order to solve the high imbalance between extreme and normal precipitation data. Our results show that the proposed model shows comparable performance with the state-of-the-art conventional method and other deep learning nowcasting models. The proposed EVL has also been shown to improve the overall performance and accuracy in predicting extreme events.","Precipitation Nowcasting; Deep Generative Model; Extreme Value Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","class=""MsoNormal"">The Arctic is warming more rapidly than other latitudes, which can result in the release of additional greenhouse gasses, global sea level rise and increase in extreme weather events. Additionally, this causes the rapid decline of sea ice and an ice free Arctic might occur during the summer in the 2040s. The decreasing sea ice cover accelerates the warming of the Arctic, which is known as the albedo feedback system. Solar radiation management (SRM) can be a solution to diminish or possibly stop sea ice decline. Within SRM a proposed technology, known as Arctic Ice Management (AIM), is distributing water on top of existing sea ice to increase the ice thickness enough to survive the summer melt. This raises the question: What water volume should AIM distribute on top of existing sea ice to counteract the annual Arctic sea ice volume loss? Based on data obtained during the period 1979-2020, the September trends for ice extent, ice area and ice volume are -83 400 km2yr-1, -49 200 km2yr-1 and -322 km3yr-1 respectively. The ice volume is considered as target parameter, as it accounts for both absolute areal ice loss and overall decreasing ice thickness. There are two main ice drift patterns in the Arctic: The Beaufort Gyre in the Beaufort Sea and the Transpolar Drift, of which the latter exports ice through Fram Strait into the Greenland Sea. Literature shows the ice remains within the Arctic for about five years when located in the Beaufort Sea and one to two years when located in the Transpolar Drift. For both locations, the ice decay is determined using an analytical approach first. This approach shows resemblance for ice located in the Beaufort Sea, but generally overestimates the ice decay in the Transpolar Drift. For this reason, an empirical approach is developed to determine the survival ice thickness. This results in accurate trends for ice decay of -2.1 to -2.7 cm day-1 in the Beaufort Sea and -0.8 to -1.4 cm day-1 in the Transpolar Drift. Considering 91 melting days results in an average survival thickness of 2.18 and 1 m respectively. AIM can be used to increase the ice thickness beyond this survival thickness and an AIM model is developed to show ice growth including AIM. The model concludes the AIM thickness, initial ice thickness prior to flooding and freezing duration after AIM define the effective ice thickness increase. The model is validated with small scale experiments, which indicate a delay between the flooding phase and continued natural ice growth. This delay can be the effect of the duration required to restore the temperature profile in the ice after flooding as shown by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. Considering the AIM model, it is discouraged to implement AIM on ice thicknesses below 0.6 m and suggested for ice thicknesses approaching 1 m or higher to optimize the effective increase. The required water volume to compensate the annual sea ice volume loss highly depends on the location, initial ice thickness and target ice thickness and varies between 707 to 1095 km3 in the Beaufort Sea and between 386 to 464 km3 in the Transpolar Drift for the methods discussed in this research. To pump up this water volume, the expected power requirements are 4.5 to 7.0 GW and 2.5 to 3.0 GW respectively.","Arctic ice management; Arctic engineering; sea ice; ice loss; ice melt; ice growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This limits the number of solutions we can evaluate. When optimizing with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) a frequently used approach is to approximate the objective using a surrogate function, replacing the time-consuming real evaluation. This surrogate model is combined with a so-called acquisition function, to select promising candidate solutions. The acquisition function balances the trade-off between exploration of parameter space and the exploitation of the surrogate. These candidates are subject to an expensive evaluation with the true objective function and are used to update the surrogate model. Iteratively applying this process can effectively optimize global optimization problems. In this work, we propose a new multi-objective optimization algorithm with inverse distance weighting as surrogate function, which we call IDW-SAEA (inverse distance weighting surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm). We introduce a new objective to the optimization problem to improve exploration and reduce the complexity of the acquisition function. We show this algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art kriging-based surrogate-assisted EAs on certain benchmark problems. Additionally, we use the algorithm to optimize a practical problem: a Finite Element Method simulation of the cervix region with applications in radiotherapy for cervical cancer.","evolutionary algorithm; Surrogate; expensive optimization; inversed distance weighting; Multi-objective optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Years of experience in the offshore industry, a heavy industry that contributes significantly to the climate crisis through its environmental impact, is deemed to change its strategy and way of working. However, this challenge is relatively new and asks for a new approach to move along with the fast-changing requirements of clients and external regulations that can have financial consequences if one is not acting now. Engineering solutions to reduce and prevent impact are already aligned, thinking of shore power, carbon capture and storage techniques, and alternative fuels on the vessels. Nevertheless, the total environmental impact goes beyond the implementation of these technologies. Making a change on the total impact of a marine contractor asks for a behavioural change within the organization, towards decision-making taking care of the environment. Finding a balance in actions that lead to investing in sustainable technologies and setting every employee to actions that flourish within to contribute to the company's sustainability ambitions will help improve their environmental performance. This research explores how to stimulate and support sustainable behaviour within project scope in a marine contracting organization through designing a suitable intervention. This intervention combines the design principles discovered with theories from gamification. From creative thinking and exploring the different means of gamification in a sustainability context, gamification was chosen as a suitable format for the intervention. The objective of the intervention is to stimulate people to think of sustainable solutions in their work by making them aware of environmental impact and actions. More important, it is a fun and interactive introduction to highlight the contribution one has to the total environmental footprint of the company. The game is designed to be played by project teams that start with the project's conceptual design phase within a marine contractor organization. The game's purpose is to become aware of the environmental impact indicators and actions and to share individual values by deciding what investments to make in reducing the impact of the fictitious project. Players are challenged during the game to make strategic decisions to design their fictitious wind project that will have an as low as possible environmental impact. This is to make sustainability and environmental impact more tangible for the project team and ensure that employees can start discussions on sustainability within the marine contracting industry from a common ground and experience on sustainability.","Sustainable Behaviour; Stimulate; Support; Awareness; Marine Contractor; Gamification; Project scope; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

These graphs give physicians insight into the potential pathology of the heart. In order to come to a diagnosis, physicians use electrocardiograms in combination with follow-up physical examinations. There has been extensive research into automated methods that can differentiate healthy individuals from pathological individuals<br/>when given only an electrocardiogram. Some of these methods make use of neural networks that do feature extraction and classification in an end-to-end fashion. Related research performs feature engineering on ECG data followed by clustering. The evaluation shows that the resulting clusters coincide with heart pathology annotations. This master thesis describes the search for a machine<br/>learning pipeline, where a combination of an input representation, autoencoder, and clustering algorithm produces clusters coinciding with heart pathology without being biased by either heart pathology annotations or feature engineering that is already known to be predictive of heart pathology. Although the preexisting methods yield state-of-the-art accuracies, they do not allow us to learn about the structure and patterns in the data and the supervised methods are very costly to create. There has been no research into feature extraction by autoencoder followed by unsupervised clustering. Doing this could expose patterns in the data that could lead to improved diagnostics of heart pathology, and to automatic methods that are cheaper to create by turning the problem of diagnosis into an unsupervised or semi-unsupervised problem. In order to find the combination of input representation, autoencoders, and clustering that is best suited for predicting heart pathology from ECG signals, experiments are done that give insight into how much the resulting clusters coincide with heart pathology. The experiments work by first feeding some representation of one-second ECG objects into the autoencoder, after which the resulting low-dimensional representations are fed into a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm gives every low-dimensional ECG object a cluster label. The cluster labels are mapped to heart pathology labels by making use of existing heart pathology labels. This heart pathology label can now be interpreted as a class prediction in the context of classification. This setup is created to quantitatively answer to what degree the resulting clusters coincide with heart pathology. In the end, the concatenated image plot representation objects fed into a convolutional autoencoder followed by SOM clustering are compared to existing research. The classification accuracy achieved by the autoencoder pipeline formed in this research is 0.76 ± 0.01. This means that the clusters formed by the existing research coincide much more with heart pathology labels than the clusters from this research. A qualitative visualization from the low dimensional representations after the autoencoder, however, shows that the setup from this research is better at identifying patient IDs than heart pathology. This means that the features extracted by the autoencoder are salient for identifying persons, but not for identifying heart pathology.","ECG; Autoencoder; Clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, how the airport can develop and adopt the infrastructure needed for LH2 supply logistics, storage, and refueling is researched. This process can be defined as a socio-technical transition in which a new niche technology (LH2 aviation infrastructure) develops to ultimately replace the incumbent regime (traditional kerosene-based fuel infrastructure). The process of gaining a deeper understanding of how this transition will look is guided by the transition management cycle. The methodological framework of this research followed certain steps of the transition management cycle for a specific case airport in order to explore this transition. The transition to LH2 infrastructure for Schiphol airport was addressed in order to gain in-context knowledge on the transition at hand. An extensive literature review was used in part to develop an initial infrastructure vision for Schiphol. Then, in an iterative manner, expert interviews were used to further develop an infrastructure vision which is expected to work best for the specific environment in which Schiphol finds itself. The opportunities and challenges which are apparent with this infrastructure vision were then defined. These previous findings, along with transition management theory, were used to develop a transition roadmap for Schiphol. The Schiphol-specific infrastructure vision and transition roadmap gave insight into this transition in a specific context and allowed for more general learnings to be gained on the nuances and factors influencing such a transition. The key parameters which determine how LH2 infrastructure will look at an airport along with a generalized transition roadmap were generated with this knowledge.<br/><br/>The way in which the LH2 infrastructural systems for LH2 supply, storage, and refueling will look for an airport are very dependent on a number of factors. Regarding the supply of LH2, an airport needs to consider its geographic proximity to a transport hub; forecasted LH2 demand; and the area, natural resources, and funds available to the airport. Storage methods will largely be based on an optimization of efficiency, required sizing, and safety. And the refueling infrastructure will likely be dependent on LH2 demand, safety considerations, and the funding available. Determining these parameters and thus determining the LH2 infrastructure vision for an airport is a central step in this transition. However, there are many other steps which need to be taken in parallel in order to develop the niche effectively. In the transition roadmap actionable steps regarding developing operational procedures, supply chains, financial sustainability, and policy are all highlighted. Then, there is also a focus on the steps to take to ensure that scaling up of this infrastructure as LH2 aviation adoption increases is addressed.<br","Socio-technical transition; Liquid hydrogen; Sustainable Aviation; Airport infrastructure; Liquid hydrogen aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

However, as collaboration is subject to ambiguous factors that influence both the content of the project and the social elements, it is proven to be difficult to achieve this mission. Elemental differences in the goals, ambitions and responsibilities of clients and contractors during projects still exist and cause differences in perception. One of the elements collaborations are subject to, are external factors. These are especially hard to deal with due to the fact that the occurrence of said factors is beyond the control of the project team. This research provides insight in this volatile environment with the aim to increase the resilience of collaborations by answering the question: “What external factors are present during construction projects that influence the collaboration between client and contractors and how can the impact of these events be reduced up-front?”. To answer this question, a Q-study is performed. As input for this study, a model of the project environment distinguishing the internal and external project environment is created. The model defines 8 domains of external factors which influence client-contractor collaboration: economic, technological and political -context, the parent organisation of both client and contractor, subcontractors, related projects &amp; surroundings and lastly the stakeholders. From the Q-study four perspectives on external factors are retrieved, confirming the difference in perception of the external factors for individuals, based on their respective role and organisations in the collaboration. To reduce the influence of external factors on the dynamics within the project team, a framework of measures to create resilient collaborations is composed. The measures are divided in three categories: preliminary organisation, creating flexibility and attention to soft side. Each category is elaborated on with specific measures and which domains are addressed by implementing these measures. Moreover, the implementation in the project life cycle is explained making the framework directly usable for project organisations.","Collaboration; Project environment; External factors; Project organization; Client-contractor collaboration; Disruptions; Q-study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Vuik, Cornelis (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to their attractive characteristics, convertible and callable bonds became a more important class of fixed-income products within the financial market. Therefore, the need for fair and accurate pricing of convertible and callable bonds increases. Where the convertible option can be considered as a right for the bondholder, the callable option is a right assigned to the bond issuer. Moreover, due to the hybrid nature of a convertible bond, it both contains characteristics of fixed income and equity products. As a consequence, both the risk of default and the possible equity profits need to be taken into account when valuing convertible bonds. Furthermore, as many convertible bonds also include a call option, an extra early exercise feature due to this call option needs to be taken into account. This early exercise option further increases the complexity of the valuation problem, as a possible buyback of the bond before maturity needs to be considered in the value of the bond. Computing a fair and accurate price for convertible and callable bonds, therefore gives rise to a complex valuation problem which leads to the need for further research. <br/>In this thesis, a structural default model is used to value callable convertible bonds. Contrary to reduced-form models, structural default models are characterized by the rationale behind the default event. Due to the better rationale and new insights into possible better market fits, structural default models have gained new interest in academic research. Recent research is conducted on finding new numerical techniques used for approximating the prices of complex financial products. This thesis discussed different valuation methods as proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz, Lord et al. and Oosterlee and Grzelak applied to the valuation of callable convertible bonds. In particular, a convolution-based method (CONV) and a cosine-based (COS) method are discussed. Whereas the Monte Carlo methods and the CONV method are already used in different articles, the COS method was not yet applied to the callable convertible bond valuation. As the COS method has been proven to be an efficient algorithm for approximating the values of financial derivatives, this thesis uses the COS method to compare its convergence to seek more insights into the convergence of the CONV method. Monte Carlo methods are used to verify the obtained approximations. <br/>For the problem considered under constant interest rates, this thesis shows that the COS method can be derived and applied. For small values of the grid size, the COS method showed to converge much faster than the CONV method. For larger values of the grid size, the CONV method showed to catch up with the COS method to become almost equally accurate. The results also showed that, contrary to the COS method, the CONV method was robust under the choice of the hyper-parameter concerning the integration grid. For the COS method, it was shown that a bad choice of the hyper-parameter could lead to a bad approximation. Although the two-dimensional CONV method shows to converge to the value obtained under Monte Carlo simulation, the results are still off for grid sizes of intermediate size. Results seem to indicate that the amount of grid points is not sufficient for the proposed integration interval and that therefore more grid points are needed. A greater amount of grid points, however, will also indicate a requirement for a greater amount of resources which may not always be available. <br/>From the results of the zero-coupon case, the COS method showed a more rapid convergence towards the approximations obtained by the Monte Carlo methods than the approximations obtained using the CONV method. Furthermore, when taking the hyper-parameters into account, the CONV method showed less robust features than the COS method in the two-dimensional case. Only for a small range of the hyper-parameters convergence is obtained for the CONV method. On the other hand, the COS method clearly shows convergence for a much wider range of hyper-parameters.","bonds; option valuation; CONV method; COS method; convergence analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In this thesis we present a framework for formal control of uncertain systems under complex specifications. We consider dynamical systems with random disturbances, whose probability distribution is unknown. When it comes to the specifications, we focus on those given as syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) formulas. Such formulas resemble natural language, and allow us to reason over complex behaviours of the system.<br/><br/>We follow an abstraction-based approach: we abstract the original system to a finite-state Markov model, in which the state discretization error as well as the distributional ambiguity, are embedded as uncertainties. To do so we make use of tools from optimal transport and ambiguity sets of probability distributions. After that, we synthesize a strategy for the abstraction and obtain probabilistic guarantees that the abstraction satisfies the specifications. Finally, we correctly refine the strategy to one that the original system can follow, and prove that the guarantees we obtained for the abstraction also hold for the original system.<br/><br/>We propose two approaches to obtain the abstraction. First, we propose a data-driven approach to abstract the system into an interval Markov decision process (IMDP) when samples from the unknown distribution is available. Then we use already existing algorithms to synthesize a strategy for the IMDP. Secondly, we propose an approach to abstract the original system into a robust Markov decision process (robust MDP). This second approach is applicable to more general uncertainty models besides the data-driven one, and reduces conservatism of the abstraction. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to synthesize robust strategies for robust MDPs, which also renders the guarantees that the abstraction satisfies the specifications. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approaches through several case studies that involve both linear and nonlinear systems.","Abstraction; Stochastic; Uncertain Systems; Formal Controller Synthesis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor); Della Santina, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Kidney stone disease has become the most common disease of the urinary tract. Flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) is one of the methods to perform diagnosis or treatment for the stones inside the kidney. However, because of the complex structure inside the kidney with multiple calyxes and the limitation of the ureteroscope, surgeons find it difficult to know which calyx is being observed and where the ureteroscope tip actually reaches during the ureteroscopy procedure by only using the ureteroscope camera views. To solve this problem, this thesis proposed an image-matching-based navigation system for robotic ureteroscopy in kidney exploration. The system consists of two parts: pre-operation and post-operation. During pre-operation, the virtual ureteroscopy (VURS) environment is rendered from the 3D kidney model, which is generated from computed tomography (CT) scan data. The VURS images of calyxes inside the kidney are collected and then processed to perform edge feature extraction as the matching virtual image database (VID). In post-operation, real calyx images (RCIs) are collected. For each RCI, image processing is used, and its edge features are extracted as the matching input. By performing the matching algorithm between edge features of the RCI and the VID, the best matching result image in the VID can be found according to the RCI. Then the location of the ureteroscope can be shown in the virtual ureteroscopy environment. This thesis uses an open source kidney model to replace the data from CT scans due to resource limitations. Unity software is used to generate the VURS. The VID is collected manually. A robotic ureteroscope prototype and a 3D-printing kidney phantom based on the open source kidney model are used to simulate the fURS procedure to get RCIs. After applying image processing techniques to RCIs, the shape context (SC) matching method is used to find the best matching image from the VID. The results are validated by the EMT system. The whole system is validated through both simulation images and the experiment. The successful rate of matching the simulation images is 92%, while it reduces to 62.5% when matching the RCIs. This performance difference is caused by the poor image quality of RCIs, which can be improved by selecting a more suitable light source and a digital camera.","Ureteroscopy; Navigation systems; Image Matching; Virtual Endoscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

By changing the working environment, most communication channels between employees shifted from personal conversations and meetings to emails, opening opportunities for attackers to strengthen their attack vectors and target victims through emails to retrieve user credentials. When threat actors are successful, they can log in to legitimate user accounts and cause more damage by, e.g., stealing private information or committing fraud under the compromised account. Most anomaly detection systems utilize artificial intelligence and meta information of user activities to detect attacks. However, current solutions do not give enough insights into why an activity is classified as malicious, resulting in Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysts spending much time understanding alerts. In addition, using meta information such as time and location is easily manipulable and adaptable by the threat actor.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a state machine-based anomaly detection approach to detect anomalies in user behavior datasets. By processing user actions, we create state machine-based user behavior profiles with FlexFringe.

Moreover, incorporating actual user actions make it harder for attackers to manipulate or imitate the exact user behavior.

(graduation committee); Grieco, Luca (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Healthcare systems worldwide rely heavily on the efficient allocation of caregivers in home- based care. Despite this, to this day, the majority of home healthcare (HHC) organisations plan their operations manually, an extremely time-consuming and labour-intensive task yielding sub-optimal solutions. Research efforts in the operations research (OR) field have extensively studied said problem under the HHC routing and scheduling problem (HHCRSP). However, the separate consideration of the planning of caregivers and re- sources required at visits are considered a relevant gap in the literature, as real-world organisations must plan both simultaneously.<br/>As a solution toward bridging this gap, this paper proposes the introduction of home de- livery vehicles (HDVs) to support HHC operations, in which the vehicles deliver resources required at patient visits in time for consultation. A mathematical formulation consider- ing the routing, scheduling, and synchronisation of caregivers and vehicles is presented, in which partial battery charging alongside hard visit and working time windows are key characteristics. A genetic algorithm (GA) is further developed to solve the proposed for- mulation, which is proven to perform efficiently in benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Simulations were run on data generated synthetically by a sta- tistical model recreating the HHC needs of the London Borough of Islington. The results highlight the potential benefits of adopting such technology, resulting in an average re- duction of the required medical resources of 49.94% and a 19.23% reduction in costs with respect to standard operations using the same number of resources.<br/>Overall, the most economical operating strategy for a HHC organisation was identified to be the purchase of a number of resources equal to the number of visits requiring said re- sources. Such an approach was found to decrease the costs per visit by 1.26% with respect to HDVs. The marginal amount, however, is expected to be diminished in the coming years due to factors not captured in the analysis such as the higher scalability of HDVs and their resulting potential to meet the anticipated growth in demand for HHC, the ex- pected decrease in the price of electric vehicle technology, the economic incentives offered to adopt said technologies, and the potential collaboration between caregivers and HDVs. These, alongside extensions to the proposed model such as non-linear battery charging, are proposed as future research avenues.","Home healthcare routing and scheduling problem; home delivery vehicles; genetic algorithm; Synthetic data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Oertel, Catharine (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Hate speech detection on social media platforms remains a challenging task. Manual moderation by humans is the most reliable but infeasible, and machine learning models for detecting hate speech are scalable but unreliable as they often perform poorly on unseen data. Therefore, human-AI collaborative systems, in which we combine the strengths of humans' reliability and the scalability of machine learning, offer great potential for detecting hate speech. While methods for task handover in human-AI collaboration exist that consider the costs of incorrect predictions, insufficient attention has been paid to estimating these costs. In this work, we propose a value-sensitive rejector that automatically rejects machine learning predictions when the prediction's confidence is too low by taking into account the users' perception regarding different types of machine learning predictions. We conducted a crowdsourced survey study with 160 participants to evaluate their perception of correct, incorrect and rejected predictions in the context of hate speech detection. We introduce magnitude estimation, an unbounded scale, as the preferred method for measuring user perception of machine predictions. The results show that we can use magnitude estimation reliably for measuring the users' perception. We integrate the user-perceived values into the value-sensitive rejector and apply the rejector to several state-of-the-art hate speech detection models. The results show that the value-sensitive rejector can help us to determine when to accept or reject predictions to achieve optimal model value. Furthermore, the results show that the best model can be different when optimizing model value compared to optimizing more widely used metrics, such as accuracy.","human-ai collaboration; machine learning; hate speech detection; crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor); Ummels, B.C. (graduation committee); Gao, Zhen (graduation committee); Sævik, Svein (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With an increasing shift to renewable energies, solutions are required to overcome that variability and unpredictability of power production that comes with it. Hydrogen is one solution that can overcome this issue since it can be produced using renewable energy through electrolysis, it can be transported to shore efficiently by pipelines and it can be stored, like natural gas. Not only can hydrogen be used as a way to store energy, but it can also be used directly as a basis for steel production and for long-distance transport. Using wind energy, specifically offshore wind farms, as the source for hydrogen is an idea that is gaining attention. Currently, wind turbines are electrically connected, bringing their electricity to shore by high-voltage cables, allowing hydrogen to be produced onshore. Hydrogen could however also be produced at a central location in the offshore wind farm or at each individual offshore wind turbine, removing the need for high-voltage cables. The purpose of this research is to explore different methods of hydrogen production and validate a model that can simulate each method. The goal is to be able to compare the different methods and quantify the losses of producing hydrogen offshore as opposed to onshore. A time-based simulation model has been developed to represent an offshore wind farm, which would either produce electricity or hydrogen, which eventually arrives onshore. High-resolution wind data are used to correctly include short-term fluctuations in wind output. The N.O. Jensen wake model is implemented to capture the wake effects. Since wake is typically modelled steady-state, specific attention has been given to include the moving of the wake through the wind park. The power outputs for each turbine in the model could be accurately determined based on the incoming wind data. It is found that the spatial effect reduces wind power variations at the wind farm level to about 22\% of first turbine in the sting, as expected. The output of the simulation model compares the power losses of producing hydrogen through four scenarios. This model uses a total of eleven wind turbine strings of seven 10 MW wind turbines each. The power output calculated would then be used to determine the amount of hydrogen produced. By applying electrical power loss equations and calculating the pressure drops for hydrogen traveling in a pipeline by assuming steady-state and isothermal, the losses are calculated for each scenario. A sensitivity study is performed to see the effects of changing model parameters on each of the different scenarios. The model developed in this thesis allows for comparison of electricity production and hydrogen production by offshore wind turbines. It is found that producing hydrogen at the wind farm level and then transporting hydrogen to the shore (Scenario 2) has lower overall energy losses (kg of hydrogen available on shore) than using electrical cables. The same goes for individual offshore hydrogen production (Scenario 3). A high-level exploration of the economics indicates that both scenarios 2 and 3 are more economically feasible when only looking at transportation costs. It is recommended that further research is done to be able to determine which method of hydrogen production would be the most effective by taking the transportation losses and economics into account.<br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Although the resolution of the planet's image will only be one pixel at first, the intensity of this pixel will change over time because of the orbit around its host star and its diurnal rotation. This intensity as a function of time is called the light curve of an exoplanet. The changes in the light curve as a result of annual and diurnal rotation can in turn be used to obtain information about the surface of the planet, this is called spin-orbit tomography.<br/><br/><i>Aims.</i> The aim of this study is to determine if an exoplanet's surface can be retrieved from its light curve for planet surfaces that can be described by Lambertian, Lommel-Seeliger or Fresnel reflection, or a combination of these. The variation in the light curve due to differences in the planet's surface will be used to find a map of its continents and oceans and to determine what surface types the planet is made of.<br/><br/><i>Methods.</i> This thesis starts by composing a near-equal area segmentation of a sphere to maximize the retrieval of information per pixel of the exoplanet's surface. Additionally, a method for generating artificial planets is described, such that the following method can be tested on light curves, since the current telescopes are not powerful enough to measure an exoplanet's light curve. A linear transformation from the surface to the light curve is constructed to obtain the light curve from the surface. Consequently, this transformation is inverted in order to obtain information about the surface from the light curve. This method is applied to exoplanets with a stationary surface, i.e. no clouds or changing ice caps and is consistent of the following surfaces: water, vegetation, sand and snow, each described by a different reflection model. Lastly, surface retrieval is tested from a light curve with a realistic amount of photon shot noise (SNR ≈ 14).<br/><br/><i>Results.</i> The composed near-equal area segmentation of a sphere is the Voronoi diagram of the Fibonacci lattice. It is a very appropriate near-equal area segmentation, because the maximum difference in facet area is 12% for 1001 points. Furthermore, the retrieval of an exoplanet's surface from its reflected light curve is close to perfect for exoplanets that are described by a combination of the three reflection models if the light curve does not contain noise and there are a sufficient number of data points. If the light curve does contain shot noise, parts of the surface that are described by the Lommel-Seeliger law, are not retrieved correctly. However, the general shape of the surface that is described by Lambertian or Fresnel reflection is still retrieved correctly. If the surface can be described by one single reflection model, the planet's features are retrieved correctly from a light curve with shot noise regardless of the reflection model. <br/><br/><i>Conclusions</i>. Spin-orbit tomography in the form of a linear transformation between the light curve and albedo map of an exoplanet is a very accurate method to retrieve the albedo map from a single observed pixel, even with a realistic amount of shot noise.","Exopcartography; Exoplanets; Light curve; Surface mapping; Astronomy; Spin-Orbit tomography","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/SwederB/BEP-Exocartography/tree/main/Code_Timo Code used for the project","","2022-07-21","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Three initialization methods for the model were used, and also tested for their effectiveness. For the algorithm, a parameter $\gamma$ is introduced that changes the size of some of the moments for the new starting points. Six different values for $\gamma$ were tested for their effectiveness against a test set of suboptimal solutions. <br/>The model with the addition of boundary conditions and the algorithm performed the best out of the three iterations of the model, with an effectiveness of 99.895\%, and an average run time ranging from 0.62 s for 2$\times$2$\times$2 Ni, to 94.64 s for 3$\times$3$\times$3 Fe\textsubscript{2}P, in the case of $\gamma = 0.3$.

It is partly due to their significant economic impact. Decreasing the traveling time, certainly for big organizations, can save costs in the range of millions of dollars and increase their service quality. Moreover, the wide variety of real-world applications comes with very different objective functions and constraints that must be considered. Also, finding optimal or approximate so- lutions in a reasonable time is a challenge for this NP-hard problem. This paper proposes a framework using deep reinforcement learning that can ameliorate VRP instances based on already-found solutions. Most of the research in the literature that uses deep learning to solve VRPs, describes construction algorithms. We, on the other hand, propose an improvement algorithm. We propose a method that takes as input an already found solution of the VRP, then computes the state of each node and vehicle using attention layers. Afterward, a problem-type specific algorithm computes a newly found solution based upon those embeddings. The effectiveness of our framework is then proven with two VRPs, namely the CVRP and the CVRP with strict time windows. They are chosen because of their differ- ence. Because when assigning a node to a vehicle, the order of passage needs to be considered for the CVRP-TW while for the CVRP it doesn’t. They prove the ability of our framework to be applied on very different VRPs-types. Computational experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework compared to the other works that use deep learning to solve CVRPs. It also proves: the broad applicability of our framework, the ability to use deep learning to improve a so- lution based upon an already found solution, and the advantages of using deep reinforcement Learning to solve combinatorial problems.","Vehicle Routing Problem; Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows; Deep Learning; Deep Reinforcement Learning; improvement algorithm; capacitated vehicle routing problem; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This is also true in the case of neurological disorders and diseases, which stem from the body's nervous system. While the nervous system possesses high responsiveness to chemical devices, these same devices can often not target specific locations at the required time.

This is no different for the construction industry. However, the construction industry is placed second in the ranking of most dangerous industries. The Dutch Safety Board, being an independent administrative body, has recommended to integrate a third party into the contractual general terms and conditions such as the UAC for integrated contracts. The objective of this research is to examine whether there is any potential to integrate a third party into the UAC-IC 2005 contract. This potential is being examined using a comparison between the UAC-IC 2005 and FIDIC Yellow Book 1999, a contract in which a third party is already present. In this comparison, the main focus points are the ""vital tasks &amp; responsibilities"" that are necessary in order to safeguard safety on site, safety of the surrounding area &amp; structural safety. <br/><br/>This thesis has found that the three types of safety can be improved if the vital tasks &amp; responsibilities are properly performed. These tasks &amp; responsibilities mainly relate to the management of project specific and safety related risks, and to the safety approach that is a result of this risk management system. From a theoretical point of view, the UAC-IC 2005 and the Dutch Building Decree are able to facilitate these vital tasks &amp; responsibilities. The ON is responsible for most of the vital tasks &amp; responsibilities, and the OG has the possibility to use an external control mechanism to verify this. The practical situation is however different. It is not uncommon that other aspects like time, or money can get more important for the contracting party than proper risk management processes and the corresponding safety approach. Work is not executed as intended, but rather as work-as-actually-done. The OG’s incentives in the UAC-IC can be insufficient for him to effectively perform this external control mechanism. This leads to a possible situation in which no internal nor external control mechanism is present, which is to the detriment of safety. The Engineer, being the party that is responsible for an external independent control mechanism in the Yellow Book’s quality assurance system, does have more incentives to actually make him perform this external independent control mechanism effectively. This incentive has its origin in the uncapped liability which the Engineer can be held liable for. If the Dutch version of the role of the Engineer would be integrated into the UAC-IC, he would be able to improve the three types of safety when he takes over the responsibility for the external control mechanism from the OG under the assumption that this external control mechanism will be performed more effectively. This assumption is valid if the Dutch Engineer would have a comparable liability as in the White Book. Since TNR 2011 would most likely be used in the Dutch construction industry, the liability in TNR 2011 must be increased for Dutch Engineers in order to be comparable to FIDIC’s White Book. <br","Safety; UAC-IC 2005; FIDIC Yellow Book; Vital tasks & responsibilities; Control mechanisms; Incentives; Dutch Engineer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The task of cross-view matching-based localization is to estimate the geo-location of a vehicle-mounted camera by matching the captured street view image with an overhead-view satellite map containing the vehicle's local surroundings. This local satellite view image can be obtained using any rough localization prior, e.g., from a global navigation satellite system or temporal filtering. Existing cross-view matching methods are global image descriptor-based and achieve considerably lower localization performance than structure-based methods with 3D maps. Whereas structure-based methods utilized global image descriptors in the past, recent structure-based work has shown that significantly better localization performance can be achieved using local image descriptors to find pixel-level correspondences between the query street view image and the 3D map. Hence, using local image descriptors may be the key to improving the localization performance of cross-view matching methods. However, the street and the satellite view do exhibit not only very different visual appearances but also have distinctive geometric configurations. As a result, finding correspondences between the two views is not a trivial task. We observe that the geometric relationship between the street and satellite view implies that every vertical line in the street view image has a corresponding azimuth direction in the satellite view image. Based on this prior, we devise a novel neural network architecture called SliceNet that extracts local image descriptors from both images and matches these to compute a dense spatial distribution for the camera's location. Specifically, the geometric prior is used as a weakly supervised signal to enable SliceNet to learn the correspondences between the two views. As an additional task, we also show that the extracted local image descriptors can be used to determine the heading of the camera. SliceNet outperforms global image descriptor-based cross-view matching methods and achieves state-of-the-art localization results on the VIGOR dataset. Notably, the proposed method reduces the median metric localization error by 21% and 4% compared to the state-of-the-art methods when generalizing, respectively, in the same area and across areas.","street-to-satellite image matching; cross-view matching; vehicle localization; SliceNet; street camera localization; visual localization; image metric localization; image matching; local feature matching; pose estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Therefore, leak detection and localization technology is a major concern for water utilities to save water and meet the ever-growing water demand.

The performance of the model-based method is proved to be negatively affected by model errors and limited sensors. To solve these two problems, on the one hand, flows and residuals between observed and model-simulated data in the non-leak situation are used to develop a residual model to calculate offset values for model output correction. On the other hand, graph-based interpolation is introduced to create ‘virtual’ sensor measurements in the presence of a limited number of sensors. The data-driven method proposed in this work uses graph-based interpolation to estimate the head signals at the nodes without sensors and subsequently create pressure maps. Leak localization is achieved by comparing pressure maps in the non-leak and leak situations. In this process, this methodology does not require a well-calibrated model and leak flow information. Both two methodologies are tested on fire hydrant leak tests in DMAs in the United Kingdom. Results obtained by using the model-based method illustrate the positive impact of model output correction on localization results and the performance of this method under different conditions such as different times of the leak and different sizes of leak flow. The data-driven method performs fairly well in DMAs with a higher spatial density of sensors. Furthermore, the results of both two methods are compared to demonstrate the suitability of the methods in different cases.","Leak localization; Model-based methods; Data-driven methods; Graph-based interpolation; Water distribution networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

While it is well known that vascular pathology is a critical contributing factor to dementia, cerebral small vessel disease is often not addressed by these methods, possibly causing impeded generalizability of the models from research setting to clinical practice. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate whether vascular pathology, as represented by white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), influences the outcome of machine learning prediction models for dementia and as such hampers generalizability of these models from the research setting to clinical practice. To answer this research question, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for prediction of cognitive performance measured by MMSE and ADAS13. We used ADNI data and included all subject timepoints that adhered to our inclusion criteria (N = 4846). Next, we derived gray matter density maps (GMDMs) and WMH density maps (WMHDMs) from T1 and FLAIR MRI scans using voxel-based morphometry. Six CNN models were implemented, differing in input: model 1 (GMDM), model 2 (GMDM, age, sex), model 3 (WMHDM), model 4 (WMHDM, age, sex), model 5 (GMDM, WMHDM, age, sex) and model 6 (GMDM, log(WMH ratio), age, sex). WMH ratio was defined as WMH volume corrected for intracranial volume. We split the data into a low, middle and high WMH load group based on WMH ratio tertiles and performed two sets of experiments. First, we trained all models on the low WMH load group with the intention of testing on the high WMH load group as a measure of generalizability. Second, we trained model 2 and 5 on data from all WMH load groups. For these sets of experiments, we split both the low WMH load group and all WMH load groups into a train, validation and test set. The models trained on the low WMH load group obtained a similar performance to prediction of a constant value and prediction by a model developed on randomized cognitive scores. These models likely suffered from the underrepresentation of lower cognitive performance data (i.e. high ADAS13 scores and low MMSE scores). This is supported by the fact that model 2 and 5 outperformed constant value prediction when trained on data from all WMH load groups. The current models did in general not benefit from adding WMHDM input to the model, while they did benefit slightly from log(WMH ratio) information. However, we were unable to answer our research question due to the suboptimal performance of the models. Our future research will focus on revisiting our research question through brain age prediction in order to improve generalizability of ML methods for AD to clinical populations with prominent vascular pathology.","Machine learning; Alzheimer's Disease (AD); Vascular pathology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

The lack of type information poses a new challenge for test case generation techniques.<br/>In this thesis, we propose a novel unsupervised probabilistic type inference approach to infer data types in a test case generation context.

The combination of using both statically and dynamically inferred types improves the approach slightly with a significant increase in 56% of the benchmark files compared to the baseline.

Methanol is expected to be one of the renewable alternatives. However, it evaporates easily compared to for example Diesel and its vapours are toxic and flammable. Regulations prescribe the use of 10m radius hazardous areas around the vent mast connected to the ship's tank. These areas pose stringent limitations on the use of a ship. In this context, knowledge is lacking on the actual risks induced by possible outflows, let alone on outflow mitigation measures. In this research an analytical thermodynamical model of a ship's methanol fuel tank is developed, it is analysed what appropriate safety measures are and what their effectiveness is.<br/><br/>The thermodynamical phenomena inside a ship's tank are inventoried from literature and on a selection of these a model is derived. With the model, outflow values of methanol mass with and without outflow mitigation measures are simulated for various scenarios and tank sizes. The scenarios are (1) heating during the transition from night to day or (2) due to a fire and (3) the most critical post bunker situation. The latter occurs after the ship's tank is filled for the first time prior to which no methanol vapours are present.<br/><br/>It is found that outflow values correspond to a hazardous area size much smaller than the prescribed 10m except for the fire scenario. However, mitigating the outflow with a PRV and with locating the tank floor in contact with the seawater is found to be very effective. With application of mitigation measures, only the most critical post bunker situation results in a hazardous area of larger than 1m, being 1.17m. Assessment of the model accuracy is limited to the presented scenarios, limiting the model applicability to the ranges in which the parameters are varied within this research.","Methanol; Ship; Fuel; Tank; Storage; Risks; Safety; Venting; Outflow; Hazardous Area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-11","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Conventional soil compaction techniques for saturated silty sands often require either high compaction effort or even fail to reach aspired relative densities. This thesis is a follow-up study based on the promising small scale results of Stals 2020. The proposed solution consists of a two-stage method in which, firstly, a soil sample was desaturated by means of Microbially Induced Desaturation (MID) through denitrification and, secondly, dynamically compacted. The objective of this, and previous, research was to assess whether biogenic gas formation could be used as a pretreatment to increase the effectivity of soil compaction techniques. Tests with a height of 1m and 2.5m were developed, opposed to the previous 15cm small scale tests. Series of tests were conducted on a silt-sand mixture of 16% fines. Each series was compacted with both a different compaction method and energy input. The investigated scale effects included: the desaturation stage, bubble growth, bubble distribution, gas migration and final degree of compaction. All treated soils were able to desaturate to, and even below the optimum water content. In this research the in-situ shear strength was linked to swelling and bubble production. Based on a qualitative inspection, the gas distribution in the sample was found to be homogeneous over depth. In order to estimate swelling and venting of the sample during the desaturation stage, a model was produced based on a saturation dependent gas conductivity. It was suggested that a continuous gas phase was responsible for the highest amounts of compactive strain. With a non-intrusive compaction method, more compactive energy led to faster, but not more, release of gas. All 2.5m tests ended with a residual amount of gas. A 1m test series, consisting of three tests resulted in higher degrees of compaction for the treated tests opposed to the untreated tests. The final relative density of the treated tests was at least two times higher than the final relative density of the untreated test. A 2.5m test, which included surcharge, had a final RD 2.8 times higher opposed to a similar untreated test without surcharge. Taking into account the uncertainties of the results, it was concluded that a field trial is feasible. A hypothetical field case was set up of 500 m3. The costs of the proposed method were a factor 2.2 times cheaper opposed to the current soil improvement for silty<br/>sands, namely a stone column vibroreplacement technique.","MID; Compaction; Gas behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-11","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

However, utilizing the CubeSat platform for such missions gives rise to a series of significant technological challenges. Fortunately, the field of inflatable space structures offers some tantalizing solutions to these challenges. Unfortunately, at present the development of these structures is hampered by a technological gap in the required inflation systems. In order to fill this gap, this thesis proposes the development of inflation system optimized for such applications, based on the field of micropropulsion technology. In pursuit of this goal, the main research question shall address the design adjustments required in order to adapt current micropropulsion technology for this purpose. To answer this question the research objectives of the thesis are to first develop a preliminary design for an inflatable BEOC reflector and then, having generated inflation requirements based on this structure, design a custom micropropulsion based inflation system.<br/><br/>This approach involves first identifying a BEOC inflatable reflector design whose continued development will play a key role in enabling and enhancing the development of BEOC missions and inflatable space structures in general. Then the structure is designed with particular focus on the key design considerations that impact the requirements of the inflation system. Following the design of the structure, the requirements for the inflation system are generated. Informed by these requirements, a trade off analysis identified a cold gas system as the most suitable micropropulsion system for inflation applications, as well as the inflation gas and a suitable inflation scheme. After this, the design of the inflation system is performed. It is found that in order to satisfy the inflation system requirements, apart from a unique design approach for the inflation nozzle, minimal design adjustments are required to cold gas micropropulsion technology for inflation purposes. This result demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing micropropulsion technology for the development of optimized inflation systems and provides a clear indication that such systems can play a key role in enhancing and enabling the development of BEOC inflatable structures.","inflatable structure; Inflation System; CubeSat; Micropropulsion; Deployable Structure; interplanetary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

During the first period in the AZC, “newcomers” are purposely distanced from Dutch society. This has as an effect that when they finally get an official refugee status, they have a hard time finding a fitting job. They lack the social network (social bonds, social links and social bridges) that are needed to obtain certain goals or wishes. As previous waves of refugees have struggled to find their role in society, many people consider that the core objectives of integration policies have failed, leaving in their place unfulfilled promises of equal treatment, and polarized or fragmented societies, which strengthens the biases towards newcomers even more (Orton 2012). <br/><br/>As social capital is seen as one of the pillars for successful integration (Ager &amp; Strang (2019), the goal of the graduation project at first was to train locals to be active connectors in linking newcomers to their network in order to help them achieve their goals and ambitions.<br/><br/>Through conducting desk research, interviews, analyzing existing buddy networks and the mapping of newcomer needs, 10 design principles were distilled that helped to define the final design goal. The research and concept ‘Shadow of the Future’ by Besnick (2000) showed that when referring to or when referred to people need to understand past actions to portray this understanding of the future. This resulted in the finding, that there is not such a thing as training locals to be active connectors but locals should get acquainted with newcomers to a level that they feel comfortable to refer them to their network. <br/><br/>Next to this insight, the clustered data gathered through interviews revealed that newcomers experience challenges in paving a new path and setting goals. As newcomers have been raised in a more collectivist culture, they have always acted upon the collective interest. However, with the disappearance of the value of previously obtained degrees and their collective society, awareness of the self and its corresponding goals is crucial, to be alte to function within the dutch individualistic society.<br/><br/>The developed concept, namely a personal growth workshop has been designed in a way to facilitate both the creation of a network and the shaping of goals based on ‘the self’. The workshop creates a space in which newcomers and locals meet to partake in a personal growth workshop. Through a mutual goal, a social script and through offering a way to build ‘the shadow of the future’, the outline of a personal development workshop supports the acquaintance process between local and newcomer.<br/><br/>This workshop has been prototyped, piloted and evaluated iteratively three times. These pilot’s had been used to evaluate the effects on acquainting and personal growth, but also provided insights to develop the concept further. The findings of these pilots showed that the workshop has had a positive effect on the attitude of locals towards newcomers and that the workshop created more awareness of the self. The pilot has great potential in opening up a network through acquainting, but more research has to be conducted to facilitate the right micro interactions.<br/><br","Integration; Refugees; Newcomers; acquainting; acculturation; personal growth; workshop design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

At the same time, most of the post-war buildings in Europe have reached the end of their service life. As a consequence, a period of intense demolition activities with<br/>significant waste generation is expected in the upcoming years. Both situations are eventually translated into significant environmental pressure. Concrete is the main component in construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW). Due to the high environmental footprint of this material, it is crucial to eliminate its consumption<br/>through recycling and re-use. Currently, concrete rubbles are crushed with regular crushers and used mainly for low-grade applications (down-cycling) such as road foundations. Despite the environmental and financial benefits, this practice is still not at a sustainable level since raw materials are still needed for new structures, while the demand for low-quality secondary materials in the construction sector has already declined.<br/><br/>Two innovative recycling technologies called C2CA and Smart crushing (SC) developed recently in the Netherlands, aiming to close the material loop in the construction sector. These technologies recover most of the original concrete materials at high-quality, which can be use in the production of new concrete at<br/>higher rates than traditionally. This research focuses on the environmental and financial implications of the novel C2CA and SC recycling systems as alternative solutions to the Traditional crushing (TC) method. The evaluation was conducted based on an integrated LCA&amp;LCC analysis framework in which the monetised<br/>environmental impacts (shadow costs) were internalised in the actual costs occurred within the supply chain of recycled concrete (production of primary materials, recycling, transports). On this basis, the recycling systems were compared from two different perspectives. First, the recycled materials produced were used for concrete production according to the current European standards. In this case, the traditional recycled coarse aggregates (TRCAs) were used to replace 50% of the primary gravel, while the innovative coarse (IRCAs) and fine (IRFAs) aggregates from the innovative systems replaced 100% of primary gravel and 60% of primary sand respectively. The maximum potentials of the innovative systems were investigated in a second scenario in which IRCAs and IRFAs completely replaced the primary concrete aggregates. In addition to that, the produced recycled concrete powder (RCP) was used as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) to replace 20% of the primary cement. In this study, the innovative recycling systems were considered mobile units located at the demolition site. In contrast, the TC recycling was executed off-site at a stationary plant to secure the sufficient quality of TRCAs. <br/><br/>The results of the integrated LCA&amp;LCC study revealed that both C2CA and SC systems were financially better options than the traditional recycling route. Especially when the SC system was used to replace higher quantities of primary materials, the total cost was reduced by up to 19% relative to the TC method. On the other hand, the C2CA technology showed better performance when following the current standards, where about an 8% cost reduction was achieved. However, environmental improvements were reported only for maximum utilisation of the SC products, resulting in about 17% lower shadow cost than the traditional method. In the case of the C2CA system, the environmental impact was found 5% increase for both scenarios. Both innovative systems displayed overall benefits over the TC method regarding social cost (internalised environmental impacts), with the SC system exhibiting the best overall performance for maximum use of its products. In this case, the overall benefits reached almost 19%, while the rest scenarios were not higher than 5%.<br/><br/>The sensitivity analysis emerged that the innovative recycling systems presented benefits only when they were located close to the demolition site due to increased transportation of EoL concrete. For the same locations and up to 23 km away from the demolition site, only the SC2 scenario (maximum use of SC products) was more efficient than the traditional recycling route. The rest scenarios became more effective as the traditional plant was placed away from the demolition site. On the other hand, changes in the recycling phase, such as energy consumption and equipment operating costs, had a negligible impact on the results. Even if renewable energy sources would power the recycling plants, the environmental and cost benefits throughout the supply chain were not higher than 5% and 2.5%, respectively","Concrete Recycling; C2CA; Smart crushing; Innovative concrete recycling; Sustainability; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing (LCC); Traditional crushing recycling; Advance Dry Recovery (ADR); Heating Air Classification System (HAS); Smart Liberator; Smart Refiner; Concrete supply chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

In particular, the hydrolox combination is the most used as it returns the best Δ&#x1d463; performance thanks to its high specific impulse. However, this class of propellants faces an issue that could jeopardize all the mass savings: boil-off. This consists in propellant evaporation due to heat penetration in the tank structure, and it could become so severe for long storage times (in the order of months) that the additional propellant mass used to make up for the boil-off losses would nullify all the benefits that come from the high impulse of these mixtures.<br/><br/>The approach taken in this work consists in developing a propellant depot sizing model that allows determining the effect of different thermal control design options, thermal environments, and depot configurations for varying mission durations. The model performs a multi-nodal thermal analysis to estimate boil-off rates and allows for taking into account different thermal control methods, which include Multi-Layer Insulation with uniform and variable density distributions and Vapor Cooled Shields. <br/><br/>Using the developed tool, the analysis of different depot architectures is performed. In particular, Low Earth and Geostationary orbits are investigated as locations for a depot, with the possibility to extend the results to the Earth-Moon Lagrange point L1. As for the depot, both single and multi-tank configurations are studied. <br/>Results showed that variable density MLI (VDMLI) improves the effectiveness of the thermal insulation compared to the uniform density case: the most mass efficient designs in terms of insulation plus boil-off mass are achieved with less total number of layers when VDMLI is used. The use of a vapor cooled shield (VCS) additionally reduces the propellant boil-off. However, for the VCS to become advantageous in terms of mass, a minimum storage duration is needed: this corresponds to two months for the LEO depot, and at least six for the GEO depot. This is due to the mass penalty introduced by the addition of the metal shield into the system.<br/>Lastly, it is shown that multi-tank depots have increased boil-off rates than single tank depots because of reflected thermal fluxes among the depot elements. However, some propellant savings come from placing the cryogenic tank in the shadow of the other tanks of the depot station.<br","Cryogenics; Liquid hydrogen; Propellant Depots; Thermal control; Vapor Cooled Shield; Long-Term Storage; System Architecture; In-orbit Storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Previous work has shown that a vertically layered airspace design performs best at improving safety metrics such as the total number of conflicts and Losses of Separation (LoSs). Furthermore, it has been shown that machine learning techniques are capable of selecting heading ranges for the vertically stacked layers in non-uniform traffic scenarios, in order to reduce the number of conflicts and LoSs compared to uniform structures. These works, however, set structures in an ‘empty’ airspace and do not take into account the necessary vertical deviations to get from one structure to the next. In this work reinforcement learning (RL) agents are used to select layer heading ranges, while taking into account the previous airspace structure. During this dynamic structuring, several challenges arise. First, it is not clear how to reduce the number of vertical conflicts when aircraft move into a new airspace structure. Second, specific structures should be selected that reduce the necessary vertical deviations from the old structure, while still minimising the cruising conflicts for the new traffic distribution. The present work is divided into three experiments. Experiment I focused on analysing the number of conflicts and LoSs that aircraft suffer during vertically moving towards their layer in the new structure. Experiment II tested whether a RL agent is capable of setting an aircraft structure in function of the expected future traffic scenario. Experiment III aimed to show the capability of a RL agent to select airspace structures, while taking into account the previous airspace structures, in order to decrease the number of vertical conflicts. The results of the research show that RL methods are capable of defining airspace structures appropriate for a given traffic scenario. For dynamic reconfiguration, it proved challenging to simulate traffic scenarios that cause an agent to select different structures to prevent the occurrence of vertical conflicts. Under the experimental conditions employed, analytical methods of structure selection performed better in terms of safety.","Airspace Design; Airspace Structure; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); Reinforcement Learning; Dynamic Airspace Reconfiguration; BlueSky ATC Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

The most important risk associated with this variability is an unstable grid due to the difficulty of matching production and consumption. A novel way of mitigating this risk is by accurate power forecasting with the aid of machine learning.<br/>This research aimed to create insight into the application of machine learning in the space of renewable power forecasting, by comparing hybrid renewable energy system forecasting models with proposed benchmark models. Improved grid planning and value creation could be two potential benefits of this. In this way, the Dutch TSO, TenneT, and commercial operators can profit from an improved forecasting method.<br/>This study proposes two machine learning techniques for the application of power forecasting. Namely, the tree regressor XGBoost (XGB) and a neural network (NN). Both techniques were used for the models of an individual PV plant and wind farm for the 1-hour and 6- hour ahead forecast horizon. Then, the hybrid models were built with the machine learning techniques and were compared to the individual models and Persistence with respect to the normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE). Next to the NRMSE the value creation of the models was studied with respect to Persistence on the 6-hour forecast horizon.<br/>The results show that all proposed models outperform Persistence on the 6-hour forecast horizon. Furthermore, the results show that the hybrid models for both XGB and NN outperform the individual models on the 6-hour forecast horizon. Overall, the XGB models outperform the NN models on both the forecast horizons. Lastly, the proposed models all created positive value with respect to Persistence.

When citizens don’t follow evidence-based treatments or measures and do take non proven, unuseful or dangerous treatments (Freeman et al., 2022; Montagni et al, 2021; Prieto &amp; González, 2021). This became clear especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. More broadly it is a danger to democracy.<br/><br/>Within the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport there are several hurdles to effectively deal with disinformation. Too narrow and present focussed problem frames are used, with little alignment and a lack of starting points for concrete interventions.<br/><br/>In response to these problems, my design goal is to catalyse a broader and anticipatory problem frame of disinformation, find concrete starting points for interventions dealing with disinformation and align key stakeholders.<br/><br/>Method<br/>A combination of methods is made (Chapter 2). First, systemic design (Meadows, 2020), finding elements, mechanisms and starting points in a system, enables to create a broader problem frame. Second, anticipatory governance (Guston, 2014) adds the temporal dimension, creating an anticipatory problem frame. It consists of four phases. Foresight, creating plausible future images. Engagement, involving people inside the organisation to respond to the plausible future. Integration, implementation of those responses and ensemble harmonising these efforts. Third, experiential futures (Candy, 2010) enable alignment between stakeholders through future prototypes: objects as if they came from the future.<br/><br/>Section 1 - Foresight<br/>Expert interviews and consultation of academic, popular ‘mainstream’ and ‘fringe’ literature is conducted (Chapter 3). This leads to a (dis)information system map (Chapter 4) showing mechanisms that influence the system like doubt, trust, crisis and polarisation. Currently, the system is unbalanced. Yet, there are leverage points where interventions can bring back balance. The second outcome is a driver and trend analysis showing how the elements in the system map might develop. A new systemic and anticipatory problem frame is proposed (Chapter 6) that reveals new threats, but also opens up possibilities to bring balance.<br/><br/>Section 2 - Engagement<br/>A future scenario (Chapter 7) is written that communicates the systemic and anticipatory problem frame. Two aspects are central: <br/>In 2033, we will live in a country with ideological splintering. Due to climate change, an extreme heatwave during the summer causes a great threat to public health.<br/><br/>This scenario is developed into experiential future prototypes (Chapter 8, Figure X). The future prototypes were used in a 1:1 simulation with key stakeholders in the government (Chapter 9). Participants were asked 1) to reflect on the future that was embodied in the artefacts, and 2) to suggest interventions inspired by the future prototypes. The simulation showed alignment (Chapter 10) on the new anticipatory problem frame and even sparked a shared future vision:<br/>Becoming an empowering government based on mutual trust.<br/><br/>Section 3 - Integration and Ensemble<br/>A disinformation team is initiated, together with a policy maker from the Ministry. This makes sure the results from this project can be integrated after the delivery of the thesis.<br","Anticipatory Governance; Experiential futures; Systemic design; Government; Disinformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Both floodings and human influences have caused the Oosterschelde to have its current shape. During the last century before implementation of the Delta plan (1953) the estuary was still expanding as the channels deepened and the tidal flats increased. With the construction of the Delta works the tidal range decreased with 12 % whereas the tidal prism reduced with 31 %. As a consequence of this reduced tidal motion, the tide is not able anymore to counteract the erosion of the tidal flats which is caused by waves/wind. Therefore, the surface area and the height of the tidal flats reduces (‘Zandhonger’). This decrease of tidal area is an undesirable situation as the unique tidal nature of the Oosterschelde provides a lot of functions for both economy (oysters, mussels), ecology and recreation. Furthermore, the Oosterschelde is used as a transport route by cargo vessels.<br/><br/>This research studies the morphological development of a model of the Oosterschelde with two hypothetical interventions: removal of the storm surge barrier (SSB) and applying 2 metre sea level rise (SLR) in 50 years. This is done with four model scenarios: a run with SSB in place, without SLR (1), a run without SSB, without SLR (2), a run without SSB, with SLR (3) and a run with SSB, with SLR (4). This last run was used as sensitivity run in order to see which hypothetical interventions has more impact.<br/><br/>The model results led to conclusions which parts of the model are represented well and which parts of the model need to be improved. The results made clear that current model is promising as the tidal range was modelled correctly for the majority of the Oosterschelde. Also the model represented the tidal prism well compared to the calculated tidal prism (tidal prism = tidal range * wet surface area of the basin – the sediment volume of the tidal flats). It was found too that SLR can be modelled in a correct way by forcing a water level at the boundaries of the model.<br/><br/>It was found that wave activity is an important process with respect to the development of the tidal flats. Therefore, the frequency of the wave computations should be chosen in such way that reliable wave heights are present for each water level during the tidal cycle at all locations in the Oosterschelde. Another key factor which should be improved is the availability of sediment in the model as this determines the (desired) growth of the tidal flats with SLR. Processes/indicators which give information about this availability (ebb/flood dominance, sediment characteristics) can give insight in the development of the tidal flats. With improvement of modelling these two processes it may be possible to improve model capabilities.","Delft 3D; Oosterschelde; Sea level rise; Morphodynamic modelling; Long-term development; Storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.640202,3.775201"

Of particular concern is the amount of global warming we are facing now and in the future, as it is becoming more likely that even if our emissions are significantly reduced, global warming will reach at least 2∘&#x1d436; (Arias et al., 2021). Much research concerns the future contribution of the GrIS to sea level rise for high emissions scenarios and low emission scenarios, but there are few studies giving the main focus to what is becoming a more likely future, the moderate emissions scenarios. This research aims to quantify the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet and subsequent contribution to future sea level rise under a moderate CO2 concentration scenario over a multimillennia timescale. An idealised simulation of 3000 years, where CO2 concentrations are increased by 1% annually until reaching two times pre-industrial values and then kept constant, is run with the high-resolution Community Earth System Model version 2.1 (CESM2.1) and Community Ice Sheet Model version 2.1 (CISM2.1). The climate, run with CESM2.1, is simulated for 1000 years. After 500 years, it is assumed that the climate is close to equilibrium, and thus one climate year is used for five years of forcing the ice sheet in CISM2.1, resulting in 3000 years of ice sheet simulation. At the end of the simulation, the global mean annual temperature has increased by 5∘&#x1d436; and the temperature over Greenland is 9∘&#x1d436; warmer than pre-industrial. The rate of sea level contribution in the first centuries is lower than the observed contemporary mass loss of 0.7 mm/yr (Shepherd et al., 2020) but increases after year 710 to a rate of 1 mm/yr. Another increase in mass loss is happening from the year 1380 until the end of the simulation where the rate is 2 mm/yr and the total contribution to sea level rise is 4.1 m. The limited mass loss in the period between years 71-400 and its increase thereafter is found to relate to temporal strong weakening and posterior recovery of the NAMOC. This study projects that the GrIS is a major contributor to future sea level rise, even in a moderate warming scenario, and that the changing NAMOC has a noteworthy effect on the GrIS mass budget.","Greenland ice sheet; Sea level rise; NAMOC; Climate change; GrIS Surface mass balance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Depending on the<br/>location and disease pathology, thrombus composition varies, affecting treatment response and making identification of thrombus composition and its mechanical response sought after. The features of a fibrin network, which functions as the adhesive, have shown to influence thrombus strength, viscoelasticity, permeability and resilience to fibrinolysis. In previous studies, these features were analysed on fibrin gels made under static conditions, while in vivo thrombi are formed under flow. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to form plasma thrombi in both the presence and absence of flow and evaluate the differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. <br/><br/>Methods - Plasma thrombi in the presence and absence of flow were formed inside the Chandler loop. Recitrated PFP, pooled from three healthy volunteers, was to the Chandler loop tubings and spun at 0, 10 and 30 RPM to create shear rates of roughly 0 (static thrombus), 100 and 300 s^(-1) (flow thrombi). Six thrombi were formed for each shear rate, of which two were prepared for SEM imaging to determine the diameter of fibrin fibers. The other four thrombi were cut into three disks and were used for CLSM, unconfined compression testing and micro-indentation. With CLSM, the fiber density and pore size of the network were quantified and with unconfined compression testing and micro-indentation the global and local stiffness' of the thrombi, respectively. The global stiffness of the thrombi was measured at low (20-40\%) and high strains (75-80\%).<br/><br/>Results - Increased diameters were found for flow thrombi compared to static thrombi (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001).

Drought causes these dikes to crack and fail more easily. Visual dike inspections are therefore inefficient, especially considering the increasing climate changes of the future. Research has shown that a fiber optic sensor cable (FOS), used in distributed temperature sensing (DTS), can help measure soil thermal responses, but the question remains whether it is also suitable as a replacement for visual inspections of dikes. This study helps to answer this question by coupling a finite element method (FEM) model with measured DTS information collected at Flood Proof Holland (Delft). In addition, (thermal) images are used to calibrate the FEM model. The measurement period was 20 summer days. The measured data consisted of webcam images, thermal images, and temperature time series of a FOS cable. The meteorological data was obtained via a weather station located in Rotterdam. The FEM model, calibrated and validated with the measured data, helped to find the thermal response of the system in situations of which no data was available, for example having various crack dimensions, cable positions or climatic conditions. The more distinguished the material properties of air and soil are (days with high water content and/or high radiation), the better the crack detection via DTS. After correction for the overestimation influence of radiation on the black FOS cable on sunny afternoons, the thermal response of the crack is corresponding to the air temperature more compared to the thermal response of grass. Crack detection via DTS turned out to be possible by x,T- and t,T-plots (diurnal temperature variation) and a regression plot with the daily peak-to-peak amplitude of the air temperature on the one hand and the daily peak-to-peak amplitude of the cable on the other. The advantage of the regression plot is that only one DTS thermal time series is needed to determine if the segment is most likely cracked or not. Furthermore, the peak-to-peak axes allow for diurnal climatic condition indications, and with it the heat storage and release of the system: rainy, cloudy days are in lower axis regions whereas sunny, clear days are in higher axis regions. However, due to a small measurement period, this method is only fully proven for sunny afternoons. Future studies have to map the thermal processes for other situations too.","desiccation crack detection; distributed temperature sensing; fiber optic sensor; finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

A key factor for an effective SDA is the successful identification of an Earthorbiting satellite, or object in general. Current methods are usually limited to either time-resolved photometry, spectrometry, or polarimetry. In this thesis, we present the Spectropolarimeter for Satellite Identification (SSI), whose design combines these detection methods with the aim to provide a unique ‘fingerprint’ of the satellite, thereby expanding the range of satellite identification methods. The SSI combines a dual-channel spectrometer with off-the-shelf polarization optics. Using a combination of an achromatic quarter-wave retarder, a highly chromatic multiple order retarder, a polarizing beam splitter, and two linear polarizers, all operating in the visible spectrum, a sinusoidal modulation of the linear polarization information is imprinted onto the measured spectrum. The amplitude of the signal scales with the degree of linear polarization and the phase with the angle of linear polarization. Furthermore, by using a dual-channel setup, the intensity spectrum can be obtained for the full spectrograph resolution of 9 nm. We introduce and verify the retrieval algorithm to attain the linear polarization information with an approximate resolution of 135 nm due to the modulation approach. Differential transmission between both channels is corrected by a proposed iterative transmission correction which is verified to have an effect of ≤ 1% on the accuracy of the retrieved linear polarization information. This thesis concentrates on geostationary satellites as observation targets, making use of the stable observation geometry to simplify calibration and analysis. We reason that the phase angle has a strong influence on the retrieved spectropolarimetric data and received photon flux. A thorough photon budget estimation is conducted with the conclusion that we are able to observe faint geostationary satellites with an apparent visual magnitude of 10, especially if the observed phase angle is kept minimal. An analysis of the most probable errors is conducted. We identify the convolution of the instrument response function with the modulated signal and the induced polarization by the telescope and instrument as the most severe ones. Laboratory wavelength and polarimetric calibration are conducted. Using a double glass plate setup to induce low levels of degree of linear polarization we performed laboratory validation measurements. We determined the overall laboratory polarimetric accuracy to be ≤ 1.2%. Additionally, we are able to distinguish signals ≥ 1.3 %. Preliminary observations of three bright stars are conducted. We are able to retrieve instrumentinduced polarization between 1% and 2.5% which is in the expected range. We conclude that there has been a misalignment between the telescope and instrument which causes a large discrepancy between expected and received photons and propose future measures to resolve the issue. The proof of concept to use linear channelled spectropolarimetry for satellite identification with the SSI will open up the way for further technical refinement of the instrument, an extension to low Earth orbit satellites, and the possible addition of phase angle resolved spectropolarimetric measurements to further improve the concept of a satellite‘s spectropolarimetric ‘fingerprint’.

The Robust Tail Assignment problem aims to assign aircraft to flights, while minimize expected costs of operating a flight schedule, including expected delay costs. This problem is difficult, because delays can propagate between successive flights in the schedule, creating dependencies between flights assigned to the same aircraft. <br/><br/>Using probability distributions of delay for every individual flight, as well as expected costs associated with delaying flights, the expected delay costs of a full flight schedule can be estimated. The workings of a simulator are described, which can be used to evaluate the total expected costs of solution schedules for the Robust Tail Assignment problem.<br/><br/>To be able to incorporate expected delay costs in a mathematical model, the construction of a multi-commodity flow network is described, which uses departure and arrival states for flight rotations, corresponding to discrete amounts of delay. The amount of flow through edges of this network represents the probability of these states transitioning into other states. By activating and deactivating edges, based on the assignment of aircraft to rotations, this network can be used in a model to approximate the total expected delay costs of a model solution.<br/><br/>The proposed robust flow model uses such a state network in a MIP model, that can be solved using an iterative solver to find good solutions to the Robust Tail Assignment problem. Delay costs are imposed on edges in the network, to quantify the expected delay costs. In the model, the network size is reduced by only considering connections between rotations that have high probabilities of propagating delay. This reduces the accuracy of the model, but shortens the run-time of the optimization process significantly.<br/><br/>Several experiments are done to test the run-time and performance of the robust flow model. The model proved hard to solve to optimality, but is able to find good solutions, if the model parameters are well tuned.

Despite being the largest social sector in Europe, accounting for approximately 30% of the Dutch housing market, recent research suggests that housing associations are unable to properly handle their social responsibilities in the current environment in the Netherlands (Penders, 2020). First of all, recent changes in the housing market demonstrate that the demand for social housing has not only expanded but also diversified its target audience (Madsen &amp; Ghekière, 2021). Recent studies indicate that aside from the poor and vulnerable, also the elderly, young adults (starters), and middle-income families, along with vulnerable and special groups are becoming increasingly interested in this housing aid (OECD, 2020; Madsen &amp; Ghekière, 2021).<br/><br/>In order to meet the rising social housing demand, housing associations are expected to construct more than 25,000 new social houses each year until 2035, with the number of dwellings that must become more sustainable gradually increasing from 25,000 to over 60,000 (Penders, 2020; Madsen &amp; Ghekière, 2021). According to Penders (2020), approximately €116 billion is required for all investments up to and including 2035, however, around €30 billion in social tasks (nearly 25% of the total amount) will not be accomplished since housing associations’ expenditures (interest, taxes, maintenance, and management) are rising faster than their income, namely rentals. In the Netherlands, the creation and management of social housing is the responsibility of social housing associations. However, the different actions that these housing associations can take in order to fulfil their social obligations depend mainly on the housing policies that the Dutch policymakers implement. As a result, it has recently come to light that a significant portion of the social housing stock in the Netherlands is unfit for habitation. One in five of all social rental dwellings in the Netherlands, which is estimated to be home to 312,500 households, are expected to be energy-poor, according to recent studies (P. Mulder et al., 2021; Aw, 2021). In addition, according to current Autoriteit woningcorporaties (Aw) data, the housing associations themselves provided about 80,000 social rental houses in (very) poor conditions (De Regt &amp; Bunskoek, 2021).<br/><br/>Given that the Dutch social housing is currently struggling to meet its social obligations due to a paradox of rising demand and constrained financial means. More legislative actions will be required to alleviate the current housing crisis through the social housing market. Therefore, this study aims to answer the following research question: What policy strategy could Dutch policymakers put in place to assist social housing providers to ensure that there are enough adequate rental properties available to meet the rising housing demand?<br/><br/>In this study, this research question will be answered by means of a simulation modelling approach. It was decided to investigate the underlying mechanisms in the social sector in the Haaglanden urban region by conducting various analyses (including uncertainty analysis and policy analysis) using the system dynamics (SD) simulation model, the Dutch Social Housing Model, which was created during the execution of this study. Contrary to the conventional SD approach, this study is accomplished by combining the SD approach with the Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA) methodology – which employs computer experiments to support decision-making under uncertainties. Given the dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty linked to the researched system, this method was performed to draw valid conclusions regarding the Dutch social housing market under deep uncertainty (Adams, 2011; Le Roux et al., 2011; Jonsson et al., 2021; Kwakkel &amp; Pruyt, 2015).<br/><br/>First of all, the results show that up to and including 2050 there will be a housing shortage in both the social housing market (hereinafter referred to as SGEI) and the housing market for middle-low-income households (hereinafter referred to as Non SGEI) in the Haaglanden urban region. In particular, the shortage of SGEI homes will remain at around 60,000 homes from now until 2050, while the shortage of Non SGEI homes will continue to rise to about 20,000 homes. This can be explained by the difficult financial situation of the social housing associations, which cannot meet their social obligations. Despite the anticipated gradual increase in the social housing associations’ financial sources, this study shows that these corporations will only have enough financial resources to invest in the social housing market. Due to this, it is expected that the housing quality of SGEI houses will improve, while that of the Non SGEI houses is expected to deteriorate. The reason being, that if the housing association has sufficient financial resources for a particular house (in this case the SGEI houses), it can ensure that the homes in question can undergo maintenance, which improves the housing quality.<br/><br/>Given that the main purpose of this study is to identify policies that will enhance the system behaviour of the social housing market, it was decided to examine the following social housing regulations: Increase Average Rent, More Subsidy for Social Housing, More Planning Capacity for Social Housing, Lower Interest Rate, and Eliminate Landlord Levy. This is due to the fact that the policies Increase Average Rent, More Subsidy for Social Housing, and Eliminate Landlord Levy all improve the cash flow of social housing associations, with Eliminate Landlord Levy lowering the expenditures while the other two policies increase the income of the social housing associations. The expectation is that improved income flow will put social housing businesses in a stronger financial position, allowing them to make more investments to address the housing shortage and quality. Furthermore, More Planning Capacity for Social Housing guarantees more land at the disposal of housing associations compared to the current situation for the construction of new social housing to ensure that the growing housing demand will be met by the housing supply.<br/><br/>It is advised to use a combination of these policies to address the issues with the social housing system because no single of these policies can effectively address both the housing scarcity and the poor housing quality of both housing markets. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the combination of the following policies should be used in Dutch social housing: (1) More Planning Capacity for Social Housing, (2) More Subsidy for Social Housing, and (3) Eliminate Landlord Levy. However, it is advised to ascertain the value of the most influential uncertain parameters prior to the selection of the policy strategy because the majority of the KPIs, with the exception of the housing shortage for middle-low income households, are behaviorally sensitive to the uncertain parameters investigated in this study. Moreover, it is challenging to assess the robustness of the investigated policies because of the significant overlap between the findings of the several policies reviewed by the robustness study. The efficiency and robustness of the various policies mentioned in this study and their combination should therefore be thoroughly examined using the data that have been gathered of the most influential uncertain parameters. This information allows for the most precise mapping of the researched system’s behaviour during the application of the policy interventions. Policymakers are then able to decide on a course of action that is supported by empirical facts as a result. Ultimately, it is recommended that the other actors also be included in the policymaker’s selection procedure, as they may have differing opinions about the different policy candidates. The many perspectives that the actors involved have regarding the social housing system must therefore be thoroughly researched.","Adequate Housing; Social Housing; Housing Policy; System Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In this paper, a dynamic sunshade is proposed. Such a system is capable of not only reducing the global mean surface temperature anomaly, but also minimizing regional climate changes by tailoring the sunshade's motion according to climate requirements. A sunshade orbiting in the vicinity of the Sun-Earth L1 point is able to reduce the global mean surface temperature from 16.39°C (scenario with 680 ppm of atmospheric CO2) to 14.13°C until equilibrium is reached.

Reusing structural steel elements can potentially decrease the need for the production of new steel. However, designing a load-bearing structure with reusable elements poses challenges to the design process. The starting point of the process is different due to a limited availability of structural elements. The design of the load-bearing structure should be based on the measurements of the available reusable elements, while traditionally the amount of elements and their measurements were based on the design. However, the freedom in a design is often limited by certain architectural and structural constraints. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is on how to organize an optimization process in which the aim is to design a load-bearing structure containing the least amount of new steel by means of implementing reusable elements, while taking into account the architectural and structural constraints. <br/><br/>In the optimization method developed in this study, a primary design for a load-bearing structure functions as an input. The method consists of four big steps: the definition of the geometry, the assignment of (reusable) elements, structural calculations and the formulation of results. The goal is to assign reusable elements which are respecting the given constraints: the minimum and maximum UC-value allowed and the maximum deviation in length. The output is a modified design in which reusable elements are implemented, in a way that lowers the amount of steel required to realize the design.<br/>By performing a case study, the model is tested and the influence of the constraints and the implemented stock can be determined. Several analyses are conducted, using three different stocks. Stock 1 and stock 2 can be considered more diverse than stock 3.  <br/>The characteristics of the resulting designs are influenced by the relation between the stock and the original design. For the more diverse stock, there are only results whenever the minimum allowed UC-value is set to 0.01. While the required amount of steel lowers (up to 79% for stock 1 and 74% for stock 2), the actual UC-values of the implemented elements can be considered low and the change in design can be considered big (up to 19 out of 24 angles in the beam-configuration changing more than 10%). For the less diverse stock, all analyses give results, independent of the values for the constraints. In this case, the results UC-value are high compared to the results related to stock 1 and 2, and the changes in design are less (0 changing angles). Besides, all elements can be reused, which lowers the amount of required new steel to zero.  <br/>Therefore, applying the optimization method developed in this study to a design for a load-bearing structure results in a modified design in which the amount of new steel required to realize the design is minimized. However, the actual UC-values corresponding to the different elements and the changes in the design are dependent on the available stock and the constraints.","Reuse; Steel; Parametric Design; Optimization; Structural Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

A new concept Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) can minimize the environmental impact of brine. However, the high costs for construction and running of a ZLD plant limits its growth in desalination market. Therefore, a new strategy integrating brine mining with desalination is proposed to improve its economic performance due to the valuable minerals in brine. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is carried out to assess its economic performance and compare this strategy with other ZLD strategies. The results present that the cost-effectiveness of the studied strategy is lower than ZLD systems which only maximize water recovery. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the studied strategy is 0.056€/kg of freshwater, higher than ZLD maximizing water recovery (0.032€/kg of freshwater). However, its profitability is higher than other ZLD schemes. This study shows that the integrated desalination and brine mining strategy has a great economic potential. Its cost-benefit of is 1.12, far lower than that of ZLD only maximizing water recovery (26.08). In addition, it can be indicated that CEA is not comprehensive enough to assess the economic performance of a multi-product desalination system.

NNs are usually trained via gradient descent (GD), but research has shown that GD is not always capable of training very small networks. As a result, networks trained via GD are often significantly larger than necessary, demanding more computing power and energy to evaluate, and thereby hampering adoption on lower- power devices. This thesis investigates whether evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can successfully train NNs and if these networks can be smaller than those required by GD. Four algorithms, namely the GD-based Adam, Adam with cold restarts, and the EAs GOMEA and BIPOP-CMA-ES, were used to train various configurations of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with one hidden layer for the Exclusive-OR (XOR) problem. Their relative performance was gauged by comparing the rates at which each algorithm attained an acceptable loss for a given number of hidden nodes. The main findings are that EAs could find smaller ReLU-activated networks than GD could, while, oppositely, the GD could generally find smaller networks for sigmoid- activated networks. However, GOMEA in particular was able to successfully train XOR networks using the highly discrete Heaviside activation function, whereas GD could not due gradient erasure. Problem-specific knowledge in the form of a soft symmetry breaking constraint was found to be effective to increase success rates in a limited number of cases. These findings indicate that using EAs is a viable strategy for training NNs, yielding smaller, and therefore more efficient networks than those trained via GD, provided that the network topology is suitable for the chosen EA. This opens up future research into, including but not limited to, the many ways EAs can be scaled up to training larger NNs, hybridization with GD, and niche network topologies.","evolutionary algorithms; neural networks; gradient descent; optimization; GOMEA; CMA-ES; Adam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

The sole application of LAS makes the random field unconditional, which has been improved to conditional random field generator by using Kriging interpolation. Both unconditional and conditional generator are tested in an illustrative example and the results indicate that the improvement from unconditional to conditional random field reduces the uncertainty of the most probable result of classifications and the classifications in the unconditional random field will converge if there are enough realizations. Additionally, the conditional random field generator is further applied in a case with three conducted CPTs, which build up a domain with very large scale of fluctuations. It’s found that the uncertainty of the generated most probable result of classifications is pretty low so it’s speculated that the proposed generator can be best applied in a large scale of fluctuation scenario.

Prilling is widely used for efficient production of a variety of materials such as, e.g., fertilizer grains, laundry detergent, and substances for drugs and foods.<br/>While in most prilling applications the jet can be considered as a pure liquid, in some cases the molten substance may contain suspended particles. The present study is motivated by prilling of fertilizers composed of Urea or Ammonium Nitrate (AN) containing polyhalite particles. To date, the effects of suspended particles on jet breakup, drop formation and crystallization are not well-understood. In the first part of this report a literature review is given on prilling and the current understanding of the effect of suspended particles on this. It has been found in literature that a large concentration of suspended particles will increase the viscosity of the suspension but also promote breakup of the jet. Besides, the size of the particles also influences the viscosity and jet breakup, resulting in a decrease in the amount of smaller formed secondary droplets at larger suspended particle sizes, hence increasing monodispersity. The objectives of this MSc research project are to assess under what conditions high-quality fertilizer grains can be optimally prilled from polyhalite suspensions in molten urea or ammonium nitrate. An experimental setup was designed to assess how molten liquid jets of Urea or AN with suspended polyhalite particles can be optimally prilled for producing high-quality fertilizer grains. This design consists of melting and mixing the batch of materials, from where it will pump the particulate suspension through a vertical tube with a screw pump to a nozzle. Here, a jet will be formed. This will breakup into droplets, which will fall in an oil batch to increase cooling and hence fasten the solidification process. Unfortunately, the current design was always dripping and not able to form a jet due clogging and the formation of hard lumps, which decreased the flow rate. The droplets were however collected and analyzed. It was found in this thesis that a larger concentration of P4 particles in urea will increase the viscosity. When the particles are grinded more, the viscosity increased as well, however a direct relationship between particle size and viscosity has yet to be determined. The particles were also unequally distributed over the prills, because P4 tends to stick together. To obtain the best quality prills, it is recommended to use relatively large P4 particles in combination with larger nozzles of &gt;1mm to decrease the desired prilling force and prevent clogging.

According to the European Commission, sector coupling is required to achieve these targets. This includes the inclusion of renewables into sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, but also using resources more efficient, and introducing new clean fuels. Recent research has examined the increased integration of renewables into the energy system, or the coupling with other sectors, such as the heating industry. However, a paucity of studies investigated the integration of the transportation sector with the power sector based on different configurations of hydrogen supply chains, with hydrogen as a nodal connector. Some studies looked into the decarbonization of the transportation sector but diminished to explore how the coupling based on hydrogen supply chains including hydrogen storage could support the grid by providing balancing services. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine potential designs for renewable hydrogen supply chains to provide joint applications, which are satisfying a hydrogen mobility demand, as well as providing balancing services to the power grid. However, the interconnection of the hydrogen system within the mobility sector, as well as the functioning power grid, based on the supply chain, poses multiple challenges on different levels. This complex problem requires solving in an integrated manner. In that regard, this thesis proposes a modelling approach for the optimal functioning of hydrogen generation and storage supply chains. Hereby the objective of the function is to maximize the profit of the supply chains through the supply of hydrogen fuel to the mobility sector and the contribution of balancing services to the power grid. The proposed optimization model is employed to perform a techno-economic comparison of two supply chain configurations: a distributed on-site supply chain, in which the hydrogen is generated at the fuelling stations, and a centralized off-site supply chain, where the hydrogen is centrally produced and afterwards transported to the dispersed fuelling stations. Both scenarios are quantitatively studied under two operating conditions, which are only selling to the mobility demand, and providing ancillary services to the power grid concurrently. It was found that both distributed and centralized hydrogen generation and storage supply chains can be used to offer hydrogen fuel to the transportation sector as well as provide different ancillary services to the grid. Furthermore, the numerical findings show that when both supply chains are planned and run concurrently for various ancillary services, the highest improvement in terms of financial parameters can be observed. The results also indicate that the profitability of the distributed and centralized supply chain is comparable under various operating conditions. However, while the distributed supply chain system presents better economic performances than the centralized supply chain system under the performed conditions, the centralized hydrogen supply chain has greater<br/>4<br/>technological benefits than the distributed supply chain in terms of flexibility. Whereas the decentralized supply chain is more beneficial for smaller demands and a more isolated operation, the centralized supply chain can provide higher values to investors who must deal with larger demands and more interconnected systems. Because the majority of these systems will be operated by larger system operators, and the supply chain, including fuelling stations, will be increasingly connected to the energy sectors rather than operating independently, the centralized alternative is likely to be the most beneficial investment. The analyses reported in this study are useful to interconnected investors or system operators for assessing the technical and economic viability of the widespread deployment of distributed and centralized hydrogen generation and storage supply chains integrated with the power grid. Future research might investigate other system configurations, such as including the hydrogen backbone into the operation or integrating the hydrogen supply chain with diverse industries, such as the heating sector. Different renewable energy sources, such as biomass or hydropower, might also be included. Other research might involve dynamic hydrogen pricing or the engagement of various distribution modalities with global demand points. Finally, for the supply chain systems to be successful, the social aspect must be considered, in which numerous market regulatory and governance impediments must be identified and exploited.","Sector integration; Mobility sector; Power grid; Hydrogen generation and storage supply chains; Ancillary services; Multi-objective optimization; Scheduling scheme; Renewable energy sources","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Therefore, to diminish the physical and psychological impact during and after recovery, a newly proposed minimally invasive therapy for early-stage breast cancer treatment is proposed. Within this study, this proposed treatment is modelled to gain more knowledge of the behavior of the treatment material in tissue. The treatment includes magnetic thermal ablation, which is combined with permanent Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy, both performed simultaneously.<br/>The goal of the treatment is to diminish the physical and psychological impact during treatment and after recovery, since it requires only a single medical intervention. The treatment material consists of radioactive palladium-103 superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (Pd-103 SPIONs) incorporated in a solid gel, forming a seed that is implanted into the tumor. To investigate the effectiveness and limitations of the combined therapy, computational simulations were performed in Matlab using the Finite Element Method (FEM).<br/>These simulations allowed for the prediction of the treatment results, by calculating the temperature distribution based on Pennes' bioheat equation, the nanoparticle concentration distribution and the dose distribution over time. The sensitivity of the results to the relevant physical properties and optimization parameters was analyzed. The latter resulted in a recommended optimization approach that ultimately could be used for treatment planning. First, an initial simulation was performed using property values from literature. Then, the temperature and dose results were tested on their sensitivity to model parameter changes. The temperature model was found to be most sensitive to changes in the nanoparticle heat source value Qnp, to an increased heat conduction coefficient k and to a decreased blood perfusion rate wb. The cumulative dose results are sensitive to both the initial concentration ci and to a decreased diffusion coefficient D. It is concluded that accurate values for these temperature and concentration model parameters are necessary to perform relevant simulations.<br/>Furthermore, the possible optimization parameters were identified. For dose optimization, these parameters are the activity of the nanoparticles A, which is not easily modified, and the initial nanoparticle concentration in the seeds ci, which affects the temperature distribution as well. The temperature distribution specific variables that were found, are the strength of the magnetic field H and the time t of magnetic field application, which both can be adjusted during the treatment. The seed location and number of seeds are two additional adjustable variables used for optimization of both temperature and dose distribution. Lastly, it was concluded that the internal radiation part of the treatment is limiting in the reaching treatment goals and in number of optimization possibilities, compared to the thermal ablation part. Therefore, treatment optimization should be performed on the dose distribution first. Because most limitations of the models are a result of the 2D representation and because these limitations strongly affect the outcomes of the models, it is recommended to transform these models to 3D. These limitations make it impossible to do proper treatment planning with the 2D model, which requires a 3D view of the results. With all these findings, this study has contributed by providing basic knowledge of the state-of-the-art early stage breast cancer combined therapy, bringing it one step closer to clinical implementation.<br","Proposed combined single interference treatment; Thermal ablation; LDR brachytherapy; Early‐stage breast cancer; Thermo‐radioactive nanoparticles; Palladium‐103 superparamagnetic iron‐oxide nanoparticles; Finite Element Method; Matlab simulations; Temperature, concentration and dose distribution profiles; Sensitivity analysis; Treatment optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The surgical procedure of tissue extraction from the human body for precautionary or curative measures is common in many medical fields. Currently, aspiration catheters are the golden standard, enabling removal by means of a suction force. By Sakes et al., an alternative mechanism is proposed, transporting tissue based on friction, inspired by the egg-laying structure of wasps. Challenges within these devices comprise clogging and damage prevention, achieving adequate<br/>transportation rates, transportation of tissue with differing elasticity properties and satisfying the dimensional restrictions of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). Due to the vital impact of MIS, a tissue extraction device overcoming the previously mentioned barriers is highly desirable. The goal of this research is stated as follows, ‘design of a continuous tissue transportation mechanism compatible for MIS in which the transportation velocity is independent of tissue elasticity within the young’s modulus range of 1-110 kPa’. The stated elasticity span resembles a large range of tissue that can be encountered during MIS, whilst aspiration catheters are assumed to be suitable for the removal of liquids. Tissue extraction and retrieval are not included within the scope. <br/><br/>To achieve the stated objective, novel ideas are generated from both a dynamic and nature-based perspective and assessed by means of rapid prototyping. Within the final prototype, a cylindrical conveyor belt is created, consisting of a thread wrapped along a tubular body. Due to friction between the thread and tissue, the latter is transported whenever continuously rotating the thread in the direction of removal. Experiments are performed with the proof of principle prototype to investigate the effects of different rotational velocities, instrument orientation, and tissue shape on the transportation velocity of tissue and the corresponding efficiency and reliability. Maximum mean mass transportation rates of 7.75∓0.48, 8.43∓1.50, and 8.90∓0.56 g/min are attained, as a result of transporting tissue phantoms with a young’s modulus of approximately 1-10, 55, and 100-110 kPa respectively. Whether statistically, variance in transportation rates between these categories appears is not determined, as equivalent power supply voltages did not result in identical rotational velocities due to varying thread tension. However, as the transportation velocities match rates of clinically available morcellator and perfect reliability is attained, the potency of the designed mechanism as an alternative for aspiration-based instruments is demonstrated.","Medical device design; Tissue extraction; Tissue elasticity; Conveyor belt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Additionally, mobility is undergoing a fundamental transformation toward inclusivity as a result of technological trends. This gave rise to the chance for this project, which aims to investigate how mobility may be more inclusive, draw in a larger audience, and address fresh narratives that genuinely speak to and belong to everyone. <br/><br/>MaaS is a concept that unifies access-based mobility services like public transportation and others onto a single, user-friendly platform. Users will no longer need to make significant investments to maintain access to transportation as a result. They are able to carry out door-to-door travel at a time that works for them. Using this integrated system, transportation companies can build a network that more effectively serves the necessary region and its users. There is still a long way to go before a fast, flexible, reliable, seamless MaaS experience can be realised. Therefore a long-term approach must be adopted by using a design roadmap. This provides the opportunity to work towards the full potential of a MaaS system by keeping the elderly involved in the whole process.<br/><br/>The roadmap’s greatest contribution to inclusiveness is that it, on the one hand, encourages the mobility sector to take a more active role in changing the behaviour of elderly and incorporating them in the design process of this new ecosystem. On the other hand, it shows that so much needs to be done to achieve this and that to this day we are far from inclusive when it comes to our mobility offerings.<br/><br/>In validation tests with experts, the roadmaps’s desirability was investigated. These evaluation interviews provided an enriched understanding on how the roadmap contributes to available knowledge and how it can be used as a strategic way to encourage change and development of the MaaS concept. These insights combined were used to formulate the final recommendations.

(mentor); Lampaert, S.G.E. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Confocal microscopy is often used to make three-dimensional high-resolution images of biological samples. It is done by reflecting a laser beam off of a dichroic mirror, and focusing it on a sample with the use of a microscope. This sample is treated with a fluorescent dye. The dye molecules emit light of a higher wavelength with an intensity proportional to their illumination intensity. This light travels back, and can now pass through the dichroic mirror. Hereafter, the light is focused onto a pinhole that blocks out-of-focus light. By measuring the intensity of the in-focus light, and raster scanning the focused light spot across the sample, a high resolution image of a section of the sample can be formed. The raster scanning is done with a set of rotating scan mirrors. To attain a three-dimensional image, the spot can be focused on a new section of the sample, and the process is repeated.<br/>Rescan confocal microscopy is a relatively new addition to it. Instead of directly measuring the light intensity after it passes through the dichroic mirror, it is instead recollimated and rescanned across a CMOS chip with a second set of rotating rescan mirrors, synchronized with the scan mirrors. The rescan surface area is proportionally larger, resulting in a higher resolution than conventional confocal microscopy. The pinhole can also be made larger, resulting in higher quantum efficiency.<br/>State-of-the-art rescan confocal microscopy utilizes two sets of galvanometer mirrors for both the scanning and rescanning, and is very slow; only up to 2 frames per second for a 512 by 512 pixel image. The goal of this research is to speed up a rescan confocal microscopy significantly from the state-of-the-art. <br/>The raster scanning and rescanning is done much like reading a book. In each set there is a fast-axis mirror travelling from left to right, and a slow-axis mirror only moving down a small step. <br/>Thus, the fast-axis mirrors for both the scanning and rescanning bottlenecks the speed. Replacing these two with one faster mirror-based alternative would improve the system speed. Using one mirror-based alternative eliminates potential synchronization issues between scanning and rescanning at high rates. <br/><br/>The three mirror-based alternatives selected for further investigation are: polygon scanners, resonant scanners, and MEMS resonant scanners.<br/>Polygon scanners have a polygonal head with multiple mirror facets. This head is attached to a shaft which is rotated in the order of several thousands of revolutions per minute. Each passing mirror facet equates to one scan line. <br/>Resonant scanners contain a mirror attached to a shaft. This shaft is brought up to torsional eigenfrequency (in the order of several thousands of kilohertz), resulting in the mirror oscillating back-and-forth. Each oscillation period can thus cover two scan lines. MEMS resonant scanners operate on the same principle as conventional resonant scanners, their main difference being their production method and form factor. <br/>The three scanner types were further investigated for and compared to one-another. The performance metric that was used for this was the scanned area per second of the microscope image plane.<br/><br/>Optimization models were made for the three scanners, with this metric and found constraints. The number of variables for all models was reduced to two so that contour plots could be made. These contour plots were made for both the theoretical maximum performance of each scanner, as well as the current commercially-available products. These models show that MEMS resonant scanners have the potential for the largest scanned area per second with up to 2800mm^2/s. However, this is a theoretical large diameter MEMS scanner (2.46mm). While there is recent research focusing on large diameter MEMS resonant scanners, most scanners found in literature are between 1-2mm. Thus, there is most certainly future potential in large diameter MEMS resonant scanners for confocal microscopy applications. However, when comparing the current lineup of<br/>commercially-available scanners MEMS scanners are not feasible due to their small mirror diameters. Polygon scanners attain the highest performance here, with a up to 1100mm^2/s. Conventional resonant scanners can only provide up to 698mm^2/s. Thus, a polygon scanner was chosen for the final design. <br/><br/>Polygon scanners have facet-to-facet errors. One such error: the cross-scan error, or dynamic track error could form a problem for the final image and result in brightness banding, due to the (re)scan lines jumping up or down along the slow-axis with each passing facet.<br/>It was decided that this error had to be eliminated. This can be done by using a relay and a multiple of two mirrors. A relay relays and inverts an angle four focal lengths further along the optical axis. Thus, by relaying the cross-scan error back to the same polygon facet, the error in the slow-axis can be completely eliminated while maintaining the desired angle along the fast-axis. This method appears to be novel in literature, and was subsequently verified with an experiment. <br/><br/>This novel solution was used in the final polygon design, which was fully detailed in CAD with off-the-shelf optical components. The made Zemax models showed a diffraction-limited system. The final area scan rate is 949mm^2/s, and is 42 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Future work includes assembling and testing the prototype setup, and converting it into a commercial product.","rescan confocal microscopy; confocal microscopy; microscopy; polygon scanner; resonant scanner; MEMS resonant scanner; dynamic track error; cross-scan error; polygon error","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-06","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Although recycling rates are slowly rising, plastic pollution remains one of the biggest threads to the global ecosystem. Especially in low-to-middle-income countries, industrial recycling systems are sparse due to their required investment.<br/><br/>Precious Plastic is an organization aiming to tackle plastic pollution, step by step. They openly distribute blueprints of recycling machines for anyone to use, which enables local recyclers to start their own informal recycling workshop. Over 40,000 people in 400 workspaces are connected through the Precious Plastic Universe, in which recyclers, designers and plastic collectors collaborate. One of their machines is an injection machine, capable of injecting recycling plastic into a mold (figure 1). This machine is low cost, easy to build, and creates a beautiful marbled aesthetic that convincingly tells the story of the value of recycled plastic.<br/><br/>However, the design of the machine has quite a number of problems. Mainly, it requires an excessive amount of hand-force which exceeds human ergonomic limits. The machine also has a number of safety and buildability issues. Lastly, the machine does not easily enable tailoring due to its monolithic design. Next to the problems relating to the injection machine, Precious Plastic has noticed they often miss out on gathering improvements that builders implement in their machine. Due to this, valuable opportunities for development of the machine are not redeemed. This project aims to tackle these problems through two design outcomes. The first outcome is an online framework where users can tailor their injection machine based on their needs and upload their machine improvements. The concept aims to transform the current monolithic design sharing system into an inviting modular framework.<br/><br/>The second outcome is an advanced version of the injection machine. The goal aimed to develop, validate and document a functioning prototype of an advanced arbor injection machine. The design of the machine decreases the required input force by 70%, while producing a higher injection pressure and solving the prior safety and usage problems. The design of the machine was developed in active collaboration with a group of experienced machine builders and will be distributed throughout the Precious Plastic Universe.<br/><br/>In the end, both design outcomes contribute towards a more sustainable world, in which people are empowered through Open Source Hardware and plastic is in fact precious.","open source hardware; plastic recycling; injection molding; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Underwater vehicles are typically equipped with a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) that measures the velocity relative to the seafloor. Aside from the velocity, the DVL also measures the range of each of the four beams. When compared against a bathymetry height map, these measured ranges provide additional information enabling improving position estimates. Unfortunately, surveys often occur in areas where detailed bathymetry maps are unavailable. In these cases, bathymetry Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) could be used to improve the position estimates compared to the velocity integration position. With SLAM, the map is being estimated during the mission while at the same time using the map for position determination.<br/><br/>In this thesis, reduced rank Gaussian processes (GPs) are used as map representation for SLAM. The downside of regular GPs is a time complexity of O(n^3) , reduced rank GPs improve the computation performance. GPs provide Gaussian distributions at any point, leading to a neat integration with probabilistic SLAM algorithms. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this has not been used in bathymetry SLAM. This report investigates how reduced rank approximated GPs, representing the bathymetry, can be integrated into a SLAM algorithm to improve the position estimates of an underwater vehicle equipped with a DVL and low-quality gyroscopes.<br/><br/>A squared exponential kernel is used as GPs model of the bathymetry. The reduced rank approximation is vital for real-time SLAM performance. This map representation is integrated with a Rao Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) that estimates both the underwater vehicle’s trajectory and the bathymetry map.<br/><br/>The SLAM algorithm is evaluated using data from an underwater vehicle operated at the surface such that a GNSS reference position is available. Experiments of the SLAM algorithm show a reduced position error compared to the GNSS reference. The resulting algorithm has a computation time of up to 30 times faster than the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) collects data while improving position estimates. This concludes that the RBPF using reduced rank GPs is capable of onboard improved position estimation on underwater vehicles.","SLAM; Underwater Vehicles; Position estimation; Gaussian Processes; Bathymetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

As the US government is planning to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, many rock installation projects are planned. This is where GLDD wants to contribute by being part of a more sustainable future by building a subsea rock installation vessel. This vessel with a 20.000 ton rock capacity is placing rocks using a solid fallpipe. Accurate knowledge of how rocks are placed using a fallpipe is necessary to plan, manage and estimate the costs of a project. The main focus of this thesis project is to establish an optimal computer model for an inclined fallpipe for subsea rock installation. This model can be used to calculate rock velocity during operating the inclined fall pipe (IFP). Additionally, the particle concentration and the distribution of particles over the pipe’s cross-sectional area can be determined. The velocity of particles is essential for future models calculating where the rocks settle down after leaving the fallpipe.

These improvements lead to Vertical fallpipe model 2 (VFM2) and Sliding bed model 2 (SBM2). In the lab research, a scale model of a fallpipe is made.

By comparing the temporal evolution of the bed levels of the frontal entrance area with measured concentrations at the inlet of Perkpolder, it can be concluded that the frontal entrance area acted as a finite source of sediment that eroded quickly in the first years and increased sedimentation within Perkpolder during these years.<br/><br/>New realignment projects can profit from the research at Perkpolder. Bed shear stresses of the initial proposed layout of Perkpolder gives a clear indication if the creeks are setup correctly. Furthermore, an estimate of the initial sedimentation can be based on the accretion rate of other intertidal areas within the estuary. Since realigned areas are often more sheltered and have a lower elevation, accretion rates may be higher. Moreover, not only the forcing of the estuary, but at the same time the availability of different sediment sources and the initial bathymetry shape the morphodynamic response of the realignment site. Therefore, it is recommended to measure the bathymetry for a sufficient long period (e.g. 10 years after the realignment) to get grip on the mechanisms shaping the morphodynamics at these areas.","Managed realignment; Morphodynamics; Hydrodynamics; Perkpolder; Sediment transport; Morphodynamic modelling; Hydrodynamic modelling; Data analysis; Suspended Sediment Concentration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.391403, 4.023281"

In this study, a phantom model for a vesicovaginal fistula repair was developed that can be produced and used in Africa, to train medical doctors in the treatment of simple fistulas by the transvaginal approach.<br/>Method of production: The phantom consists out of 3D printed PLA parts and silicone parts. The framework and the moulds for the required organs were 3D printed with PLA, and silicone was then poured into the moulds. To determine which tissue-mimicking silicone material to use, a test focused on the tendency to rupture, and a tensile test were performed. It followed that to mimic the vaginal tissue, Dragon Skin 10 with 11% silicone oil was most suitable. To mimic the bladder tissue both Dragon Skin 10 with 11% silicone oil and Dragon Skin 10 with Slacker could be suitable. Therefore, two bladders with both materials were made. The cervix, the vulva, and a plate that closes off the bladder were all made with Dragon Skin 10 without an additive. To mimic the urethra a tube of natural rubber was used, and to mimic the connecting fascia between the bladder and vagina and to connect the organs silicone glue was used. <br/>Testing results: A clinical validation test was performed by two dutch gynaecologists to validate the overall initial model, the representation of the materials, and whether the procedural steps of excising, dissecting, and suturing of the tissue could be performed. The water-tightness was not tested in this stage yet. It mainly followed that the angle of the model should be adjusted to the Trendelenburg position and that the working space should be broadened. Both improvements were processed in an updated final model, on which a secondary test was performed by a pelvic surgeon. In this stage also a water-tightness test was performed, from which it followed that the bladder with Slacker became watertight after suturing, the bladder with silicone oil, however, did not. Therefore, Dragon Skin 10 with Slacker is most suitable for mimicking the bladder tissue. The material costs for the permanent parts of the final phantom model are €14,23 and for the replaceable parts, the material costs are €5,38.<br/>Conclusion: All procedural steps could be performed on the final phantom model without any problems. And, the model can be produced locally, while keeping the costs low. Overall, the model is suitable to be used as a phantom to train medical doctors in the treatment of a simple vesicovaginal fistula repair with the transvaginal approach.","Vesicovaginal fistula; transvaginal approach; phantom; 3D printing; silicone; tissue-mimicking material; suturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Deep geothermal energy is implemented more in The Netherlands over the last couple of years as a substitute to the conventional boilers and this is a technique that is proven to be working. However, one problem with geothermal energy is the fact that only base load extraction is possible, whereas the heating demand varies throughout the year. During winter there is an energy shortage while during summer there is a surplus. Hence, seasonal heat storage is seen as a promising technique to increase the portion of green energy in heating networks.<br/><br/>High-Temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES) can bridge the gap between the supply and demand, storing excess produced heat during summer and supplying during the winter months. This research focuses on both the technical aspects as well as the business case of the implementation of such a system in a heating network. Technical simulations are performed where the fluid transport and heat loss processes are modelled. The output of these simulations is used to compare the business cases of a heating network with and without HT-ATES implementation, based on the Levelized Cost Of Heat (LCOH) and total annual CO2 emissions in an economics tool developed in Python. All simulations are based on the situation at the TU Delft Campus, where plans are made for a HT-ATES in the Maassluis formation.<br/><br/>The base case shows a thermal recovery efficiency of 0.75 in cycle four. The LCOH for a project with a lifetime of 30 years is 52 €/MWh (14 €/GJ) when HT-ATES is implemented, compared to 61 €/MWh (17 €/GJ) in the case where only geothermal energy and gas boilers are used to supply the heat. Total CO2 emission reductions are 31%. Based on these values, one can conclude that the situation where HT-ATES is included is the economic scenario.<br/><br/>On top of the case study, a parameter sensitivity study is performed. The results show that storage volume, storage reservoir permeability and temperature differences between the wells are the key geological and operational parameters when assessing the project feasibility. Economic parameters such as the discount rate and gas prices also have a considerable impact on the economic results. The results of the sensitivity analysis shows that the project in Delft is feasible as long as the future average gas price remains above 21 €/MWh and the discount rate does not exceed 18.3%, while keeping the other variables constant.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

Stereo matching algorithms are often optimized for specific environments and camera properties, using the ground truth error as a supervisor. However, in practical applications ground truth data is usually not available. Therefore, in this research, we finetune several conventional stereo matching algorithms (BM, SGBM, and ELAS) and a neural network (AnyNet) using self-supervision. The settings of the conventional algorithms are optimized with NSGA-II, using the reconstruction error and disparity density as objective functions. AnyNet is finetuned with the reconstruction error, as well as with the disparity map of conventional methods. We conclude that finetuning the parameters of conventional stereo algorithms using the reconstruction error can lead to a slight improvement in performance compared with the general settings, depending on the stereo algorithm. The performance of the conventional methods is comparable to that of AnyNet on a major portion of the image. However, removing the values with low confidence in the disparity map of ELAS and interpolating the missing disparities leads to an accuracy well above AnyNet.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Currently, runup levels are usually calculated using empirical formula derived from experiments conducted at beaches all over the world, and during different beach states. During this research, conditions are analyzed where runup reaches the dune toe and above. The main objective of this research is to examine the changes in the runup characteristics, which are the wave setup, the infragravity swash motions (low frequency wave motion) and the incident swash motions (high frequency wave motion). In order to examine these conditions, a fieldwork experiment has be conducted at the Sand engine near Kijkduin (South Holland). a dune of 150 (m) in width and 5.5 (m) above NAP (Nieuw Amsterdams Peil) have be constructed near the waterline. Instruments have been installed which have monitored the incoming wave conditions and the behavior of the hydrodynamic conditions at the waterline. One of these instruments was an instrument new to measurements conducted at the coast. This was a LLC (Line scanning Low Cost) LiDAR, which was used to track the runup during extreme wave conditions.<br/>The LLC LiDAR was evaluated in terms of measuring the nearshore hydrodynamics by comparing the water level measured by the LLC LiDAR to the water level measured by a pressure sensor. The water levels from both instruments compared well with an &#x1d445;2 ranging from &#x1d445;2 = −0.86. The match in the peaks of the water levels were lower, showing &#x1d445;2 in the range of 0.34 − 0.78.<br/>Data from the Fieldwork Experiment showed an increase in incident swash wave height during collision conditions when compared to swash conditions. Although the nearshore wave field showed similar conditions between the swash and collision conditions, the swash height showed an increase. Several parameters have been investigated to find the dependence of runup height to the offshore wave or beach characteristics. A best fit is found between runup and the beach slope (&#x1d445;2 = 0.86), also indicating that swash motions are significant. Runup heights during these conditions are also compared to an empirical runup formula. This comparison indicated that runup elevations could still be predicted during conditions where runup reaches above the dune toe elevation.","runup; SWASH; LiDAR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","REALDUNE/REFLEX",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","During its thirteen-year long mission in the Saturnian system, the Cassini spacecraft routinely used Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, for performing its gravity assists. The problem of determining the gravity field of Titan by performing a precise fit of Cassini’s orbit to the available Doppler tracking data was reviewed in this study. The knowledge of the gravity field of Titan can be used to constrain the moon’s internal structure and composition, providing clues about its formation process and the properties of an internal ocean (Grasset et al., 2000). Previous solutions obtained by Durante et al. (2019) and van Noort (2021) were respectively found to have inconsistencies regarding the reported small uncertainties given the noise level of the Doppler measurements and the estimation of an unfeasible negative value for the second-degree Love number k<sub>2</sub>. It was demonstrated in the present work that this last parameter should be estimable. Here, the data from the ten Titan flybys considered in those studies was analysed and emulated by using a relativistic model for Doppler measurements in search of ways of improving the accuracy of the gravity field solution. Both the GEODYN (McCarthy et al., 2015) software from NASA GSFC and Tudat libraries (see appendices in Dirkx et al., 2019) developed by the Astrodynamics and Space Missions department at TU Delft were used to investigate the nature of this gravity determination problem and compare the results against the previous solutions. A model mismatch in Doppler in the order of 10<sup>2</sup> mHz was found between the estimation setups with GEODYN and Tudat. In the search for the source of the mismodelling, it was tested that the empirical accelerations, measurement biases, measurement timing and the spherical harmonics of Saturn have a great influence on the solution and residuals. Thus, they should be reviewed with care for future estimation efforts. It was proven that the flyby geometry is not favourable for resolving the dipole field spherical harmonics coefficients, especially J<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>22</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>, which reveal information about the tidal interactions from Saturn on Titan. They were found to be highly correlated and, when simulating equivalent noises to those found in the previous research, presented similar uncertainties to those obtained by van Noort (2021), but large in relation to the ones determined in Durante et al. (2019). Nevertheless, there are some prospects of estimating the dipole coefficients without the need of adding constraints on the solution, although the search for well grounded constraints is recommended and necessary when pursuing a more accurate solution. The power of fully simulated gravity field estimations as a means for addressing the quality of the available real data and verifying models and constrains, has been manifested throughout this study.","Gravity; Orbit Determination; Outer moons; Titan; Saturn; Cassini; Doppler tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Long fibre pellets have much higher potential strength, and the development of higher strength materials could create stronger parts and/or reduce the mass of products, lowering their energy consumption in the case of vehicular parts of heated tooling.<br/><br/>By developing long-fibre thermoplastic pellet processing, this thesis works toward improving the mechanical performance of fused granulate fabricated parts. Extreme die-swell was encountered when extruding long glass-fibre polypropylene pellets. This die-swell is theorised to be caused by energy storage in an entangled network of long fibres, which is released upon extrusion. This issue was solved by developing a mix of two different material pellets, which was used with the tactical use of temperature zones to create a hetero-phasic blend inside the extruder. This technique and material blend enable controlling the melting of the long fibre pellet resin, lubricating the pellets to promote macro-alignment, and reducing heating through shear friction. These effects delay the dispersion and entangling of fibres.<br/><br/>This method eliminated the problem encountered; reducing porosity by 82%, increasing strength by 960% over the original swollen material and achieving specific strength 16% higher than the short fibre compound currently being used.

Green hydrogen is produced by renewable electricity and is CO<sub>2</sub>-free. This thesis focuses on the production of hydrogen by implementing alkaline water electrolysis as the core technology.  <br/>Due to the intermittency of renewable sources, alkaline water electrolysers are forced to operate in their part-load range. The cathodic hydrogen species that remains dissolved in the liquid electrolyte can end up to the anodic compartment, and hence lower the purity of the produced gaseous oxygen. This phenomenon is prominent in the part-load range and is called gas crossover. When the concentration of hydrogen in oxygen reaches the Lower Explosive Limit which is 4 vol%, spontaneous combustion can occur. Therefore, the electrolyser is forced to shut down for safety reasons.<br/>This thesis focuses on understanding the mass transfer mechanisms of gas crossover in alkaline water electrolysis, in the part-load range. A literature study has been conducted in which the gas crossover mechanisms are thoroughly analyzed. The mitigation of gas crossover can lead the operation to lower current density ranges. From the mitigation strategies, a focus is given on the “dynamic switching of the electrolyte cycles"". The dynamic switching of the electrolyte cycles is based on the periodic changeover of the operative electrolyte cycles between the partly-separated and the mixed mode. The anodic hydrogen content acquires a sinusoidal response, where the average value is less than the impurity in traditional operation.  <br/>The gas crossover steady-state and dynamic models are mathematically derived and developed in Python. The models consider the mechanisms of gas crossover through the diaphragm and the electrolyte mixing. Therefore, the anodic hydrogen and cathodic oxygen content are calculated in the steady state and dynamically. The dynamic switching of electrolyte cycles can be simulated with the dynamic model.<br/>The experiments are conducted to define the anodic hydrogen and cathodic oxygen content in a single cell configuration. The first experiment outputs the steady-state impurity as a function of the current density. The steady-state impurities show a descending tendency with an increasing current density. Next, the dynamic switching is performed and the anodic hydrogen content is recorded as a function of time. The average impurity in the dynamic switching is smaller than the result in the steady-state experiment.<br/>The steady-state model sufficiently validates the literature data and verifies the experimental results. The dynamic switching model validates the literature data. Furthermore, it verifies the experimental results, when a correction factor is applied to the total volume of the separator tanks. The correction factor is required because the experimental impurities were measured at the exit of the single cell, resulting in faster system response. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the dynamic model. The sensitivity analysis shows that the dynamic model can successfully simulate the operation of an alkaline water electrolyser.<br","Alkaline electrolysis; Gas crossover; Process modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-03","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Over the past 20 years, the cost of sequencing genomes has reduced drastically. As DNA data grows at an unprecedented rate, the need for fast and affordable software and hardware solutions for DNA analysis is higher than ever. A critical and time-consuming component in any DNA analysis pipeline is sequence alignment, which refers to mapping smaller sequences onto larger reference regions exhibiting high similarity. Many modern aligners break the problem of alignment into seed and extension. First, the algorithm finds matching substrings between the references and the query and then extends these strings on both ends to contain areas around the seeds. One of the most popular and utilized alignment tools is the Burrows-Wheeler aligner, specifically its Maximal Exact Match version called BWA-MEM. This tool solves the alignment problem by first finding seeds using a unique index called the FMD index, which reduces the complexity of the string matching problem while the extension is performed using a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm. Since the seed and extension methods are time-consuming tasks, they have been the target of various optimizations and acceleration attempts in the past. In this thesis, we aimed to integrate two previously developed GPU libraries, namely GPUSeed which finds seeds in a BWA-MEM like manner and GASAL2 which aims to accelerate the extension, into the BWA-MEM pipeline. The three software components were first analyzed from a theoretical standpoint and then profiled in order to determine the algorithmic and execution differences between the baseline CPU functions of BWA-MEM and the accelerated GPU implementations of GPUSeed and GASAL2. For the GPUSeed library, we found that seeding is performed 24× faster compared to the baseline BWA-MEM. For the GASAL2 library, we found around 1.5× better execution time over the baseline, while the main alignment results of the good quality alignments only differ by around 1.8% due to the GASAL2 acceleration heuristics. Based on our profiling observations, we integrated the three libraries into one complete accelerated BWA-MEM implementation and optimized various stages to achieve better performance and lower results deviations. Our integrated solution achieves speedups between 6.82× and 8.72× for single thread execution, depending on the dataset. For multithreaded execution, we find speedups between 2× and 2.8× over the baseline. For the alignment results, we found that our integrated program has around 2% of lines in the main result different from the baseline program, and if we filter alignments with mapping quality below 20, the percentage of different lines reduces to around 1%. Finally, depending on the query dataset, our accelerated library achieved between 60% and 75% GPU utilization during the seeding phase. For the extension part, we found a consistent 100% utilization for a dataset with 250 bases per query when using 14 CPU threads and varying GPU utilization between 40% and 95% for datasets with smaller query sizes. Our accelerated BWA-MEM implementation is freely available on GitHub.","Bioinformatics; sequence alignment; DNA analysis; GPU computing; CUDA; DNA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bots, P.W.G. (graduation committee); Smith, Matthew (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The urgency for decarbonization of the energy grid is ever increasing and fossil energy sources must be replaced by sustainable sources of energy to prevent detrimental levels of global warming. Renewable energy sources wind and solar show potential and contribute to decarbonization but are intermitted and require storage solutions that are exposed to further constrictions and costs. Nuclear fusion is regarded as the most promising new energy source since scientists first learned about it and in theory poses the ideal properties to meet the needs of the world's future energy system. Despite fusion’s potential as the ideal energy source for innovating and decarbonizing the energy system, the reality is that 70 years of research and development have not yet resulted in fusion energy on the grid. Overpromises by fusion scientists since the seventies have resulted in scepticism and cynicism towards fusion development with the longstanding quip that “Fusion energy is thirty years away…and always will be”. Nevertheless, 2021 saw many important breakthroughs and achievements in fusion research which resulted in it being titled “The best year in the history of fusion development” and led to revived optimism and claims that fusion development is moving from the lab to the grid and commercialization is closer than ever before. <br/><br/>In order to truly understand the process of commercializing fusion energy, the barriers need to be known and understood so that these can be addressed specifically, and the process can be accelerated. Adding to that is, that there are also numerous different technical approaches to fusion, each with their own characteristics. However, currently comprehensive knowledge of these barriers is missing. Information is highly scattered as it is focusses on specific topics of fusion development, mostly the scientific or technical barriers. Adding to that is that most information is on separate technologies or specific experiments. As a result, there is a severe lack of knowledge: it is unknown what all the barriers towards commercialization are, how these barriers differ in severity and how they differ amongst the numerous fusion technologies. In an attempt to tackle this knowledge gap and enable a better understanding of the fusion development, the objective of this research was to develop a comprehensive list of barriers and subsequently study and assess this list for the different approaches to fusion with the intention of increasing the understanding of the pathway for commercialization of fusion energy.<br/><br/>Before starting this endeavour, a conceptual analysis was performed to define the concepts “barrier” and “commercialization”. Using these definitions an extensive literature study was performed, alongside 23 semi-structured interviews with almost all the leading fusion institutes and companies. Using predefined selection criteria to deal with the vast amounts of information, a list of fifteen relevant barriers was identified. The barriers described in literature were complemented and extended by empirical experiences and practical examples obtained in the interviews, resulting in a manageable but comprehensive list of fusion barriers towards commercialization, including several barriers that have received very little attention to date.<br/><br/>In an attempt to gain further insight into these barriers and research how these are different for the various approaches to fusion, a methodology was developed to assess the barriers in a standardized way. Based on the principles of the Y-factor method developed by (Chappin et al., 2020), a customized framework was developed for the commercialization of fusion energy technologies. Each barrier was concisely described and subsequently the identified barriers were organized into five categories: Technology, Operation, Cost &amp; Financing, Governance and Engineering. The framework assesses the barriers on a tripartite scale, scoring a value of 0 indicating no barrier, 1; indicating a potential barrier and 2; indicating a significant barrier. For every barrier the scoring criteria were detailed to allow for accurate scoring. <br/><br/>The five most developed and pursued technical approaches to fusion (Tokamak, Spherical Tokamak, Stellarator, Field Reversed Configuration and Inertial Confinement Fusion) were assessed using the designed framework. This was done by three sperate expert interviews. These respondents were selected because they all had high expertise of both fusion energy and experience within the fusion industry and hence contribute to the validity of the research. Analysis of the results lead to numerous interesting findings <br/><br/>• Barriers generally apply to all technologies: Although the difference between the fusion technologies were identified and acknowledged by the various respondents, this did not result in notable differences in the scoring of these technologies. Instead, most barriers apply in a similar severity for all technologies. <br/><br/>• Experts disagree on fundamental barriers: Two of the respondents disagreed strongly on the scoring of several barriers, such as “Plasma physics”, “Radiation shielding” and “Energy production”. The fact that these respondents both have a PHD in plasma physics, demonstrates the uncertainty of fusion development and underlines the complexity and difficulty of predicting the pathway of fusion technologies. In this particular case the differences mostly originated from the reasoning of the respondents; one argued more from a theoretical point of view while the other purely looked at results to date, exposing that the framework can be interpreted differently by different respondents.<br/><br/>• Barriers have a strong time element: The abovementioned disagreements can be partially explained by time. The application of the framework exposed that nearly all barriers are characterized by a strong time dependency and that the barrier value is heavily dependent on the timeframe it is evaluated in. Fusion technology is still under development and while an active effort was made to describe the scoring criteria as closely as possible during the synthesis of the framework, the time dependency and the interpretability that comes with it could not be eliminated<br/><br/>• Hierarchy within barriers: The application of the framework also exposed a certain degree of hierarchy within the barriers and found that there was an order of urgency within the barrier categories. A clear and logical pathway could be observed; firstly the “Technology” barriers must be resolved, afterwards the category of “Operation” barriers become most urgent and finally the “Engineering” category. This was substantiated by the scores as these categories received the highest scores. The remaining categories “Governance” and “Cost &amp; Financing” are present throughout the entire innovation pathway.<br/><br/>All in all, the research has three main contributions. The first contribution is the identification of a comprehensive list of fifteen barriers that is validated by experts, can be used to assess all fusion technologies and captures the complete commercialization pathway. Secondly, the developed framework is the first tool that can be used to uniformly assess these barriers and compare them amongst different technologies. Finally, application of the framework increased understanding of the time-dependency and hierarchy of the barriers. Despite the limited value of the quantitative output, the qualitative findings have certainly increased understanding of the barriers and complexity of fusion energy development and showed that the use of the method can enable insightful discussions.<br/><br/>It should be noted that in spite of continuous attempts at safeguarding the validity of the research, there are a number of limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the research and its results. The development of the scoring criteria is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different respondents, despite the effort to formulate these with a high accuracy and clarity. Simultaneously, because the barrier definitions and scoring criteria are newly designed, these are also constrained by the perception and interpretation of the researcher. Lastly it is important to note that the application of the designed framework was limited to only 3 respondents and the outcomes are therefore based on a small sample size. The overall results of applying and scoring the framework is greatly determined by the individual views and can’t be generalized.<br","Nuclear fusion energy; Commercialization; Decarbonisation; Barriers; Y-factor; Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Brand, D.I. (mentor); Warman, Peter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nowadays, the digital space is gaining more and more relevance in our daily lives. Transactions, documents, education, meetings, and social activities are being digitalised. Companies from around the globe are making steps and taking initiatives to lead the change with concepts like the “metaverse”. Parallelly, blockchain technology is helping the evolution from the traditional internet to the so called “web 3”, a new concept where decentralisation is key, and revolutionary concepts such as digital ownership and authenticity are more possible than ever. In this scope, the graduation project takes place. <br/><br/>Due to the fast changes the digital environment has suffered in the last year 2021 with the surge of the NFTs and the serious investments in the development of “metaverses”, I intend to understand what problems users have while interacting with NFTs to promote this change and remove possible barriers for the adoption of the technology. The focus, therefore, is on the uses of NFTs and how the consumers interact and experience them. The goal is to detect a problem in this regard and propose a solution that improves the current state of the art. Thus, the work conveyed consists of a study of the general environment, industries, users and their problems and a definition of a problem to solve. Afterwards, I provide a solution to the problem detected.<br/><br/>In the study conducted I pinpoint the current trends of NFTs as a hyped and niche market, but with potential to become mainstream in the mid future (5 years). Accordingly, a problem that could prevent this to happen is detected as result of engaging with the users and their current use of NFTs. Here, the present scenario for showcasing NFTs is highlighted as an issue and potential roadblock for the mass adoption of the technology.<br/><br/>The solution developed does not only focus on the user problem but also on the underlying limitation, the technical existing constraints when visualising NFTs. The result of the graduation project not only solves the problem detected, but also improves the current state of the art and sets a solid ground for NFTs to unlock their maximum potential. This is achieved with the use of advanced technologies like Augmented Reality and concentration on the user’s desires. <br/><br/>Finally, future recommendations are suggested to improve the deliverable, including all the functionalities required. A fully working prototype will shed more light to the results obtained and give the users the true complete desired experience.","Non-Fungible Tokens; Web 3.0; Augmented Reality; Metaverse; Design for Emotion; User Centered Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Uriol Balbin, I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","At the Technical University of Delft(TU Delft), a Kirigami inspired method of spirally deploying a coiled up band into a parabolic reflector is being studied for its use in space.<br/>This thesis performs a thermo-elastic analysis on the spiral dish Antenna (SDA) using a combination of ESATAN-TMS, Abaqus, and python scripting. After analysing a reflector for different low earth orbital cases in ESATAN, the heat fluxes are transferred to Abaqus to perform a second thermal analysis. A base SDA is modelled with an Aluminum zipper and Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) band. The SDA is shown to experience temperatures ranging from 175K to 375K with temperature changes of 100K in less than 100s.<br/>The reflector can experiences maximum temperature deltas of 93K across the reflector at a single moment during orbit. These temperature changes cause the SDA to have a maximum displacement of 20mm with a maximum root mean square (RMS) of 6mm. This thesis also shows the creation of a cross pattern on the SDA most likely created by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the zipper and band material. An improved SDA is modelled after an initial parametrization, showing an improvement to the displacement field with the max RMS being around 1mm. <br/>This thesis shows how the base model of the SDA deforms into an cross pattern and experience high displacement regions near the end of the spiral interface. This version of the SDA is shown to not be able to perform in space. A short parametrization analysis with regards to materials choice, spiral geometry, and<br/>thickness does show a path in which the SDA can perform similarly to a normal reflector with the same design parameters.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
