Not solely as a means of transportation through the vast amount of land that is covered by the city, but also as a means of development for the city’s spatial configurations, organizational patterns and even building typologies. New York’s developmental history is probably more closely interwoven with the development of its rapid transit system than any other city in the world. The subways and elevated’s enabled the northward expansion on the island of Manhattan, unified the five boroughs into one megalopolis, dispersed the population from the tip of Manhattan, sparked the development of the city’s first suburbs and eventually created the breeding ground for the high densities and skyscrapers, as we know them from today’s Manhattan. In a relatively short period of about 100 years, New York City grew from a small harbor town, to the largest metropolis in the world at that time. The Rapid Transit system forms an intricate part of this growth process. The four periods distinguished in the course of this research, each mark a distinct stage in the development of the system, but also in the becoming of the Metropolis. The direction and scale of the introduced system each time determined the step forward that could be taken by urban development. Therefore it is safe to say, that without its Rapid Transit system, New York City would have never become the metropolis as we know it now.","New York City; rapid transit; subway; elevated; history","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor); Lee, S. (mentor); Hoekstra, F. (mentor); Van Weeren, C. (mentor)","2009","The 'Commuter Retreat' project was developed in the context of the Border Conditions graduation studio. This studio emphasizes on an experimental approach to architecture, based on the development of specific techniques of representation to describe specific urban and architectural phenomena. The first part of the studio focuses on the urban investigation of a specific city and the second part consist of an architectural design, derived from the discourse developed in the first part of the studio. The design of the Commuter Retreat is based on the notions of flow, movement, connectivity and the network as a basic means of notating these phenomena. The design was generated from these notions and aims to test these notions as architectural tools by means of 3D computer modeling with Nurbs surfaces. This is crucial, as these surfaces are defined in space by vectors, which have a specific speed and direction, rather than by points, which are static. This type of modeling is fundamental to a different way of thinking about and dealing with 3 dimensional spaces, which can now be based on movement and transformation rather than stasis. Based on this generative approach to the generation of 3 dimensional spatial models, an architectural model for a Health Centre that connects an Underground subway station to an Elevated train station is developed. The design deals with the genesis of architectural form from the notions of network, flow and movement by translating these into specific shapes through vector based Nurbs modeling. A four-directional grid, or Diagrid, is used to control the deformation of the Nurbs surfaces to accommodate specific programmatic requirements. The project researches parametric construction development and the use of file-to-factory techniques to create physical representations of the computer model. By means of project of simple construction elements on complex 3 dimensional surfaces, the computer calculates the parametric deformation of these elements, which data can in turn be used to control the CNC machinery that manufactures these unique elements.","border conditions; nurbs modeling; cnc; double curved surfaces; parametric design","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Because of the wish for, and the necessity of the multiple use of space the amount of tunnels and buildings in close proximity of roads are increasing. Meanwhile the number of transports of dangerous goods is also increasing. Therefore it would be desirable to have a highway network which is fully accessible for the transport of dangerous goods. In order to make this possible the effect of an incident with dangerous goods on the buildings along the road should be known. This study focuses on the effect of an explosion blast on a building. It aims to propose a method to determine this effect, and to propose several structural solutions for buildings, situated alongside the road, to make them more resistant against the blast load from an explosion on the road as a result of an incident with an LPG tank truck. Of all the possible situations on the Dutch highway network some are discussed and three are chosen to study the effect of an explosion. These situations are: in the tunnel, at the tunnel mouth and on the open road with buildings beside the road. Of all types of explosions and effects that can occur, this study only focuses on the effect of a blast wave on a building as a result of a BLEVE of an LPG tank truck of 50 m3. A BLEVE is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion. The to liquid compressed gas will evaporate explosively when the vessel ruptures, which results in a blast wave. The overpressure at the building can be schematised by in instant increase of the pressure to the peak overpressure, after which it decreases linearly to zero after a certain positive phase duration. The impulse is the surface under the pressure-time curve. An explosion in a tunnel results in the building-up of pressure. To determine how the overpressure exits the tunnel and reaches the building, an estimation of the increase of volume and the wave front surface is made. For an explosion in the open field five different methods are discussed. These range from a TNT equivalence method to a gas-dynamic modelling. The calculated values for the overpressure differ a lot and not all methods give a value for the impulse. Based on the described methods it is concluded that an explosion on the open road gives a larger blast load on the building than an explosion in the tunnel or the tunnel mouth. The blast-wave of an explosion of an LPG tank truck can cause damage to the buildings. Several aspects of the blast-wave are discussed, and how they determine the load that is transferred to the main load bearing structure. These aspects are among others the reflection, dynamic blast load, adjacent buildings, distribution of the blast load on the façade of a building, and glass failure. For several of these aspects methods are given to determine the load on the building. The peak reflected overpressure on a defined model building of 35 m high is 101 kPa and the impulse is 1,97 kPa*s. After this the mechanical properties of a building as a whole and of the building elements that determine its response to this load are determined. These are the static strength, natural frequency and ductility. After the loading, all the response aspects and the structural properties are determined and an estimation of the damage to the building and its elements is given with methods that calculate the chance of collapse, the equivalent static load and the required ductility. From sensitivity analyses of the damage methods it is concluded that it is possible to make a building able to withstand the blast from an LPG explosion by choosing the right parameters. The most sensitive parameters of the blast load and the mechanical properties of the building are the tank volume, the distance to the explosion, the horizontal design load and the height of the building. A higher building results in a larger design load and a smaller angular rotation","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

De context van deze opgave is de wijk Transvaal in Den Haag. Dit is een aandachtswijk (=probleemwijk). Onderzoek: Voorafgaand aan het ontwerp is er een uitgebreid onderzoek verricht, naar aandachtswijken, commerciele gebouwen en de Haagse wijk Transvaal. De onderzoeksvraag die hierbij centraal staat, luidt: Met welke kwaliteitsrichtlijnen en aandachtspunten kan het ontwerp van een multicultureel commercieel gebouw geegreerd worden in een aandachtswijk en bijdragen aan de wijkverbetering? et doel van het onderzoek is tweeledig: - het ontwerpen van een multicultureel commercieel gebouw in Den Haag Transvaal. - het formuleren van kwaliteitsrichtlijnen en aandachtspunten voor een ontwerp van een multicultureel commercieel gebouw in een aandachtswijk. Aandachtswijken: Aandachtswijk is een ander woord voor probleemwijk. In het onderzoek is het overheidbeleid en architectuurbeleid van de 20e eeuw geevalueerd. Op grond van een uitgebreide inventarisatie zijn aanbevelingen voor architecten opgesteld. Commerciele gebouwen: In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de architectonische kenmerken van commerciele gebouwen. Daarnaast is een breder onderwerp aan bod gekomen: het functioneren van publieke functies. Het commerciele gebouw zou namelijk kunnen functioneren als publieke domein (=een plaats waar verschillende maatschappelijke groepen uitwisselen). Leerzaam waren de aandachtspunten van 'Projects for Public Spaces', die pleiten voor het creeren van succesvolle plaatsen in de stad. Transvaal: Het meest specifieke onderzoek is de analyse van de wijk Transvaal. De wijk is onderzocht op stedenbouwkundig gebied, historie en sociale karakteristieken. Er is een visie opgesteld na het doornemen van de beleidsstukken en plannen van de gemeente Den Haag. Patronenboek: De bevindingen en conclusies uit het onderzoek zijn vertaald in richtlijnen voor de ontwerper. De gebruikte methode is de patronentaal van Christopher Alexander. Er is een patronenboek van 37 richtlijnen is samengesteld. Deze kan als handboek dienen voor architecten, die voor een soortgelijke opgave zijn gesteld. Ontwerp: Het ontwerp van een multicultureel commercieel gebouw in Transvaal (Den Haag) was de laatste en belangrijkste fase in het afstudeerproject. Het complex vormt een onderdeel van de wijkaanpak en stedelijke vernieuwing. Het dient een complementair onderdeel te zijn van het commerci netwerk van Den Haag. Het krijgt een Oosters karakter, gezien de bevolkingssamenstelling in de wijken er omheen. Het gebouw presenteert Transvaal met haar rijkdom aan culturen aan de stad. En het is aantrekkelijk voor hogere inkomensgroepen. Het gebouw herbergt diverse commerci functies, zoals winkels, horeca, een filmhuis en een hammam (badhuis). Daarnaast zijn er 30 woningen in het complex ondergebracht en er is voldoende parkeergelegenheid. De locatie van het gebouw is op de grens van de wijken Transvaal en de Schilderswijk. Het is een representatieve plek in de stad en het kavel vormt onderdeel van een voorzieningenstrook langs tramlijn 11. Het is goed bereikbaar voor autos en met het OV. Het gebouw heeft een duidelijke structuur, van schijven. In het complex nemen twee koepelvormige pleinen een belangrijke plaats in. De pleinen worden gevormd door bogen, die uitgesneden zijn uit de schijven. De pleinen zijn spectaculaire ruimtes, met Oosterse sfeer. In de materialisering en detaillering vindt een interessante integratie plaats. Dit ontwerp staat in Den Haag, en krijgt een Oosterse identiteit. De gevel wordt gemaakt van baksteen, met oog voor detail en toepassing van kleurrijke ornamentiek. Inspiratie hiervoor wordt gevonden in omringende bebouwing en in India. In het ontwerp worden beide werelden samengevoegd tot een interessant spel van verschillende culturen.","multicultureel; probleemwijk; oosterse architectuur; transvaal; multifunctioneel","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","With the rise of multi-core chips in commodity hardware, the need for specialized workloads to evaluate the performance of multi-core systems has become apparent. The current generation of workloads used for evaluating multi-core systems often consist of sequential programs not capable of running on multiple processors and are therefore of limited use for evaluating multi-core hardware. Such sequential programs fail to show the bene?ts of adding additional cores to a system, since the programs are not capable of using all of the available resources concurrently. Apple Inc. requested the development of a workload suite that would clearly show the bene?ts of increasing the number of cores, while stressing the main parts of the system. Key requirements for the workload are: Scalability, Reproducibility and Veri?ability. In this thesis report, we present the whole process of workload development for multi-core systems, starting from selecting the programs to be included in the workload, till the application of the workload to actual hardware. In addition, this report discusses the classi?cation of different programs based on fundamental algorithm classes called Dwarfs, which is the basis for selecting possible workload components. The thesis also presents the relevant technologies used for the parallelization of selected workload components. Finally, a case study is discussed showing how to use the developed workload in practice.","amdahl; benchmark; bioinformatics; chud; cpu; heisenberg; HPC; intel; linpack; MPI; NASA; NPB; openmp; parallel; parsec; performance tools; pin; posix; raytrace; scaling; apple; shark; spec; suite; wrf; x264; yafaray; multi-core; multicore; analysis; workload; architecture; Dwarf","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Munnig Schmidt, R.H. (mentor)","2009","Many high-tech equipment demands a vibration free environment and can only operate at vibration levels much lower than typical ground vibrations. This high level of vibration isolation is difficult to achieve with conventional suspension solutions, especially in the range of low frequencies in the order of 1 Hz. The goal of the Kolibri project conducted at TNO is to develop an active vibration isolated tabletop system which excellent vibration attenuation properties at low frequencies: 60 dB attenuation at 1 Hz. The performance of the current Kolibri table does not meet this requirement by 30 dB and is to be improved. The current Kolibri set-up is analyzed to find the performance limiting functional sub-systems. The conclusion of this analysis is that a redesign of the suspension will provide a significant improvement of the vibration isolation performance. Reducing the natural frequency of the suspention from 10 Hz to 0.5 Hz will result in the desired performance improvement of the total Kolibri system. This reduction of natural frequency is to be achieved by reducing the suspension stiffness. The principle of negative stiffness is chosen to reduce the positive stiffness of the conventional spring. This will potentially result in a compact suspention mechanism at reasonable costs. Several concepts for this mechanism are analyzed. The configuration with three pre-tensioned radial flextures is chosen and completely worked out in detail. After manufacturing, the negative stiffness mechanism assembled to be tested. The performance of the negative stiffness mechanism is measured; the natural frequency of the mechanism is found to be X Hz, which is higher/lower than the specifications. Conclusions and recommendations are given for future developments on the Kolibri project, and for improving the negative stiffness mechanism.","vibration isolation; suspension stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The two main objectives were (1) to develop this model and (2) consequently apply it to study the effects of wave reworking on the morphology and stratigraphy of a delta. A depth-average Delft3D model with two sediment fractions (fine silt and fine sand) was developed. The initial condition was the morphology and stratigraphy of a pre-defined fluvial-dominated delta. This initial condition was first subjected to gentle perpendicular waves for a period of 44 months, for a situation with no active river discharge, to resemble a degrading delta. Next, the reference model was subjected to waves for the same period and varying riverine water and sediment discharges were added to the model. The results of these simulations gave a realistic representation of sediment reworking by waves in the deltaic environment. The deltaic environment rapidly adjusted to changes in the forcing. The base case showed the effects of delta front erosion, channel infill and sediment sorting. Due to the difference in energy required for stirring up and transport of sediments, sand sediments remained in the deltaic environment while silt sediments were transported. This process of sediment sorting is dominant in wave reworking and is adequately represented by the model. Sand sediments are deposited on the edges of the delta front and thereby shield the underlying fine sediments. The results for the fluvial input case showed similar realistic behaviour and exhibited a switch towards wave-influenced delta morphology and behaviour, as defined by classical delta classifications. Also deposition of sand-ridges around the river mouth was observed. Sand deposits prevented further erosion of fine sediments of the delta front and sand-ridges shield the deltaic environment behind the ridge. This study also demonstrated that the influence of riverine sediment discharge is a steering factor for delta development. The model proved to be robust in the sensitivity analysis and provides greater insight in the coupling of morphology and stratigraphy of deltas and delta behaviour. The model therefore contributes to the understanding of the response to changes of processes in the deltaic environment, which is of increasing importance to help to sustain deltas for future generations.","delta; sediment reworking; wave reworking; morphology; stratigraphy","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Het aantal stakeholders neemt verder toe door onder andere uitbreiding van de prestatievelden in het BBSH naar leefbaarheid en zorg en de aandacht in Stedelijke Vernieuwing naast fysieke ingrepen voor sociale en economische ingrepen. Stakeholders zijn er in vele soorten en maten; van zorg- en welzijnsinstellingen, basisscholen en gemeenten tot collega corporaties, belangenverenigingen, milieuactivisten, pers en natuurlijk de klant. In literatuur over de corporatiesector wordt gewezen op het oog hebben voor stakeholders (SEV (2008), Futura (2008), Elsing, M. (2007). De corporatie kan niet om stakeholders heen. De taak van corporaties stopt niet bij stenen stapelen. Stakeholders zijn degenen die de corporatie legitimiteit en de mogelijkheid tot ondernemen geven (SER, 2005). Nu zou men denken dat hiermee de term stakeholdermanagement valt; hoe de omgang met stakeholders bewust vorm te geven. Echter deze term duikt in de discussies rondom stakeholders in de corporatiesector nog niet vaak op. Literatuur vanuit andere vakgebieden zoals organisatiekunde en procesmanagement richt zich wel op stakeholdermanagement. Echter hoe wordt stakeholdermanagement door de corporatiesector met haar aandacht voor maatschappelijk ondernemen vormgegeven? Dit rapport probeert het gat in literatuur en onderzoek naar stakeholdermanagement door woningcorporaties te dichten. Daarbij wordt gebruik gemaakt van een vanuit de literatuur geformuleerd analytisch model ten aanzien van stakeholdermanagent. Dit model wordt vervolgens getoetst aan de praktijk om af te sluiten met conclusies en aanbevelingen ten aanzien van stakeholdermanagement door woningcorporaties","stakeholdermanagement; woningcorporatie; stedelijke vernieuwing","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

The exact processes that drive this ongoing erosion however are not well defined yet, and therefore two main goals are defined. The first goal is to gain more insight into the processes that drive the ongoing erosion in Hai Hau. The second goal is to predict the future developments of the nearshore area with following consequences for the coastal defense system. The most important results are: 1. Large amounts of wave energy coming from north-eastern directions are blocked by the Ba Lat delta. The only waves reaching the northern part of the Hai Hau coast refract around the delta. These refracted waves are lower than the waves in the other parts of Hai Hau. 2. Modeling south-western currents along the Ba Lat delta showed that the flow is restored at a distance of approximately 13 km south of the southern spit of the Ba Lat delta. Due to the asymmetrical shape of the Ba Lat delta this reattachment point is expected to be located more south in reality. 3. Alongshore sediment transport modeling by waves only, resulted in southward directed transport in winter, with increasing transport capacities in southern direction. Summer transport directions are north. In the annual transport a point of diverging transport direction has been observed near Van Ly. 4. Lowering of the seabed in front of the dikes resulted in a reduction of sediment transport capacities for all locations. The transport gradients, and hence the eroded volumes, decrease as well. These results lead to the following conclusions: a) The sheltering effect of the Ba Lat delta on the sediment transport in Hai Hau is a reduction in sediment transport capacities in the northern parts during winter monsoon periods. This transport increases in southern direction. During summer monsoon periods waves are not hindered to reach the shore and transport capacities are more constant. b) conclusions regarding the annual erosion were based on the assumption that the large scale residual currents reattach in the middle of Hai Hau. Currents along the coast are expected to increase in southern direction from 0 m/s in the North to 0.2 m/s in the South. c) The present annual eroding volume is approximated at 546.000 m3/year. 4) Lowering of the seabed in front of dikes over the width of the surfzone due to ongoing erosion, reduces the width over which sediment is transported in longshore direction. This also leads to lowering of alongshore sediment transports rates and eroded volumes. An equilibrium situation is not to be expected in the near future.","erosion; coastal; Hai Hai; Vietnam; processes","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Verhaeghe, R.J. (mentor); Van Ham, J.C. (mentor)","2009","This thesis carries out the capacity expansion strategy for port in a competition environment. A new model which deals sea port as a node in the logistic chain will be built in this study. And the port of Rotterdam and port of Antwerp will be used as a special case study. Nowadays containers are widely used in world trade business. Millions of containers are being moved from one point to another every single day. In the last decades, world container traffic has increased enormously because of the increasing wodd population and the more specific needs of customers. The world container traffic increased from around 100 Million TEU in 1990 to around 400 Million TEU in 2005 (Hofstra University). And the container traffic is expected to remain growing in the future. The growth in international container shipping will continue with the expected percentage of 9% annually up to 2015 (Heymann, 2006). Ports, as facilities for accommodate ships and transferring cargoes, play essential nodes in maritime-land freight transport network. The strong growth in container industry, gives a good opportunity for port development on one hand. On the other hand, ports are facing great pressure of handling with the rapid-growing container traffic. Due to the enormous growth in total demand and uncertain demand fluctuation in short periods, ports are always faced with capacity problems, either short-capacity or over-capacity. When taking into account new trends in containerization, and intensively increasing competition among ports in regional port clusters, port planning in capacity will become even more significant. Therefore, developing best strategies to deal with port capacity expansion problems in competitive environments is a main challenge faced by port authonties. In order to provide information to port authorities when they make port capacity expansion strategies, simulation models are widely used. In these simulation models, main focus is on hinterland transport network, because of the quality of hintedand transport has become increasingly important for the competitiveness of a seaport (Konings, 2007). Basically, two types of approaches for transport modeling can be used in transportation planning concerning port capacity problems. One is simulation of route assignment in network, e.g. the SMILE model (Strategic Model for Integrated Logistics and Evaluation) developed by the Dutch institute TNO, which simulates the assignment of freight flows for different commodity types and transportation modes. The other one is projection of port demand based on macro-economic relationships with a more or less fixed market share for a particular port. The example of this second approach is the GSM model (Goederen Stromen Model) used by the Port of Rotterdam. But there are some limitations in these two approaches. The first approach does not account for port development. This approach mainly focuses on hinterland transportation network. However, port investment characteristics are not taken into account in this approach. The second approach accounts for port development, but does not incorporate the potential changes in a port's market share caused by, for instance, competition between transportation routes or port service level. In this case, it is essential to develop a new model, which combine these two fore-mentioned approaches, with the capability of both simulating the effect of competition and incorporating autonomous demand growth. In this thesis, a new concept is formulated that sea port is considered as a node in total logistic chain. A new dynamic port planning model is developed with Microsoft Excel Program. In this port planning model, factors of port capacity, port-commercial and public interests, port competition, capacity problems of hinterland infrastructures are all taken into consideration. An actor analysis is firstly carried out in the thesis. The main actors in container industry are analyzed, including terminal operators, port authorities, shipping companies, inland transport operators, manufacturers and consignees. Market share, port utilization, traffic volume, and unit cost are concluded as the main interests of port authorities. Based on the conclusions of actor analysis, the port planning model is developed with three key inputs, including (1) port residence cost and congestion; (2) port investment cost; (3) hintedand transport cost and congestion. This model is developed based on the following iterative mechanism: In one year, these three aspects (i.e. port residence cost, port investment cost, and hintedand transport cost) determine the unit transshipment cost per TEU of this same year and ultimately determine ports' market share of the same year. However, the market share of this year would determine the three costs of the next following year (i.e. port residence cost, port investment cost, and hintedand transport cost). In the iterative process, several other factors are also included. Port capacity also affects the port residence cost of the same year. The new capacity added is another factor that affects the port investment costs of the same year. Hintedand infrastructure also affects the hintedand transport cost of the same year. A case study is earned out by means of the port-planning model. In this case study, port of Antwerp and port of Rotterdam are chosen as the two competition ports. Time honzon of 30 years is analyzed with thirty iterations. First of all, a general descnption of both ports is shown, including geographical location, histoncal overview, port statistics, hintedand connection, future expansion planning and containenzation in each port. Based on this basic port information, five scenarios and assumptions are made as follows: changing expansion plans; changes in port congestion; changes in hintedand congestion; global economy development; combination of strategies with uncertainty. The first two scenarios (changing expansion plans and changes in port congestion) can be fully determined by port authorities.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

De feitelijke bouw loopt sterk achter op de planning en wegen en nutsvoorzieningen blijken niet op tijd beschikbaar. Dat heeft gevolgen voor de bouw van de deelgebieden. Dit onderzoek heeft de beperkingen tijdens de exploitatieperiode in beeld gebracht en daarvoor een oplossing aangedragen. Er is gekozen om te werken vanuit het perspectief van de Gemeenschappelijke Exploitatie Maatschappij (GEM) De Zuidlanden. Een analyse van het project en de ruimtelijke omgeving heeft duidelijk gemaakt waar de knelpunten zich bevinden en waardoor ze ontstaan. Met een risicoanalyse op de huidige planning van De Zuidlanden zijn de voornaamste onzekerheden rond het project in beeld gebracht. Op basis daarvan is een aantal mogelijke beheersmaatregelen aangegeven. Het eindresultaat van het onderzoek is een voorstel voor een aangepaste planning van De Zuidlanden. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de hoofdinfrastructuur een centrale rol speelt binnen het project. Dit is allereerst een gevolg van de ontwikkelingsstrategie van de GEM. Men legt nieuwe wegen en nutsvoorzieningen pas aan op het moment dat ze nodig zijn om nieuwe deelgebieden te bouwen. Hierdoor komen de infrastructurele werkzaamheden op het ‘kritieke pad’ van de planning te liggen. Tegelijkertijd zijn de bestaande wegen en nutsvoorzieningen ontoereikend voor het totale project. De deelgebieden zijn dus keer op keer afhankelijk van nieuw aan te leggen infrastructuur. De ontwikkelingsstrategie van de GEM en de betrokkenheid van andere partijen blijken een groot aandeel te hebben in het ontstaan van tijdsrisico’s voor het project. In de voorgestelde beheersstrategie is gekozen voor het verminderen van afhankelijkheid van de aanleg van hoofdinfrastructuur. Daardoor nemen de risico’s voor het project als geheel sterk af. Dit kan de GEM bereiken door de hoofdinfrastructuur voor het hele gebied eerder aan te leggen. Vanwege de grote voorinvestering die ermee gepaard gaat, zou ze de aanleg in een paar grote stappen uit kunnen voeren. Dat geeft nog steeds voldoende effect. Een en ander is uitgewerkt tot een voorstel voor de planning van het project. Voor een vollediger afweging van het wel of niet implementeren van de nieuwe strategie verdient het aanbeveling ook de financiële haalbaarheid in beeld te brengen. Het schuiven met werkzaamheden in de uitvoeringsfase van de planning heeft direct invloed op de grondexploitatie.

Meanwhile the number of transports of dangerous goods is also increasing. Therefore it would be desirable to have a highway network which is fully accessible for the transport of dangerous goods. In order to make this possible the effect of an incident with dangerous goods on the buildings along the road should be known. This study focuses on the effect of an explosion blast on a building. It aims to propose a method to determine this effect, and to propose several structural solutions for buildings, situated alongside the road, to make them more resistant against the blast load from an explosion on the road as a result of an incident with an LPG tank truck. Of all the possible situations on the Dutch highway network some are discussed and three are chosen to study the effect of an explosion. These situations are: in the tunnel, at the tunnel mouth and on the open road with buildings beside the road. Of all types of explosions and effects that can occur, this study only focuses on the effect of a blast wave on a building as a result of a BLEVE of an LPG tank truck of 50 m3. A BLEVE is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion. The to liquid compressed gas will evaporate explosively when the vessel ruptures, which results in a blast wave. The overpressure at the building can be schematised by in instant increase of the pressure to the peak overpressure, after which it decreases linearly to zero after a certain positive phase duration. The impulse is the surface under the pressure-time curve. An explosion in a tunnel results in the building-up of pressure. To determine how the overpressure exits the tunnel and reaches the building, an estimation of the increase of volume and the wave front surface is made. For an explosion in the open field five different methods are discussed. These range from a TNT equivalence method to a gas-dynamic modelling. The calculated values for the overpressure differ a lot and not all methods give a value for the impulse. Based on the described methods it is concluded that an explosion on the open road gives a larger blast load on the building than an explosion in the tunnel or the tunnel mouth. The blast-wave of an explosion of an LPG tank truck can cause damage to the buildings. Several aspects of the blast-wave are discussed, and how they determine the load that is transferred to the main load bearing structure. These aspects are among others the reflection, dynamic blast load, adjacent buildings, distribution of the blast load on the façade of a building, and glass failure. For several of these aspects methods are given to determine the load on the building. The peak reflected overpressure on a defined model building of 35 m high is 101 kPa and the impulse is 1,97 kPa*s. After this the mechanical properties of a building as a whole and of the building elements that determine its response to this load are determined. These are the static strength, natural frequency and ductility. After the loading, all the response aspects and the structural properties are determined and an estimation of the damage to the building and its elements is given with methods that calculate the chance of collapse, the equivalent static load and the required ductility. From sensitivity analyses of the damage methods it is concluded that it is possible to make a building able to withstand the blast from an LPG explosion by choosing the right parameters. The most sensitive parameters of the blast load and the mechanical properties of the building are the tank volume, the distance to the explosion, the horizontal design load and the height of the building. A higher building results in a larger design load and a smaller angular rotation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Based on these settings, we defined a horizontal fractured structure above and below the shale beds and vertical fractures with spacing varying from 10{30 cm. The matrix in between is oil shale with a kerogen content of 35% up to 70 %. The oil shale contains lenses of pyrite. Several dynamic models, based on this fractured oil shale structure, have been developed to illustrate aspects leading to enhancements or extinction of oil shale fires. Natural convection supplies air (oxygen) to sustain combustion. Air can penetrate into the matrix, mainly to the highly fractured structure, to react with fuel. The presence of oxidising pyrite may trigger the fire. Favourable conditions for oil shale fires are dryness, mostly during the summer, and a heat source.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as node density increases, the throughput share of each device decreases due to contention of the wireless medium. It seems that the capacity problem in wireless mesh networks can be alleviated by equipping the nodes with multiple radios tuned to non-overlapping channels. In theory it should be possible to have simultaneous reliable transmissions on orthogonal non-overlapping channels. In practice though, due to signal leakage from one channel to another, transmissions on these non overlapping channels interfere with one another. In this thesis, I claim that the assumption of perfect independence between non-overlapping operating channels does not always hold in general. During this work, I have done some practical measurements about adjacent channel interference, taking into consideration various factors such as antenna separation, number of channels and radio, transmit-power and packet size. I have compared the interference effects in different channels. Furthermore, I have evaluated and studied the causes and effects of adjacent channel interference via analysis, calculations and simulation. In order to cope with this problem, a classification of possible solutions which are feasible is discussed, and then by adopting the concept of reservation, I propose a solution called MRR (Multi-Radio Reservation). Finally the proposed solution is evaluated.","adjacent channel interference; multi-radio; multi-channel; wireless mesh networks; reservation","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Telecommunications","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Architecture has rarely taken political initiative itself, except of some points in the history, (beginning of the 20th century) when avant-garde political projects and progressive art and architecture movements worked in a close collaboration to imagine different worlds. Today, in the post political condition, the urgent necessity emerges of rethinking the way space is produced and the role of urbanists, planners and architects in the society.","critical architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-08-08","Architecture","DSD Urban Asymmetries","","","",""

(mentor); Hekmat, R. (mentor)","2009","Recently the need for ultra high data rate wireless networks has increased. With the improvement of CMOS technologies, 60 GHz WPANs has become more interesting commercially. 60 GHz radio operates at wave lengths in the order of millimeters at a frequency band between 57 and 64 GHz. The 802.15.3 MAC is specified to provide high data rate and also have QoS capabilities. Because of physical properties of 60 GHz radio, humans and other object are sources for blocking and shadowing of the wireless channel. The 802.15.3 MAC does not specify how these kind of connection issues can be solved. To overcome problem of shadowing and blocking, changes have to be made to the 803.15.3 MAC and route discovery is needed in case two node lose their peer-to-peer connection. This thesis provides a solution for blocking of a connection between two devices in a piconet by using a multi-hop solution. First a route discovery process is initialised. If needed intermediate nodes are used to reconnect the devices. In case either the source or the destination is excluded from the piconet, a new piconet is formed, creating a mesh network. The newly created piconet contains devices which are in reach of the source and the destination. A measurement for the performance of the route discovery process is the time needed to find the optimal route between the source and the destination. A mathematical model has been derived for route discovery during the CAP using directional antennas. In Opnet Modeler the route discovery has also been simulated using the 802.15.3 MAC extended with directional antennas. The mathematical models do not exactly produce the same values for the delay as the simulation. However, the mathematical model and the simulations show the same behaviour. Furthermore, both the mathematical model and the simulation show that for small networks initialising a route discovery process is quick enough to overcome blocking.","mmwWPAN; 60 GHz","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Brookhuis, K.A. (mentor); Ossen, S.J.L. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, S.P. (mentor)","2009","In order to assess infrastructure measures or dynamic traffic management measures, microscopic simulation models have proven to be powerful tools. These models, describing the driving behaviour at a microscopic level, consist of several sub models each modelling different aspects of the driving behaviour. Recently however, doubts have been raised on the validity of the theories used to model lane change behaviour. This research focuses on one specific type of lane change, the mandatory lane change. Mandatory lane changes are lane changes that need to be performed by the driver to keep following his route. A well observable type of a mandatory lane change is the merge from an on ramp to the main road of a freeway. The objective of this research is to find the best way to describe the merge behaviour in a theory that can be used to model merge behaviour. Existing theories on merge behaviour model this behaviour with gap acceptance. Gap acceptance states that every driver has a certain critical gap. Every gap that is larger than the critical gap will be accepted by the driver. Current microscopic simulation models, e.g. Vissim and Fosim, make the critical gap shorter along the on ramp. In this way the growing urge to perform the merge is modelled. New theories on merge behaviour elaborate further on gap acceptance, adding cooperative behaviour of vehicles on the main road or adding different scenarios for which different critical gaps are valid. To analyse the existing theories on merge behaviour an empirical microscopic dataset has been collected within this research. For this purpose a flight with a helicopter has been performed. Underneath the helicopter a high resolution camera is mounted that captures fifteen images per second. Two data collection locations have been selected. Criteria for these locations were: a freeway with an on ramp, where the on ramp needs to form an active bottleneck for the freeway. There should also be no obstacles above the road. Two datasets have been collected, one at the A12 near Bodegraven containing 35 minutes of data and one at the A2 near Vinkeveen containing 15 minutes of data. The Bodegraven dataset has been processed into a trajectory dataset containing 3459 trajectories, from which 704 trajectories are merging vehicles. Four aspects of the merge behaviour are analysed using the Bodegraven trajectory dataset: - The merge location; - The accepted gaps; - The relaxation phenomenon; - Cooperative behaviour of vehicles on the main road. Analysis of the merge location has shown that during congestion more vehicles merge in at the end of the on ramp than during free flow traffic conditions. Looking at the individual trajectories has shown that vehicles that merge in at the end of the on ramp during congestion are overtaking vehicles on the main road. The accepted gaps found in the dataset are very short. Resulting time headways, between the merging vehicle and its new leader and follower, start below 0.25 s. Analysing these headways after the merge shows that gradually the headways grow over time. This indicates that the relaxation phenomenon is present in the driving behaviour. Examples of cooperative behaviour of vehicles on the main road have been found. Cooperative lane changing, where a vehicle on the right lane of the main road changes a lane to the left to give a merging vehicle more space, is performed by 7% of all vehicles on the right lane. Courtesy yielding, where the new follower of the merging vehicle decelerates to enlarge the headway, is also found in the dataset. It is found that this behaviour is very subtle. The analyses on the merge behaviour have shown that gap acceptance theories, using a certain critical gap, are not able to represent the observed behaviour. Therefore a new theory on merge behaviour is postulated based on gap selection. This theory states that every merging vehicle is able to find a suitable gap without being overtaken by multiple vehicles on the main road and without coming to a standstill at the end of the on ramp. For every merging vehicle a set of reachable gaps is defined. Every gap for which it is physically possible to be reached, is put in the set. From this set a choice is made using a choice model. The choice depends on the driver style of the merging vehicle. The postulated theory is worked out in a flowchart indicating how merge behaviour should be modelled. Future research is needed on the choice model and on the calibration of the theory. This future work can be done using the existing Bodegraven trajectory dataset.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The creation of a decision model with which the most economic construction methodology for a specific project can be obtained, was the goal of this research project. It has been carried out in cooperation with the Dutch contracting firm Boele & van Eesteren. Problem definition The choice for the construction method of a building is often based on a contractor’s knowledge, culture, equipment and thoroughness in which a project- and process analysis is carried out. Whether the selected construction method is the most economical is not always analyzed in an integral manner. Furthermore, in case alternative construction methods are analyzed, excess risks on construction costs and construction time are not always explicitly taken into account. Research My research is carried out by answering the following research questions: 1. How is the development of high-rise residential buildings in the Netherlands and which construction methodologies are used? 2. Which construction methodologies are essential for integration into the decision model? 3. In which manner can social developments in the Netherlands influence the choice for a construction methodology? 4. What are, as seen from the building practice’s point of view, the most important project related influence factors on the choice for the construction methodology, and how can these be integrated into a decision model? 5. In which manner can excess risks on construction costs and construction time be efficiently integrated into a cost and time estimation? Results 1. Since 2000, 27 high-rise residential buildings were built and in the coming years another 27 projects are being realized. The construction methodologies that are mostly used are ‘tunnelen’ (48%), ‘prefab’ (24%), ‘klimmen’ (10%), ‘staal’ (5%) and ‘traditioneel’ (2%). 2. Because of the their high degree of repetition, concurring building costs and relatively high building speed, ‘tunnelen’, ‘prefab’, and ‘klimmen’ are essential for integration into the decision model. 3. Working with social responsibility is something that is being done by more an more contractors in the Netherland, but as long as there will not be a financial incentive for this, it will not be a part of the decision model. 4. Influence factors: building time, building costs, contractors expertise, design, market, location and logistics. They can be integrated to select technically possible methods and carry out a design related optimization. 5. Carry out a quantitative risk analysis based on a risk database providing statistical data. Conclusions and recommendations The market for high-rise residential building is growing. A few construction methodologies are leading in use and should always be analyzed in a project analysis. Working with social responsibility is growing but not always integrated as policy. It deserves further research in which way this can be integrated into companies policies. Integrating a quantitative analysis of excess risks can add to choosing the most economic construction methodology. It deserves further research into how this integration can be obtained as well as research into the creation of a risk database.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Scarano, F. (mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (mentor)","2009","Nowadays there is a wide variety of applications for forced transition. They are all based on introducing disturbances to the flow and increasing its momentum thickness. Forced transition or bypass transition as it is also called is used to manipulate the flow by setting the transition point in such a way that the required/better flow situation is achieved. There is a variety of types of transition devices in use such as a simple wire, sandpaper, surface steps and zigzag tape. All of them have their own characteristics. In this report an investigation of the last two has been given. From practical experience it is known that the zigzag tape produces transition to turbulence with less height of the obstacle. This implies that the zigzag strip produces turbulence more efficiently than a two‐dimensional roughness. The difference in efficiency suggests that there may be differences in the mechanism creating turbulence behind these two kinds of devices. What happens in the transition phase of the flow over these obstacles has been investigated. For this investigation hot wire anemometry has been used to locate and quantify turbulence and particle image velocimetry to visualize structures in the flow. The results confirm the different behaviour (efficiency) of the two tripping device types. A clear difference is revealed in the flow comparing the zigzag strip to the two‐dimensional roughness element composed of a strip of rectangular cross‐section. The zigzag strip causes streamwise vortices which interact with the outer flow to create turbulence through mixing. This explains why it is more efficient. These vortices persist quite far downstream, hence the turbulent flow is only slowly moving to a uniform state. This means the flow is not completely uniform. The surface step creates a spanwise vortex which causes the mixing. This vortex doesn’t trail far behind the strip and thus creates a more homogeneous turbulent flow downstream of it.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Aerodynamics","",""

The intent of our analysis is to provide practical solutions for interference mitigation under different NBI models. In our work, a new receiver windowing for zero padding (ZP) OFDM system is proposed to reduce NBI spreading in the MB-OFDM UWB system.
