(mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Duinkerken, M.B. (mentor)","2011","CEVA Logistics in The Hague is a 3PL that performs logistics activities for its customers. These activities include transportation and different warehousing activities. CEVA's main customer is KPN. It shows that the capacity needed in order to perform the activities at CEVA is not scheduled properly. This is caused by fluctuating demand and late knowledge of the demand. KPN forwards the demand of their customers towards CEVA, however the demand is only known the evening before and during the day. The effect is that there is over- or under capacity, which causes that overtime is needed or extra temporary personnel is needed at the last moment. This will lead to low productivity and extra costs. To better schedule the required capacity a forecasting and planning tool was developed. The main research question is: Can costs be saved and the service level increased by using a forecasting and planning tool? Cooperation with KPN in the development process of this tool is important, because KPN knows when the demand gets influenced by sales promotions, introductions and back orders. The most labour-intensive process is the outbound handling, therefore it is important to schedule the capacity for these processes accurate. The objective of this project is to design a forecasting and planning tool with which the demand of the customers of KPN of the 6 outbound handling order processes can be forecasted and with which the required capacity can be scheduled more accurate at CEVA.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""

(mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Huijsmans, M.G.M. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis focuses on the transportation of coal from two coalmines in South Kalimantan to the Java sea. Coal has to be transported from the coal mine area, situated hundred kilometre land inward, to a location with sufficient water depth, at the mouth of the river Barito. The biggest challenge for the new transport system is to increase the throughput capacity five times in five years. Three different transport modes have been investigated in this thesis. Those are; transport by barges, conveyor belt transport and hydraulic transport. A comprehensive logistics study is performed with the use of a simulation model. The simulation model is written in Matlab and is a so-called event based model. The transport configuration which is lowest in transport costs, is determined with the results from the simulation model. A transport configuration is a combination of the number of barges, number of berths and the loading capacity of the berths. Hydraulic transportation of coal is an unconventional transport mode. Hydraulic transportation of coal is very similar with the transportation of sand in the dredging industry. The coarse coal is first mixed with water and then transported through a pipeline by means of a number of centrifugal pumps in series. The main differences between a coal-water slurry and a sand-water slurry are the density of the particles and the average particle size. The particle size of coal, when it is exported, is much larger than the average particle size of sand. Larger particle sizes will increase the turbulent behaviour of the slurry. Different formulas for a coal-water slurry are analysed. In the analysis is investigated which influence the particle density and particle size have on the friction head in a particular formula.","Coal; Transport; Hydraulic; Barge; Kalimantan; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Pelgrum, E. (mentor); Ciupuliga, A. (mentor)","2011","This master thesis aims at developing the methodology to form dynamic PTDF families, for the implementation into the market model. The main procedures to create a dynamic PTDF family are developed and presented with a study case (See Chapter 4). By fitting data from the market model into the data mining tools, typical scenarios of the time intervals are selected. Furthermore, by dividing subareas according to nodal PTDF values, the resulted estimation power flow is getting closer to the real flow, as depicted in section 4.4 for the study case. In addition, the outliers of the initial input data are located and more typical scenarios are selected from this outlier data group. The effectiveness of the dynamic PTDF family is demonstrated by comparing the estimated power flow using the dynamic PTDF matrices, a fixed PTDF matrix and the real power flow calculated in PSSE, given the same economic dispatch run by Powrsym4 simulation without PTDF logic. The results reveal that with the dynamic PTDF family adopted, the power flow estimation error is significantly reduced in comparison with using a fixed PTDF matrix. In the study case, the peak value of the estimation error is reduced by 67%. The average error of the estimated power flow reduced from 16.9% with one fixed PTDF matrix to 3.7% when we adopt the PTDF family. In the last part of the thesis, the implementation of dynamic PTDF matrix in the market model is simulated with a Matlab economic dispatch model for one hour. The influence of incorporating dynamic PTDF matrix into the UC-ED decision is investigated. The UC-ED results and PSSE power flows are compared for cases without PTDF logic, with simple PTDF logic (only one fixed PTDF matrix) and with dynamic PTDF matrix. At last, an implementation scheme of the dynamic PTDF family for the UC-ED decision making is proposed.","zonal market model; dynamic PTDF; data mining; k-medoids; silhouette","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Systems","",""

(mentor)","2011","In 2003, a first proposal for identification of seaward development, preliminary in combination with residential building, was presented in the Chamber of Deputies and within the States-Provincial (South-Holland), by respectively Geluk and Waterman. In response to this proposition, the ministry started an investigation, but concluded there was no support for seaward development financed through residential housing. Consequently, the initial proposal was adjusted. A feasibility analysis was made for seaward extension together with extensive possibilities for nature and recreation. A follow-up investigation (2005) indicated a large need for nature and recreation in the conurbation of Western Holland. In 2006, commission Tielrooij urged the necessity of a combined approach of the Delfland coast for sustainable long-term flood protection with expanding spatial qualities. The commission recommended a research into innovative civil methods for sustainable flood protection and expanding spatial qualities, among which mega-nourishment is recommended. In April 2008, an agreement is signed, by all concerning governmental stakeholders, for coastal expansion according to the principle “Building with Nature”. This agreement enables the start of a process to examine and investigate the execution of a so-called “Zandmotor” (hereafter sand-engine) at the Delfland coast. Begin 2009, the Environmental Impact Assessment “pilot project sand-engine” was published, in autumn 2009 the decision was finished regarding the financial costs for the Province and the Department of Waterways and Public Works. In March 2011, the execution of the sand-engine started near the Delfland coast. EIA, based on long-term morphodynamic prediction The Environmental Impact Assessment for the pilot project the sand-engine is based on long-term morphodynamic predictions, made with a single numerical software model called Delft3D. This model calculated the morphological development of the sand-engine for 20 years in advance, using average hydrodynamic conditions. After the EIA and during the construction of the sand-engine new problems and questions arose among stakeholders concerning e.g. groundwater flow, swimming safety, impact storm events, aeolian transports, etc. These uncertainties were not modeled and simulated, and are not included in the EIA. Idealized model approach Because there was a lack of an integrated design approach during the EIA phase of the sand-engine, this thesis includes an idealized design approach for mega-nourishments. Due to this idealized design approach multiple physical processes can be integrated using several numerical models for accurate long-term modeling of mega-nourishments. One integration, in this idealized design approach, concerns the impact of storm events within long-term morphological predictions. The integration of storm events within long-term morphodynamic predictions, is made possible within this thesis, by coupling two numerical software models, Delft3D and XBeach. Delft3D functions as base core, generating long-term morphodynamic predictions, and via XBeach, storm events are simulated at several points in time. Impact storm events on long-term morphodynamics For the assessment of the impact of storm events on the morphological development of the sand-engine, a reference scenario is made for comparison. The reference case predicts the morphological development of the sand-engine with average hydrodynamics for five years in advance. Compared to the reference case, storm events substantially increase the morphodynamic process of the sand-engine. Multiple milt annual storm events (1/1 year) have more impact than a single severe storm event (1/100 year). During severe storm events (1/100 year and 1/1000 year) the pronounced hooked shape of the sand-engine remains intact. However, during severe storm events, especially after some years, the spit of the sand-engine becomes sensitive for breaching.","zandmotor; model coupling; mega-nourishment; long-term morphodynamics; impact storm events","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

It is Philips strategy to enter the market now and claim consumers’ mind space to prepare consumer and channel for products to come in the future. The consumer is currently rather unaware of what LED lamps can do for them and since the products to launch are not at top level yet, consumer education is key in the market activation strategy to take. In this project a draft market activation strategy has been developed and tested during launch in Korea and China.

This has led to the definition of several energy ambitions. An example is related to green gas, with the ambition of green gas substituting 50% of the natural gas supply in 2050 in The Netherlands. At this moment in time, the most significant source of green gas in The Netherlands is biogas. This biogas is produced from biomass (e.g. cattle manure) by means of biological processes. Using an upgrading process step, biogas can be brought to the quality level of natural gas: green gas. However, these upgrading facilities are expensive, which results in it only being a viable option for those producers that handle significant volumes of biomass. Due to their relative low production volume, small-scale biogas producers cannot come to a solid business case for this upgrading of biogas. A biogas gathering infrastructure (biogas hub) seems to be a useful concept in approaching a cost-effective process. In this concept, several small-scale biogas producers are coupled using a stand-alone pipeline network which leads the gas of the different producers connect to one central upgrading facility. The upgrading costs are divided amongst all producers which increases the cost-effectiveness of the production process. Although several biogas infrastructures are initiated in The Netherlands, there is still no successful physical realization. However, this is not caused by a lack of enthusiasm amongst stakeholders; both private and public organizations have shown interest. Apparently there does not seem to be a successful environment in which it is able to realize a biogas infrastructure. This thesis explores the underlying causes of the impasse that arises here, by performing a system study based on the Multiple Perspective Approach of Mittrof and Linstone (1993). Recommendations are composed which could improve the situation for emerging biogas infrastructures in The Netherlands.","biogas infrastructures; system study; Multiple Perspective Approach; green gas; sustainability policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

The outcome of the business case has led to the construction of an entire sea defense and the realization of port areas in phases, in response to client demand. The phased development results in the creation of a temporary inner lake. The temporary use of this inner lake by port activities is hampered by the large investments generally required for port infrastructure. This research examines the possibility of allocating temporary activities to the temporary inner lake of Maasvlakte 2, using flexible port infrastructures. Potential activities are inventoried and ranked in a brainstorming session. Potential structures are investigated through a literature study. Activities are coupled with structures to create alternatives. These are allocated on the inner lake, depending on their functional requirements. The common barge terminal is the only activity that requires a quay type structure. The objective of this research is to examine the financial viability of an activity using a flexible structure. The common barge terminal concept is examined in detail. A common barge terminal is a neutral transshipment point that enables inland vessels to transship their containers at one inland quay instead of at several deep sea quays. Its results in a win, win, win situation: Inland vessels operators do not have to hop from one terminal to the next. They sail shorter distances and can reduce their turnaround time in the Port of Rotterdam. Container terminal operators have more time and space to handle sea going vessels. Sea going vessels are served by more cranes and can transship more containers per time per quay length. The additional quay capacity enables to postpone expansions. Port of Rotterdam Authority can postpone deep sea quay expansions. The latter is examined in detail. Port of Rotterdam Authority can postpone several deep sea quay expansions. There are three container terminal operators on Maasvlakte 2 that want to expand in several phases. Postponing deep sea quay expansions saves investment costs and leads to a loss in rent. The future value of costs and revenues are lower than the present value. A discount factor reduces future to present values. The net present cost savings cumulates the discounted cost savings and losses in rent of all postponed expansions. The net present cost savings for Port of Rotterdam Authority are larger than 15 M, if the: inland vessels that call with 50 TEU or less are handled at the common barge terminal, discount rate is at least 8.5%, percentage transshipped in call sizes <50 TEU is at least 4.2% of the total throughput and the increase in container throughput is at most 6%. Port of Rotterdam Authority not only saves cost with a common barge terminal, but also has to invest in a quay and receives rent from the common barge terminal operator. Several structures are compared by their whole lifecycle costs. Containerland consists of several containers sandwiched between two concrete slabs and has the lowest whole lifecycle costs. The service life of the inner lake is considerably shorter than the technical lifetime of the structures. Structures can be reused, sold or demolished. Reuse-possibilities have to be considered in case the discount rate is low (4.5 instead of 8.5%) or the service life is small (5 instead of 10 years).","balanced score card; business case; common barge terminal; flexible port infrastructure; lifecycle analysis; Maasvlakte 2; market research; portfolio analysis; systems engineering; temporary inner lake","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

My graduation project focuses on the question whether the combination of water vapour measurements and wind measurements can increase the quality of these water vapour maps. The increase in quality is expected as wind is moving the water vapour, also called advecting. Therefore in addition, 3D wind data obtained from HIRLAM is incorporated in the map making. HIRLAM is the abbreviation for High Resolution Limited Area Model for Numerical Weather Prediction, and this model is created by a European consortium of meteorological institutes. A modified Kriging interpolation approach is used to combine both current measurements and measurements from the past advected by the wind. By using a case study it is investigated whether the IWV prediction in between the GPS ground stations could be improved. For this case study, and using this method, we can conclude that on average the IWV maps are not improved by incorporating advected measurements. However, there are also locations for which the IWV predictions are improved.","water vapour; kriging; radiosonde; GPS; meteorology; wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Weltje, G.J. (mentor)","2011","Due to the closure of the Haringvliet in 1970 as part of the Delta works and the opening of the Beerdam in 1997, the course of the tidal flow in the Rhine-Meuse delta has changed. The tidal flow from and towards the Haringvliet is now completely taking place through the branches that connect the Haringvliet with the Nieuwe Maas and Nieuwe Waterweg. This causes these branches to erode by the increase of the tidal prism. The erosion problems occur in the central parts of the Rhine-Meuse delta, which, amongst other rivers, includes the rivers Spui, Oude Maas, Noord and Dordtsche Kil. The presence of sand, clay and peat layers in the branches causes the erosion mechanism to be rather complex. The alternation of sand and clay layers in the area causes the erosion to be non-uniformly distributed, resulting in deep local scour holes. The goal of this research is to determine an adequate maintenance strategy for the problem area. In order to do so the erosion processes are modelled in an existing Delft3D model. In this study, the morphodynamics in a depth averaged model, covering the Dordtsche Kil and a part of the Oude Maas, are calibrated in such a way that it quantitatively fits the existing long term erosion trend and that the qualitative processes of scour in the model simulations comply with the erosion occurring in reality. This is achieved by implementing multiple sediment layers simulating a bed topography where clay layers and local sand packages alternate. Subsequently modelling a variety of possible maintenance strategies has shown that several effective strategies are possible to deal with the erosion problems. Two strategies are suggested regarding the shortage of sediment in the system. The best way to deal with the local scour problems is to prevent further scouring of existing holes by fixation with riprap. Continuous nourishment in scour holes prevents the holes from scouring any further and moreover provides a solution for the long-term problem due to the fact that outflowing sediment diffuses and spreads out over the whole length of the river. A disadvantage of this strategy is the future obligation of continuous maintenance and monitoring for the whole Rhine-Meuse delta. The uncontrolled character of this strategy can also cause navigation nuisance. The other type of maintenance strategies considered is the reduction of erosive flow in the system. A situation where the Haringvliet gates are always opened, even during high tide, leads to a remarkable reduction in erosion. The scour holes still undergo erosion, but at a slower rate, and the erosion of the clay layer decreases to a negligible amount. A combination of fixing scour holes and opening the Haringvliet gates is also considered, which solves the problem for long-term erosion and the local scour, but comes at a high cost to implement. Besides in the Oude Maas, the erosion in the Spui branch is also alarmingly severe. In order to reduce erosion in this river branch, an option is to close it off. This causes the flow velocity in the Oude Maas to increase with approximately 10% and to reduce the flow velocity in the river Spui by half. It is strongly recommended to investigate the effects and possibilities of opening the Haringvliet sluices further. Further research should also be done with the extension of the Delft3D model to the Spui river, the downstream part of the Oude Maas and the Noord. Since the numerical model can become (even more) extensive with the implementations of 3 more domains, much more insight in the problems can be obtained with the interaction of the different eroding branches in a Delft3D model.","erosion; scour; Rhine-Meuse; Haringvliet; bed maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

How to add web-enhanced features to traditional TV viewing experience has been the focus of the competition in TV industry. As one of the major TV producers, Philips realizes that Smart TV calls for smart control experience, resulting in TV Fluid Control Project. Fluidity is proposed to be the durable wow experience for Philips new Smart TV remote control (RC) interaction. Touchpad-based interaction and pointer-based interaction are both promising for fluid control experience duo to their support for heads-up and lean-back viewing posture. In this project, the two interactions were compared from the perspectives of anticipated user experience (UX) and actual UX, concluding that touchpad-based interaction with uFlow user interface (UI) is more relaxing and moderate for diverse 10-foot TV consumption context. However, multiple swiping on touchpad is the main issue that degrades the fluid interaction. It is found that two-handed operation is better than one-handed operation for releasing natural and intuitive swipes. Swiping in horizontal is superior to that in vertical especially for thumb movement. The size of natural swipe revealed in this study is more than 1 cm larger than that of current touchpad on TV remote control. The criteria for touchpad-based RC were given based on user studies: remote control feeling, touchpad affordance, handholding, finger swiping, one/two-handed operation flexibility, tactile button-click interaction. The final result is the redesign of touchpad-based RC for fluid swiping UX with features as follows. A touchpad keyboard on back side for coherence of two-handed touching navigation and text entry A concave touchpad below the centre of RC on front side for comfortable and precise swipe An ergonomic shape for hand gripping to reduce the constraints of thumb movement","user experience; wow emotion; hand operation; pointing; touching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-21","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2011","Chard Safety is a Dutch company founded in 2005 and focusing on automotive crash safety systems. The most important ongoing project is the Deceleration Responsive Seat (DRS) concept, also called “The Albatross”. The concept is an unique automotive seat which provides safety and comfort aspects. Due to the innovative construction, there is potential to develop 3-point belted seats with significantly lower mass properties. However dynamic crash tests have shown potential safety provisions (e.g. no whiplash, better occupant restraint), the design of the seat is in an early phase and a lot needs to be developed more in detail. Next to design related issues, a strategic future plan is missing and there is no long term vision about what Chard Safety look like within 10 years. These issues activated the company to approach the Technical University in Delft for taking the next steps in product development and entrepreneurship. In this study, the potential of the Albatross concept was analyzed. The fundament for visioning concerned 1) an extended research in the automotive industry, 2) interviews with experts in the field and 3) qualitative observations of current markets and vehicles. The potential of Albatross was translated to a prioritized market choice, on which the company should focus. Strategic decisions were proposed in a business model canvas (Alexander Osterwalder & Yves Pigneur). These proposals directed the key elements to become a successful and valuable company in the near future. Next to strategic input, the Albatross design has been developed to a next level; “the Albatross 2.0”. In this phase, mechanical properties and improvements have been realized. Besides, the aesthetics of Albatross were studied and implemented in an exterior proposal. Finally, usability aspects were evaluated by use of graphical representations of the final design. Passenger (school) transport markets (commercial vehicles) have shown to be very potential since the concept provides multiple safety elements in a relative simple and light weight manner. Commercial vehicles are, often, poorly provided with the actual needed safety measures, mainly due to financial reasons. Governments on national and European level (EC) are major actors in the field, since these can activate the industry by legislative enforcement. Chard Safety will continue as a knowledge centered company in 1) the field of automotive crash safety and 2) development of Albatross systems. The new philosophy of “supporting passengers in a crash” make Chard Safety unique in its segment. Revenues will be generated in a licensing-out business model strategy. Financial risks can be relative low, whereas scaling and differentiation can be rapidly achieved. In long Chard Safety will be known as an important actor in the field of road safety on international level.","design; automotive; safety; weight; comfort; usability; seat; vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","IPD + SPD + Automotive","",""

(mentor)","2011","Residue curve maps are theoretically generated to assess the feasibility of a reactive distillation concept for the production of n-propyl propionate (ProPro). This product is a widely used solvent in industry and is synthesized by the heterogeneous catalyzed esterification reaction of 1-propanol (ProOH) and propionic acid (ProAc). The application of reactive distillation may result in higher yields, lower investment and operational costs and inherently safer processing. Thermodynamic and kinetic models are described for the quaternary reactive system, which agree well with experimental data from literature. The vapor-liquid equilibrium is modeled using the ‘Gamma-Phi’-formulation where the activity coefficients are calculated using UNIQUAC and the fugacity coefficients are estimated using the method of Hayden-O’Connell. A pseudo-homogeneous approach is used to describe the reaction kinetics and Arrhenius-type of expressions are obtained for the chemical equilibrium constant and the reaction rate constant. The methodology and mathematical models for the residue curve maps are described for three scenarios: (1) non-reactive, (2) chemical equilibrium and (3) kinetically controlled. These cases show that the topology of the residue curve maps depends on the rate of reaction with respect to the rate of evaporation rate, which is included in the Damköhler (Da) number. Based on the reactive residue curve maps, the reactive distillation concept for the production of ProPro tends to be technically feasible using one single column where an excess of alcohol is used in the feed. The resulting process is able to produce pure ProPro at the bottom and an azeotropic mixture of ProOH and water at the top of the column. The separation of the top products by an additional separation step makes that ProOH can be recycled and high conversion levels can be obtained","Residue curve map; reactive distillation; process intensification; n-propyl propionate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","IRS","",""

(mentor); Tan, Y.H. (mentor); Scholten, V. (mentor); Schonewille, J. (mentor)","2011","Companies do a lot of mergers and acquisitions as part of their corporate strategy. This has been a trend for some time now. Another important trend is that companies use increasing amounts of IT in their business to accomplish different things. The complexity of integrating IT systems during an M&A is something that is often forgotten when engaging in M&A activities. Research into this complexity has so far not yielded much evidence as to the exact role that IT plays within M&As. One of the difficulties for researchers is that measuring the outcome of M&As is not done consistently and is therefore hard to compare to other M&As. The goal of this research is to fill this gap. The main question is: What should a Business-IT merger performance measurement system look like? The system that was designed in response to the question consists of the following factors: transaction costs, information costs, business process consolidation, enterprise system consolidation, customer satisfaction, user satisfaction, business opportunities, and IT opportunities. The first two factors are the financial benefits, transaction costs are about the boundaries of the firm and a merger should yield a more efficient organization-al form this is measured by transaction costs. Information costs is the costs of retrieving information from IT systems, the more complex the systems the higher these costs. Therefore the information costs should rise initially because getting information from two different systems and combining them should be more difficult than after the integration when the systems have become one. The business processes and the accompanying enterprise systems are measured based on their consolidation. The level of integration and the ambitions for the new company drive these measures. A company cannot survive without customers and their satisfaction will be measured. On the IT side the users of the systems are the customers and their satisfaction will be measured. Together these last two factors are part of the service-profit chain. The final two factors are busi-ness and IT opportunities. These are aimed at the benefits of the merger that were not or cannot be specified beforehand. A survey was conducted to explore the validity of this system. The response was very low but given these respondents the factors were all deemed appropriate, except for IT opportunities. Further research into the validity, especially in case studies and other “real” situations is necessary. The proposed performance measurement system further specifies to measure the performance of each of these factors starting one year before the merger and for five years after the merger. Most factors are meas-ured using indexes that allow for comparison of different M&As both within one company and between com-panies.","merger & acquisition; enterprise integration; performance measurement; success; failure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Informatie en Communicatie Technologie","",""

(mentor)","2011","Process technologies are approaching physical limits making further reduction of device size and higher integration challenging. Three dimensional (3D) integration is emerging as an attractive solution to continue the pace of growth of System-on-Chips. Although vertical interconnection between the stacked dies has substantial benefits in terms of electrical performance, higher integration density aggravates the prevailing challenges of power density and consequently microelectronics cooling. This makes consideration of temperature constraints important while designing power management schemes. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) schemes in two-dimensional (2D) Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) do not consider thermal relation between various Processing Elements (PE) however this cannot be ignored in 3D stacks. In this thesis a new temperature constraint power management scheme for 3D MPSoC is proposed. Thermal relation between PEs is represented by the effective thermal resistance between them. These values along with PE’s operating temperature, utilization and positional information are used to generate weights for each PE and voltage island. These weights are then used for scaling and imposing temporary constraints on operating voltage and frequency (V/F) levels of PEs in the stack. While scaling brings temperatures of all PEs below critical limits, imposing constraints on the V/F levels avoids significant fluctuations in operating temperatures. When compared to 2D DVFS, an improvement of up to 19.55% in overall execution time is achieved, temperatures are maintained at a safe margin from critical limits and stability in operating temperatures was observed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Loeve, A.J. (mentor)","2011","In the past two decades, dental implants have been an essential component of the public health. However, lack of a reliable and safe dental surgery imaging modality remains a major problem. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an interferometic optical imaging modality that is somewhat similar to B-mode ultrasound but utilizes infrared light instead of sound waves. It can provide optical biopsy at a very high resolution and in real time. The compact fiber-optic components of OCT make it easy to integrate into dental drill bit to provide the dentists with real-time image feedback about the anatomical structure in the vicinity of the drill bit. This research focuses on the image processing for such a concept designing OCT integrated dental drilling system. Various image processing methods are applied to the OCT images with the intention of finding out the suitable solutions for speckle noise reduction, image reconstruction and dental tissues segmentation. OCT imaging system obtains the cross sectional structure of samples by measuring the back reflected light. The coherent detection makes the OCT images are always subject to speckle noise. The existence of speckle noise limits the interpretation of OCT images. In this study, various speckle reduction digital filters are applied to the images obtained from OCT during high speed rotation. Our results indicate that the adaptive Wiener filter is particularly suitable for our specific application. It is a time–saving method that not only significantly suppresses speckle noise but also preserves image edges. The study also concerns the image restoration due to the non-uniform rotational scanning. One modified method based on the cross correlation between successive A-scans is posted and studied. The assembled images indicate our algorithm is capable of reconstructing the manually-scanned images with an acceptable assemble accuracy. In tissue segmentation, the porous structure of the trabecular bones enables us to discriminate different them from cortical bones. However, due to the intensity decay along the depth direction, the way for image automatic segmentation is still a major problem need to be solved in future research. To test and verify our algorithms, the experiments are conducted to both real animal jawbones and silicone elastomer-based optical tissue phantoms. This proof-of-concept study shows that OCT is able to probe dental tissues in rotational scanning. The results from both samples are highly in accord with each other. This conclusion suggests that our optical phantom is a good jawbone substitute. The durable, easy-to-make phantoms can significantly reduce the cost of future researches.","dental implants; optical coherence tomography; speckle noise; digital filter; image quality analysis; image reconstruction; optical phantom; jawbone; tissues recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-09","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Warnier, M.E. (mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor); Meuffels, W.J.M. (mentor)","2011","The ORTEC Consulting Group (OCG) advises express service providers on efficient network design. A part of the challenge to this design is the hub location problem (HLP). The HLP consists of selecting optimal locations for large sorting centres (hubs) from a range of smaller sorting centres (depots) to which the rest of these depots can connect. The resulting network aims to transport parcels in the most cost effective manner achievable. The OCG is interested in multi-agent modelling technique as a new approach to the HLP, since this technique provides a natural way of modelling complexity that arises from interacting nodes. Literature showed no research on solving the HLP from a multi-agent systems (MAS) perspective. This thesis aims to fill this gap. With the main research goal being ""Designing a model that can solve the hub location problem for express networks with use of multi-agent modelling"", the model was designed using the Prometheus methodology. The model uses information on the volume distributions of a set of fixed depots to determine optimal hub locations from these depots. Simultaneously, the model ensures that parcels can be sent from any location and will be delivered within the set service time. Optimal hub locations in this sense means that the total network cost consisting of hub cost and transport cost is as low as possible. The inputs of the designed model are the depot locations, their volume distributions, the driving times between nodes, hub cost and transport cost. The outputs are the network cost, the number of hubs, the locations of these hubs and the routes of all the different parcels. The designed MAS consists of three main phases. Phase 1 is responsible for creating hubs based on volume distributions. Hubs are placed in regions that have a lot of parcels to be transported between them. Phase 2 creates routes via the hubs that resulted from Phase 1. Although the most efficient routes are calculated, the main focus of this phase is to create routes for every parcel in the first place. During Phase 3 the main focus is cost reduction through reducing air transport cost, reducing road transport cost and reducing hub cost. In addition, part of this design is implemented into a proof of concept using the JACK Agent Language (a Java based language) to show the added value of multi-agent modelling. This proof of concept, Preliminary Organisation of Hub Location Tool (POHST), contains the implementation of the first part of Phase 1. Hence, it creates hubs based on the volume distribution. A graphical user interface is added to turn POHST into an easily accessible tool. This tool is applied to two datasets to demonstrate its use in the preliminary phase of network research aiding in data gathering and the generation of initial hub configurations. Experts of the OCG confirmed the usefulness of POHST as strategic analysis tool. In addition, the type of model outputs did not allow for thorough integral testing of the tool, although other verification methods showed that the tool behaved as intended by the model design. Due to the lack of quantitative output, the tool could not be validated using traditional methods. Instead, the same experts were asked to validate the model. Although they had quite a few recommendations for further improvement of the tool, there was a consensus on its validity. The design process revealed interesting benefits and drawbacks of using the agent paradigm to solve the HLP. The source of much of the complexity of the HLP is the interaction between nodes. One of the major advantages of using the agent paradigm is that it provides a natural way of modelling such interactions. Furthermore, the scalability of agent models is an attractive feature. When a few types of agents have been designed, an unlimited amount of such agents can be used when applying the model, scaling along with the inserted data. Next, the research shows the benefit of agents adapting to local circumstances. By locally looking around for inefficiencies agents are capable to enhance the solution with limited data. Another advantage of using agents is the detailed level of statistics gathering it enables. Every agent decision can be tracked. Consequently, an agent model does not only produce an outcome, it can also show how and why this outcome evolved as it did. The major challenge of using agents to solve the HLP is the difficulty of making local decisions that might impact the entire infrastructure. To be absolutely sure that a local change will lead to lower network cost, all possible consequences are checked and valued for their change in cost. This process can lead to a vast amount of communication, because the agents are practically considering global data. Thus, undermining the multi-agent modelling values of local data views. Although this risk exists in the presented model, it does not prove that it is impossible to achieve a design that reaches a global optimum using strictly local information. However, it is the greatest challenge that the HLP poses to the use of multi-agent modelling. In conclusion, it can be said that this research has proved the potential of using MAS to solve the HLP.

The main goal of this project was to give recommendations for the packaging team to develop attractive and suitable packages for the brand X. Brand x is a face care brand, which has been in Chinese female skin care market for years, and the company was planning to launch its first-ever male face care category in China. However, in the aspect of packaging, little knowledge was available about men in China. All these factors resulted in the final assignment: What should brand X’s packaging strategy be to make men’s face care products successful in the Chinese market after launch? Specifically, the project can be divided into five stages. In stage 1 literatures about packaging development is reviewed to get a better understanding of the packaging development area; stage 2 resembles a thorough analysis including internal/external analysis, market analysis, and competitor analysis. In stage 3 the market positioning for brand x is determined in order to decide which values should be communicated by its men’s skin product; and in stage 4, consumer research is carried out to get insights from consumers and to give packaging design recommendations to brand x; stage 5 completes the concept design based on the recommendations received in the preceding phase. Consumer research is a key aspect of this project and the qualitative research method is in focus. One to one in-depth interview and focus group discussion have been carried out during the process for gathering insights from consumers, and final design recommendations have bee created based on this information. In the end, several packaging concepts have been designed by four industrial design students and myself. The design has been based on the recommendations in order to test whether the recommendations are clear enough for the product design phase at a later stage.","packaging; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor); Oomen, M. (mentor)","2011","This graduation assignment was assigned by Peeters Produkten BV, a firm that is known for its expertise in producing chocolate spreads of which ‘Duo Penotti’ is the most renowned. Though first steps have been taken, the firm’s approach to tackle sustainability issues is not yet on strategic level. Hence, the task was given to come up with a strategy to incorporate sustainable practices into the firm’s conduct of business. Consequently, the report can be described as the result of a study that investigates various aspects influencing the strategy and the manner in which Peeters Produkten BV should aim for corporate sustainability: Corporate sustainability refers to the business approach in which a corporation’s embedded sustainable practices are consistent with its organisational culture and corporate strategy. As Peeters Produkten BV is competing in the FMCG industry, the firm is dealing with fast shifting market developments and a range of stakeholders. These parties, like the Dutch government, the industry, NGOs and consumers all have their opinions and demands on how businesses should react on sustainability issues. So, in setting the strategy for corporate sustainability these views must be taken into account next to the CEO’s motivations and ambitions and the firm’s capabilities. A strategy is always about making choices; firms are not responsible for all of the world’s problems, nor have the capabilities to solve them all. Thus, Peeters Produkten BV should prioritise and identify few opportunities within its value chain that are most likely to contribute to a better environment (planet) and society (people) and bring value to the firm itself by efficiently using the resources available. For Peeters Produkten BV the core activities are the following: 1. creating a sustainable culture and code of conduct 2. procurement of sustainable ingredients by setting supplier policies 3. sustainable logistics as the firm is facing both in- and outbound logistics, regarding the firm’s largest impact on the environment 4. buying in renewable energy as it is a very feasible solution to contribute in reduction of the firm’s impact caused by its large electricity use Of course, the firm should always report on and monitor its progress on its approach to alter, improve and increase the amount of sustainable activities. Finally, a case study was conducted on one the firm’s products: Duo Penotti Dippi. Due to the product’s poor performance consumer research must first be conducted. Research’ results must then be guiding in the decision on what to do with Dippi; divestiture, incremental- or redical innovation. Nevertheless, in any resulting decision the firms’ strategy for sustainability must be taken into account.","corporate sustainability; sustainable development; SME; strategy; value chain; chocolate spread; FMCG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This study attempts to standardize thermal spread by 1) listing the relevant medical, technical, and statistical parameters, 2) selecting a soft tissue substitute to reduce biological influences, and 3) testing the protocol by determining the thermal spread of the Lotus grasper. Thermal spread was measured in a meat replacement product (quorn) by means of eight thermocouples. Spread of heat was determined as the distance between the instrument shaft and the 7:5_C isotherm. It was measured at 5 mm depth in the left (3:09 _ 0:637 mm), and right flank (2:70 _ 0:966 mm). In addition, two more depth levels were measured in the left flank, 2:5 mm (2:11_ 0:732 mm), and 7:5 mm (2:95_0:959 mm). The thermal distribution of the Lotus obtained by this measuring technique was comprehensible and educative. The use of thermocouples seemed adequate, as spread could be measured in the deep direction, and sufficiently precise. The selected test material (quorn) was sub- optimal from a mechanical viewpoint. This may have led to experimental uncertainties and an increased measurement variance.","ultrasonic; snare cutting; laparoscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

Intel Seattle Research proposed an indoor mapping algorithm making use of such a camera. The algorithm itself is vulnerable to violations of the static environment assumption and image based localization failures that can be caused by, for example, featureless environments. The goal of this master thesis is to augment the indoor mapping algorithm with additional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to enhance the robustness to these vulnerabilities. To this end the characteristics and limitations of the Microsoft Kinect are investigated and an enhanced mapping algorithm is proposed. IMU orientation estimates are fused with pose estimates based on image data, which give an initial guess to the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that is used to align point cloud data to create a final map. In case visual localization fails, the algorithm of Intel uses a constant velocity assumption as fallback mechanism while the IMU data provide more accurate orientation estimations than the constant velocity assumption can provide. The IMU-enhanced algorithm shows similar mapping quality in ideal mapping conditions compared to the plain mapping algorithm. While a series of corner case tests show that the IMU-enhanced algorithm was unable to improve the results compared with the plain mapping algorithm, it potentially generates improvements in mapping quality when dealing with non-static environments.","RGBD camera; IMU; Indoor Mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software Group","","Embedded Systems","",""

It becomes a challenge for engineers to manually convert an algorithm in an HDL, considering the pushing time-to-market constraints. High Level Synthesis tools are developed to make this process less laborious. HLS tools use the original source code and transforms this to a hardware description. The quality of the original source code is of great in?uence for the resulting hardware. In many data intensive applications, memory accesses form a bottleneck. To improve the performance of the hardware implementation, the execution behavoir of these accesses must ?rst be optimized in the software source code. While doing this, an analyzer providing crucial information about the algorithm itself helps reduce engineering time. This thesis work presents a framework which is capable of providing information about memory accesses and operations executed within an algorithm. The reports containing this information can be generated on a per function or per loop basis. This enables the engineer to ?nd loop speci?c information, which can be used to optimize the algorithm and to provide crucial pipeline information to the HLS tool. An Optical Flow algorithm is used as case study to demonstrate the functionality of the framework. A massive speedup of a factor of 13.7 was achieved while the area increased only with a factor of 1.47.

(mentor)","2011","Nowadays, the ecological effects of dredge plumes are usually managed based on the precautionary principle. Predictions of suspended sediment levels are made, which have to be compared to thresholds set by the responsible authority. Failing to comply may cause a project to be delayed and thus lead to additional costs. The precautionary principle however is vague and incorrect, since it does not take into account the benefits of the dredging activity. The proper question to ask is whether the dredging activity should be allowed to harm the ecosystem or the ecosystem should be allowed to harm the dredging activity. To be able to answer this question, ecological risk is required to be assessed in a quantitative manner. A suitable framework to do so is provided by the Ecological Risk Assessment (era), which enables a risk agent to include uncertainties explicitly. An era consists of a description of the system and its components, hazard identification, effects assessment, exposure assessment, risk characterization and an evaluation which provides feedback for a possibly updated system description. The effects assessment relates suspended sediment concentration and exposure duration to the response of a sensitive receiver. A graphical representation of this relationship is a dose-response curve, which represents the resistance of the species, or 'strength'. Field measurements or laboratory experiments are necessary to enable the development of dose-response curves for important sensitive receivers. The exposure assessment starts with the formulation of the dredge plume source term. The complex dynamic phase of the plume is not modelled, but is incorporated in the source term by means of established empirical relations. The passive phase is modelled by a hydrodynamic and transport model, which results in a time series of suspended sediment concentration levels at the location of the sensitive receiver. This is translated into a concentration and an exposure duration, which can be interpreted as the 'load'. When effects and exposure have been estimated, the risk has to be characterized. There are several ways to do this, which depend on the treatment of uncertainty. A probabilistic approach incorporates variability in exposure and effects estimates and a deterministic approach estimates one representative value for exposure and compares this with one representative dose-response relationship. A probabilistic approach enables the determination of a 'failure probability'. This provides confidence levels for the obtained results and points to gaps in knowledge. In general, insight in probabilities is assumed to enable a better risk assessment. When these methods are applied in practice, it depends on the situation at hand which technique is most suitable to estimate risk. In the design and planning phase of dredging works a probabilistic analysis is the preferred option, to identify possible new areas of investigation or research or to support the development of a monitoring strategy. It is however computationally expensive to carry out a Monte Carlo analysis to assess long-term exposure. On the other hand, when dredging works are already in progress, a deterministic analysis satisfies the desire for a quick assessment of the risks. Execution methods can in that stage still be changed and mitigating measures might still be implemented. In conclusion, for a quantitative assessment of ecological risk it is necessary to carry out a probabilistic analysis. Costs and benefits of a dredging project can then be determined, which enables a complete economic analysis and a transparent decision making process.","dredge plume; ecology; risk assessment; probabilistic; species response curve","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management","",""

(mentor); Köhler, A.M. (mentor); Van Os, J.P.J. (mentor)","2011","This graduation project has been executed in cooperation with Philips Research and Holst Centre, within the Platform for Large Area Conformable Electronics by InTegration (PLACE-it) project. The scope of the project is to identify required developments for OLED textile, to fulfill the needs of future users and minimise the environmental impact. Suitable applications for OLED textile within the health and wellness area are defined and multiple concepts are developed. The new insights gained by the development of the chosen applications can be used to develop a vision for the integration of OLEDs with textile. OLED textile analysis: To our knowledge the first experiments worldwide, in combining OLEDs with textile, were made during this project. OLED textile mock-ups and comparisons with similar technologies were used to define the specific qualities of OLED textile. The most important aspect of OLEDs is the emission of homogeneous light. Therefore OLED textile does not require an extra layer for light diffusion or heat dissipation and can be thin and worn close to the body. The homogeneous light of OLEDs also can provide comfortable lighting for applications with light directed at the retina. Furthermore OLEDs, like LEDs, have the advantage of the diversity in possible emitted wavelengths. Defined opportunities for OLED textile are long term usage, large body coverage, the ease to adapt to surroundings, portability, easy integration in normal life and comfortable lighting directed at the retina. Concept selection: Five application areas are found for lighting within health and wellness: Improve working conditions, communication tool, light therapy retina, light therapy skin and measuring tool. They are scaled down to three concepts based on requirements concerning making use of the qualities of OLED textile, the quality to inspire future developments and the potential for further sustainability research. The chosen concepts are the wearable light therapy device, acne face treatment and a neonatal jaundice garment. The wearable light therapy concept is a retina light therapy device used during activities. To cure facial acne at home, the acne face treatment concept can be used. The neonatal jaundice device is a blue light emitting baby blanket or garment used in hospitals to treat jaundice. Embodiment design - user need: The neonatal jaundice application is developed more in depth since it is thought to have the most potential on short term. The main advantages are the comfortability and a continuous treatment, also during kangaroo care and breast feeding. Concepts were developed based on the input from specialists and two prototypes were made: a prototype which simulates the user comfort by using OLED dummies (figure 1) and one simulating OLEDs by LEDs. The user need for neonatal jaundice treatment is partly fulfilled by this demonstrator; it is a comforting cure for newborns with less severe jaundice. However, homogeneous lighting on the total surface of close to body applications seems not possible due to breathability and heat regulation factors. This results in a lighting area which is too small to treat severe jaundice. To establish the vision of the future user need, unobtrusive garments for monitoring and light treatment, OLEDs should have textile qualities itself. Embodiment design - minimise environmental impact: The guidelines to minimise the environmental impact of OLED textile applications are prioritised as follows: energy efficiency, minimise environmental value of virgin product, prolong product and OLED usage, recycle and incinerate. Energy efficiency of OLED textile applications could be improved by optimising the wavelength range, OLED efficiency and decreasing the absorption by the textile. More accurate information regarding environmental impact and lifetime of the OLED is required, to determine the preferred cleaning method and durability of other product components. For now it is expected that hospital applications, like the jaundice blanket, preferably are machine washed and the electronic layer of consumer applications should be wiped separately. Another difference between the two target groups is the infrastructure of disposal, repair and recycling. The lifetime of hospital textile is completely controllable, consumers on the other hand should be persuaded to extend product lifetime and dispose it at end of life for recycling. The first objective for recycling is not polluting the ordinary waste streams. Next material and component reuse can take place within a complex infrastructure. If OLEDs would be developed that could replace textile, this system can be simplified considerably. In that case the future vision, closed loop – no waste, might come true. Conclusion: Currently the user need generally requires OLED textile integration, which conflicts with separable OLED and textile to minimise environmental impact. A balance can be found between both wishes, but never will be ideal. An OLED structure which is completely made of polymers and can replace textile would be the optimum.","OLED; Organic Light Emitting Diode; photonic textile; OLED textile; jaundice; acne; light therapy; health; wellness; e-textile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mesbah, A. (mentor)","2011","The traditional way of developing websites as hypertexts, which can be navigated link by link, is progressively giving way to the AJAX approach, in which the entire hypertext can be contained in a single web page. The resulting page has the advantage of offering navigation by loading only specific parts of the page - only the changing content. Conventional web crawlers, applications which explore web pages in a systematic way, are not able to browse AJAX pages. In order to overcome this barrier, which prevents the execution of automated tasks such as web indexing or mechanized tests, the Software Engineering Group at TU Delft has developed Crawljax, a tool capable of crawling AJAX pages. Crawljax already offers many possibilities. It provides default settings for simple page testing, but it can also be included in a Java project and be programmed to execute more complicated testing, or specific crawling in certain directions of the page. For example, Crawljax can include or exclude some buttons, check boxes, text areas and other elements of the page to help focus on a certain area to test. Through its various plugins it can benchmark websites, find invariants to use in regression tests, export a graphical representation of the states tree graph, and more. All of these possibilities are however restricted to Java programmers, willing to learn how to use a new tool to expand their limited crawling power. What Crawljax does not yet offer is a simple way, even for non-programmers, to create and execute specific test cases. Here we present an extension on Crawljax, a way to simplify the process of running crawling sessions and integrity tests on webpages. We call this system CrawlMan, the Crawljax Manager. CrawlMan uses components of Crawljax and his plugins and libraries, connected to a Graphical User Interface, in order to provide automated, repeatable crawling and testing. The application allows a basic user to start crawling a web page by simply inserting the selected URL, then shows a graphical representation of the result and uses it to guide the user in the refinement of the settings. The user can then crawl the same URL with more specific settings, inspect the new result and use the new suggestions to refine the settings, again and again. The obtained cycle, where the test results are used to improve the test itself, is the main project contribution. We evaluate our approach by means of analyzing the behavior of selected novice users during the execution of predefined tests.","web testing; crawler; Crawljax; web application; AJAX; CrawlMan; automated testing; exploratory testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

EEG signals from the sensorimotor cortex and EMG data from the reflexive carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis muscles were recorded from five healthy subjects while performing visual-motor force tasks, with and without perturbation on the wrist. Different continuous perturbation signals with different frequency content (multisines), as well as perturbation resulting in rapid angular displacements of the wrist were applied to study the existence of synchronization on corticomuscular communication, as well as the possible trancortical contribution to the late reflexes on the muscle. Corticomuscular, perturbation- EEG and perturbation - EMG coherences were calculated for all tasks. Three out of five subjects did show high coherence results in beta band when applying multisine perturbation and decreased in base task and in tasks with rapid angular displacements of the wrist, implying an Ia afferent contribution from muscle spindles to beta EEG. The connection of the perturbation to the brain and the muscles is considered non-linear due to high corticomuscular coherence found in harmonics of the excited frequencies. Current source density was applied on frequencies with high corticomuscular coherence. Contralateral supplementary motor cortex is more likely to cause corticomuscular communication at high frequencies of the beta band. Moreover, proprioceptive-evoked potentials were calculated from tasks with continuous rapid angular displacements of the wrist.

To avoid derelict stadiums after one-off events such as the World Cup or Olympic Games, a solution is found in the application of a demountable stadium that can be relocated once a year. The goal of the research is to present a preliminary structural design of a demountable and transportable (football) stadium based on the flying shell concept of Zwarts & Jansma Architects. Based on ideal lines of sight and a limited viewing distance to the centre of the field a distinctive stadium results with an undulating upper edge. The applicability of shell action to create an efficient structural system to the stadium is researched with the help of the method of graphic statics. The 2D results of this study are placed in a 3D context to examine the usefulness to the stadium. Based on these results, four configurations are examined with the help of a computer model to check hypotheses and to gain further insight to allow the design of a final model. A final model is chosen on the basis of behaviour under loading, functionality, ease of assembly and appearance. This final model is tested on ultimate limit situations and serviceability limit state situations. Dynamic behaviour happened to be a critical issue that needed further research. Adjustments to the final model are made to improve the dynamic behaviour of the stadium. In addition to structural behaviour, research is done on the assembly, demountability and transportability of the stadium. Transportation limitations cause the stadium to consist of many small elements that are designed to create maximum uniformity. The order of assembly is based on direct stability, together with shell and ring action providing stiffness during assembly. This is achieved by erecting the stadium layer by layer. The structural system is based on the principle of shell action. Within this principle, double curvature is a very important criterion to ensure structural stiffness. Results of the models that are investigated showed a lack of structural stiffness resulting in a low natural frequency of the total structure. This has major consequences regarding the grandstand structure, as the load spectrum of dynamic crowd loads lies within the response frequency of the grandstand. Either natural frequencies should be increased, or severe measures should be taken regarding the increase of damping capacity, monitoring oscillations in the stadium or design for a dynamic amplification, to rectify this. In order to increase the natural frequency of the stadium the stiffness needs to be increased. The most efficient way to do so with regards to shell action is to increase (double) curvature. Tangential curvature is based on ‘C’ values and preferably should not be altered. Radial curvature is almost absent and needs to be increased. In the situation where natural frequency will not be increased, damping capacity should be increased dramatically by means of the application of dampers at connections or integrated into preassembled elements.

The deterioration depends on many factors, including workmanship, and therefore it is difficult to predict the exact deteriorating in time. By inspections it is possible to measure the deterioration and create a model with statistics and curve-fitting. Because of the high consequences C of failure of hydraulic structures, it is important to keep the probability of failure PF low. This follows from the definition of risk: Risk = PF?C Here is PF not the true probability of failure, because this is unknown, but it represents our perception about the probability of failure. The probability of failure consists of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties about the resistance of and the load on the construction. The epistemic uncertainties can be reduced by inspections, so we will be more certain about the reliability, without changing the structure physically. A low probability of failure for existing structures can be realized by inspections and maintenance. With the inspection results one can determine the condition of the structure and the necessity for maintenance. But what determines the necessity for inspection? This is an interesting question when the inspections are destructive or very costly. When it comes to relatively cheap inspections, this will also play an important role, if they have to be executed a great number of times. Especially if a lot of unnecessary inspections are executed. With the pre-posterior Bayesian analysis one can determine value of certain types and numbers of inspections beforehand. By weighing the value of inspection against the inspection costs, it is possible to develop an optimal inspection strategy. The method above is applied to the reinforcement bars in a concrete plate of a bridge. The effective diameter of the reinforcement bar is uncertain due to the presence of corrosion. Therefore the strength of the reinforcement bar is uncertain. With the present conditions the risk can be to such a degree, that it is cost efficient to inspect and/or maintain the bridge. The effective diameter can be determined by a destructive and expensive method, of which a number of n can be executed. The total costs exist of the inspections costs and the expected maintenance costs belonging to a number of n inspections. The optimal number of inspections n follows from the minimization of the total costs. Because the inspection results are unknown beforehand, these results are treated as random variables, according to prior knowledge (the deterioration model). Then the cost optimal decision is chosen belonging to a number of inspections n . This is possible because we know that the diameter of the reinforcement bar is uncertain, and that this uncertainty can be reduced by inspections.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2011","Mimetic discretization methods are emerging techniques designed to preserve, as much as possible, properties of the continuous differential equation. In this framework the geometric nature of physics plays a crucial role. Thus, it is necessary to use a new language to model physical problems, Differential Geometry. The calculus of differential forms reveals intrinsic structures that usually, are obscured by metric notions implicitly encoded in vector calculus. In the language of differential forms the unified treatment of scalar and non-scalar advection is simplified by the use of one operator: the Lie Derivative. Much attention has been devoted to the discretization of scalar advection problems in numerical analysis. Therefore, it would be expected that non-scalar advection is not common or relevant. This is not true. The so-called magnetic advection in electromagnetism or the advection of vorticity in fluid mechanics are examples of important non-scalar fields. Furthermore, it is widely known that the classical Galerkin formulation when applied to scalar convection may lead to spurious (non-physical) oscillations. The goal of this thesis is to derive a physically accurate discretization of the generalized advection problem. Thus, very small or even vanishing artificial diffusion should reflect the robustness of these methods. Also in this thesis, geometric structure-preserving semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian discrete schemes are derived.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Predicting and characterizing damping in joints and connections is a bottleneck in many design processes. New analysis techniques can be used to advance the engineering practice. These techniques would for example be useful to make a better estimation of the coupled dynamics of an engine-generator set (gen-set) on a ship. Large ships are commonly equipped with a gen-set to provide power to the vessels and to the electrical consumers on board. In some cases the engine vibration levels are too high to satisfy vibration guideline limits. In order to get insight in the system dynamics and to propose useful structural modifications an accurate system description of the total system is needed. In the Msc. project, research has been done on the identification of the dynamic behaviour of joints. Joints can significantly influence the dynamics of the entire system. The identification will be done by using Dynamic Substructuring (DS) techniques. The joint will be modelled and treated as a subsystem and the properties will be iteratively obtained. An often encountered problem in practice is the absence of crucial response measurements on the interface due to tight packaging of the system. A method is proposed to describe the unmeasured interface Degrees of Freedom (DoF), which are needed for compatibility of motions on the interface, in terms of measured DoF. Measurements are done on a base-upright test structure which is tested in different support conditions. It is shown that DS techniques can be used to identify properties of joints. The proposed method for describing unmeasured DoF has been validated with simulated experiments. Further investigation is needed to use this method with measured data.","dynamic substructuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","The Baboto ore body is situated along the same geological structure as the Yalea and the Loulo3 ore bodies. It is located approximately 10km north east of the ROMPAD, 1km north of the village of Baboto. It stretches 5km to the north, a part of the Baboto North ore body lies in the Kofi permit. Relative little sampling has been done; core drilling every 25m, so all reserves are inferred. A block model has been made using ordinary kriging. This estimates the reserves at 11.9Mt with an average grade of 2.06 g/tonne. The ore body will be split up into two categories, all ore with a grade higher than 2.5 g/t shall be classified as high grade ore and all ore with a lower grade than 2.5 g/t shall be classified as low grade ore. The high grade ore will be processed at the processing plant. For the low grade ore the option of processing via a heap leaching process is being investigated. Metallurgical bottle roll tests have shown a possible plant recovery for the high grade ore of 89 to 94%. Heap leaching recovery is being estimated around 80%. Pit optimization using Gemcom’s Whittle software with a gold price of $1,200 per tonne produces 3 pits which would produce 5.74Mt of ore, or 462,166 ounces of gold content that will be processed. 301,164 ounces gold content is qualified as high grade ore, 161,002 ounces are from low grade ores. The main objective in mining is to have a continuous feed of the plant of 50,000 tonnes per month. This can best be done by first mining Baboto Center, than Baboto North after which Baboto South is the final area to be mined. This will result in a total mine life of 3.7 years. The total mining costs are assumed to be approximately $2.85 per tonne. The high grade ore will be transported to the plant by the same trucks as currently used for Gounkoto and 3 trucks shall be needed. The route from the Baboto ROM to the crusher at the ROMPAD will be approximately 12.5km, of which approximately 9km will be newly constructed. The low grade material from Gara and Yalea currently stockpiled next to the ROMPAD including the scats, are probably useful material for heap leaching. This is 1.57Mt at an average grade of 1.67 g/t. So the first 2.6 years the trucks will bring this material along on their way back to Baboto. This would only require a detour of 583m and 10 minutes of loading and dumping extra. The total transport costs for the high grade ore from Baboto to the crusher and the stockpile material form the ROMPAD to Baboto will be approximately $4.68 per tonne, including capital depreciation. The scats, just as the Baboto oxide ores, will not have to be crushed and can be used for heap leaching right away, the other non-oxide ores will have to be crushed. The leaching time for the ore on the heaps will be 60 days, after which it will be extracted via activated carbon and transported as high gold content liquid to the processing plant. Here it will undergo the same process as the comparable fluids at the plant. The estimated costs for heap leaching are $12.56 per tonne for the scats and $14.06 per tonne for all other ores. Whereas the processing costs for the high grade ore in the plant is $21.66 per tonne. 3 months will be needed for the entire infrastructure for the project to be constructed. With the G&A costs set at $5.98 per tonne of ore the total costs for all Baboto operations including the heap leaching of the ROMPAD stockpiles the costs will be $297.1M. This will produce 467,650 ounces of gold, which would give at a gold price of $1,200 per ounce a revenue of $561.2M. With an annual discount rate of 0% this would result in a NPV of $264.0M and an IRR at annual rate of 476%.","gold; Randgold Resources; scoping study; Baboto","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Resource Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","For Wacom, a tablet manufacturing company, an application for children between 8 and 12 years of age was designed to be used with their consumer line, the Bamboo Tablet, and their software platform, Bamboo Dock. Upon exploring the target group on the topic of drawing, it was found that children between 8 and 12 typically lose interest in drawing. Based on a literature study, it was found that the cause of this phenomenon is a desire to achieve realism in drawing that is never achieved. The goal of the project became maintaining the motivation in drawing by enabling children to learn to draw more realistically. Using existing theories, the terms ‘drawing realistically’, ‘learning’ and ‘motivation’ were operationalized. By comparing the explained drawing procedures of the most successful books on learning to draw with the drawing procedure of 5 children, the drawing problems were found to be originating from 5 common mistakes: not using reference images, failing to see the image as a collection of shapes, not paying attention to line details, neglecting proportions, and not seeing the shades. Using a context mapping activity with 6 children, the reason behind the drop of motivation was found to be the sense of a mistake in the drawing without the knowledge to fix it. To find a means to teach the children to learn to draw, literature on learning was consulted. At the intersection between learning and motivation, a common activity among children was found: video games. Using the combined guidelines of motivation, learning and gaming, an application was designed, to teach the desired drawing practice while pointing out that the common mistakes do not work. The application would provide a series of activities, consisting of supported drawing assignments that gradually increase in difficulty and complexity. With seven children, the target group’s pen accuracy, drawing topic preferences and the usability of the design were researched and specified. For the usability test, a prototype was created to simulate one drawing assignment. Based on the test results, the design was further developed, and a research setup for the verification of effectiveness of the application was proposed.","Tablet; Context mapping; Children; Drawing; Application; Game; Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Therefore, thermal recovery methods are commonly used in heavy oil production. Most thermal methods involve fluid injection to transfer heat further into the reservoir. Hot water-flooding is among these methods. In hot water-flooding, thermal energy will increase oil mobility, and possibly provide a more efficient sweep. This research investigates the effect of heat on water-flood recovery. An approximate analytical model has been constructed to describe fluid flow and heat transfer, simultaneously. Furthermore, several core flooding experiments have been conducted. These experiments involve regular (isothermal water-flooding at room temperature), and non-isothermal (hot) water-flooding. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans have been also taken during the experiments to detect the movement of the water phase and the stability of the displacement front. It has been observed from the experiments, that increasing the injection temperature delays water breakthrough, and increases recovery factor of the water-flood. Moreover, due to the decrease in oil viscosity, the pressure drop along the core also decreases with increasing temperature. On the other hand, the movement of the water phase cannot be detected accurately from CT images.","Hot water-flooding; Heavy oil recovery; Buckley-Leverett; Core flooding experiments; CT-Scan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Section Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kornmann, C.M. (mentor); Pothoven, A. (mentor)","2011","Over a third of all traffic relative fatalities and injuries all over the world are pedestrians and with ongoing developments the numbers are expected to rise even further. After years of research and testing in the field of crash safety and combined with legislative stimulation the automotive industry has made significant improvements in minimizing the risk for serious injuries during a crash. Because occupants nowadays have a good chance to survive in a crash the attention within vehicle safety testing has turned towards the relatively new subject of pedestrian protection. This has become part of the testing protocol of the influential consumer organisation Euro-NCAP. Pedestrian safety represents 20% of the total score, which is one star. Testing in this context means firing leg-, hip-and head-impactors on specified locations of the vehicle front-end. The silhouette of a vehicle determines where the impactors will be fired. The thereby registered impact values make up the total score on the subject. The overall score on pedestrian safety of a large majority of the tested vehicles is very poor. Especially small vehicles have difficulty, because of limited packaging space and exposed hard-points. The smart car is unique in its own segment for over more than decade. With its spacious 2-seater interior, very compact exterior dimensions and mono volume design the vehicle represents a different state of mind towards personal mobility. It was designed to provide maximal protection to the occupants in the event of a crash and therefore has a hard safety cell structure. Unfortunately the steep front-end bonnet-less design and exposed hard components do not favour pedestrian safety and therefore the current smart car scores rather poor in the Euro-NCAP pedestrian protection test. Mainly the windscreen area, in which a lot of points are to be scored due to head-impact testing, the smart scores poorly. The challenge lies in designing an optimal energy-absorbing front-end, where especially the pedestrian’s head impact is important, while still providing maximum occupant protection. A new approach was investigated in order to meet future regulations and explore the limits of the vehicle’s exterior design. The solutions where solely sought in passive safety measurements in order to fit the micro-car budget. This project proposes a concept vehicle with optimal pedestrian safety testing performance, named the smart 45X. By performing literature research, consulting multiple experts and by analysing the entire front-end of the smart vehicle, with all its relative components, an integral design process was used. The entire front-end, up to the upper cross member, is within the testing area and therefore structural changes are needed. These have will have an effect on the exterior design of the vehicle. The proposed solutions have been gathered under the name 3PS, which stands for Passive Pedestrian Protection Systems. The front-end of the smart 45X has been divided up into three zones that represent the impact areas of the pedestrian. The ideas that where generated in the ideation phase have been translated into three concept vehicles that present solutions for pedestrian protection in every zone. The most promising results displayed in the concepts are brought together in final design proposal. Solutions have been found that will create serious changes to the structure basic of the smart vehicle and literarily open new views. Other components that are hard-points within the front-end, like the wiper system, front lights and parts underneath the service hatch have also 3PS incorporated into them. Next to that the integration of functions has also created new possibilities. All 3PS solutions are brought together in a concept vehicle design 45X. The final result has been visualized on paper next to a 1:1 mock-up model in which the newly found solutions roughly take shape.","pedestrian; smart; safety; automotive; front-end design; Euro-NCAP; Daimler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-12-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Automotive","",""

(mentor)","2011","The main challenge of naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) is understanding how fractures behave in the subsurface outside the radius of influence of wells. Fractured outcrop analogues provide geological concepts that can be used to extrapolate fracture data outside the well control. Numerous methods for studying fractured outcrops are available but they all have different disadvantages. We propose a new methodology using Digifract 1.0 software that allows for quick digitization of fractures resulting in a statistically significant quantitative dataset. This approach is used in a carbonate quarry in France to digitize height, dip and azimuth of nearly 1800 non-stratabound fractures on vertical outcrop walls, taking into account assumptions and pitfalls that are often overlooked. The 2D height and spatial distributions of two non-stratabound fracture sets identified in the quarry follow power-law distributions. Applying the 2D distributions in FracMan stochastic fracture simulation software results in 3D DFNs that honour the properties of the 2D distributions. The 3D DFNs form percolating clusters of fractures but for the assumed subsurface conditions the fracture networks would not percolate. The maximum fracture size and the dispersion in the orientation distribution have the largest effect on the percolation threshold. Fracture spacing in 3D is very similar to fracture spacing in 2D. There is a significant sampling error in fracture spacing measurements along scanlines that are not perpendicular to the average fracture dip. The most commonly used correction, Terzaghi, corrects for this as long as the angle between the fracture dip and the scanline is larger than 30 degrees. For smaller angles no uniform correction method has been found.","fractures; NFR; naturally fractured reservoirs; DFN; discrete; fracture; networks; 3D modelling; schochastic; power-law; non-stratabound; corridor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Applied Geology","",""

(mentor); Albayrak, A. (mentor); Anderiesen, H. (mentor)","2011","Nowadays, when someone is diagnosed with a traumatic unstable spinal fracture, the spine is fixated by surgery and the patient is prescribed to wear a corset brace for 8 to 12 weeks. The two most used corset braces are the lumbar and the thoracic corset brace. These corset braces are highly uncomfortable and prevents the patient from almost every movement. The task of the corset brace, however, is to limit certain movements of the back, but not to prevent every movement. Therefore a new solution will be designed within the scope of this project. The goal of this project is to design a comfortable and wearable device that monitors the spinal movement of the patient and provides direct feedback when pre-set boundaries are crossed. In this case the new device will warn the patient when a possible harmful movement is made. It will also transfer the data to the medical staff so they could adjust the rehabilitation program to the gained insights of the patient’s behavior. The doctor could also reset the boundaries from a distance. Pontes medical and the Academic Medical Center of Utrecht will facilitate the medical background of the project, 2M Engineering will be responsible for the sensors and other hardware and Evalan B.V will collect, reduce, interpret and transfer the collected data. An important part of the exploratory report is the research on the user and the context; this was done by the method of contextmapping. One of the main issues that can be concluded from the user research is the insecurity. Patients and their relatives are insecure about how much they are allowed to do with and without the corset brace. Also, several adjustments of the patient’s life have to be made when they return home. By taking all insights gained by the research into account, finally a vision on the interaction between the user and the future product could be formed. ‘I want people to be more comfortable, mobile and independent while they rehabilitate from a spinal fracture.’ The vision was the starting position for the development of the product. In order to develop several different aspects of the product, many researches were performed. The development started with principle solutions in structured in morphological charts, which lead to ideas and concepts. With the help of a Harris Profile, one of these concepts has been chosen and further developed. The product consists of four parts; a shirt, two sensor modules, a wristband and a docking station. The focus of this graduation is mainly on the development of the wristband and the shirt with the sensor modules. The two main functions of the product are telemonitoring and feedback. This feedback will be provided in two ways; direct and historic. The direct feedback is provided real-time and visualized on the display of the wristband and by a vibration signal in the lower sensor module. The historic feedback can be consulted online by both the patient and his physicians at any time. The product has three main unique selling points:  Lower costs Lower initial costs Less polyclinic visits Fewer adjustments by casting technician More opportunity for hospital to submit new patients  Fewer complications Less thrombosis No friction with the skin High level of comfort  Shorter rehabilitation time Boundaries can be reset on a distance according to the patient’s individual needs Supports correct training Less complications Higher level of independency of the patient","design; healthcare; spine; fractures; trauma; orthopeadics; rehabilitation; telemonitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design, Medisign","",""

To address this situation, it is necessary to determine the influence of changing properties of oil on the BDV of said oil in switchgear. The goal of the research is to reduce the risk of breakdown of oil in OIS. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the BDV of insulating oil and quantifies the influence of related factors on the BDV of oil. Stedin can apply this knowledge in order to reduce the risk of failures related to the breakdown of insulating oil.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-20","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","High-Voltage Technology and Management","","","",""

(mentor); Ranasinghe, R. (mentor); Luijendijk, A.P. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor)","2011","Submerged breakwaters (SBWs) are becoming increasingly popular as alternative coastal defence system due to the lack of impact on beach amenity and aesthetics compared to common emerged beach protection measures. However, the recent significant amount of failing SBWs resulting in additional shoreline erosion reported in [Ranasinghe and Turner 2006], indicates the importance of understanding the driving processes of salient development before routinely adopting SBWs in practice. The main objective of this thesis is to gain more insight into single shore-parallel detached SBW induced hydrodynamic processes driving morphological changes. In order to study SBW induced hydrodynamic conditions resulting in morphological response, a depth-averaged Delft3D model is used. By online coupling of Delft3D-FLOW and SWAN, the wave-current interaction is accounted. To exclude site-specific conditions, an idealized approach is used, including an alongshore uniform beach profile and shore normal short wave forcing. For this idealized situation, a sensitivity analysis of numerical parameters is performed, as well as a validation on individual SBW induced processes based on published literature. By examining the cross- and alongshore momentum balance for a variety of results from numerical simulations only changing alongshore length and offshore distance of the SBW, dominant SBW induced alongshore differences in water level and resulting currents are explained in detail. In addition, SBW design parameters are studied using the same momentum balances. Besides offshore distance, alongshore length of the SBW and directionality of the incoming waves, these include the crest width, crest height, incoming wave height and breakwater roughness. To confirm the findings from the hydrodynamic analysis as the important driving processes of SBW induced morphological changes, additional morphological simulations are included and morphological SBW induced response is compared to initial hydrodynamic conditions. As a result, a computationally efficient depth-averaged Delft3D model is obtained, which is capable of simulating SBW induced processes accurately compared to published literature. From the idealized simulations, more insight is given in two distinct SBW induced processes driving morphological response. These processes reducing nearshore water level set-up are the spatial distribution of wave forcing (commonly referred as wave sheltering effect) and the momentum balance between wave forcing and bottom stresses over the SBW. In addition to the parameters presented in [Ranasinghe et al. 2010], the breakwater roughness and directional spreading of waves are important parameters to take into account when constructing SBWs. Morphological simulations confirm the relation between the hydrodynamic processes described and the morphological response to SBWs. The ability of Delft3D to simulate morphological response to SBWs, enables a powerful numerical tool for future studies on SBW induced (morphological) processes.","submerged breakwaters; artificial reefs; numerical modeling; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

For carrying out such a research, experiments were performed in the low speed facilities of Delft University of Technology. Four wind tunnels and several data acquisition techniques have been used in order to investigate the physical actuation mechanism that a NS-DBD plasma actuator is able to achieve. Leading Edge Flow Separation Control has been demonstrated at a Reynolds number up to 3.3 millions, and with a Mach number about 0.3. Set-ups of tests like Schlieren or PIV and results of such tests have been shown and discussed in this report. For industrial application the issue of applicability rose up. A scalability study has shown the capability of the NS-DBD Plasma Actuator of working on different scales. From a phenomenological study several actuation principles have been derived. Moreover, from the large data set that was obtained possible physical mechanisms that underlay the NS-DBD plasma actuation have been proposed. The most remarkable results achieved are: maximum lift coefficient increased about 20% with respect to its theoretical maximum, stall angle delayed about 5 degrees, drag due to the wake reduced about 300% in a leading edge flow separated condition. Eventually possible outlook and future research aimed to get the plasma actuator at an “industrial” stage is proposed. This experimental study has been carried out as a joined project between Delft University of Technology and NEQLab Research BV. The first one supported the project with knowledge and facilities, the second one with technology, equipments and manpower.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This degradation has both natural- and men-made causes. Brazil has no specific laws and acts which relate to coastal protection and management up to this date. Beaches in the metropolitan area of Recife show variety in beach width according to the seasons. However the local factors play such a significant role in this, that it is not possible to establish a direct link between the seasons and beach width. Since the beginning of the 20th century, men has built structures all along this coast without proper guidelines. Wrong implementation of the structures has ,most probable, made matters worse. Another aspect is that men built structures (1970) on the backshore creating less back buffer which resulted in relative erosion. This paper entails the study of the coast of metropolitan Recife which is 45 km long. The goal of this study is to assess the area: to create solutions for their problems. The paper consist of two parts, part A and part B. Part A consists of a study of the entire coast of metropolitan Recife. Part B focuses on Boa Viagem, an area of 2.78 km within the metropolitan area of Recife. In order to assess the entire area more suffiecient, the area has been split up into 7 parts, from north to south: Janga, Casa Caiada, Bairro Novo, Fortim, Boa Viagem, Piedade and Candeias. All these areas have been studied in order to find the cause of erosion, and possible solution. This has been done by preliminary assessment, where the current structures are observed; a problem assessment, this study emphasizes each area’s problem and probable causes; and finally a solution assessment where possible solutions are represented. The total area of the coast of metropolitan Recife consists of men-made hard structures such as groynes, breakwaters and revetment. But has also natural breakwaters such as reefs. The presence of the latter makes study of this coast highly complex. The area has one major and one minor source of sediment. The major is the sediment that is transported in the littoral drift. The minor source is sediment being discharged by the rivers in the area. The sediment is fine to medium size sand. The current level of “protection” is highly ineffective and has made matters worse in many cases such as Casa Caiada. The level of protection can be classified as poor. Initially, the area was thought be a flood risk, however, closer inspection has revealed that coastal flooding is a non-issue in the metropolitan area of Recife. The amount of erosion cannot be limited but only displaced if hard measures are deployed. If sediment is trapped in one area, another area will be adversely affected. The only solution to sediment deficiency is introducing additional sediment in the area. Part B focusses on Boa Viagem, an area of 2.78 km long with probably the most economic value. The coast of Boa Viagem has healthy beaches but also shows signs of erosion. The area consist mostly of reefs, but also has revetments and a harbor. Different solutions for Boa Viagem have been presented, via a Multi Criteria Analysis one has concluded that a solution of only nourishment will be applied. The nourishment will be dredged by a hopper, 10 km off the coast. The hopper transports the sand with the aid of a pumping system through a 2.5 km piping system to the beach. The nourishment will be spread by a bulldozer and a scraper. In order to maintain the beach, re-nourishment will be done every 5 years. The total amount of initial nourishment is 1.2 million m³ sand. And for re-nourishment 0.5 million m³ sand has been calculated. The whole operation cost R$ 143 mln (  60 mln ) during a period of 50 years, this includes: initial nourishment, re-nourishments and interest etc.","Brazil; coastal protection; Recife; beach nourishment","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Legacy Information Systems are considered the backbone of the organizations business since these systems are robust and carry valuable information which is of significant business value to the company. However, due to the increasing demand of business and organizational agility these systems need to be modernized retaining their existing assets. The concept of a Service Oriented Architecture provides organizations the ability to reuse their existing assets and contributes to a higher level of organizational agility. Therefore, the possibility to modernize these systems with their existing assets toward a Service Oriented Architecture becomes very interesting for organizations coping with LIS’s. However, migrating toward a SOA can be a very risky and complex undertaking. Few migration projects up until now have been completed successfully. Therefore, it is very interesting to perform research in this area. This research focuses on the critical success factors that contribute to successful LIS to SOA migration. The main adopted research method in this study has been qualitative research and evaluation based on a multi case studies at 4 large organizations. Through extensive literature examination, a framework of critical success factors for the migration of legacy systems onto a SOA has been developed. The framework has been evaluated using the case studies as input. In this research, we concluded the success factors found in our case studies through cross case analysis and factor analysis. In total 42 critical success factors were identified, of which 19 were most critical based on evaluation of these factors at 4 large globally known organizations where migration projects were carried out.","Legacy Information System; SOA; Migration to SOA; Critical success factors SOA; Successful SOA Migration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-01-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor)","2011","Objective Due the coastal protection program along the Dutch coast, the groins that first defended the coast against erosion, are now covered under sediment. Due to erosion the covered groins will resurface however. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the resurfacing groins on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport. Modeling A schematized model is made to reduce effects due to a complex bathymetry and to get a clear view of the occurring processes. Three profiles are schematized at a suitable location based on the 1990, 2009 and 2010 Jarkus transects. Also a test case is modeled with a constant slope to get a view on the effect that groins have on several hydrodynamic properties and transports. The effects due to the bathymetry and the groin can now be separated. Results From this follows that the groins do not affect the alongshore current velocity significantly when the groins are relatively small, in the order of 50 meters or less. The offshore directed currents are considered more dangerous and are present and increasing with increasing groin length, although they are also small when groins are relatively small. When the groin length increases to 150 meters, both the longshore and the offshore currents become significantly larger. In the test case the increase in alongshore velocity is around 15% compared to small or no groins. The increase in current velocity depends largely on the bathymetry and the position of bars however. The sediment transports decrease quite constantly with increasing groin length when the foreshore has a constant slope, in case of a profile with bars the decrease of transport may not be constant anymore. In the schematized cases the sand transport in 1990 with groins of 140 meter is in the order of 50% smaller than in the 2010 situation without groins. Scour holes can increase the offshore directed transports and velocities, but further research is needed here.","groin; Delfland; re-surfacing; hydrodynamics; sediment transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor)","2011","This report describes the results of a graduation project to design an ice skate featuring a dynamic bend in the blade in the lateral direction. To start an analysis was carried out in order to gain an understanding of the problems experienced with currently used ice skates in long track speed skating. It turned out that while conventional ice skates feature a permanent bend in the blade to assist the skaters in steering in the corners of the track and provide more grip, on the straights this bend leads to a problem with the left foot. Having established an understanding of this problem and related aspects the process to design a model featuring a dynamic bend in the blade was started. This quickly resulted in a functional principle that would be used during the rest of the project. In order to control the degree of the bend and prevent it from becoming to large leading to a skate that would be unusable, a number of ways to do this was thought up. Each of these was modelled in a 3D CAD design software package and submitted to loading simulations to discover their influence on the bend. After having found out which idea worked best, a physical model was created which would be used in tests on the ice. The tests showed that the model indeed performed the intended function but also identified new problems. It turned out that for the left foot, the bend in both lateral directions should be tuned individually to optimize the behavior of the skate for both the straights and the corners. Adaptations to the test model were made to enable these newly discovered functions. Although the new tuning function could not be tested on the ice due to the small, fragile parts used in the tuning method, a quick ‘lab-test’ did show that it was possible to achieve individual tuning of both sides. The tuning method was worked out further and materialized in a final design proposal for the dynamic ice skate concept.","ice-skate; design; dynamic bend","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Part of the success of the British can be explained by their constant thrive to innovate in equipment and training methods. Professionalization of the Dutch Sailing sport is needed to become one of the top sailing countries of the world. One important step in this professionalization process is innovation of sports equipment and training methods. Project goal The main goal of this graduation assignment was to develop a coaching system that contributes to the professionalization of the Dutch sailing sport. A coaching system should be developed which enables sailing coaches to receive, monitor, and process real-time performance data from sailing athletes. Project process A coaching system was developed by using a user centred design approach. The project is structured according to five main phases originated from the Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) format: 1) Analysis, 2) Ideation, 3) Conceptualization, 4) Embodiment, and 5) Validation. 1) The analysis phase focused on studying the current training context to identify all important user needs. This phase was concluded with a design vision. 2) The ideation phase was used to develop product idea sketches based on three identified important coaching system aspects. This phase was concluded with a clear product direction for the conceptualization phase. 3) In the conceptualization phase the product direction was translated into three product concepts, which were evaluated using a Harris profile. This phase was concluded with a final concept proposal. 4) The embodiment phase focused on elaboration of the final concept. This phase was concluded with a final design which was used to fabricate a functional prototype. 5) The validation phase focused on validating the final design on the predefined criteria. In addition, recommendations for the implementation of the product were described. Deliverables The result of this project is a portable coaching system, which contributes to the professionalization of the Dutch sailing sport. The identified user needs from the primary target group, the professional sailing coaches, are implemented in the design of the coaching system. The concept was proved by validating the design in a user test on three identified criteria: 1) Enhance the perception of the coaches 2) Allowing communication of detailed video feedback 3) Product is portable and easy to install In addition, recommendations for further development are presented.","sailing; user-centred design; interface design; tablet; RIB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Peperkamp, W.J.M. (mentor)","2011","Parking problems in cities become more significant every day. Parking tariffs are going through the roof and parking spaces are limited. Therefore, cities are researching alternatives for parking on ground level and underground. One of these alternatives is parking underwater. One of these cities is Amsterdam. This city ranks number 5 on the list of most expensive cities to park in Europe. To create more parking spaces, the city of Amsterdam is researching the possibility of parking garages underwater at several locations. One of these locations is the Oosterdok near the central train station. A feasibility in 2009 study showed that a parking garage underwater with 350 parking spaces and constructed with the traditional construction method is not financially feasible. [Oosterdok, 2009] This situation is used to determine whether or not a new construction method could be the solution, namely the floating construction method. With this construction method, the structure is constructed directly on the water. The base consist out of a floor of EPS and concrete. This floor floats and makes it possible to construct the rest of the structure on top. This process is shown in the figure below. The advantage is the fact that an expensive temporary construction pit isn’t needed, which normally forms 20 to 30% of the total construction costs! The floating floor consist of the patented Flexbase system and is shown in the figure below. It starts with constructing a 800mm thick EPS floor consisting of 4 layers of glass fibre reinforced EPS250. Directly on top of this EPS floor the concrete floor is poured. When this floor is hardened the formwork, consisting of EPS60 blocks, for the beam grid is placed. When the beam grid is poured and hardened, the second and last floor is constructed to end up with a floating sandwich structure. The parking garage is constructed directly on top of the Flexbase floor. The parking garage has two floors and 750 parking spaces. It is 129 meters long, 76 meters wide and 6,5 meters high. This does not include the 2,05 meter thick Flexbase floor. When the garage is finished, it still floats and has a draught of 6,05 meters. When the garage element is completed, it is immersed. Ballast tanks are placed inside the element and filled with water. When the element is at the desired depth and level, grout anchors are drilled through the floor to keep the element immersed. The ballast tanks are emptied and the garage element is coupled to the entrances for cars and pedestrians. The entrances are constructed separately. Conclusions The floating construction method is technically and financially feasible for this situation. The floating construction method is approximately 11,5% cheaper than the traditional construction method. When the benefits come exclusively from parking fees, the floating construction method becomes financially feasible for this situation with hourly parking tariffs of 2,16. This research shows that the floating construction method could be a better and cheaper alternative for traditional construction methods.","Floating Structure; Floating; Construction method; Flexbase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-12-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","After the catastrophic flooding of New Orleans due to hurricane Katrina in the year 2005, the city’s hurricane protection system has been improved to provide protection against storms with at least a 100 year return period. This thesis investigates the risk to life in the post-Katrina situation for the New Orleans metro bowl. The risk to life is evaluated through a ‘scenario’ based approach simulating defined flood events. Several scenarios are identified that could lead to flooding within the Metro Bowl and including the failure of hurricane protection or the river levees. The probability for each scenario is determined based on existing design guidelines and expert judgment. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to simulate flood characteristics and these outcomes are used as input for the loss of life estimate. In addition, the evacuation effectiveness has been considered. Results indicate that the estimated loss of life in case of flooding ranges from about 100 to nearly 500. The highest life loss value is found for breaching of the river levees. The probability and consequence estimates are combined to evaluate the individual risk and societal risk for New Orleans. The individual risk (IR) refers the probability of an individual residing in a given area perishing as a consequence of flooding. The IR for large parts of New Orleans metro is larger than 1/100,000 per year. The evaluated risk is compared to risk levels that have been found to the risks of other large scale engineering systems (e.g. other flood prone areas in the US and other regions, dams and the nuclear sector) as well as existing criteria for evaluating acceptable levels of individual and societal risk. The evaluated risk determined in this study exceeds tolerable or acceptable risk criterion as discussed in literature and other industries. Despite the major improvements to the flood protection system, the societal flood risk of New Orleans is still expected to be significant at a national (US) scale. Finally, the effect of various risk reduction measures on the risk level is investigated. Strategies for which costs and risk reduction effects are discussed, including: elevated homes, improved evacuation and increased protection ( relocation of population to higher areas). While decisions regarding flood risk are complex and involve many factors such as perception and economic considerations, the results indicate the necessity of further discussion regarding the management and reduction of the city’s risk to flooding.","Flood Risk; Risk to life; New Orleans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Freudenthal, A. (mentor); Pelger, R.C.M. (mentor)","2011","This graduation thesis describes the development of a system for the diagnosis and treatment of Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions, such as urinary incontinence, bowel problems, pain, pelvic prolapse and/or sexual dysfunction. The assignment was initiated by MAXAM Medical, a start-up company consisting of Fiebke Op de Macks (author of this thesis) and ir. Jeroen Voorham. Suffering from Pelvic Floor Dysfunction can be very disabling and has an enormous impact on the patient’s Quality of Life. Currently over 180M people in Western countries suffer from a Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. A possible treatment method for these dysfunctions is Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy. MAXAM Medical is developing a system for diagnosis and treatment of Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions, which will assist Pelvic Floor Physiotherapists. As a result of this graduation thesis, this system will aid the process in an accurate and effective manner, providing innovative and qualitative health care. To develop a system that closely meets end-users’ needs and requirements, a Human Centered Design approach was used. Feedback from future end-users was actively used in the analysis, design and simulation phases of the project. During an analysis of currently used diagnosis and treatment equipment, the functions of Pelvic Floor Physiotherapists, their habits and problems became clear, providing valuable design input. This input was used for the system development, during the design phase of this project. As part of an iterative process the design was thoroughly tested with the help of future end-users, which resulted in a system that meets the express needs of the market. In the past decade, it has become apparent that usability alone does not provide people with everything they want when it comes to (new) products. People want products and services that add value to their daily lives. As products mature, they not only become more useful and usable tools, but they also require other qualities to be (commercially) more distinctive and satisfying. An entirely new user experience was created in this graduation thesis to meet these requirements. To be able to develop this new user experience, the Service, Technology, Organization and Finance (STOF) method was used. It is a design method that is developed especially for the creation of successful services and offers a step-by-step approach towards creating a balanced and secure business model. To conclude the thesis, a market analysis was performed of Europe and North-America, identifying the most interesting market entry countries. A strategic plan that MAXAM Medical should devise in order to achieve a successful market entry is proposed, together with recommendations for continuing innovation, development and testing of new functions to keep the system user’s experience and output at a high level.","pelvic floor dysfunction; medical device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Leeuwenburgh, O. (mentor); Van Bergen, F. (mentor)","2011","The upstream oil and gas industry focuses increasingly on unconventional gas resources to maintain the level of its hydrocarbon reserves. To unlock the full potential of gas shale reservoirs, horizontal wells are drilled and active stimulation of the reservoirs, in the form of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is performed. This new technique has radically changed the energy future of the United States and is on the forefront of changing it in Europe as well. The hydraulic fracturing treatment is a costly, resource intensive and potentially environmentally dangerous procedure. The objective of this thesis is to create a realistic and versatile gas shale reservoir model and optimize the placement and number of hydraulic fracture stages along a horizontal well bore, thereby maximizing the production of gas while minimizing the amount of money that is spent to do so. On the basis of the computationally efficient ensemble based optimization of vertical well placement, an idea coined and investigated by Leeuwenburgh et al. (2010), it is postulated that numerical optimization can aid in finding the optimal placement of hydraulic fracture stages along a horizontal well bore in an equally computationally efficient manner. Three gradient-based optimization algorithms (Ensemble based Optimization: EnOpt (Chen, 2008), Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation: SPSA (Spall, 1998) and finite difference gradient estimation) that work with continuous variables, are used to approximate the gradient. Because hydraulic fracture stage locations in a reservoir simulator are commonly treated as discrete variables (well grid block indices), standard implementations of gradient-based optimization are not applicable for optimal hydraulic fracture stage placement. We propose three distinct variable parameterizing placement methods to overcome the inherent continuous to discrete variables conversion issues. After the theoretical arguments about the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed optimization routines, both single well and multiple well scenario experiments are performed. Good results are obtained from the various experiments which favor an optimization with the EnOpt algorithm in combination with the fracture stage interval placement method.","optimization; hydraulic fracturing; multi-stage; hydraulic fracture; ensemble based optimization; horizontal well; well placement; stimulation; gas shale reservoir; shale gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor); Hen, C. (mentor)","2011","In an increasingly competitive climate, it has become more and more important for airports to look at ways to improve the passenger experience. This is especially applicable for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, since it has the explicit ambition to become Europe’s preferred airport for passengers. In line with this reasoning, this study looked at how a seamless travel experience can be created for passengers by applying meaningful ‘Information and Interaction’ (I&I) from now until 2020. Information and interaction is all about relevance. Understanding the specific situation of a passenger is crucial to delivering meaningful information. The findings of the internal research indicate that (too) many information sources are at hand for the passenger. The large amount of information can create confusion and often does not reach the passenger. The passenger interaction can be improved as well, by creating dialogues instead of the current static communication streams, e.g. information displays, wayfinding. Different methods have been used to research the context of this graduation assignment. The literature study suggests to take a customer-centric focus, using a holistic ‘Customer Journey’ approach. Therefore, a passenger journey cycle was mapped out, identifying a series of touchpoints with the potential for improvement. By improving the flow through these touchpoints, an optimal experience can be established. This journey approach was applied for two customer segments; the generation Einstein and senior travelers. The generation Einstein passenger is a young passenger, being confident and traveling independently. A senior traveler is older, often asks for more support and searches for reassurance and comfort. The development of personalized and pro-active information services answers the needs of these passenger segments and will improve their travel experience in terms of journey transparency, comfort, freedom and flexibility. The findings of the external analysis indicate that the clever use of technology, such as applying navigation or augmented reality, offers many opportunities for future I&I. Location-based services and tracking-and-tracing of personal behavior and belongings will alleviate current I&I issues. As for mobile technology, there is no question that it increasingly transforms the travel experience. A mobile phone becoming standard accessory, passengers use it for receiving instant information and to connect to their social network. Anticipating this, future I&I will need to be offered real-time, always and everywhere available and, ideally, controlled by the crowd. The insights from the analysis have been used to formulate the following design vision on future seamless traveling: ""The always-connected traveler will expect and demand information and services that simplify the planning, booking and overall airport experience. The physical and digital noise will be kept as low as possible, reducing the amount of impulses and enabling for the I&I to personally address the passenger. Passengers have an evolving set of requirements and expectations from the I&I, asking for the highest possible quality standards. Together with the instant delivery of meaningful solutions, this will build a seamless passenger experience."" The design vision is used as starting point for the idea generation phase, which resulted in a set of 43 idea cards. On the basis of these idea cards, a concept principle is developed, explaining the underlying theoretical framework. At the center is the development of an integrated content management system, the so-called ‘Information Hub’. The idea is that this hub will serve as a gathering point for all potentially interesting information. From there, information will be filtered according personal preferences and distributed to the passenger according to each channel’s specifications. Co-makers, such as Schiphol Group, airlines, passengers and the NS, could be involved to jointly build the hub as an open source platform. The I&I coming from the Information Hub will reach the passenger either via personal devices or via facilities and services offered at AAS. One of the advantages of the information hub is that it offers opportunities to personalize I&I based on many variables, such as a passenger’s travel history, characteristics or even future travel plans. The hub can deliver information based on the passenger’s location, personal preferences and provides I&I that is relevant for the passenger’s particular context. Therefore it is important that the I&I will be delivered real-time and is kept up-to-date. Furthermore it includes room for social interaction and provides DIY-components. The idea is to create I&I that will be understandable for each passenger, always and everywhere accessible. 15 action points have been suggested for Schiphol Group to implement on various levels of the concept (see graduation report). Moreover, two scenarios are developed, introducing a series of possible touchpoints with generation Einstein and senior passengers. The concept has been evaluated with passengers and company experts. With 58 of the 62 design criteria being achieved, the concept evaluation confirms that this concept improves the current I&I, and indeed builds towards a more seamless travel experience for the generation Einstein and senior travelers. At the same time it fits the Schiphol Group company structure. Based on this evaluation, it is recommended to continue this project by assessing the feasibility on multiple levels, i.e. performing pilot tests and business cases. This will further clarify the feasibility of the concept and can assess the success rate. Additional recommendations, a conclusion and project reflection conclude this study.","Customer Experience Management; Information and Interaction Design; Schiphol; Generation Einstein; Seniors; Passenger Journey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

An algorithm using Ant Colony Logic was developed for designing the access and longer sections of infrastructure. A third algorithm using hill climbing optimisation was developed for generating an optimised ore hauling system. For this thesis, the developed algorithms were used for generating an optimised design for the Kibali project underground sublevel stope mine. This design is then compared to the design by Randgold. It can be seen that the mining locations in both designs match. Because the optimisation algorithm takes the stope shapes into account a higher percentage of dilution is found.","Stope; Mine; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Resource Engineering","","","",""

There are no dedicated tools available for validation, for finding both falsely detected and falsely rejected points, or for deeper analysis of PSI results. Existing algorithms for automatic coherent scatterer selection need a lot of acquisitions to obtain reliable results, which makes it necessary to collect data for many months or years before processing can be done. In this study a suite of tools is developed that facilitate detailed analysis of results and versatile processing of radar data. This suite consists of a visual inspection tool, and a toolbox that handles metadata and can do versatile processing of radar data.

Giry, Dufour and Mazars (2011) have recently proposed an approach, based on an integral nonlocal damage model, which solves the problem of incorrect initiation and propagation of damage as discussed by Simone et al. (2004). In this contribution, a similar approach is presented in a differential damage model, the gradient-enhanced damage model. The underlying idea, which is used to modify the governing equations, is explained. A new formulation of the finite element equations is derived, with attention to C0-continuity requirements. Representative examples will illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

(mentor)","2011","Roomplug was founded to make renting simple. It provides all the tools needed to go from having an empty property to getting the lease agreement signed. Roomplug also wants to solve the problems on rent payment. That is what this project is all about: creating an online rent payment system. Since Roomplug is a startup company, it is expected that the requirements will change as the business model and needs of Roomplug change over time. The Feature Driven Development (FDD) methodology was chosen to create a development track suitable for this changing set of requirements. In the FDD track, the features are split up and grouped in milestones. Every next milestone can be changed to support the (new) needs of Roomplug. Before work on the first milestone starts, a global high-level design is created to make sure that all milestones work towards the same goal. The design details of each milestone are then created as soon as work on that milestone starts. This prevents unnecessary design work on features that will never be implemented. Implementation starts after the milestones design is ready. The Roomplug back-end system, and thus the payment system, is written in PHP using Zend Framework and its MVC pattern. It uses a MySQL database to store all the data. Testing the code after the implementation of a milestone is a big part of the project. Many test classes are written to ensure the correct functioning of the payment system. PHPUnit generates extensive coverage reports after each test run. All this is very use full to ensure that code from earlier milestones still works after making changes and additions to implement the next milestone. The finished prototype of the payment system lets users create single custom payments and set up recurring payments using PayPal as a payment method. Although an account is needed to receive payments, paying your rent can also be done as a guest without an account. The system is designed in such a way that other payment systems could easily be added in the future. The payment system is currently running live on the Roomplug beta site. It is ready to be used by the rental market.","PayPal; Rentals; Zend; PHPUnit; Agile; Feature Driven Development","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Koehler, A.R. (mentor)","2011","The Dutch company Royal Philips Electronics N.V. has developed a smart textile that is able to emit light. Philips named this specific type of electronic textile a photonic textile. With the use of LED’s (Light Emitting Diodes) the textile can feedback light to a user or environment. The implementation of this technology, up to this moment, is to be found in the healthcare sector where it can be used as an unobtrusive method to treat i.e. neonatal jaundice on newborn babies. Philips wants to expand the market for photonic textiles to the office environment. To enable this the FlexLight is created. The FlexLight is a product that enhances the work efficiency of the flexible workspace by reducing background noise, adding colour temperatures to the work environment that can stimulate certain moods, and creating a more personalized working environment. The product is placed on the side of the desk to keep the contact between colleagues optimized while creating a private working environment. Light and sound absorption are the result of the use of an intricate combination of different textile surfaces. The FlexLight is controlled by three icons that are projected onto the surface the product is standing. This way the fabric layers will not have to be touched in order to operate the product, which will prolong the lifetime of the fabric. The feature that makes the FlexLight destined to be a flex-office product is its ability to communicate with mobile phones through the NFC standard. When a users phone gets close to a FlexLight, the NFC connection will load the users personal settings onto the FlexLight closest to him. In order to make the FlexLight a sustainable product the FlexLight is made from parts that can all, other than the electronic parts, be re-used or recycled. This given itself does not make the FlexLight a sustainable product because if sold through a conventional business model , there is no possibility to ensure the product will really be recycled. The FlexLight will therefore be sold as a product service system. A product service system (PSS) is a business strategy to sell the service a product induces instead of the product itself. In the case of the FlexLight, the service is; enhancing the flexible workspace. The advantage of the PSS is that Philips will stay owner of the FlexLights, and can thereby control the end of life process of the product, making the life cycle more sustainable. Another advantage of the product service system lies in customer relations. Future domination of the market by LEDs will decrease the demand for retro-fit light bulbs that will have to be replaced every other year. Philips will thereby have less opportunities to sell products to the customer. The PSS will create a contract based relationships with the customer where periodical maintenance will increase the customer supplier connection. The FlexLight can be an experimental product for this model since it is more common for business to business contract to be service oriented. Concluding; the Flexlight holds potential to open a new market to push photonic textiles. It also creates opportunities for Philips to create a sustainable product with high usability and value, and experiment with a new business strategy in a changing market.","sustainable; Photonic Textile; Product Service System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-02","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Due to the extension of the runway at the local airport, wetlands between Isla Timoteo Domínguez and Isla Martín Garcia developed during the last decades. The bay, where the old port was located, was loaded with sediment. After the waters between the two islands sedimented, Isla Hércules is formed and a channel is created. For the location of the marina, three possible options are selected: at the pier, south of Isla Hércules and in the sedimented bay north of Isla Martín Garcia. By using a multi criteria analysis, a marina at the pier is chosen as the best option because of its small dredging area and minor environmental impact. In consultation with the consultative authorities, a marina at the bay is chosen as the elaborated alternative. The recovery of the old situation in which the marina is located in the bay is the main reason for this choice.Implementation of the marina at Isla Martín Garcia involves cooperation between two parties: the government and a second investor. The government is responsible for the island, and a certain amount of liquidity is required to boost tourism on the island. A second party, like a private investor, is introduced for the maintenance and exploration of the project. This cooperation needs to invest 22.9 million dollars; this includes the 16.4 million dollars for the government and 6.5 million dollars for the second party. Without involving an external investor the internal rate of return (IRR) is 1.77% which is very low. When involving a private investor the IRR increases, the external investor receives an IRR of 7.71 % over the entire lifetime of the marina.","Marina; Argentina; Uruguay; Rio de la Plata","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Environmental problems and the dependence on fossil fuels led to increasing interest in renewable energy sources. Photovoltaic (PV) technologies can convert the light emitted by the sun directly into electrical energy. Therefore PV technologies are very promising and the expectations are high worldwide. Compared to neighboring countries like Germany, the installed capacity of PV in the Netherlands is disappointingly low. This is striking considering the high expectations regarding PV. This means that there is still a lot to be changed and developed regarding these technologies. There are different PV technologies, each in a different phase of development and having different specs. Since PV technologies are emerging technologies, a lot can still change. It would be interesting to assess which of the PV technologies is playing or will play an important role in the way towards sustainable energy production in the Netherlands. To do the assessment, the following research question needs to be answered: “What factors of the Innovation System of PV technologies boost or hamper their development and diffusion in the Netherlands and how did that affect the competition between them? “. To answer that question the following technologies have been chosen: Crystalline silicon solar cells; thin film silicon solar cells; CIGS and CIS solar cells; CdTe solar cells; and organic solar cells. To analyze the factors that boost or hamper the development and diffusions of the technologies, their Technology Specific Innovation System (TSIS) is going to be analyzed. A TSIS is “a network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure or set of infrastructures and involved in the generation, diffusion and utilization of technology” (Carlsson & Stankiewicz, 1991). The TSIS will be analyzed using 7 Functions of Innovation Systems (FIS). Each of these functions assesses a part of the TSIS of the technologies. The functions are - Entrepreneurial activity [F1] - Knowledge development [F2] - Knowledge diffusion through networks [F3] - Guidance of the search [F4] - Market formation [F5] - Resource mobilization [F6] - Creation of legitimacy/ counteract resistance to change [F7] Indicators of each function are described in Table 2.1 in chapter 2. The interaction between the functions will then be analyzed using motors of innovation. These motors of innovation describe several vicious and virtuous cycles or a follow up of events that influenced the development and diffusion of the PV technologies. The research showed that most of the technologies showed so called motors of Science and Technology Push (STP). This motor of innovation is characterized by being dominated by the functions Knowledge development [F2], Knowledge diffusion through networks [F3], Guidance of the search [F4] and Resource mobilization [F6]. Entrepreneurial activities [F1] are weak or even absent. Only CdTe cells showed motors of decline or vicious cycles because the use of cadmium of prohibited when used in combination with some other materials. CdTe is the only technology on which no research is done in the Netherlands nor has there been any entrepreneurial activity, except for machine manufacturing. Not many entrepreneurial activities have led to the actual diffusion of solar cells in the Netherlands. Most entrepreneurial activities only boosted the knowledge developed within the country. Machine manufacturing companies are an example of these entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial activity that leads to diffusion of the technology was only identified for crystalline silicon cells. These cells were first in being ready to be marketed. Between 1985 and 2003, a lot of demonstration projects took place. The EPR subsidy also encouraged users to acquire crystalline silicon PV systems. Therefore an Entrepreneurial motor was identified for crystalline silicon cells between 1985 and 2003. This is when an STP motor “evolves” and more entrepreneurial activity and demonstration projects take place. This would then improve the expectations regarding the technology. However, because the government was still hesitative and entrepreneurs were mostly focused on export, there was no steady subsidy scheme which was needed regarding the high costs of a PV system. This led to a downfall in demand and the Entrepreneurial motor fell back to a STP motor. Thin film silicon was researched almost as much as c-Si. Diffusion of this technology however did not take off. International disappointing results decreased the interest of investors in thin film silicon. This resulted in the closure of the only company involved in this technology, Helianthos. They had a pilot plant for years and never actually started large scale production. CIGS have not really been a subject of research very often. This was mostly because the technology used scarce materials. However the fast international developments regarding this technology led to more research activities and collaboration between Dutch players within the PV TSIS in the Netherlands. There are many actors with different skills, they are now bundling their knowledge to exploit the growing CIGS market. Organic PV is receiving a lot of attention from universities and research institutes. Especially polymer cells are profiting from the fast developments of organic electronics. Production has not taken off yet in the Netherlands because the technology still needs a lot of developments. Investors have therefore still not invested in any production plant. The government has not played a big role in determining which technology acquired the strongest TSIS. Subsidies and regulation were actually the same for each of the technologies. Technologies were researched at different universities and institutes, and if one started a research on a new technology they did not abandon their old research. The competition between the technologies was mostly the result of international factors. These are factors like international research results, availability of raw material and international demand. Entrepreneurs in the Netherlands were therefore mostly driven by export and investors also based their investment decisions on international factors. CdTe for example was not so popular in the Netherlands but internationally it is the most successful thin film technology. Therefore the slower developing thin film silicon in the Netherlands was not so interesting for investors. The analysis of TSIS using FIS was found to lack the attention to international factors. Even when considered their role seems being undermined because they are spread among different functions. This thesis therefore recommended collecting these international factors in a separate function. This function has a lot of influence on the other 7 functions of FIS but not the other way around.","Innovation Systems; Photovoltaics; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology dynamics and Sustainable development","","","",""
