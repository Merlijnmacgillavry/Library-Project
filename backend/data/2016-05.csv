(mentor)","2016","As a consequence of extracting gas from gas fields in the subsoil of the Groningen province during the last decades, seismic activity is increasingly encountered. As The Netherlands is not located in a seismic active area, dynamic loads due to earthquakes historically are not taken into account in structural design. The dynamic loads from induced earthquakes in Groningen were therefore not included in the design conditions for the existing quay structures in the port of Groningen. The occurrence of seismic loads on existing structures is likely to be more common and the phenomenon of seismic activity might now be an important consideration for future design loading of these marine structures. For Groningen Seaports, the port authority, it is of importance to know the consequences of the (predicted) seismic activity on their quay infrastructure and to determine whether safety and functionality are at stake. This thesis research investigates if modifications are required and possible for an existing quay structure in the Eemshaven of Groningen Seaports.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor)","2016","Everybody has experienced it: you start eating from a pack of biscuits or other snacks and suddenly the pack is empty. Even though you did not intent to eat all of it in once. It is known that the package and the food it contains can make a consumer eat more, but little is known of the opposite. This graduation report (hereafter: study) is a part of the master ‘Strategic Product Design` and tries to answer the question: ‘Can we, (designers) make a snack package that influences the consumer in such a way that they eat less of the snack?’ This graduation research builds upon the literature about packaging. The existing literature is based on either the psychology or on the marketing perspective of packaging. This study targets packaging and consumption behaviour from the point of view of the designer. How is design influencing the behaviour of consumers? It is already known that packaging influences the consumption behaviour. Material, shape, size and eating habits are all studied. However not much is known about how these different design aspects are related to each other. Consumers are more and more aware of the effect of packaging, they know the package influences them to use more of its content. And that the goods inside are also influencing the usage frequency. This study tries to show that it is possible to design a package with which the consumer can self-control the amount of food used. In other words: the designer can give the tools to the consumer to self-control the amount of food that is used. A cover story was used to recruit participants for the study. Participants where told that the study was about emotion recognition software and that it therefore was required to watch a film, while their facial expressions where recorded. All participants were told they could eat and drink during the film. To study the effect of packaging, we specifically designed a package for the purpose of this study and produced it using rapid prototyping. The goal for the package design was to enhance the self-reflectiveness of the consumers. This self-reflectiveness was enhanced by making use of the monitoring effect and the Delboeuf illusion. With the self-reflectiveness of the consumer a more mindful way of eating is possibly reached. Three conditions were tested using a between groups design; One partitioned bowl, one partitioned bowl with a lid and one control bowl without partitions or lid. In total 64 participants where recruited. 22 of them were placed in the control group, 21 in each of the other groups. During a 30 minute film the participants were allowed to eat and drink as much as they wanted. A sweet snack was chosen that was easy to count and put into the different partitions. After the film there was a short questionnaire. The recordings made during the experiments were coded afterwards, looking specifically at the participants eating behaviour. Together with the answers of the questionnaire a data set was produced for the analysis. The hypotheses tested stated that both the partitioning of a bowl and closing the bowl with a lid would reduce the rate of eating and the amount eaten from the bowl. An indication towards rejecting the hypotheses was found. The package, designed according to the guidelines found in earlier literature, did enhance the opposite of what was expected. Participants eating from the package that was thought to be the package that reduces the rate of consumption the most, was in fact enhancing the rate in which the participants where eating from it. More research is needed to be able to speak of significant effects.","design; consumption behaviour; packaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In near future the Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México (NAICM) will be built in Mexico City. The airport’s construction is necessary as the Benitto Juarez Internatinal airport has reached its full capacity. The Mexico City area is notorious about its subsoil complexity and earthquake presence. Tunnel Engineer Company (TEC) has been assigned to provide seismic response advice. The importance of site amplification effects in seismic design of constructions is familiar by the up-to-date seismic design codes. Predominantly for constructions with high risk, founded in soft soil situations, site amplification effects are regarded as a significant factor that has to be considered in design. The TEC report provided vital insight on this topic, but basin effects were not included. This work aims to capture basin effects by simulating an elongated surface structure (runway) under earthquake loading, in one (1D) and two dimensional (2D) finite element environment. In the first part of the study a literature examination is conducted, thus to give an integral aspect of the project and especially in the runway characteristics. The hazard risk for NAICM as well as the seismic design requirements provided by TEC for runways is defined. The first part is concluded with a review of earthquake engineering investigation procedures and the background of site response analysis. The second part of the study is orientated to the calibration of the FEM model. The proper choice of clay parameters for the FEM model is a vital step so as to examine site response. Then, the emphasis is moved to free field dynamic analysis of soil column for vertically propagating shear waves because of its significance for seismic analysis of runways. Together linear and linear-elastic perfectly-plastic finite element modeling (FEM) are executed and compared to equivalent linear (E-L) frequency domain analysis. The conclusions extracted from this phase are significant input for the runway dynamic analysis, as they define the geotechnical parameters, the meshing size and the damping introduced in the system to generate valid outputs. Finally, the seismic runway response is presented. First is presented the construction stages and the changes in shear wave velocities, proposed by TEC, which are used to form a wised in place model for the airport’s runway. Comparison between 1D Linear and 2D FEM with linear soil material for one soil profile is examined as well as 1D E-L and 2D FEM Linear Elastic Perfectly Plastic (LE-PP), being followed by comparison between 1D E-L and 2D FEM LE-PP for different locations. Then the conclusions reached by this work are formed, continued by recommendations for possible future work.","site effect; Mexico City; earthquake engineering; ground response; basin effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Fracture mechanics based computational methods are becoming increasingly important to study the structural integrity and failure of materials and structures used in engineering applications. One challenging aspect for computational methods is the analysis of crack nucleation and propagation in complex geometries or in materials with inhomogeneities at microstructural level as found in composite materials. To address this challenge, the present work combines three key ingredients namely, (i) the Finite Cell Method (FCM), (ii) Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) and (iii) Phase-Field model. The Finite Cell Method (FCM) has emerged as a promising computational method in order to simplify the modelling of complex geometries. FCM combined with a higher-order finite element method such as IgA has been implemented in numerous field of structural analysis. Within this context, the IgA-FCM framework isi extended to fracture mechanics through incorporation of a Phase-Field model. Phase-Field model, based on variational formulation of a brittle fracture, is used to study the nucleation and the propagation of cracks around voids and inclusions under quasi-static conditions. The ability of Phase-Field model to reconstruct fracture mechanics problems as coupled partial differential equations makes it easy to implement in the IgA-FCM framework. Due to the computationally demanding nature of the Phase-Field model, hierarchical sub-division of Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBs) basis functions is implemented to achieve local refinement in IgA framework. A novel algorithm to implement hierarchical refinement in IgA-FCM framework is presented which is capable of simultaneously implementing element-based local refinement for stable crack propagation as well as Gauss Quadrature based local refinement for better integration around voids and material interfaces. For establishing the feasibility of IgA-FCM in Phase-field modelling, numerous numerical simulations such as crack nucleation around voids, inclusions and crack propagation in presence of voids, soft and hard inclusions were performed for two-dimensional cases. For relatively simple numerical cases considered in this project, modelling of voids and inclusions as fictitious domain resulted in expected crack behaviour such as crack nucleation at high stress location, curvilinear crack influenced by varying stress state in presence of inclusions. With these numerical simulations, it is shown that the IgA-FCM-Phase-Field framework can be effectively applied for fracture mechanics problems involving complex features.","fracture mechanics; isogeometric analysis; phase-field model; finite-cell method; finite element analysis; voids; inclusions; crack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

To be able to design this tool more information is needed about what a signature solutions is and why it is important. Also more context is needed about when and where this tool will be used. This results in the following research question: How to explain in the Experience Center the development process of the Scarabee Security Lane in such way clients understand how creating a personalised solution through a co-creation approach can add value to their airport? Scarabee is a fast growing international company. Their knowledge about airport processes and their co-creation approach enables the employees to have a holistic way of looking at the solutions and how these solutions influence the other activities at the airport. This project focusses on the role of an interactive showroom as a tool in the early sales process, Scarabee calls this the Experience Center. Scarabee operates in the aviation industry. Through the years flying commoditised and passenger became more demanding. As they gained more power “passenger experience” became an important concept. The competitor analysis shows that Scarabee differentiates itself by focussing on passenger experience and solutions that are personalised to the client needs. The Experience Center consists of different areas which have different functionalities. The space has an industrial look and feel. However the design looks more like a showroom because it misses the “experience”. A boundary object is created that enhances the experience in the Experience Center. It consists of an interactive table and a model of the Scarabee Security Lane that interacts with this table. This table allows the business developer and the client to co-create a personalized model of the security lane. A memorabilia is generated based on the personalized model which enables visitors to share their newly acquired knowledge with their company.","experience; boundary object; co-creation; aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-05-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

Despite their importance, many of them tend to suffer from significant social opposition at the same time. This study was started from an assumption that is shared by a growing number of scientists, this being that social opposition with regard to such projects and activities emerges from underlying value conflicts. A promising approach to address values in a structured and comprehensive manner throughout the design process of technical artifacts is Value Sensitive Design, an ethical theory that aims to incorporate the variety of values in the design process of technical projects.

The necessity of braces (connections between the portside and starboard hulls) for this vessel is questioned, based on earlier vessel developments and operational experience. This study addresses the influence of braces on the structural integrity of the hull. The influence is examined by performing a hydrodynamic, strength and fatigue analysis. The aim of this thesis is comparative; what is the difference between a structural configuration with and a configuration without braces is the red line through this thesis. The structural governing sea states are found using a spectral analysis. A structural optimization in the strength analysisis performed using MATLAB optimization tools. High braces weights are found for which the physical explanations are: 1) the magnitude of the main particulars of the vessel and 2) the fact that a 'forced' displacement is created on the edge nodes of the braces causing very high bending and shear loads. Braces also influence the structural behavior in other parts of the vessel. Therefore the fatigue damage in a deckbox column connection is considered using: 1) a principal stress method and 2) a multiaxial method using Path Dependent Maximum Range (PDMR) cycle counting.It was found that a configuration without braces will yield higher fatigue damages in considered detail in both approaches. The multi-axial approach showed to be the conservative method.","semi-submersible; structural optimization; multiaxial fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology - Offshore and Dredging Engineering - Structural Analysis and Design","","","",""

In this thesis an existing biological proof of concept based on desert ants is transferred to MAVs. Vision-in-the-loop experiments in different environments are performed, to investigate the viability of scene familiarity for visual navigation. Trained images are used to determine which control actions to take during homing. To determine familiarity, either a database of stored images is kept or an artificial neural network is used. Different image representations are compared in multiple simulated environments. The use of textons for determining familiarity gives the best performance, but HSV color histograms also perform well and are very efficient. It is concluded that to make this method competitive with other visual navigation approaches, route familiarity should be combined with other methods to improve robustness.","visual homing; MAV navigation; insect-inspired navigation; scene familiarity; autonomous flight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-30","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

One of the methods that have already proven to be able to increase high lift performance is boundary layer suction. In practice however the application of it is uncommon mainly due to the often high power requirements. The objective of the presented project is studying possible BLS systems with minimal requirements, which may then be driven by ‘naturally occurring’ low pressure zones. Influencing the wake with suction was identified as most promising in this respect, more particularly preventing the phenomenon ‘wake burst’ where the wake rapidly expands and dominates the flowfield in such way that it leads to a loss of lift. Simulations were performed with the inviscid-viscid interaction flow solver MSES, adapted for suction. The results showed that the application of suction was very successful to bring the expansion rate of displacement thickness of the wake below 0.23, which was identified as the critical value above which wake burst is likely. On selected geometries (NLR7301 and MFFS026) this leads to an increase in lift of up to 4.5%. This is not a significantly better than earlier investigated BLS configurations, but the requirements imposed on the eventual BLS system are much lower, especially when considering the required under pressure.","boundary layer suction; pump requirements; multi-element airfoil; MSES; wake control; wake burst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AWE, Aerodynamics","","","",""

Based on this technique a method was developed to determine the hydraulic conductivity. This method is based on water injection from the side of the probe into the soil. Pressure transducers are installed around the injection screen or pressure is measured at surface level. The soil prevents water from freely exiting the probe, causing a pressure increase. This pressure increase is measured at the pressured transducers or at surface level. Low hydraulic conductivity will result in a higher pressure increase than higher hydraulic conductivity. Also the flowrate of the water injection is important, because a larger flowrate will cause larger pressure increases. The ratio flowrate/pressure is a measure of the hydraulic conductivity. But how to relate this ratio to the absolute hydraulic conductivity is something that is not always clear. In this thesis are several methods are given and analysed.

(mentor); De Jonge, F.M. (mentor); Bongers, E. (mentor)","2016","Dunlop Protective Footwear is a global leader in the protective footwear market for the boots segment. Innovations in the niche market of Dunlop are incremental compared with the radical pace of the general footwear industry lead by brands like Nike. Driven by different factors, the industries to which Dunlop deliver their boots are in constant evolution in the way they are structured and they operate, ultimately influencing the role of the workers and their safety requirements. For the company, it is important to continue with their innovation efforts, not only to remain relevant to the market but also to keep the leading position in the protective footwear market. Considering this situation, the aim of this project was to first, explore the need of protective footwear in the future environment of the specific industries in which Dunlop participates with its boots. Secondly, to consider what the company could offer in response to this need. The Scenario Planning approach was chosen for this task. Scenarios is one of the most recognized methods from the field of Futures Studies, which aims to better understand and anticipate change ahead from the present (“Introduction to future studies”, 2016) (“Methods for Studying the Future”, 2016). For this project, there are mainly three benefits from the Scenario Planning approach: The first one is its long term perspective, allowing to include elements that could reside well ahead from the present. The second is because it allows to portray the increasing complexity of future situations around the user in a rich, integrated and thorough way. Lastly, its comprehensiveness, as it supports the integration of various tools and methods to address issues in the process. The outcome of the project is a portrayal of certain possibilities for the protective boots from Dunlop by the year 2030, in the four industry segments where the company focuses. The outcome of the project is constituted by different elements, as ‘the insights and learning arising from the process’ can be of equal or greater value than the end product (Bradfield et. al., 2005). For this reason, together with the final results, other valuable elements such as the Prospective Roles that the Workers could be performing are also considered as part of the project outcome. From this exploration, some possibilities for the future of Dunlop boots can be understood. With the growth of Automation and Robotics in practically every industry field, the presence of human labor will suffer an impact, with a ripple effect in the presence of boots. Also, to some extend, the core attributes of the wellingtons will still be relevant for certain tasks, but there will also be room for new ones. New and emerging ways in which the industries will operate will open new opportunities for the boots as well. The contribution of this project is two folded. On the academic side, it advances the understanding about the application of Scenario Planning techniques in Strategy for the Design discipline. On the company side, it expands Dunlop’s knowledge about their external environment from a long term perspective. Ultimately, this can be used to anticipate and support decision making and strategic planning within the Product Design and Innovation (PDI) Department and the company. With this body of knowledge, the following steps should seek for external perspectives, by contacting knowledgeable people in the field, to challenge and support the assumptions, findings and propositions of this project. The Scenario Planning approach and its tools can be a continuous exercise, considering the constant evolution of the external environment, so the PDI department and the company should consider to carry on with this effort.","design and strategy; futures studies; scenario planning; future scenarios; product development and innovation; contextdriven innovation; future need","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

At this moment, PostNL consists of three main branches: mail, international and parcel. Mail is the big cash cow that needs to be kept as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Part of PostNL’s strategy to realise this, is to find new markets and extent their current services. The assignment focuses on the market of sending ‘offline postcards’ that PostNL serves. This market is mature and declining due to new technologies to communicate and our changing behaviour in communication. Though, these offline postcards are still worth 200mln euros of revenue a year. For years the stamp has been the method of payment for using the delivery service of PostNL. To compensate for the decreasing market this stamp will be increasing in price and there will be cut backs of costs that influence the values of the traditional offline postal service for the consumer.

(mentor)","2016","This master thesis report, authored by Eva Schuurmans in 2016, lays the foundation for the development of a product that enables midwives in the Netherlands who facilitate births at home, to administer analgesic laughing gas to relief women in childbirth from pain. In this thesis, Eva presents a product concept that meets the strict regulations of the Ministry of Health and that takes the limitations of the working environment and needs of the users in the Netherlands into account. A literature research focused on the subject pain and N2O was conducted. There was constant contact with professionals and the users, midwives and women giving birth. In total thirteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in the pre-design phase. The prototype was shown to several companies and users with the goal to gain feedback and test the potential. The result is a concept for the technical solution, double mask and casing. The main goal is to keep the exposure value of the midwife as low as reasonably possible, because of the negative effects the gas has on the absorption of vitamin B12. It is a simple product with limited adjustment possibilities, as most midwives are not used to working with complex devices. The woman herself controls the supply with a button. This positively effects her feeling of personal control and feeling of satisfaction. As long as the control button is pressed, the N2O stays within a closed system, only removing the CO2 and adding some O2 to keep the ratio stable. When the control button is released an electrical spark decomposes the N2O before being released into the room. The woman constantly wears a transparent mask. The mask can be opened to the side when the woman suffers from the side effect of vomiting. The outer contour of the mask keeps on extracting air, even when the mask is open. The amount of N2O being used is limited. The three wheels on the casing make it possible to move the product up the stairs. The product has potential for further development. It offers a way to offer an analgesic at home, something that is not yet available. Benefits of the product include the rapid onset, clearance and the low costs involved. A working prototype needs to be built to test the device.","design; laughing gas; N2O; home delivery; mask; birth; pain killer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Results from the internal and external analysis are followed by a material research, showing the explored possibilities of bamboo. After explaining why Dutch grown bamboo is not suitable for a balance bike, anthropometric data is used for an ergonomics analysis. Combined with the analysis of the prototype provided by the company, a program of requirements is drafted and the conceptualisation phase starts. The creative process that follows, leads to the material combination that is the basis for the rest of the project: bamboo and aluminum. The steps taken from idea to concept proposal are documented showing how difficulties were overcome. A concept is proposed that uses weld aluminum shapes as mechanical and visual joints to create a unified bamboo balance bike design, portraying a focus on sustainability through the subject of eco- efficient value creation. A prototype is used to test the design and see whether the aesthetic and technical qualities produce the desired value, improving the eco-efficiency.","design; bamboo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Heul, D.R. (mentor)","2016","In this project a numerical method has been designed for the coupling of a spherical and cubic grid while preserving a second order error accuracy. This is done to make accurate simulations of the many processes in nature that rely on mass or heat transfer between a solid surface and an adjacent fluid. The solid surface is often enlarged by dispersing the solid as many particles into the liquid, and a single particle can be approximated to be spherical. The rectangular 2D domain, consisting of a circular notch as particle along one side was discretized in a fine spherical grid near the particle and a coarse rectangular grid on the whole domain. A higher resolution near the particle is needed as the result of high Schmidt numbers in fluid systems Sc=1000 and thus strong concentration gradients are to be expected near the particle. On the particle a first order reaction is imposed by a homogeneous Robin boundary condition. If discretized with the same second order accuracy, no difference in error convergence should be expected. Only for high Damkohler numbers, i.e. the ratio between the reaction rate and the diffusion rate, the increased gradients at the particle could result in minor problems. Those could be solved by enlarging the finer spherical grid. The coupling between the grids was done by bilinear interpolation of the flux values. To arrive at this way of coupling, simulations were done first on a 1D diffusion equation. Multiple interpolation methods were tested, but while keeping in mind that interpolation of higher order is very difficult to perform in higher dimensions, linear interpolation was chosen as the best option. And because linear interpolation was performed on flux values, a second order error convergence was still found. Moving on to 2D, also convection-diffusion equations were solved on an easier total rectangular domain and it was found that when discretized with a second order method, the fluid flow had no influence in the error behaviour.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ChemE / Transport Phenomena","","Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Schwab, A.L. (mentor)","2016","Looking ahead to the Summer Olympics of 2020 in Tokyo, the Dutch decathletes want to improve their pole vaulting performance by 15 [cm] to increase their chances of winning an Olympic medal. As the current strategies to improve pole vaulting performance have reached their limit, the coach of the Dutch decathletes and NOC*NSF contacted the TU Delft Sports Engineering Institute to explore, identify and asses new strategies. For this purpose a mechanical model is developed that describes the complete motion of the pole vault. The pole vault motion is modelled as the two dimensional motion of a massless pole and a two segment athlete. The mechanical model includes active control of the motion coordination of the athlete and the forces and moments the athlete applies to the top end of the pole. The mechanical model can determine the motion of the athlete, deformation of the pole, the trajectory of the centre of mass, the forces acting on the athlete-pole system and the energy transformations during a vault. Two new strategies have been identified and assessed using this mechanical model. The first strategy is to reduce the impact energy loss by adding a spring to the bottom end of the pole. The second strategy is to not only optimize the pole length and stiffness but the complete pole vault motion including the motion coordination of the athlete. The results show that it is feasible to implement both strategies before the Summer Olympics of 2020 and that they can improve pole vaulting performance. Especially the optimization of the complete pole vault motion has the potential to improve pole vaulting performance by 15 [cm].","pole vaulting; dynamics; elite performance; mechanical model; motion optimization; spring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-27","Aerospace Engineering","Structures and Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The digital environment has an ever increasing amount smart programs. Programs that also get smarter every day. They help us filtering spam e-mail and they adjust to show us personalized advertisements. These smart programs observe people and serve (other) people. A robot can be seen as a program with a body. Make the program smart enough and it can help us in the real world too. The smartest programs learn from observations to become better at what they do. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of learning that has been successfully applied to solve a variety of learning tasks. RL is learning from experience in sensory changes and rewards. The robot that uses RL tries to optimize the actions it takes to achieve the maximum reward. Most RL algorithms do not scale well to large sensory inputs. Images are very large inputs because each pixel is an input. Therefore algorithms have been created to compress the visual information to abstract representations (Visual Features). Neural Q-learning is such a method. It combines the RL algorithm of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are networks of neurons that each do a small adjustable calculation. The network can transform the input to more abstract or useful information. The ANN can learn by adjusting and optimizing the calculations until the network creates the desired transformation. Using an ANN is a good method to find complex ways to make visual data more abstract and more compressed. In this theses, Deep Q-learning is tested with a more difficult task combined with a higher world complexity. In the original paper it was tested on ATARI 2600 games and achieved good results. In this thesis Deep Q-learning is tested in a transportation task in a 3D simulation where the learner only has a relatively large first-person perspective image of the robot it controls. The results show that the complexity of the visual information and the relatively long-delayed reinforcements cause an initialization-noise to reinforcement-signal ratio such that the learner was unable to converge the neural network to describe beneficial behavior. What was learned was forgotten faster than the learner could replay the useful experiences. It can be concluded that only scaling the environment complexity with the Neural Q-learning algorithm is not possible. The learning algorithm needs an extension that makes it better able to handle long-delayed rewards with large visual inputs.","reinforcement learning; visual features; neural networks; unsupervised learning; convolutional neural networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

The job is valuable for the community as it contributes to a clean neighbourhood and helps to create social coherence. The Broodbroeder rides a specially designed cargo bicycle to a number of bread collection sites and takes the bread to a place where it can be made useful. As part of their daily/weekly routine, local residents can bring bread to school, their local baker or the mosque, where baskets are set up to collect leftover bread. The Broodbroeder also has a social function. Each month, he will cooperate with local parties to turn leftover bread into delicious food on neighbourhood events.

This avoidance is different than other fields, such as art, which embrace ambiguity frequently to evoke intriguing and engaging art experiences. The potentials of ambiguity in product design.and what it can bring to a users experience with objects, has rarely been explored. To our knowledge, Gaver, Beaver, and Benford (2003) are among the first to embrace ambiguity as a rich resource for designing human-computer interactions and to offer design strategies to enhance, create, or provoke ambiguity when designing information, context, and relationships. Alex Zakkas (2013) explored how ambiguity could induce creativity when people interacted with, and made use of, an object that is abundant in our lives (i.e., a twig). Product designers such as Philippe Starck and Naoto Fukasawa have also explored ambiguity in their work. Starck’s Juicy Salif, with its unconventional features for a lemon juicer, has dual-functionality envisioned by the designer: one being a lemon squeezer, the other being a conversation starter in the awkward moments between a newlywed and their in-laws. Fukasawa utilises ambiguity in the design of objects through creating interactions and experiences that are new and intriguing, yet familiar and comfortable to users. The MUJI CD player is an example of his use of ambiguity in the sense that the object resembles and is interacted with as kitchen wall fan yet provides a total new experience and interaction to how the user enjoys music via CD.","ambiguity; product-user experience; object; meaning attribution; affective response; product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The design of the optimal layout of the wind farm is crucial to minimize the cost of energy produced by the wind farm. This requires an accurate wake model to simulate the wake effect on the annual energy yield of the wind farm. On the other hand, the wake model must be very simple in order to limit the duration of the layout optimisation process. The initial purpose of this Master thesis project is to develop an improved (simple) wake model for the wind farm layout optimisation considering the wake meandering effect. With this purpose, a dynamic wind farm wake model which incorporates the wake meandering motion in the time domain is first developed. Since the dynamic wind farm wake model is very computationally expensive, it is not suitable for the wind farm layout optimisation. However, it is discovered with the dynamic wind farm wake model that the wake meandering has insignificant effect on the annual energy yield of the wind farm. Hence, it is not meaningful to develop such simple wake model that considers the wake meandering effect on the wind farm annual energy yield. The thesis has an emphasis on the analysis of the wake meandering effect on the wind farm annual energy yield using the developed dynamic wind farm wake model. The results are shown and the conclusions are drawn. Besides, the limitations of this thesis project are addressed and recommendations for the future work in this area are posted.","layout optimization; wake model; wake meandering; annual energy yield; wind farm; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This master thesis investigated the origin of the seemingly perennial (base) flow in a hydrological complex, Inselberg (a type of mountain) dominated catchment in the Municipality of Messica, Manica Province, Mozambique. Smallholders rely on these perennial flows, since they have three growth seasons, two of them during the dry period. This year-round agriculture is of pivotal importance for dwellers’ (economical) situation and contributes significantly to Mozambique’s food supply. However, there are many (hydrological) unknowns. How much groundwater is stored where, and how much water can be expected during the growth season. More knowledge will improve plant and irrigation schemes, minimize losses and prevent over-exploitation. The Messica Irrigation Pilot Project (MIPP) searches for hydrological answers and tries to provide practical and theoretical insights. Therefore, students performed measurements (e.g., precipitation, water levels, discharges, cross-sections) in the 220km2 large Messica Catchment since December 2012 up to August 2014.Most measurements have been performed at Godi Downstream (a headwater from the mountainous ridge). This perennial stream is small and abundantly vegetated. Another important measurement point is a free flow three-gated bridge downstream in the River Messica. Unfortunately, limited measurements are done here. Overall, the entire Messica Catchment is parsimoniously measured. Scientists also strive to improve ’Prediction in Ungauged Basins’ (PUB). This research took place in recent years. (Parts of) its knowledge and insights are used in this study. This master thesis continued on earlier theses, together they contribute to MIPP’s initiatives on three points. With this insights and practical methods, one might predict headwater baseflow one to two growth seasons ahead. This study proposes (1) the ’conveyance method’ to predict baseflow recession using cross-sectional corrected water levels (conveyances). Conveyances are measured continuously and are obtained directly, as opposed to discharge measurements. This method is based on uniform flow and linear (groundwater) reservoir assumptions together with a known cross-section. The conveyances C and discharges Q are linear related. The bottomslope and roughness are combined in one constant a. From this, we derived groundwater response timescales Ks , and hence, estimated the baseflow recession. Godi’s recession timescale is about 550 days. Together with some additional discharge measurements we are able to calculate discharges two growth seasons ahead. Inselbergs are very steep mountains, ridges or isolated hills in gently sloped areas. They are omnipresent in the Manica province, just as in other parts of East and West Africa. Normally they consist of solid, barely erodible TTG (Tonalite, Trondhjemite, or Granites) materials, as it is the case for the Kalahari Craton, where Messica is located on. Just East of Messica, the Kalahari borders the Barue Complex. Water storage in these solid Inselbergs is not obvious. However, literature study showed that Messica’s mountain ridge belongs to the later deposed Gairezi Sedimentary Group on top of the Kalahari Craton. It forms a 220km long belt from Sussendenga in the South to Guru in the North. The Gairezi consists of quartszites and metapelic schists, with internal westward-dipping inclinations. These mountains contain internal cracks and fissures, where water storage can take place. We developed two Flexible Topography driven, conceptual rainfall runoff (FlexTopo) models (FlexA and FlexC) with an additional output conversion model (OCM) to calibrate on conveyances. FlexA serves as a lumped benchmark model which incorporates all the predefined relevant hydrological processes. FlexC is semi-distributed and distinguishes three different HRUs (hydrological response units), which are entities that show similar hydrological responses. We use two objective parameters to classify the area: Head Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) (as function of the flow accumulation) and hill slope values. FlexC’s HRUs are: Wetlands (with saturated overland flow and exfiltration of deeper groundwater), Inselbergs (with perennial baseflow from its large groundwater storages, fast runoff processes due to steep, forested and/or rocky slopes) and Flatlands. The latter covers a wider scope from irrigated areas, grass and shrub lands to rain-fed fields, but contributes also (delayed) to base and peak flows. Every HRU has its own slow groundwater response reservoir. Furthermore, we applied altitude corrected precipitation to correct for orographic effects. Both FlexA and FlexC are calibrated on the River Godi and validated on the RiverMessica. FlexC showed that (2) Messica’s Inselberg ridge most likely contains an over-year storage. It predicted a groundwater storage of about 800mm in 2013-2014. This led to a specific discharge q of 1.45 mm/s at the beginning of the dry period. In general, this storage guarantees a continuous streamflow during the dry season and makes the area more resilient for dry years. Moreover, we showed with FlexA and FlexC that (3) conveyances can be used to calibrate year-round discharge variations (both base and peak flows). It also proved that FlexModels are transferable, i.e. discharge variations for the (ungauged) downstream locations (Messica Downstream Station) can be predicted based on calibration on a (gauged) subcatchment (Godi Downstream Station). Where FlexA showed better peak flow predictions according to objective functions, FlexC narrowed down uncertainty intervals around predictions on other locations and gave a more consistent model performance. Given the smaller uncertainty intervals, the landscape dependent FlexC is better transferable than the lumped FlexA. However, FlexC seemed to overestimate peak flows, for which several explanations and improvements are given. In general, the conveyance method appeared accurate to predict baseflow recession and to calibrate on low flows. It performed less well during peak flows, since the uniform flow assumption was violated. This was mostly due to the abundant (water) vegetation. The vegetation was even denser above the average water level. Additional work is needed in order to make the method fully functional for the whole flow regime.","baseflow recession; Conveyance method; Stevens method; rating curve; perennial headwaters; Mozambique; Messica; Manica Province; Inselberg; Gairezi Sedimentary Group; smallholder irrigation; rainfall runoff modelling; FlexTopo; cross-sectional corrected water levels; groundwater storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water resources - Hydrology","","-18.885654, 33.140307"

By adhering to this distribution, the manufacturer can efficiently reuse and re-manufacture parts throughout the three main gamer-segments. The concept is to serve multiple users with a single part. With the ultimate goal of creating a win-win-win scenario. Firstly, serving customers with the highest quality products in an affordable and accessible manner. Secondly, as a result of that the manufacturer can maximize the attraction of its platform for gamers. This will have a positive influence on developers. Lastly, at the end of each life-cycle, the manufacturer can recycle and retrieve valuable materials and close the ecological loop. WAVES is based on user research on the desired user experience of gamers. The insights of the research acted as a guide for existing (circular) product design and business strategies. The outcome is a powerful case study of how the Circular Economy can enhance the user experience when driven by a user-centered approach.","circular economy; console gaming","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Circular Research Group","",""

(mentor); Kasbergen, C. (mentor); Ramkisoen, A.S. (mentor)","2016","Urban areas in the Netherlands are expending rapidly and civilization is squeezed onto a decreasing space. As a result building projects intent to be located very close to adjacent constructions leading to potential risk damaging these structures. Especially structures that are constructed within the subsurface, like cables and ducts, require extra care. A fundamental challenge in engineering of vibratory pile installation methods is to quantify the vibration levels and wave propagation through the subsurface. Using empirical prediction methods, based on measured field data, the complexity of the problem lacks authenticity. No distinction between different wave types or layered soil is taken into consideration. These crude methods are good ""first predic- tion methods"", but lack the validly with respect to the impact on pipe structures present in the subsurface. Cost expensive precautionary measurements or time expensive 3D Finite Element calculations are in directly related to the complexity of the problem statement. The need for a reliable and simple to use prediction method is the fundamental basis for this Master Thesis research project. Basic dynamics is mandatory to retrieve knowledge about the complexity of the problem spectrum. Various wave properties and behavior are therefore included in the investigation to obtain favorable judgment in modeling choice. Massarsch and Fellenius proposed a simple model for the prediction of vibration levels at the surface induced by impact pile installation will be applied. This mothodology makes it possible to investigsted layer soil compositions and makes a clear distinction between different wave types. Investigation of vibratory pile installation problems, as carried out in this Master Thesis project, requires modification of this model. To prove the validity of the modified research methodology, the Eurocode 3 and the application of an axis symmetric 2D Finite Element ABAQUS model is inserted as comparison method. The pressure wave as modeled enforces the pipe to vibrate. Modeling the impact of this oscillations on pipe structures by means of a 1D Finite Element approach is in accordance with the aim for simplification and model authenticity. The constitutive behavior of the model is build on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and applied to the equation of motion. A realistic soil damping representation is incorporated by means of the Rayleigh-damping method. A parameter sensitivity study is applied to test all individual model components on their behavior with respect to condition changes. From the study can be concluded that the coupled modified vibration estimation method of Massarsch and Fellenius (named Wave Propagation Model in this research) to the proposed pipe structure representation (named Pipe Structure Model in this research) made it possible to accomplish the research goals of this Master Thesis project. The most important research goal achieved is the possibility to predict the oscillatory behavior of the pipe to enforced vibration waves from vibratory sheet pile installation. Although the comparison between the Wave Propagation Model and the ABAQUS model show complementary results, due to the the lack of observation regarding field measurement data the authenticity of the model is not yet confirmed.","numerical analysis; vibrations; pile driving; pipes; ducts; dynamics; soil dynamics; structural dynamics; soil structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis describes the design and implementation of a VLIW processor and associated caches based on the ρ-VEX concept. An ρ-VEX processor must be dynamically (runtime) reconfigurable to behave as a single large processor, two medium-sized processors, or four small processors. This allows a scheduler to optimize for energy and/or performance based on runtime information. The key challenge lies in translating this concept into actual working hardware. Note that reconfiguration must happen quickly for the increase in performance to outweigh the reconfiguration overhead. To accomplish this goal, a new processor and corresponding cache organization had to be developed, verified, and debugged. The dynamic reconfiguration concept used in the ρ-VEX processor is unique and, therefore, the following key components had to be designed: (1) a dynamic instruction cache that can service a single processor or multiple processors depending on the core configuration, (2) a dynamic data cache with coherency since we are dealing with multiple cores, (3) a reconfiguration control unit that synchronizes running threads before reallocating the computational and cache resources, and (4) a mechanism that allows state restoration after handling a trap. State restoration must be possible even if the configuration changed while the trap was being handled. This is an issue, because it is possible for a trap to interrupt a thread in intermediate states that would not normally occur in wider configurations. Reconfiguration takes only six clock cycles if there are no stalls from the memory subsystem, so overhead should be negligible. On top of the base design of the dynamic ρ-VEX processor, the following features were implemented: (1) variable-length instruction support to decrease instruction cache pressure, (2) a debugging peripheral and accompanying tools, and (3) a trace unit for offline debugging and cache performance logging. Furthermore, many parameters of the processor can be selected at design-time using generics, such as the issue width, the degree of reconfigurability, and the layout and availability of the computational resources. Additionally, the pipeline configuration, instruction set encoding, and control register functionality can be configured using a VHDL code generator. This work is intended to enable future research and development in dynamic processor design. It has already proven its value, as three MSc projects used the current design as a starting point, and four conference papers were published with results generated based on the current design. Finally, the processor will also serve as the basis for an ASIC design that is intended to be used in robotics and space applications.","r-VEX; dynamic reconfiguration; reconfigurable VLIW processor; reconfigurable cache; cache coherence; bus snooping; precise trap; precise interrupt; precise exception; external debug; self-hosted debug; variable-length instructions","en","student report","","","","","","","","2018-05-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Rezaei, J. (mentor)","2016","Increasing competition in today’s markets leads to an increasing need for companies to be competitive. One factor that affects how competitive companies can be, is how innovative they are. Companies therefore want to be innovative, which can be challenging. One way of being innovative is to use innovations created by others. When two companies merge, this creates the possibility to use innovations from each other. Before this can happen, the innovations need to be exchanged. In some mergers, after they have merged, the exchange of innovations does not happen. Companies want to know how they can positively influence innovation exchange. By understanding what factors contribute to innovation exchange, companies can design innovation strategies that deal with these factors. This research specifically focuses on mergers between Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies that are located in different countries. It was believed that being located in different countries, being in a merger and having a specific company culture might influence which factors affect innovation exchange. The goal of this research is to create a list of success factors for innovation exchange between merged international Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies. These success factors are used to understand how merged international Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies can exchange innovations. In order to achieve this, the following research question was set up: How can merged Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies from different countries exchange innovations between the merged companies? In this definition, innovations are those things that are significantly new for the receiver. In order to answer the main research question, three sub-questions were set up. The first sub-question is: Which factors contribute to the exchange of innovations between companies? This sub-question was answered by a literature review. The second sub-question is: Which factors contribute to the exchange of innovations between two merged international Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul companies? This sub-question was answered by performing a case study research at AirFrance Industries KLM Engineering and Maintenance. The third sub- question is: How can AirFrance KLM Engineering and Maintenance come to the exchange of innovations? This sub-question was answered by deriving a list of do’s and don’ts and recommendations for innovation exchange from the interviews in the case study. The literature review that answers the first sub-question covers literature on standards battles, inter- organizational relationships, social networks and alliance governance. The second sub-question is answered by providing a list of success factors for innovation exchange that were derived from interviews performed at AirFrance Industries KLM Engineering and Maintenance. The interviews from the case study were also used to answer the third sub-question. The list of success factors from sub-question 1 and sub-question 2 were compared and it was checked whether overlap and differences exist between the factors. A set of eight success factors was derived from the case study, which were not found in the literature review. These factors can be taken into consideration by companies trying to exchange innovations. From this comparison, it was concluded that success factors found within a merged international Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul company are largely similar to the general success factors found in existing literature on innovation exchange between companies. Based on the conclusion that the success factors are largely similar and that the new success factors do not oppose existing success factors, it is concluded that the list of success factors derived from the literature review, combined with those found in the case study, can be used by companies to design an innovation exchange strategy or to improve the sharing of innovations within their merged companies. Merged international Maintenance Repair and Overhaul companies, and AirFrance Industries KLM Engineering and Maintenance in particular, can use this set of success factors together with the recommendations in this research and the list of do’s and don’ts, that were mentioned by their own employees, to design an innovation exchange strategy.","innovation exchange; mergers and acquisitions; success factors; aircraft MRO; Airfrance KLM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","","",""

(mentor); Miedema, S.A. (mentor)","2016","To protect pipelines in Arctic regions they are often buried in trenches, effectively preventing damage by ice gouging. When trenching is performed in Arctic soil, subsea permafrost may be encountered at water depths up to 100 m, mainlywhile excavating clay soil. Frozen clay is an anisotropic inhomogeneous material with a tensile strength and behavior comparable to soft rock. Previous observations of cutting experiments on submerged frozen clay indicated that the dominant failure mechanism is tensile brittle. With an increasing thickness of the layer cut, the increase of cutting forces seems to be less than proportional. An explanation for this trend is the size effect, which describes the probabilistic weakening of the material when the thickness of the layer cut increases. An optimal thickness of the layer cut could result in lower specific energy consumption, however this may lead to higher cutting forces. In order to excel in the design and construction of efficient subsea excavation equipment (e.g. subsea trenchers) thorough knowledge of physical characteristics of permafrost is mandatory. These characteristics include the failure mechanisms, the required cutting forces and power consumption. Due to the brittle behavior of the frozen clay the use of a vibration-impact mechanism has been investigated. A literature reviewidentified that the knowledge on vibration-impact cutting in permafrost is very limited. Therefore Royal IHC and Delft University of Technology joined forces to fill this knowledge gap. The main goal of this research is to identify the governing parameters in (vibration-impact) cutting of frozen clay. Knowledge of the effect of vibration-impact cutting leads to the ability to calculate cutting forces in similar conditions and to determine the parameters required for designing effective subsea excavation equipment. In this study a prediction model of the vibration-impact cutting tool and soil is developed. A specialized large scale vibration-impact cutting setup was designed and constructed. The cutting experiments were performed on stiff clay having similar properties of the soils found in the Arctic. The results from the experiments were used to validate the prediction model. A relationship between drawbar force reduction, velocity ratio and force ratio has been found and is elaborated to design parameters.","vibration; impact; percussive; clay; frozen; trenching; arctic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering - Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

In the second part, this method will be used to derive the actual equations of motion. These equations are linearized around of the the pendulum's stationary positions to obtain expressions which link the moment of inertia about an axis to the period of oscillation of the pendulum about that axis. These equations are subsequently applied to the solar boat to derive estimates for the moments of inertia about the principle axis of the boat. The results of this thesis considers three different configurations of the bifilar pendulum with the solar boat suspended. One of these configurations results in the most accurate estimates for the moments of inertia, however, these have not been quantitatively predicted.

A low load response threatens the employability of a vessel. Goal of this research is solving the load response challenge, which enables the option of full LNG power for all vessels, without limiting employability. The low load response of gas only engines is attributable to the Otto-cycle, the chance of pre-ignition limits the amount of fuel injected each cycle. During this research five solution principles were identified: concessions, internal-, external energy input, load sharing and over-sizing. A tool is developed determining the required power, capacity and load response of the solution’s components. These parameters are used to calculate the dimensions and costs of each solution. A score function for the solution’s performance is defined to analytically determine the optimal solution. Implementing knowledge gained throughout this research in a tool significantly reduces the time required for a load response analysis. Besides, where designers might encounter tunnel vision, the tool analytically determines the optimal solution, introducing alternatives otherwise not explored.

(mentor); Van Es, S.H.J. (mentor); Gresnigt, A.M. (mentor); Vardon, P.J. (mentor); Peters, D.J. (mentor)","2016","Bending behaviour of steel tubes has been examined in many research projects through the years, especially for empty ones. Also the infill and pressure effect in the tubes has been elaborately investigated but not much has been done on the effect that the sand infill has on the bending of the tubes. Combi-wall tubes are filled with sand during their installation on site not on purpose, since the sand enters through the lower open edge of the tube. The presence of the sand helps in achieving better post-yielding behaviour and local buckling capacity (failure at higher curvature), and also smaller ovalization of the steel tube cross-section. One of the advantages of the sand infill of combi-wall tubes is that it is free of costs and present at the application site. In order to have a better view of this favourable effect, the SBRCURnet organization performed an investigation programme, which included 4-point bending tests on empty and sand-filled tubes. In the current thesis, a numerical model of the experiments is designed which is verified and compared to the experimental test results and to analytical formulas. The numerical model is built with the ABAQUS software and consists of two approaches (models) on the issue. The first consists of a “slice” of the cross-section and it produces the moment-curvature and ovalization-curvature diagrams but it cannot predict the local buckling of the tube. The second is created in order to simulate experiment setting. It is a full scale model and it represents the mid-section of the set-up which has a constant bending moment. From this, the moment-curvature and the ovalization-curvature diagrams and the local buckling failure can be derived. The numerical curves and results are compared to curves derived from analytical formulas taken from literature research and to the results taken from the experimental tests. Additionally, the slice model is used to perform a parametrical study of the sand properties. By this, the influence of each sand property on the moment and ovalization can be examined. Generally, the final conclusion is that the numerical moment-curvature curves are a very good fit to the ones derived from the analytical formulas and they also have a good fit to the results of the experiment except for a very few of them. Furthermore, it can be clearly seen that the favourable effect of the sand is depicted in the numerical results as well as in the experimental ones. The sand infill contributes mainly to the post-yielding behaviour and the local buckling capacity since the buckle occurs in a later curvature value compared to the empty tubes. Also, the buckling shape of a sand-filled tube differs for the buckling shape of an empty tube due to the presence of the sand, which averts the inward local buckling and allows only an outward buckle to form.Additionally, by preventing the excessive ovalization of an empty steel tube, it can contribute to the bending moment capacity especially for the higher curvature values. In the curvature values close after the yielding of the tube, the contribution in the moment capacity is significantly smaller but nevertheless obvious. To sum up, filling the combi-wall steel tubes is an easy and very cheap manner in order to enhance their local buckling capacity.","steel tubes; sand-filled; local buckling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Numerous services are being offered over the Internet and require identification of users as in face-to-face interactions. To simplify the authentication procedure and reduce the need to manage multiple credentials to access services, Electronic Identification (eID) schemes have been introduced. eID schemes commonly involve many service providers (SPs) which provide services, such as online shopping, social networks, etc. to users and identity providers (IDPs) which verify the identity of users and facilitate the users to authenticate him/herself to SPs. In federated eID schemes, IDPs store identifiable user information (attributes), often with a unique ID, and attest on these attributes to SPs. In this work we address the privacy concerns of storing user attributes at the IDP which allows the IDP to profile the behaviour and activities of users. We propose to store the attributes in a privacy friendly manner so that they cannot be directly linked to a particular user even if the data is leaked. Then we include an additional step incorporating private information retrieval (PIR) in the usual authentication flow of federated eID scheme so that the IDP can perform its role of authenticating and managing the user’s identity without turning into a privacy hotspot. The privacy enhancement offered by our work needs to be accompanied by privacy-friendly authentication, which does not reveal the identity of the user, to be effective. Finally, through a proof-of-concept implementation we show a practical variant of our scheme in which the IDP, with millions of users, partitions its database.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

The main objectives were to evaluate the performance of a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based turbulence models in Unsteady RANS (URANS) simulations, identify sensitivities to numerical parameters and find out if Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) based turbulence models provide lower modelling errors than in URANS simulations for this practical test-case. In this respect, the effect of the iterative error and the discretization error using k-omega SST-2003 model [15] was studied and turbulence models such as the SST-DDES turbulence model [19] and the TNT-XLES turbulence model [20] were also applied. The results using the URANS results have highlighted the importance of small temporal and spatial resolution in the calculation domain in order to reduce the effect of the discretization errors. Moreover, large time-integration periods (larger than 60 shedding cycles) should be required to ensure that the statistical noise does not affect the solution Verification procedure which would otherwise hamper the estimated numerical uncertainties. As expected from the studies of Pereira et al. [7], the results with the DES based turbulence models have shown that numerical settings for URANS are insufficient for DES and large comparison errors have been found for many quantities such as the time-averaged pressure distribution at the surface and the integral quantities. The numerical studies with the k-omega SST model [15] have shown that if the numerical uncertainties identified in the study are controlled, Verification & Validation studies using this model could provide low modelling errors for this test-case for the investigated mean flow quantities. For the DES results, since the poor comparisons with experimental results with respect to URANS results using the k-omega SST (2003) turbulence model are caused by poor numerical settings, studies using finer grids, smaller time-steps and lower iterative criteria than the ones used in the present work are recommended.","square prism; Detached Eddy Simulation; URANS; turbulence modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime Technology","","","",""

The project arose from the resolution of Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding to develop a protocol to identify the material properties of bre reinforced composites by non-destructive methodologies in order to validate nite element models of real scaled structural components. The requirements set-up for this protocol were conceived to create a feasible user friendly system, applicable mostly using in-house equipments and software. MNETs combine experimental global results with numerical simulation results in order to obtain priori unknown characteristics or parameters minimizing the distance between the experimental and numerical outputs. The results obtained in the last 25 years have proved modal analysis to be a great experimental technique for this application. The structural parts of the deck used in the analysis consisted in two Carbon/Epoxy sandwich panels and one monolithic E-Glass girder. All of them were subjected to modal vibration tests (EMA) and numerical simulation by nite element methods (FEA). The two sets of results made up of numerical and experimental natural frequencies and mode shapes obtained respectively from the experimental modal analysis and the nite element analysis were correlated in pairs matching each numerical couple of natural frequency and mode shape to the equivalent experimental couple. These data set together with the stiness parameters to update are implemented in the material identication routine to computed the new updated stiness parameters. The parameters were input in the FE-model of the original deck section and compared with the test results to check if the new parameters generated a numerical simulation closer to the reality. This thesis demonstrated that the MNET based on modal analysis for composites sti- ness parameters identication can be successfully applied within the shipbuilding environment with low initial impact of investment. Further research will be necessary to improve the protocol and to back-check the results evaluating the update FE-model performance static simulations focused on stresses and strains. Investigation of the same procedure applied to the identication of other structural parameters such as: damping, damage etc. would be high interesting projects.","composites; MNETs; EMA; material identification; non destructive test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","A sunken ship load needs more and more to be taken into account in the design of an immersed tunnel. Such a load is often governing the design. The designer gets often a prescribed value (in kN/m2) from the client for a sunken ship load. The range in prescribed values show however a big scatter. There are also a lot of tunnels over which a lot of ships are passing, without having a sunken ship load taken into account in the design. This gives the need to get more insight in the behaviour of a sunken ship to predict a representative sunken ship load. Another important question is, if a ship sinks on an immersed tunnel, whether the tunnel collapses or not. If the tunnel collapses, the users are not safe anymore. The insight in the behaviour of a sunken ship is gained through a literature study. From this literature study it resulted that a sunken ship load depends on a lot of parameters. It depends on the mass density of the carried cargo, the size of the ship, the depth of the waterway, and the way how a ship sinks. To determine a sunken ship load, all events in which a ship hits the tunnel are set out in a fault tree. All those events are evaluated with respect to the probability of occurrence an the magnitude of load. The magnitude of load is determined with the aid of a developed model. In that model the different parameters on which a sunken ship load depends are taken into account. The event in which a ship sinks with its bow on the tunnel deck appears to be the most important one. Sunken ship loads ranging from 50 – 300kN/m2 are found then. The response of an immersed tunnel depends on the type of tunnel. Concrete tunnels appear to be the most important type of tunnel. Concrete tunnels on a typical Dutch subsoil are evaluated with respect to a large sunken ship load of 300kN/m2. For the cross sectional analysis, an globally increase in U.C. of 1.3 for shear and a decrease in U.C. of 0.7 for bending moment was found. For the longitudinal analysis, monolithic tunnels obtain shear forces in the joints which are three times bigger than the strength. The bending moments cause through cracking of the tunnel structure. The deformation of the water seals remain below the requirements. The shear forces in the joints for a segmented tunnel lie in the same order of magnitude as the strength. The bending moments remain small and cause no through cracking of the tunnel structure. The deformations of the water seals can become twice as high as allowed. The Wijkertunnel is used as a case study to evaluate the response of a specific tunnel when subjected to a sunken ship load. The Wijkertunnel is a segmented tunnel with an immersed part of 575m consisting out of 6 elements. Each element contains four segments. The sunken ship loads applied on the tunnel are derived from the shipping characteristics of the ships passing that tunnel. The tunnel is evaluated for a small ship (a general cargo carrier) and a big ship (an iron ore bulk carrier). For the general cargo carrier only the event of the (bow of the) ship sinking on the tunnel deck is evaluated. For the iron ore bulk carrier the same event is evaluated, and also the event if the ship sinks just next to the tunnel. If the tunnel sinks just next to the tunnel, a load is induced on the tunnel wall. From the cross sectional analysis it resulted that one tunnel tube fails under the load from the general cargo carrier and the load from the iron ore bulk carrier when sinking on the deck. Shear failure is the governing failure mechanism. From the longitudinal analysis it followed that the shear kay fails in the wall if the tunnel is loaded from aside. Failure of one tube of the cross section implies that the structure is no longer structural safe. The users of the tunnel are in great danger then. Failure of the shear key in the wall causes only big leakage problems. The tunnel remains structural safe then. Users of the tunnel are still able to leave the tunnel safely. The risk of a sunken ship load leading to failure of the Wijkertunnel is lower than the risk of a BLEVE. The risk of a BLEVE is often accepted and not covered in the design of immersed tunnels. It is therefore concluded that the risk of a sunken ship load also can be accepted.","immersed tunnel; sunken ship; structural behaviour; Wijkertunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Broekhans, B. (mentor); Lendering, K.T. (mentor)","2016","The coming decades the Netherlands will continue to urbanize, through the construction of houses and the reconstruction of old neighbourhoods and industrial areas. The need to maximise the possibilities of the scarce space at the urban waterfront connects flood security and spatial planning ever more closely. The current competition of space often makes it impossible to reinforce the flood defences in urban areas in a traditional way; therefore it is necessary to find alternative solutions. The application of multifunctional flood defences can contribute to overcoming this challenge. The multifunctional flood defence concept aims to use the (limited) space that is still available along the popular waterfront by integrating several functions into a multifunctional flood defence. This way the concept can help to reduce the conflicts between spatial planning requirements and flood security. Especially in densely populated areas there is a need for further development of this concept. There is to be expected that opportunities will arise the coming years for the realisation of multifunctional flood defence due to the flood security assignment, especially at the riverfronts. However the opportunities to do more with the integration of flood defences and spatial planning developments are barely used. In order to understand this, there needs to be more insight into the decision-making process of multifunctional flood defences. This research opportunity leads to the following main research question: What are key factors that influence the decision-making process of multifunctional flood defence projects and how can those factors influence the decision-making process? In this research a multifunctional flood defence is in this research defined as: a primary flood defence that is constructed or adapted to serve secondary non-common functions whereby retaining water remains the main function of the flood defence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Dommelen, S. (mentor); Van Geer, R. (mentor)","2016","Secrid is a company that designs and manufactures innovative wallets and has grown very fast by doing so. The company has the ambition to play an important role in the self-defined pocketwear market, which is symbol for small and convenient products you carry with you. Acknowledging the rise and popularity of the smartphone as a pocketwear product, the company desires to explore the market of digital products and services. Secrid has not yet expanded their product portfolio beyond the wallet. However, brand extension is necessary for any one-product-brand to survive. As Secrid currently has no efforts in this market of digital products, there needs to be a way to translate Secrid’s brand to digital products and services. By designing for a typically Secrid emotional experience, the brand can be translated to this market independent of the functionality of the products for this market. Personality Driven Design Personality Driven Design is a tool that materialises the process of design for an emotional experience. It has been extracted what concerns Secrid’s customers have regarding their wallets as those influence the emotional experience according to appraisal theory. Designing for those Secrid specific concerns for different products is accomplished by ideating around personality traits that are matched to those concerns, as people connect with products in a way similar to how they connect with other humans. Through this process of ideation, it is continually asked how a certain personality trait influences the usefulness, usability and desirability of a product; thus making the design of a new product personality driven. As Personality Driven Design is focused on the emotional experience of the product that is subject to its process, it can also be useful for the design process of for example the marketing department. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on the development of the Secrid brand. Personality Driven Design is the first step by step tool to design for an emotional experience and has impact on design methodology and design for emotion literature. Beyond Secrid, the tool or its mechanism can even be generalised to different companies and purposes. Portfolio of Concepts As Secrid needs a way to get started in this new market, the portfolio of concepts is introduced. The portfolio consists of four concepts that indicate Secrid’s role in the market by being designed for different—yet still Secrid—concerns. The Talisman concept envisions Secrid’s ultimate role in the market and embodies what the company can accomplish in the future. The Passbook concept is a less complex concept that the company can immediately start with. The concepts of the portfolio are sequentially more complex, so the company needs to acquire the necessary capabilities to realise those products. This is primarily done by the hiring of new people and partnering with a software development firm. Internalising knowledge on digital products and services has the added benefit that the company acquires the flexibility to deal with and act on technological innovations, which can also be beneficial for the physical product portfolio. As the company looks towards the market of digital products as a great opportunity that can add value to the brand and organisation, every concept contributes to various performance indicators to indicate their success. The risks that come with the development of the portfolio are identified and mitigated by various strategies that indicate the company needs the flexibility to adapt alongside the development. Every project can be strategised, but as change in the context is unavoidable, such a strategy is never finished. Conclusion Personality Driven Design and the portfolio of concepts provide Secrid with a way to enter the market of digital products and services and has a wide variety of inspiring products it can start developing. It is therefore recommended that Secrid starts implementation of both deliverables.","brand extension; product portfolio management; design for emotion; product service systems; digital products; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The goal is to find the influence of changes to the structural configuration on the resulting weight of said torsion-bending boxes.

From the generated data the influence of buckling allowables, number of spars, stringers and ribs on the overall structural weight is determined. This research resulted in a fast, reliable and versatile tool for the preliminary design of wing-like structures, while finding trends in weight saving related to changes in structural configuration which could lead to more detailed and accurate weight estimations for future design efforts. It is concluded that for the case study performed on the DC-10 vertical tail there was indeed a significant weight saving to be found by changing the structural layout. Furthermore it is recommended that the trends and methods for weight estimation found in this research are applied to other cases to confirm or fine-tune them.","torsion-bending-box; wing-box; multi-spar; composites; weight reduction; structural analysis; finite element analysis; post-buckling; preliminary design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace structures and materials","","","",""

The main advantage of the proposed concept is the increased safety and flexibility compared to currently used AC network. The core idea is to incorporate wireless power transfer into the network which leads to inherently safer and more flexible network compared to 50 Hz AC network. The networkmust be able to supply enough power to several loads without any means of communication between the source and the load side. Furthermore, with introduction of distributed energy sources (eg. PV), the network must also be able to operate several sources at one time. Themain challenge tackled in this thesis was a design of a controller that is able to control several sources simultaneously, independently and efficiently. The controller is the same for each source, which means that there is nomaster and no slave source and each source has the same priority. The solution provided in this thesis is based on the sliding mode control theory and the physics of series loaded resonant converter. The proposed controller is suitable to be used in applications like PV clusters, or other applications with distributed sources. The derivation of the controller proposed in this thesis starts with the energy-balance equation. However, it is realized that in order to control multiple sources with possibly different voltage levels it is important to utilize the reactive power. Therefore, the controller proposed emphasizes the power-balance equation. The dynamic stability of the power-balance controller is studied in the framework of sliding mode control theory.","series loaded resonant converter; energy-balance; sliding mode control; wireless power transfer; stability; equivalent control; averaged model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DC systems, Energy conversion & Storage","","","",""

(mentor); Karana, E. (mentor)","2016","This thesis is the final project as part of the master study Integrated Product Design at Delft University of Technology. In collaboration with Utrecht University, this project researches the development of mycelium based materials. Fungal mycelium is an interesting emerging material, that requires further research and development, both on the material proper and on the applications it might be suited for. Researching the potential of mycelium design, the main question for this thesis is defined as follows: How can fungi materials and products be designed on technical and experiential level to optimize their acceptance in society? Apart from applying the Material Driven Design method (Karana et al., 2015) this study attempts to adapt, modify and extrapolate theories from other fields to provide a framework for 'material acceptance'. Primary research focusses on consumer behaviour, acceptance theories and innovation models and implementing them into the MDD framework. To systemize the development of mycelium materials, a framework of variables, relevant for the final material properties, was developed. Guided by this framework, six phases of tinkering are executed to acquire a good understanding of the material and its preparation as well as to provide suitable material for further testing. The final set of materials for testing consists of six samples in which the structure and the compression of the substrate were varied. Insights in the experiential properties of the material were generated by a focus group and a categorization study. In both, the material was rated as very natural and was experienced positively by the participants. Other specific attributes ascribed to the material include e.g. light, soft, brittle and comforting. For the technical characterization, five semi-quantitative tests were executed on the samples to assess thermal conductivity, strength, density, flammability and water resistance. These tests indicated that the material, when not -compressed, is not very strong but on the other hand has good insulating properties. Through two benchmarks on i) 'products from the same material' and ii) 'similar materials', interesting opportunities for the application of mycelium materials have been extracted. Combined with the unique material qualities, this led to define the Material Experience Vision as follows: 'Create, on the basis of mycelium, a meaningful product and - experience that invites you to discard it in nature through the context of the product and the interaction it creates.' With the Vision as basis for the idea generation, five product concepts have been developed. With respect to acceptance, these concepts have been rated on their likelihood for adoption, using the five characteristics of innovation (Diffusion of Innovation) and Verganti's Design Driven innovation model. Combining both the main research question and the Vision, the final design is a novel variation on the packaging of (wine) bottles. The mycelium material is grown around the bottle and due to the shaping properties of the material it protects the object as a ‘second skin’. By peeling of the skin, the bottle is revealed and ready for consumption. The interaction with the product highlights the naturalness of the material and encourages to discard the “second skin” in nature. The thesis concludes with a set of recommendations for further research and development focussing on the material, material testing and products. The main elements recommended include substrate type, shaping and standardisation of the material and testing the material according to industry standards.","Material Driven Design; mycelium based materials; growing; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Emerging Materials","","","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor); Wang, M. (mentor)","2016","Trucks are largely used in road transportation worldwide in recent decades, and make great contributions to the GDP. Statistics shows that a large number of truck-involved accidents occur related to the ramp in merging manoeuvres on the highway. The accidents involved in trucks can lead to a considerable economic cost. The development of automated vehicl largely prompts the growth of vehicle active safety. In this thesis, we would like to address the problem of trajectory generation of trucks in merging manoeuvres. The trajectory generator is an important autonomous sector of a fully automated vehicle. A good generator can select the right moment for lane-changing manoeuvres by identifying a suitable gap in the traffic at the target lane, and define the path and acceleration profile. The potential algorithm, the optimisation-based algorithm and the sample-based algorithm are the main approaches to solve the motion planning problem. Due to its obvious drawbacks, the potential algorithm is not frequently used for the vehicle trajectory generation. The optimisation-based algorithm can get very accurate solutions; however, its performance depends on the development of the solver since most of the available solvers cost much when handling with nonlinear problems. The sample-based algorithm is a flexible method, and can be modified to fit a large range of situations. The sample-based algorithms are widely used in motion planning of small car-like robots. A lot of efforts have been paid on the studies of the sample-based algorithm. One of the most famous sample-based algorithms is the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. It is an algorithm that can cover the entire configuration space, and select a best path from the start state to the goal state quickly. However, the RRT algorithm is mostly used on small car-like robots with relatively low speed. Moreover, the results obtained by the RRT algorithm are usually not accurate. To address this problem, some modified RRT algorithms have been proposed. But most of the modified RRT algorithms have more complex structures, and achieve an accurate solution at the cost of more computational cost. The kinodynamic planning problem is to find a motion that goes from a start state to a goal state while satisfying all constraints of a nonlinear system. Trajectory generation of trucks is actually a kinodynamic planning problem. In this thesis, we would like to develop an RRT algorithm to solve the path planning problem of a large truck for merging manoeuvres on the highway. The basic RRT algorithm cannot solve the trajectory generation problem alone, since the basic RRT algorithm only focuses on the propagation of the tree and does not take the system’s dynamic into consideration. It should be incorporated with other algorithms to solve the path planning problem. The trajectory generated by the RRT algorithm cannot satisfy all constraints of the vehicle system. To solve this problem, a dynamic model that includes non-linear tyre properties with limits on longitudinal acceleration and steering angle, and with first order driveline and steering dynamics is incorporated in the RRT algorithm. Some strategies are incorporated in the RRT algorithm to improve the performance. The sample bias is introduced to the RRT algorithm to reduce the number of the waste samples by increasing the sampling probability of the nodes near to the goal region. The node selection method increases the choices of the nodes for the tree and reduces the sampling times. This method works by solving the nonlinear system for multiple times before adding the resulted node to the tree. The combination of criteria strategy uses different criteria to stop the algorithm when the goal is far away and is close. This method improves the efficiency of the algorithm. The RRT algorithm is developed for both online and offline implementation. The offline RRT algorithm is developed and implemented over the open-loop system and the closed-loop system. The simulation results show that a trajectory planned by the closed-loop RRT algorithm shows less disturbance and is smoother than a trajectory planned by the open-loop RRT algorithm. The real-time implementation is realised by updating the offline planning algorithm over closed-loop system. The replanning algorithm with regard to the highway situation is developed in this work. Collision avoidance is incorporated with the RRT algorithm by applying the intersection algorithm on the bounding volumes, since the intersection algorithm is a simple and quick method to detect the collision. The surrounding traffic is modelled as a set of Axis-aligned Bounding Boxes, and the truck is modelled as an Oriented Bounding Boxes in the configuration space. The intersection algorithm is applied on these bounding volumes to check the intersection of them. This work has developed a real-time RRT algorithm for trajectory generation for trucks for merging manoeuvres on the highway. We implement the RRT algorithm on both the open-loop system and the closed-loop system, propose ideas to improve the algorithm, and discuss the parameters that affect the algorithm in this work. It is a piece of work for the application of the RRT algorithm on the planning problems for large vehicles.","merging manoeuvres; trucks; trajectory generation; RRT algorithm; highway","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A port is selected by its port users based on their knowledge of the competition between the ports and most of all the attractive force between the port user and the ports. Addressing this port attraction is of crucial importance when wanting to influence the port selection process of the port user. This thesis aims to build a model that provides the Port of Rotterdam with intelligence of the underlying sensitivity of this port selection process that can be used to specify region specific strategies. The model is build for the case of the Port of Rotterdam who wishes to expand their current market shares in Central and Eastern Europe. Five regions are specified (Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Southern Germany) for which a set of competitive routes are identified. Due to the far location of this hinterland the entire transport chains need to be studied in order to estimate the competitiveness in these regions. The model developed in this thesis aims to address the concept of attractiveness by including the preferences of the port users who are responsible for the selection and integration of ports in its routes. In order to build a model that is suitable for this specific problem situation several a knowledge base is set in the conceptual development phase. The literature review sets a theoretical framework on how the model fits in existing literature and a background study results in a set of guidelines how to develop this model for this specific case. This study contributes to the existing literature by 1) estimating the competitiveness over the entire transport chain for specific regions, and 2) developing a methodology and measurement tool for port selection that addresses the importance of both port competition and port attractiveness. Understanding this decision-making process opens new strategic windows for the Port of Rotterdam to target expansion strategies more precisely on where the most added value is achieved. A few steps are followed in order to produce the model. First the context is defined by specifying a set of stakeholders – in this case the main decision makers when it comes to route choice –, a set of criteria – defined over the entire transport chain – on which the set of alternative – in this case the competitive routes – can be compared. The data collection consists of three important elements, 1) collecting data for the quantitative criteria, 2) collecting data for the qualitative criteria, and 3) collecting data for estimation of the weights. The first is done by approaching chain actors to get real data for quantification of criteria and performing research, while the data of the second two elements is done through a survey among the three main decision makers (freight forwarders, shippers and carriers). The weighting of the criteria is done by applying the Best Worst Method. This method is chosen due to its ability to produce reliable results with a minimum amount of comparison data. These three data elements serve as input for the actual model developed to calculate the attractiveness per route. For each region a ranking is given based on this level of attractiveness. Before the actual strategies are specified first a sensitivity analysis is performed on the weights and a few possible future scenarios are tested. These future scenarios are developed such that they link back to the motivation of the port of Rotterdam to conduct this study. For each region a strategy is defined where the tactics for improvements are targeted such that after implementation Rotterdam becomes the most attractive for these regions. Based on the degree of complexity the regions are set in a sequence that is recommended for the implementation. The thesis concludes with a discussion on how the model performs relating to existing literature and to what extend it fits in the current literature. The recommendations involve suggestions for the Port of Rotterdam for further research","port selection; port attractiveness; port competition; transport chain approach; best worst method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics",""

(mentor); Song, Y. (mentor)","2016","This report provides details of the embodiment design process, including analysis, ideation, development and validation, of a 3D hand scanner. 3D scanning, the process of creating a digital 3D model of a physical object, has opened up new possibilities for personalised products and improved diagnostics in healthcare. Since the hand poses unique challenges for 3D scanning, Delft University of Technology together with Vectory3 have invested in the development of a 3D hand scanner. This collaboration has already resulted in a technological proof of concept. However the technology needed to be brought to a user context. Through analysis, promising applications were identified in the areas of anthropometry, orthopaedics and rehabilitation. These applications and their contexts offered a framework of requirements for the embodiment design. Based on the various contexts, a simple to use product appearing somewhat medical while remaining colourful and friendly was envisioned. In-context observations and usage research were used to design a simple scanning workflow that fits all application areas. This workflow and its interactions were verified in subsequent usage research. Moreover, two studies, on light transmission and emission respectively, provide recommendations on the construction, materials and light source of the soft box. Around this, a dense internal component layout was developed allowing a compact design. Using a range of mood boards, sketches and models, the product’s outer appearance was shaped in line with the product vision. Both interaction and form were finally validated in usage research by means of a rapid working prototype. Once the core scanning technology is sufficiently developed it can be integrated into the embodiment design. It is recommended to then optimise the design and start the process of certification for use in medical environments. Moreover, it should be recognised that in order to deliver a strong product an additional design effort should focus on the post-scanning process, including data retrieval and (post-)processing.","3D scanning; handscanning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2016","BMW Motorrad’s ambition is widening the appeal of the brand and product desirability without losing their premium (successful) core values such as safety, quality and precision. The premium brand is very successful, benefiting from a large tech and manufacturing scope, and enjoying a strong synergy between BMW Automobiles, Motorcycles and Riders clothing. However, serving a customer demographic of over 40 years old, the industry is facing a shrinking market that needs to invest in a younger demographic of customers. This thesis is about exploring a projective target group and developing a proposal for BMW Motorrad to use to kickstart possible future innovation projects that support their brandpromise ""Make Life a Ride"". Current driving forces for the motorcycle industry are mainly depending on (European) legislation laws, the need for safety and expansions towards emerging markets. Therefore bandwidth of motorcycle capacity is growing: from extreme superbikes to under 500cc engines will be both highly competitive segments. Other trends to be expected are: more safety innovations, also through other hardware that elevate bike interaction and experience to new levels. Electric vehicle development seems to go slower than expected, but also this area is promising. The yearly motorcycle exhibition EICMA in Milano showed a rather conservative industry, reviving a nostalgic atmosphere that dates back to the romantic era of retro bikes, and puts style in the lights. Furthermore manufacturers are trying to create ‘entry ladders’ to their brand - providing access to younger riders - through small engined and easy-to-ride motorcycles, and a strong focus on design and styling. Parallel to these trends one can state that the young generation is not automatically exposed to riding motorcycles once allowed. It is also a generation that grew up in an environment that stimulates control and safety (where motorcycling is seen as a risky thing). Riding also seems to be more of a hobby than a basic mean of transport - in a Western understanding - and for which the financial costs make it hardly accessible for the young. How could a premium brand like BMW Motorrad still create a desirability amongst this target group? In this context, BMW Motorrad’s opportunity for growth lies in exploring an overlooked targetgroup: potential riders and in ‘entrants’ (beginning riders). Potential riders in this case are defined in three subgroups of people that (assumingly) hold the most motivation to get into motorcycling, but still need a last push: Scooterists, Thrill sports and Urban hoppers. Designprinciples have been set up than serve as designcriteria to cater to this targetgroup: “Empower me”, “Hop on & Go”, “Connect me” and “Be With Me”. Secondly, reasons have been extracted for which why these potentials are not riding yet: mainly because they either do not trust themselves in riding, or do not trust others in traffic. Lastly, a concept has been developed that lowers the entry barriers to motorcycling, and could give potential riders a hand in to getting a taste, and be attracted eventually. It will allow BMW Motorrad to put itself in a leading position in the market, and invest in a sustainable long term orientation.","customer research; BMW Motorrad; drivers of innovation; potential riders; motorcycling experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Turboprop aircraft achieve higher propulsive efficiencies at lower speeds due to their engine’s ability to accelerate a high mass flow of air at low jet velocities. With the increased importance of environmental considerations in aircraft design, aircraft manufacturers are forced to open up the considered speed domain since a reduction in cruise speed can lead to savings in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, it becomes increasingly relevant to investigate the potential benefits of applying turboprop engines in regional aircraft design. It is the objective of this research study to explore the regional aircraft design space of direct operating cost and Mach number by performing multi-disciplinary optimization on both turboprop and turbofan aircraft configurations while including mission profile parameters as design variables. In total, three regional aircraft configurations are considered in this master thesis, differentiating themselves based on the configuration lay-out and type of engine application: a low-wing turbofan, a high-wing turbofan and a high-wing turboprop configuration. The latter configuration requires the implementation of a methodology to size, locate and scale the nacelle, where no landing gear is stored, while the leading-edge high lift devices for both high-wing configurations are redefined to accommodate the engine presence in front of the wing. All aircraft configurations are equipped with an advanced engine concept, having an entry-into-service year of 2025. Furthermore, a range equal to 1950 nautical miles and a payload of 70 passengers are imposed on all regional aircraft configurations. At the same time, three off-design missions are constructed in order to assess the range sensitivity of the design space. Due to the variety in encountered cruise Mach numbers and altitudes throughout this study, a method is introduced to determine the mission profile parameters of an aircraft design, cruising at any possible combination of Mach number and altitude. Next to the definition of the regional aircraft configurations and the mission requirements, a model is developed within a multi-disciplinary optimization environment, able to evaluate the performance of turboprop engines by means of a Fortran code which predicts the propeller efficiency at every flight condition. After having validated the developed model, empirical relationships to estimate the propeller mass and engine maintenance cost are added, resulting from an assessment of different methodologies. Also, an approximation of a take-off strategy to improve the field performance of the high-wing turboprop configuration is implemented, based on a ‘rolling take-off’ procedure where the power setting is gradually increased during take-off. For a baseline fuel cost of 3 dollars per gallon, the optimal design for each range is found to be a low-wing turbofan configuration, operating at or near Mach 0.80. At a range equal to 1950 nautical miles, a 4.5% advantage in direct operating cost is achieved by this configuration compared to the most optimal high-wing turboprop design. When the fuel price is simulated to increase, the minimum direct operating cost design among all ranges shifts to the high-wing turboprop configuration, exemplified by a 3.8% decrease in direct operating cost over the most optimal low-wing turbofan design, for a fuel price of 6 dollars per gallon and a range equal to 300 nautical miles. It is therefore concluded that a potential for turboprop applications exists in regional aircraft design, considering the expected rise in fuel cost over the next years.","engine comparison; regional aircraft; multi-disciplinary optimization; design space exploration; propeller performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-19","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

With unknown amounts of sediment, stored in the banks and in local bars, all spread over this long bedrock channel, local sediment transports are hard to predict. Especially, in the case of implementation of a dam, the reduction in available sediment and so the sediment transport is difficult to determine. In this research different Delft3D input is tested to model the reduction in sediment transport. The various options were the local change of roughness, change of threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to non-erodible layers, increasing the density (locally) of sediment, controlling the maximum erosion as percentage of the water depth and the local change of available sediment at the bed. This was all done using two different sediment transport formulations of Wilcock, both for sand-gravel mixtures. The best solution turned out to be the change of the threshold for sediment reduction for sediment close to non-erodible layers. However, disadvantage here, was the inability to change this parameter locally, to be able to determine where sediment buffers in the model are located.","Mekong River; bedrock channel; sand-gravel mixtures; sediment storage; Delft3D","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Oliveira Barbosa, J. (mentor); Van der Heiden, K. (mentor)","2016","In order for Jumbo to stay competitive in the offshore market, it's heavy lift vessels should be able to take on a wide range of lifting purposes. This can range from installation of transition pieces for wind turbines to installing modules of fpso's and platforms. One of the demands from the offshore market requires large lifting heights. It is proposed to increase the lifting height on existing mast cranes by increasing the pedestal by 10 meters. In this thesis it is tried to answer the question whether this is feasible. The pedestal should be increased such that it complies with geometric constraints, stability, vessel motions and structural integrity. This feasibility study is divided in two parts. In the first part it is investigated how the enhanced pedestal influences the vessel with regards to hydrostatic characteristics and vessel motions. This information is used to obtain the changed workability of the vessel. Stability characteristics were slightly worse compared to the original vessel layout. As a result of this the maximum offshore lifting capacity decreased from 648 ton to 580 ton at an outreach of 36.5m as measured from the centerline of the vessel. For three crane configurations the hydrostatic values were obtained and served as input for the vessel motion analysis. Since the Jumbo Javelin heavy lift vessel is equipped with a DP-2 system, only first order motions needed to be taken into account. The motions or Response Amplitude Operators (RAO's) express the ratio of the vessel motion amplitudes with the amplitudes of the incoming waves. In all crane configurations, the natural period shifted upwards. From all six degrees of freedom, the roll motion was the largest which is explained by the fact that roll has very little potential damping (energy transfer from ship motion to fluid motion). The final evaluation consisted of a workability study, expressed by the percentage of time that the vessel is able to operate in different sea states. Workability remained similar to the workability of the original vessel in cases where Jumbo performed operations before. A check for North sea circumstances led to an increased workability. This is due to the fact that the natural frequency of the enhanced vessel went further away from the most common sea states. In the second part of this study the pedestal is evaluated structurally. A pedestal geometry is chosen such that it resists normal bending stresses by using the least amount of material. The Fatigue limit stress was taken as the limiting value. In this way an optimal tapered pedestal shape was chosen with varying wall thicknesses ranging from 6.25cm till 4.85cm along the height of the pedestal. The obtained shape is further processed by studying the natural frequencies of the pedestal including the mast and jib. Ship motions should not interfere with natural frequencies of the crane structure due to the effects of resonance which could lead to disproportionate stresses. To study this a finite element model is created using MATLAB that can include the effects of pedestal taper, crane components and DOF's for different jib angles. Planar motions for a plane frame are considered. 6 DOF's for each element are considered and hence represent elements that take both bending and compression. Natural frequencies for two operating conditions and one stowed condition with tip mass are investigated. The lowest observed frequency has a value of 1.39 rad/s. While the lowest natural frequency of vessel motions considered in the workability study is 1.25 rad/s. This led to the conclusion that the improved pedestal geometry and stiffness are sufficient and hence workable.","offshore; heavy; lift; stability; motions; pedestal; crane; natural; frequencies; vessel; structural; workability; feasibility; jib; boom","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Dodou, D. (mentor)","2016","In many percutaneous interventions, such as biopsies and brachytherapy, accuracy in reaching a speciﬁc target inside the human body is necessary for the success of the procedure. Maneuvering to the target site is challenging, particularly if sensitive structures such as blood vessels have to be avoided. For maneuvering along a curved trajectory, ﬂexible steerable needles have been introduced. However, since needles generally require a push force to be advanced into the tissue, the ﬂexible nature of steerable needles makes them prone to buckling. Moreover, many steerable needles require rotation for maneuvering in a 3D space, causing needle twisting which makes accurate control of the needle challenging. In this study, a novel approach for the design of a ﬂexible needle inspired by the egg-laying channel (‘ovipositor’) of parasitic wasps is proposed which addresses the aforementioned steering and buckling challenges while being small enough to be used in biopsy and brachytherapy procedures. This approach has led to the development of a six-segmented needle prototype designed to be both steerable in 3D without the need for rotation and devoid of the need for an axial push force for insertion into tissue thereby eliminating the risk of needle buckling. Experimental validation of our Ø 1.2 mm needle prototype in porcine gelatin specimen showed promising results, with steering curvatures of 0.018 1/cm achievable; yet further reﬁnement of the design and experimental setup is necessary for a conclusive experimental assessment of the needle prototype.","steerable needles; medical needles; solid-tissue; biologically inspired design","en","student report","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis proposes a product-service-system for Lens-Energie bv. Lens is a Dutch company that provides solar panels to renters in apartment buildings. Their current product benefits from the current net-metering legislation in the Netherlands. Since its is expected that this legislation will be changed in the near future, a new product is required. The financial benefit of feeding electricity back into the grid will be significant lower under the expected new legislation. A future proof product or system allows these renters to use their own generated electricity rather than selling it back to the grid. The process consists out of four phases: Analysis, Ideation, Conceptualization & Implementation In the analysis phase, an internal analysis of the company and the market was performed. This showed that the current competitive position of Lens is strong but not sustainable because of the dependence on the net-metering legislation. An external analysis on technology showed how Demand Side Management can limit the share of generated energy that has to be fed back into the grid by using buffers and so-called timeshifters. These buffers include home battery systems, electrical vehicles and heat pumps, while the timeshifters include white goods like smart washing machines, dryers and dishwashers. A SWOT analysis showed how this leads to opportunities for Lens to build a product-service-system with demand side management. In the Ideation phase, four different conceptual product-technical-systems were designed: a battery system, a timeshifter system, a heat-pump system and an electric vehicle system. Besides their technical performance in buffering or time shifting, they were assessed on their business potential. This was done by a stakeholder analysis. In the stakeholder analysis, the needs and assets of the different network actors per product-technical-system were mapped and matched. This showed different synergies per product-technical-system. The synergies from the timeshifter system showed the highest business potential for Lens and was therefore selected for further development. A user study led to the desired interaction between the user and the system. This also showed the need for a central service provider. In the Conceptualization phase, the service and the business model of the PSS were designed. Service blueprints showed show how Lens and the other network actors need to collaborate to deliver the right service and user experience in challenging situations. The business model was subsequently designed along four characteristics: Network actors, Customer value proposition, Key processes and Profit formulas. This resulted in a comprehensive business model with four revenue streams: leasing PV-systems, leasing white goods, data sales and offering additional products and services. In the Implementation phase, the PSS was analyzed. The risks were identified and an implementation plan was developed. A stage gate model in this implementation plan limits the risk of costs getting out of control by providing clear go/no-go evaluation points in the development. The evaluation suggests that further implementation of the product-service-system can provide a sustainable competitive advantage for Lens.","smart-grid; demand side response; energy; internet of things; sustainability; solar power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Although the importance of baggage handling systems is not widely recognised by its many daily users, they are a critical part of airports. A passenger only experiences handing in baggage and reclaiming it, but there is more than meets the eye. In these complex systems, baggage is collected from multiple sources, sorted, stored and redistributed. This is achieved by different devices which are connected to one another. As population growth and urbanisation are maintained, centralised around Asia and Africa, the demand for air traffic and baggage handling increases. Since no specific design process for baggage handling systems has been found in literature and design choices are based on designer intuition, the following research question is proposed: How may key performance indicators be determined for baggage handling system concept designs based on flight schedule demand? Defining a design process is crucial to this research question. A literature survey has shown a total of six design methods that may be applicable to baggage handling system concept design. To determine which method is preferred, eleven criteria are defined and ranked by baggage handling system experts in a pairwise manner with use of the analytic hierarchy process. Independently, the design methods are compared to one another in a pairwise manner on each of the eleven criteria. By multiplying both the criteria ranking and the method ranking, it becomes clear that the design method by Pielage (2005) is preferred. This preference is also verified by performing a sensitivity analysis. Results for this analysis are depicted in Table 1. As a generic model for baggage handling systems is not found in literature, six cases are assessed to determine the system boundaries, functions and interconnections. Defining these properties is part of the first three process steps in Pielage's design method. The remaining two steps, simulation and evaluation, have not been conducted. The generic model for baggage handling systems that follows from applying the selected design method is illustrated in Figure 1. A digitalised version of the model is programmed in Microsoft Office Excel and the functionality of the program has been verified by comparing manually calculated outputs and model outputs. It should be noted that this is only done for manually verifiable inputs. To assess the practical applicability of the design process and model, two case studies have been performed with data from design cases. The first case shows that there is a difference between the model-generated concept and the company-developed concept. However when disregarding the sorting function, both systems are fairly similar. In the second case, both the model-generated and company-developed concepts did not show similarities. A possible explanation for this difference may be found in several missing requirements. In both cases, design time was reduced when using Pielage's design method. The significance of this result cannot be tested as only two case studies have been conducted. The conclusion that may be drawn from this research is that Pielage's design method, as preferred by experts, is suitable for application in the baggage handling system concept design phase. Assessment of several design cases shows recurring functions from which a generic model may be established. Preliminary results on the model's application in two design cases are promising however, more design cases are necessary to either fully validate or reject the model. With this conclusion this research contributes to concept design theory for baggage handling systems. The design method and model may be generalisable for both postal and parcel systems, as these systems show similarities to baggage handling systems on functionality, connectivity and integral parts. Future research may further elaborate on this insight.","airport baggage handling system concept design method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The CubeSat platform has long since its introduction surpassed its original intend of being an educational and technology demonstration platform only. The recognition and acknowledgement of its potential has led to an everlasting hunger for more performance, which translates directly into a demand for more power. The power density of CubeSats is rapidly increasing leading to thermal hotspots that can be destructive for any CubeSat mission. The solution proposed to cope with this increase in power density is the water heat pipe: A two-phase, passive thermal control device that is able to transport a large amount of heat without introducing a large thermal gradient over the heat source and sink. For CubeSat application performance characterization tests have been carried out including investigation on its behaviour when bent, tilted against gravity, and frozen. Tests were carried out with commercial copper heat pipes with a diameter of 6mm and 200mm in length (fitting the CubeSat’s structural dimensions) for three different wick structures; axial grooved, mesh, and sintered. The results showed that the axial grooved and sintered heat pipes were easily capable of transporting more than the expected heat loads (10W OAP) for nextgeneration CubeSats without introducing large thermal gradients between heat source and sink. The performance of heat pipes is characterized by an increase in heat transfer coefficient for higher heat pipe temperatures, while at temperatures below the freezing point of water only pure copper conduction remains. Successful start-up from the frozen state was accomplished while repetitive freeze/thaw cycling showed no internal or external damage. Finally, CubeSat integration tests showed that the heat pipe was able to achieve ?T reduction of 45.6°C for a heat load of 3W. It also proved to be successful in removing a continuous 10W heat input, while keeping the PCB chip temperature within limits. The critical aspect in integrating a heat pipe in the CubeSat platform is attaining an efficient heat transfer between the heat pipe and the source and sink. For this, a proper design is necessary to reduce the thermal gradients between these interfaces. Furthermore, the heat pipe is perfect for heat transport but will create a hotspot at the chosen heat sink element of the CubeSat if no other thermal control mechanisms are involved which is able to remove this heat from the satellite.","heat pipes; CubeSat; thermal control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Military operations have over the last years become more dependent on communication, navigation and intelligence through satellites. In order to expand space activities in the future and to make more informed decisions on space projects, it was decided that the Royal Netherlands Air Force will perform a pathfinder mission. This thesis investigates the options and return for such a pathfinder mission. From a variety of possible mission applications, ionospheric disturbance monitoring was selected. The mission addresses a current issue; signal fades of navigation and communication links in the hours after sunset. Plasma bubbles are causing signal distortion, which is called ionospheric scintillation. Scintillation is noticeable on GNSS signals, but is much more severe at lower frequencies such as UHF. On these lower frequencies, used by the military for satellite communication, scintillation can lead to signal disturbances or fades of up to 50 dB. Widely available GNSS signals can be used for detecting scintillation, but are only a good scintillation indicator for the 1.2 or 1.5 GHz frequency bands. Whether GNSS and UHF signals are distorted, and how severely this disturbance is, depends on the scale lengths inside the ionospheric irregularity. A nanosatellite provides an excellent platform for doing in situ ionospheric measurements and to determine these scale lengths. A combination of a sweeping Langmuir probe, a fixed bias Langmuir probe and an impedance probe was found to be able to provide the required plasma parameters. When the RNLAF chooses to select this mission concept, the variability of the ionosphere and the influence this has on the data return, should be taken into account. The probability of occurrence in a solar minimum year, such as 2018, is expected to be low. An orbit analysis model has shown that a 400 day mission can provide up to 0.68 ionospheric disturbance measurements per day on average. The gathered data will contribute to the characterization of ionospheric scintillation and provide the RNLAF with a means of correlating GNSS and UHF disturbances.","nanosatellite; ionosphere; scintillation; systems engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

Schiphol Group realized that to become Europe’s preferred airport with AAS, involving the passenger experience in improvements at the airport is necessary. One of Schiphol Group's solutions to realize this is by expanding the current airport with a new area, named the A-area. This A-area is a greenfield that not only solves the capacity problems at AAS, but also creates opportunities to apply innovations. This resulted in the following research question: “What are the innovations within the passenger journeys at the A-area of AAS and how can an innovation and a roadmap to implementing it be designed?” This research question is answered by looking into four sub questions that are described below. As an airport it can be difficult to determine where possible opportunities lie to apply innovations. For Schiphol Group to make a deliberate decision on innovations, it is therefore first of all important to understand why innovations are necessary. Innovations for Schiphol Group are necessary for three reasons: 1) improving the passenger experience, 2) adapting to context developments and trends that will be of great importance in the future and 3) to differentiate in the market. These three fields will contribute to the main ambition of ‘becoming Europe’s preferred airport’. Through combining the insights of the three fields, the current situation is translated into the ideal future for passengers at the A-area. This is possible with the use of the essence element of the ViP approach (Hekkert & van Dijk, 2014), which looks for possible futures. This ideal future for the passengers is visualized in the form of future passenger journeys based on the customer journey mapping framework (Abbing, 2010), where the change of touchpoints is triggered by the passenger experiences, context and competition. With the context themes as a basis for the innovations at the A-area, a shortlist with innovations for the A-area is developed in three steps. First, all ideas on possible innovations are collected internally and externally, to obtain as many ideas on possible innovations as possible. Second, a selection map is developed that determines when an innovation lies within the scope of the A-area. Finally, of all possible ideas for innovations the ones for the A-area are selected through the use of the selection map. This shortlist answers the first part of the research question; thus explaining what innovations around the passenger at the A-area could be made. According to the shortlist with innovations, one of the areas of the passenger journey in which innovations can be made is baggage reclaim. Baggage reclaim can be innovated on, as the current passenger experience involving baggage claim is unsatisfactory. Others also notice this unpleasant passenger experience; expert predicts that baggage reclaim will be radically changed within twenty years (Passenger Terminal World, 2014) and new initiatives will arise like Travel Light that provide a door-to-door baggage service. These trends and developments will eventually result in a future situation where passengers have two choices to reclaim their baggage: 1) door-to-door service of baggage and 2) baggage pick-up at the airport. For Schiphol Group to improve the passenger experience around baggage reclaim at the airport, four bottlenecks should be addressed. These four bottlenecks are combined in one design goal: Design a baggage reclaim with a 1) more efficient process that is able to 2) send personal baggage information to passengers within a reclaim 3) atmosphere and 4) facilities that are a pleasant experience for passengers. This design goal is further developed into two interrelated concepts to improve the passenger experience around baggage reclaim. The development of these concepts, together with an implementation roadmap answer the second part of the research question. The iBag is a proven-concept solution for the lack of information regarding baggage towards passengers, as it is able to provide passengers with personal real-time information about their piece of baggage through the use of RFID technology and a cloud service system. The other three of the bottlenecks that cause the bad passenger experience within baggage reclaim are the process, the atmosphere and the facilities. The Self-Service Dropout Point (SSDOT) is based on proven-technology and solves these tree bottlenecks. A more efficient process is reached by substituting most of the tasks of baggage handlers by the baggage system. A pleasant atmosphere combined with facilities that form a pleasant experience for passengers is reached by merging the reclaim area with the Schiphol Plaza through a virtual customs border. An implementation roadmap is developed for the next seven years to implement both concepts. For the iBag it is possible to be implemented before 2018, as it is a proven concept and the tracking aspect is required from 2018 onwards according to the aviation policy of IATA resolution 753 (IATA, n.d.). The two major steps for Schiphol Group to implement the iBag are: getting an internal agreement on the implementation of the iBag and making agreements with the airlines about the bag tags with RFID. For the SSDOT there are still seven years to prove that the new combination of proven-technology works. These seven years are enough when using co-creation with stakeholders from the beginning on and start with the further elaboration of the business case. With a quick start to further developing these innovations, AAS can reach a competitive advantage and get a step closer to becoming Europe's preferred airport. Overall, something needs to change around baggage reclaim, which will only be achieved through the start of a project to further elaborate possibilities to solve the bottlenecks around baggage reclaim for passengers. The A-area is a greenfield that creates possibilities for innovations, which Schiphol Group can take advantage of to improve AAS overall.","design; baggage; schiphol; future; innovation; passenger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Sylvester, S. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis revolves around the development of a personal alarm device for lone workers. A lone worker is somebody who is regularly isolated from their colleagues, without direct supervision. This includes people who often work in isolation, like electricians and warehouse employees. But a worker does not need to be alone in order to be considered a ‘lone worker’. A nurse who is regularly alone with their patients is also considered a lone worker, since there are no colleagues in their direct vicinity. Compared to regular workers lone workers are more vulnerable to (the consequences of) aggression, accidents and illnesses. The main reason for that fact is that they inherently face a number of factors that create both physical and figurative distance between them and potential sources of help. This means that it will take longer for potential sources of help to notice that anything is wrong at all or to reach the lone worker’s location. If a nurse is attacked by an aggressive patient while they are alone together in a room, their colleagues might be physically near but the figurative distance between them can be huge. The thesis discusses various subjects related to lone workers and their safety, including: aggression, accidents & illness, privacy. The final product is a wearable personal alarm device that is connected to a smartphone. It allows lone workers to call for help whenever they need to. It aims to improve both the objective and the perceived safety of lone workers. The device is connected to a network of lone workers within an organisation, and can be used to send and receive alarm pulses that any nearby lone worker will feel through haptic feedback. The alarm pulses contain information on the urgency of the alarm pulse and the identity and location of the alarm maker. The alarm always escalates to the best available source of help. If a colleague is in the vicinity of the alarm maker, the alarm will escalate to them, allowing them to help each other out. If there are no colleagues nearby the alarm escalates to an Alarm Receiving Centre (ARC), run by a third party security company. This ARC is specialised in responding to incidents remotely, and will dispatch the most appropriate source of help.","wearable; accidents & illnesses; aggression; alarm; concept design; emergency; haptic feedback; incidents; lone workers; objective safety; perceived safety; personal alarm device; privacy; protection; safety; security; senses; smartwatch; ViP; vision in product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

As an engineering medium, biology poses some challenges that are different to building with electronic or mechanical systems. Problems such as infection, cell growth, and evolution are all significant when dealing with living cells. Currently, the vast majority of biology protocols require large amounts of manual work, this is slow and labour intensive. Additionally, a laboratory is required to perform even the most basic synthetic biology, limiting its potential user base significantly. The Rapid Gene Prototyper (RGP) makes synthetic biology simpler. A single-use chip is preloaded with all the chemicals that are need to test DNA circuits.

It was also clear that with increasing cover the amount of steel needed for crack width control in the Eurocode 2 calculations increased substantially compared to the VBC 1995 calculations.

The evolution of the superconducting phase at the LAO/STO(111) interface is under investigation. The superconducting phase is observed to be gate tunable and, at optimal doping, the BKT temperature, the maximum critical current and the critical magnetic field are observed to be ~70 mK, ~ 200 nA and ~21 mT, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that interface conduction can be modelled by a random array of Josephson junctions formed by superconducting puddles due to the inhomogeneous character of the interface.","superconductivity; complex oxides; interface; LaAlO3; SrTiO3; magnetotransport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Applied Physics","","","",""

As such, the company intends to explore the possibilities of an ownerless product; one that can be shared without the need for active human intervention. Due to the nature of the platform, this holds the potential to spawn an entirely new product category. The Incredible Machine was given the task to explore the potential of ownerless products with a sharable drill concept. The project started with an experiment to measure the viability of a product that is shared by people with relations and moves from person to person. A cordless drill was modified with an activity sensor and a GPS tracker and offered on Peerby to be shared in Amsterdam. Users were instructed to use the drill and share it with others whenever there was demand. The collection sensoric input was to explore the possibility of charging users for active use of the product. The experiment ended with only one person having used the drill, despite having multiple people queued up for it. Planning appointments with other users proved to be problematic. It became clear that for such a product to be effective, it should address these issues first. When these issues were put into perspective, it was appearent that an ownerless, sharable product does not require modifications using modern technology. In fact, it would only be more costly to do so. Instead, a method for planning and communication was developed that would solve these issues more effectively. Additionally, the scope of the service was widened by by focussing on the power tools category. This makes Mesh’ product offering more diverse, while at the same time keeping it specific enough so that customers can fit Mesh into a familiar context. A second experiment was done to see if people would be able to share a drill under more controlled conditions. Participants were given the task to drill a hole with a drill that they would have to acquire using a web application. From this experiment, a proposal for Mesh as a service was developed, along with a prototype for planning and communication.","power tools; product sharing; ownerless products; user experience; product-service systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Naaijen, P. (mentor); De Vos, P. (mentor); Hoogendoorn, B. (mentor)","2016","Heerema Marine Contractors is constructing a new semi-submersible crane vessel, the Sleipnir. Due to low initial stability, semi-submersibles may present significant wave induced resonant motions in heave, roll and pitch. For practical reasons, especially the roll motion could play a limiting factor for future lift operations of the Sleipnir. In order to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the Sleipnir, model tests in waves have been performed atMaritime Research Institute Netherlands. In the tested sea states low frequent second order roll has been observed. In order to evaluate the impact of the low frequent motions of the Sleipnir it is important to create an accurate (low frequent) simulation model. The aim of this thesis is to investigate if a low frequency roll motion simulation model, in the frequency and time domain, can be created. It is challenging to predict the low frequent second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements due to two main non-linear phenomenons. In the first place, the (viscous) roll damping is considered to be non-linear. In the second place, the second order wave forces in the vertical plane, which have not been investigated extensively in the past, are non-linear phenomena. A calculation method in order to simulate the low frequency roll motions is created. This simulation method makes use of a first and second order hydrodynamic date base, first and second order moment spectra and a moment transfer function in order to define the roll motion spectrum. In order to implement viscous roll damping in the frequency domain method, a linearization of the roll damping is necessary. First empirical linear viscous damping values have been obtained for the three tested sea states. The frequency domain method predicts the roll motion energy in good agreement with the measurements, using the empirical linear viscous roll damping values, for the three tested sea states. In order to predict the low frequent roll motions for any sea state, a calculation scheme is proposed. In this calculation scheme, a linear roll damping prediction method based on linearization techniques, is incorporated. However, the investigated linearization techniques do not predict the linear viscous damping in agreement with the measurements. The energy in the rollmotion response spectrumis highly dependent on the amount of added viscous damping in the calculation. Therefore, it will be hard, due to inaccurate linear viscous damping predictions assigned to the linearization techniques, to estimate the low frequency second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements. In the time domain simulations non-linear viscous damping terms are incorporated by means of a linear and quadratic damping coefficient. Still water decay test simulations show a very good agreement with the measurements when using damping coefficients obtained from decay tests. However, the statistics of the simulated model tests are not in exact agreement with statistics of the model tests. Possible causes for this mismatch are discussed. It must be noted that the time domain simulations have been validated with only one sea state. It is recommended to validate the time domain model for more sea states. Although the model tests and simulation methods show significant second order roll motions, which are undesirable for performing a heavy lift, it must be realized that a combination of the tested conditions (very low initial stability, long crested beam waves) will be very rare during a future heavy lift of the Sleipnir. Additionally it is noted, that the tested sea states exceed the typical heavy lift operability limit, used by Heerema.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-06-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Ship Hydromechanics & Structures","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

Human activities in coastal regions require a steady environment. Usually the dredging industry is contacted for coastal maintenance. Knowledge about the time development of sediment volume changes in specific regions is necessary for risk assessment in contracting. Nearly a century of available bathymetric data of the Dutch coastal zone can be used. Two different approaches of calculations of sediment volume changes are currently available from literature. Both are mainly manual calculations and they do not generate confidence bands. We set out to create two automated approaches, to analyse sediment volume changes with confidence bands. Development consisted of four steps: First, the two manual approaches were re-implemented as automated approaches. Unavailable data were calculated with a systematic and transparent algorithm filling the gaps in space and time. Second, the automated approaches were validated by 16 different unit tests with synthetic data. The difference between the calculations of the synthetic data, manual compared to automated-approaches, were acceptably small, demonstrating the validity of the automated approaches. Third, uncertainty was added to the automated approaches. Every step in the calculations to fill data gaps was identified and an uncertainty element added. This element merely points out the amount of uncertainty of the data. It is not a probabilistic uncertainty. Fourth, the automated approaches with confidence bands were used for various Dutch coastal regions as case studies to show differences with the two manual approaches from literature. These new automated approaches of sediment volume changes are validated, every step is transparent and reproducible and it generates confidence bands of the calculated data. Therefore it is a valuable additional input for risk assessment in contracting for coastal maintenance.","coastal maintenance; volume analysis; sediment budget","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Present SPECT with traditional collimators lack sensitivity to achieve sufficiently high frame rates. In this project a multi-slit SPECT system with stationary detectors was designed to track nanoparticles with a frame rate of 1000 frames per minute and a precision down to ~1 mm in a mouse-sized field of view (Ø25mmx100mm). The SPECT system used has three large gamma detectors in a stationary triangular configuration. A 198Au nanoparticle of 5 µm diameter can be activated as high as ~20 kBq and is inert in an aqueous solution, which makes it very suitable for in-vivo particle tracking. To track such a particle, a collimator system with four slits in the axial direction and one slit in the transversal plane was designed with a total sensitivity of 0.25%. Through each slit the particle gives a line-shaped response on a gamma camera. The position of the particle is found by solving the least squares solution of the intersection of the five planes defined by slits and the corresponding detector line responses. A particle tracking method with a Gaussian time window and interpolation between time frames with an insufficient number of counts is proposed. The design was experimentally evaluated by reconstructing the particle position at 448 positions in the field of view. Also, the trajectory was reconstructed of particle rotating with velocities between 6 mm/s and 20 mm/s. The position of a stationary 20 kBq source can be estimated with a precision of 0.1mm. A 20 kBq source moving at 6 mm/s could be tracked with a precision better than 2 mm at 1000 frames per minute. This is opening up possibilities for tracking single radioactive particles in small animals at high frame rates and a resolution close to a millimetre.","tracking; radioactive; particles; slits; slit-SPECT; VECTor; in-vivo; small animal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","RD&M","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Nano Filtration (NF) is an advanced treatment process that is able to remove molecules and ions from water using special, synthetic, membrane modules. Under high pressure the so– called feed water enters the membrane module. Part of the water, the permeate, passes through the membrane wall while the rejected ions and molecules are flushed out with the rest of the water, the concentrate. However, the ratio between product; the permeate, and waste; the concentrate, that can be attained with NF treatment is limited by the concentration of sparingly soluble salts in the feed water. When too much permeate is produced the concentrate stream becomes supersaturated, causing the salts to start precipitating on the membrane surface, a process called scaling. The scaling causes an increase in membrane resistance, necessitating a higher pressure, and thus more energy, to treat the same amount of water. There are several strategies to control scaling in membrane filtration installations such as feedwater alteration and antiscalant dosing, all of which aim to keep the salts dissolved for as long as possible. In this thesis a different approach to prevent scaling is proposed, aiming to promote precipitation instead, albeit in a controlled manner: precipitative antiscalants. Instead of precipitating on the membrane wall, the salts precipitate on special particles, which are transported out of the system with the waste stream. The dosing of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, was investigated as precipitative antiscalant for CaCO3 scaling. Ca(OH)2 particles exhibit a dissolve–precipitate effect, where CaCO3 precipitates on the dissolving particles, slowing down further dissolution. This effect is unwanted during application in other processes, but may prove of use as anti scaling mechanism. To better understand the mechanisms and kinetics involved with Ca(OH)2 dissolution in carbonate containing solutions a soft–sensor, capable of converting measured pH and EC to total calcium and carbonate, was developed and validated. Using this sensor it was found that, for high dosages of Ca(OH)2 , the formed layer of CaCO3 was unstable. After a certain length of time the covering layer breaks open, allowing the dissolution reaction to continue at its original rate. To investigate whether Ca(OH)2 dosing could function as antiscalant a pilot–plant installation, capable of simulating scaling on a flat–sheet polymeric NF membrane, was constructed. Dosing of Ca(OH)2 particles in combination with using a feed spacer proved problematic, as the particles got lodged between the spacers and could not be adequately removed. Without a feed spacer installed Ca(OH)2 dosing as antiscalant was a limited success. With little surface scaling taking place the runtime of the experiment could be extended from a mere 4.5 hours to over 24 hours. Excessive particulate fouling inside the pilot–plant, however, forced the experiment to be halted prematurely.

(mentor)","2016","We live in a world of connections where everything shares relationships like follow/subscribe in Social Network or protein interactions in Biology Network. A graph database embraces relationships and supports low-level join as its nature. Regular Path queries (RPQs) are queries run against graph database, which are written in the form of regular expressions based on edge labels and with strong flexibility and expressiveness. Unlike some graph databases where actual data stored and queried using standard relational mechanisms, in this thesis we investigate three distributed algorithms by storing graphs with NoSQL data model and evaluating RPQs with Apache Spark. The three algorithms are cascaded 2-way join, multi-way join and Dan Suciu’s Algorithm. The performance of them regarding to running time and network communication volume are compared, and main bottlenecks are identified. Dan Suciu’s algorithm shuffles the least data during evaluation, meanwhile the performance is heavily influenced by the ways of partitioning the graphs. In theory we found that the size of GAG (Global Accessible Graph) collected to driverside, which affects communication volume and computation scale on driver-side, is related to the number of input-nodes in distributed graph. So in this thesis project we also try to optimize the execution of Dan Suciu’s algorithm with various partition strategies such as METIS or JabeJa. Based on JabeJa, which tries to minimize the number of cross-edges, we propose a distributed algorithm JabeJa* to minimize the number of input-nodes in graph. In the best cases, those strategies can reduce the communication volume to 30%, driver-side compuation time to 30% and overall running time to 50%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

An outcrop study of low-sinuous deposits aims to provide a deterministic reservoir model that predicts correlation lengths, nesting and reservoir potential of thin-bedded fluvial reservoir sandstone in an overall low net-to-gross setting. To correlate the study area, centimetre accurate dGPS measurements of paleosols have been collected to calculate the tectonic dip. This was used to correlate lithostratigraphic logs of the area. Correlation lengths between wells are dependent on how spatial and continuous a paleosol has developed. Photo panels of the outcrop were analysed for net-to-gross ratio and distribution of channel and floodplain deposits. A clear distinction between high and low net-to-gross regions can be observed in the panels, which causes a lateral heterogeneity. This can be explained by the nesting of a river channel. Nesting can be caused by local avulsions triggered by crevasse splays of the river channel in combination with avulsion by annexation. The lateral heterogeneous character can have major implications on reservoir potential. The reservoir volume is dependent on the connectivity between the higher and lower net-to-gross regions. The heterogeneity also has an impact on reservoir modelling as there only is a limited subsurface expression from wells. Therefore, it cannot be known whether the higher or lower net-to-gross zones are being looked at for that particular fluvial system which makes estimates about reservoir volume difficult and inaccurate.","Geology; Fluvial; Thin-bedded Sandstones","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","Tough gas targeting through high-resolution geological characterization of fine-grained sedimentary rock",""

Therefore, a good understanding of these PD measurements is an essential part of an electrical engineer’s background knowledge. During this research project a PD test platform was designed and build for electrical PD detection. The setup included artificially created defects for six different types of PDs, with origins in positive and negative corona, internal discharge, floating electrodes, free-moving particles and surface discharge. These defects were designed to have a partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) of around 10kV, and could easily be connected or disconnected from the setup. Therefore, it was possible to measure individual defects or a combination of them. This PD test platform was used during this research project to characterize the different PD types (single and multiple), and as a check for testing new clustering and pattern recognition techniques. In addition, the platform could also be used as a test platform for educational purposes and to train people and test equipment. In this thesis research project, the “initial step” towards PD defect origin recognition for AC voltage without any phase dependency was conducted with the use of time-resolved partial discharge (TRPD) analysis. This thesis shows that it is possible to conduct the time analysis and recognition for AC voltage for the artificially created defects. From the analysis in this thesis, it can be concluded that the TRPD analysis for PD recognition under AC voltage is as good as, or even better than, phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) analysis. For most of the data analysed, the TRPD analysis provides the same results compared to the PRPD analysis. However, further checking is needed, such as validating the findings with mathematical models. The thesis goals are to build a setup suitable for the research, determining the optimal combination of hardware/software to discriminate among different types of defects, and to realize experiments to validate the design.","partial discharge; PRPD; TRPD; clustering; platform; PD measurements; pattern recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-05-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DC&ES","","","",""

The subject of this project is the integration of a glass structure into the main load bearing system of a high-rise building with the following configuration: • a concrete structure, 60 meters high • a glass structure, 10 meters high, upon the concrete structure • a steel/composite structure, at least 30 meters high, on top of the glass structure Therefore, the task was to design a glass structure that is able to withstand high stresses mainly due to increased gravity and wind loads and the interaction with the other parts of the building. Towards this goal, the shape for the high-rise building was chosen and the geometry of the main structural glass elements was designed. Laminated Heat Strengthened glass walls for maximum transparency and stacked float or cast glass columns bonded with a liquid adhesive interlayer for maximum load bearing capacity, constitute the main load bearing elements. One stacked float glass column consisting of float glass panels and bonded with an adhesive film and one stacked cast column consisting of solid cast glass blocks bonded with an adhesive interlayer, were tested in compression and comparisons were made in terms of stiffness, strength and failure mechanism. Safety concepts were developed that defined the measures which protect the main structural glass elements and ensure the structural integrity of the entire structure. A global model of the entire building was simulated with a FEM software (ANSYS) in linear elastic analysis using linear elements for the columns and 2D shell elements for the walls. Different load combinations and damage scenarios were investigated to obtain maximum principal stresses and deflections. Buckling calculations were conducted for the glass columns and walls by applying established analytical methods. Local models using 3D solid elements were also simulated to detect local stresses and investigate the PΔ effects on the main structural glass elements. The results of the simulations showed that with careful structural design and minimization of local stresses and imperfections, glass columns and walls have great potentials as structural elements.","structural glass; high-rise buildings; stacked column (float glass panels); brick column (solid cast glass blocks)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology & Physics","",""

(mentor); Schrijer, F.F.J. (mentor); Giepman, R.H.M. (mentor)","2016","Oblique Shock-Wave Reflections or Shock Wave-Boundary Layer interactions (SWBLI) are complex phenomena which commonly occur in high speed flight. SWBLIs can have catastrophic consequences on the aircraft due to shock induced separation and unsteadiness of the interaction. These adverse effects can be mitigated by manipulating the boundary layer, either before it enters the interaction, or in the interaction region itself. Micro-ramp vortex generators or micro-ramps have been identified as promising boundary layer control methods in supersonic engine intakes. They are small ramp devices with heights less than the boundary layer thickness (typically 50% of boundary layer thickness). It is known that, micro-ramps generate a counter-rotating vortex pair, due to which a fuller and more separation resistant boundary layer is obtained upstream of the SWBLI. They successfully prevent separation at their centrelines and their effectiveness reduces away from their centrelines. Since a micro-ramp generates a highly 3D flow, the main aim of this study is to quantify the 3D velocity fields in the micro-ramp controlled interaction. Further, this study is motivated by the fundamental question whether the total volume of separated flow in the interaction is reduced by employing micro-ramp control. The results from tomographic-PIV experiments confirm that micro-ramp control has a beneficial effect on SWBLI in reducing separation. For the experimental conditions and micro-ramp geometry used in this thesis, the total volume of separated flow is reduced to 31% compared to the interaction without control. Further, the maximum separation probability is also reduced by using micro-ramp control, with the largest reductions occurring along the micro-ramp centreline. Additionally, the findings indicate that a moderately negative correlation coefficient exists between separation bubble sizes at spanwise stations on either side of the micro-ramp centreline. This indicates that the separation bubble size at a particular spanwise location is coupled to its size at another spanwise location in the micro-ramp controlled interaction. Along with the 3D velocity fields in the interaction, these results extend the knowledge on micro-ramp control significantly. It is conjectured that the spanwise correlation between the separation bubble sizes may play an important role while using micro-ramp arrays for applications in supersonic engine intakes. Therefore, an immediate possible investigation would involve studies of 3D effects of micro-ramp array control and the spanwise correlation of the separation bubble sizes.","shock wave-boundary layer interactions; shock waves; vortex generators; micro-ramp vortex generators; shock induced separation; tomographic-PIV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor); De Wolff, H.W. (mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Schenk, M. (mentor)","2016","Since the 1990’s Dutch municipalities successfully invested in land development, which turned into a profitable undertaking (Groetelaers, 2013). Municipalities that invested a lot in land development formerly could rely on future profits from a booming housing market. The impact of the financial crisis on the land and housing markets changed this situation dramatically and brought great financial problems to a lot of Dutch municipalities. Large scale land acquisitions involve great financial risks. The financial crisis showed that generally, municipalities were not able to manage these risks sufficiently (Groetelaers, 2012, 2013). Despite the increased risk awareness that the financial crisis raised in most municipalities, the risk management of land development activities needs improvement. The main reason is that in any case it is undesirable that municipalities face the same scenario as during the financial crisis of 2008 and once again have to take major losses on development projects that started years ago. When a municipality ends up in financial problems this could have severe financial consequences for society. An increased financial burden for local citizens through higher taxes and less financial resources that are available for social serves both are possible consequences for society. The question remains whether the increased risk awareness among most municipalities is enough to avoid a similar scenario as during the crisis. Their lies a danger that municipalities will fall into their old pattern again when the economy recovers. The risk awareness of municipalities may have increased the past few years, but has to be shaped for the future. Because of this reason, it is important to investigate the possibilities for Dutch municipalities to become more in control of their financial position. Municipalities need to embed risk management in their organization and land development processes in order to improve their risk management of land development activities and gain more control over their financial position. This led to the following research question: What are the elements and requirements of good risk management that a municipality has to implement to deal knowingly and adequately with future risks concerning land development, so that they gain more control over their financial position? In order to answer this research question, several research methods have been used: - A literature study to find the principles of ‘good’ risk management regarding land development. - A desk research to identify the legal framework regarding risk management of land development in which municipalities currently have to operate. - A municipality scan, consisting of a selection procedure of Dutch municipalities and a desk research, to analyze how risk management of land development activities comes to expression in the risk reporting of Dutch municipalities and find suitable municipalities for a case study research. - A case study research at four Dutch municipalities to learn how risk management of land development is organized in practice. The case study research forms a significant part of this research, because it gives insight in three important aspects that help to answer the main research question. First of all, the results of the case study research make it possible to reflect whether or not the current of risk management of land development activities in municipalities is consistent with the principles of ‘good’ risk management. Second, the case study research identifies lessons to be learnt, distinguished in areas of concern and learning points, regarding risk management of land development activities which are useful for other municipalities. Finally, the case study research provides insight in what aspects encourage and what aspects hinder the successful implementation of measures to improve risk management in municipalities. The objective of this research is to improve the risk management within Dutch municipal land agencies in such a way that their risk assessment with respect to land development projects becomes more effective.","risk management; land development; municipality; memorandum on risk management; risk awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Built Environment and Spatial Development","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, C. (mentor); Reitsema, A.D. (mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); De Waardt, H. (mentor)","2016","In the last few decades great progression has been made in the research and development of a fairly new type of concrete called ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). This high-tech material has excellent material properties compared to conventional concrete and has the potential to make more slender and lighter structures. However the material is still very expensive and requires designers to minimize material usage in order to make an economic structure. Up to today only few structures are built using UHPC, despite that it seems that the application of UHPC has plenty of potential. Especially in long span bridges it can be a very viable solution. Because the self-weight of the structure makes up a significant part of the total loading on the structure, the material saving ability of the material has a double effect. On the one hand the material saving reduces material costs, on the other hand the material saving causes a considerable reduction of the total loading on the structure. To fully benefit from these effects, the material use should be kept to a minimum. This can be achieved by finding a structural concept that utilizes the excellent material properties of UHPC as much as possible. UHPC has a very high compressive strength combined with excellent shear capacity. Besides that it is suitable for very high levels of prestress to resist tensile forces. A study using design calculations for rectangular cross-sections have shown that the application of UHPC instead of conventional concrete leads to a significant reduction of the required volume of concrete. This holds especially for shear elements and tensile elements with a high level of prestress. Since box beams has webs as shear elements and a bottom flange as a prestressed tensile member, UHPC box beams are chosen as the best solution for long span UHPC bridges. The application of UHPC can optimize the box-shaped cross-section in several ways. Very slender beams can be made by applying a high level of prestress. Also wider beams with very thin webs can be made thanks to the high shear capacity. For this master thesis five different types of UHPC box beams are developed. These optimized box beams are designed for bridges spanning 60m, 70m, 80m, 85m and 90m. The most important advantages of these UHPC box beams over box beams made of conventional concrete are: • The beams are more slender: • The beams are wider: o Less beams have to be manufactured, transported and assembled, decreasing the amount of time and labor required to build the bridge. • The beams are lighter: o The total loading of the bridge is decreased by the lower self-weight. o They are easier to transport and to hoist. o Longer beams up to 90m can be made without exceeding the 170t weight-limit for transport by road. These benefits allow the UHPC box beams to be a fit solution for spans that are too long for conventional box beam solutions, without having to build an intermediate pier or to switch to segmented or cast in-situ solutions. Moreover they can replace old bridges with a stronger one without having to replace the substructure. Therefore it can be concluded that UHPC beams provide build new bridges and replace old bridges with minimal traffic hindrance.","long span; concrete; bridge; ultra-high performance concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural and Building Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Damme, M. (mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Peeters, P. (mentor)","2016","This thesis discusses the breach initiation processes at the land-side slope of a dike, due to overflow and wave overtopping. To date still little is known about the actual failure process of land-side slope covers. Therefore, starting in 2007, numerous wave overtopping experiments have been executed in The Netherlands and Belgium using a wave overtopping simulator. This simulator simulates different kinds of storm events by releasing volumes of water over the land-side slope according to a predetermined schedule. Flanders Hydraulics Research and Delft University of Technology per- formed another wave overtopping experiment in November 2015. The wave overtopping simulator as well as a new designed overflow simulator were used to test the breach initiation processes of the land-side slope of a river-dike adjacent to the river Scheldt, near the Wijmeers-II polder in Belgium. The data obtained from this experiment is presented in this thesis, and was used to evaluate current damage initiation theories. Currently the most advanced approach for determining the amount of erosion, or ’damage’, to the land-side slope is the ’Excess volume approach’ by Hughes [17, 18] who based his model on earlier developed models by Van der Meer [36] and Dean et al. [10]. This approach determines damage on the land-side slope based on overflow theories and overflow experiments (CIRIA experiments [13]). An overtopping wave is thereby modelled as a very short overflow event in which damage is assumed to be bottom shear stress induced. The Excess volume approach has therefore been applied on the Wijmeers-II data in order to verify the predictive accuracy of this theory. Contrary to the experimental outcome, the Excess volume approach predicted a heavier damage on the overflow test sections than on the wave overtopping test section. Due to these test results the correct representation of reality of the Excess volume approach is questioned in this thesis. Extensive investigation of video material obtained during the experiments showed that overtopping waves separate from the slope before reattaching with the slope. This separation time leads to a jet flow impacting the slope under an angle. Due to a decrease in discharge during a wave overtopping, the impact location moves towards the crest within the overtopping time of a wave. This discovery led to the development of a new modelling approach in which this phenomenon is considered. In this new ’Wave impact approach’, damage on the grass cover is assumed to be caused by wave overtopping induced jet pressures in cracks in the grass cover. These cracks are present due to weather conditions and temperature influences in the supporting clay layer. Wave overtopping induced jet pressure in the crack pushes the walls further aside leading to growth of the crack. This crack growth continues until the pressure in the crack becomes too high and grass aggregates are lifted from the cover. This crack growth is assumed to only occur when the wave overtopping induced jet pressure in the crack exceeds a critical pressure threshold Pc. The location at which the highest cumulative excess impulse load occurs is the location at which the most damage is expected. Verification of the theory against other experiments confirms the theory.","wave overtopping; wave impact; dike; land-side slope failure; breach initiation; breaching process; overflow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Tomas, J.M. (mentor)","2016","When looking at domains with several building densities, the resulting average concentrations caused by traffic when unknown, are often linearised between known building densities. To verify if this assumption is correct, several cases of street canyons with intersections, are simulated using the DALESURBAN model. The traffic is represented by a constant emission line source spanning the entire width of the periodic domain. The building density is increased, by increasing the span wise width of the obstacles, while keeping the obstacle height and stream wise obstacle width constant. The aspect ratio of the street canyons is kept constant for all cases and thereby remains in the skimming flow regime. Four span wise obstacle widths are compared in this study and tested under four wind angles ranging from perpendicular to the street canyon to almost parallel to the street canyon. To test the effects of obstacle placement on the spreading of pollutant, the obstacles are placed in an constant and non-constant pattern. For the constant spreading the stream wise streets are all of equal width, and for the non-constant pattern, a wide street is followed by a small street resulting in an alternating pattern. The resulting mean volume-averaged concentrations for the cases above complemented with, mean retention time, ACH and PCH at roof level of the volume show a linear trend for almost all cases. The exceptions in this linear trend are found at the non-perpendicular wind angles. Where at the two lowest wind angles and the highest building density, the pollutant is recirculated in the domain through the span wise periodic boundaries, resulting in a steep increase in mean volume-averaged concentration and mean retention time. Another exception is there for the wind angle just below the perpendicular one, where a large concentration is contained in the cavity at high building density, which is not present at lower building densities.","street canyon; cavity; pollution; traffic; intersections; LES; numerical; building density; front facing area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Verlinden, J.C. (mentor)","2016","Additive manufacturing (AM) is currently a highly discussed topic in the media. However, for the industry the impact of AM is far from clear. Based on previous projects and experience within the AM market, Berenschot identified opportunities in supporting organisations with AM related organisational and economic consulting services. A problem in the knowledge intensive service business is that services are difficult to scale. In order to increase the output of the total Berenschot AM value proposition, a structured service needs to be developed. In this assignment two challenges arise. First, insights have to be developed in how AM could have an impact on an Original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Secondly, a method for identifying these opportunities within an OEM has to be developed. Based on the assignment the following research question is formulated; “How can opportunities for the use of additive manufacturing be identified and quantified during the exploration phase of this new technology, in order to support strategic decision making about additive manufacturing within an organization?” Firstly an analysis of AM technologies gave insight in the status quo of the technology; the basics of the AM technologies (I), the unique aspects of AM compared to conventional technologies (II), and how AM can be applied as production technology (III). Six technologies are identified as currently most used. Two paradoxes are solved by AM; ‘increasing complexity in parts increases costs and thus needs to be avoided’ and ‘variety between products results in higher costs and thus needs to be avoided’. AM can be applied for the production of parts in three ways; the production of prototypes, the production of tooling and the production of functional end-parts. Secondly a series of best practices of AM are analysed in order to create the basis for a framework. The cases, which are used to develop these best practices, were drawn from secondary data and are verified with literature or interviews. The best practices are grouped in in five categories; Improved product design More customization Support parts Cost effective, fast or flexible supply chain Prototyping & bridge manufacturing The framework serves multiple goals; internally the framework serves as a boundary object to communicate the applications areas of AM (I). Furthermore, the framework provides a starting point for further development of the quantification model for the adoption of AM (II). Lastly, the best practice from which the framework was developed provides a case database which can be used for communication of applications of AM towards a client (III). Thirdly, the context for the identification service which will be developed for Berenschot is sketched. A literature study is performed on the topics of; new product development (I), co-creation (II), co-creation within AM (III) and creative problem solving (IV). Theories from literature are the basis on which the service can be further developed. The literature analysis is followed by an internal analysis of Berenschot, here the company structure (I), the culture (II) and the AM value proposition (III) are analysed. The internal analysis is followed by an external analysis. Here the AM eco-system (I), the competitors (II) and market trends (III) are discussed. At last, a customer analysis is performed. Fourthly, the identification service is designed and developed. Based on the assignment, internal and external research the following design objective was formulated as; “Design a consulting service for the original equipment manufacturer market. This service aims to find opportunities for AM and how these opportunities can be applied in an OEM. Furthermore, the service should give an estimation about the value these opportunities have for the client. The directions should be found and framed in cooperation with employees from different departments of the organisation. The identification and quantification should take place in a timespan of around 3 weeks. The outcome should give the client insights in the potential of AM and create internal support for further research into these areas.” The goal of the 3DP exploration is to help organisations in the fuzzy front end of the innovation process; finding AM related research areas and building a business case in order to select the most valuable opportunities. The 3DP exploration aims at combining best practices about additive manufacturing with the tacit and implicit knowledge of the organisation, in order to find application areas for AM. This process is an co-creation process. The 3DP exploration is designed to contain six main stages preceded by an intake meeting, these are; Setting the challenge Preparing the resource group Idea generation Creative session Concept valuation Concept selection In the end, the design of the 3DP exploration aims on achieving multiple goals. Generating acceptance for additive manufacturing among higher level management (I) as well as creating acceptance and awareness among stakeholders in the operational level (II). Besides that, the 3DP exploration provides higher level management with the resource to make investment decisions on AM (III) and provides the operational level with specific research areas where added value of AM can be found (IV). The factors for further implementation of the framework and 3DP exploration are discussed. First, the business model behind the 3D exploration is discussed. Two business models for the Berenschot 3DP Exploration exist. Based on this thesis a preferred set up is expressed. Secondly, success factors for the 3DP exploration are discussed; the Berenschot consultant guiding the 3DP exploration (I) and overcoming scepticism of clients (II). Lastly, the design and organisational aspects are examined, these need to be addressed in order to further develop the framework and the 3DP exploration; obtaining commercial usage right for the cases (I), verifying the need for 3DP exploration (II), performing an end-user test (III), development of a partners overview (IV) and implementing cost-factors in the framework (V).","additive manufacturing; 3D printen; co-creation; strategic product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","","",""

(mentor); Lambrecht, M. (mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2016","The nunchaku (also known as nunchucks), an exotic weapon popularised by Bruce Lee in his famous martial arts films, was adopted in the 80s as the centre piece in a dynamic martial art (nunchaku-do), founded by a small Dutch group of enthusiasts led by Milco Lambrecht. Due to the high speed of match play nunchaku-do, its referees experience problems when observing scores, and determining who struck first, especially in the case of near-simultaneous scoring attempts. Evidently, referees have insufficient tools at their disposal to let transparent sports justice be done. There is therefore significant potential for the deployment of smart materials and sensor technology as decision aids to bridge this gap. A series of experiments and tinkering exercises was staged, to refine a list of eligible sensor technologies, and what they need in order to perform reliably. These activities revealed that tactile sensors and inertial sensors offered the most promise for detecting the impacts from a player’s attempted score. This inspired the formation of three potential design directions that made use of these technologies. One of these directions was developed further, leading to a sophisticated suggestion for a custom pressure sensor matrix which is integrated in a traditional safety nunchaku’s handles, effectively turning it into a smart nunchaku. This embedded sensor, boasting an array of pressure-sensitive points instead of only one large area, detects differences in the types of contact it makes, enabling it to recognise strikes, (re)grips, and blocks, for the referee’s benefit. A small microcontroller, paired with a wireless transmitter, relays these conclusions to a master device, which relays the information to referees, who are then able to better make their calls. This intermediary feedback could be seen as an additional sense for the referee, rather than a device that attempts to claim or override the referee’s ontological authority. A series of iterative prototypes for the proposed design’s sensor were developed to test the sensor's performance. A first proof of concept was developed on a smaller scale, and confirmed that the pressure sensor could provide reliable and consistent output values. A second, full-scale version of the pressure sensor matrix was successfully embedded in a safety nunchaku, keeping the original materials intact as much as possible. A battery-powered microcontroller with the capacity to wirelessly broadcast sensor data over Bluetooth was mounted to the experimental nunchaku, to record, process, and transmit recorded sensor data. To assess how well the proposed sensor can distinguish strikes, regrips, blocks, and failed regrips, these actions were all performed and recorded in a test setup, using the constructed full-scale prototype. A high speed camera was used to record video in tandem with the sensor, so that the values obtained could be carefully compared to the camera’s frame data. The sensor’s ability to separate (re)grips from strikes (score attempts), which is by far the most essential feature needed for the sensor to perform as a decision aid, was confirmed through the experiment, though the pattern behind grips turned out to be different than had been predicted earlier. Estimation of a strike’s contact surface area and force proved feasible, perhaps even to the extent of being able to reliably detect blocked strikes. Failed regrips, where a practitioner attempts a regrip but fails to clutch the nunchaku’s handle, could not be distinguished from strikes. These observations resulted in an updated and experimentally verified pressure event distinction heuristic. A series of calibrations and vector calculations were performed on raw sensor data, in order to judge the pressure sensor matrix’ ability to determine a resultant force over time. This resultant over time would be considered indicative of the force a fighter has put behind an individual scoring attempt. Though the sensor appears to have the required operational range and resolution to establish this metric, further tests are needed to verify its applicability in terms of establishing an accepted force range for players’ strikes. The technology behind the sensor could also prove useful for many other situations where specific types of pressure are to be identified, especially considering the affordable, maker-friendly properties of the materials used.","design; combat sport; sensor; pressure; force; martial arts; nunchaku; smart material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","In April and May 2015 two earthquakes devastated Nepal. Thousands died and a manifold of these were left homeless. In order to aid the reconstruction of Nepal, Delft University of Technology initiated a research project called Shock Safe Nepal, in which multiple teams build on each other’s topics in order to help rebuild Nepal in an earthquake safe manner. A first team performed a reconnaissance mission and made a broad problem assessment of the current situation of Nepal. Building upon this work, our team investigated the current situation (February and March 2016) in rural Nepal. What solutions can be integrated in rural Nepal in order to make it earthquake safe? And how can these solutions be made both durable and permanent? In order to leave a lasting impression, not only has the feasibility of the solutions been taken into account, but also the needs and wishes of the local population. To dissipate the solutions into society, a profound understanding of the social and educational network in rural Nepal is highly necessary. Our team has examined the rural area in the development region of Central Nepal with a focus on the Sindhulpalchok, Rasuwa, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Makwanpur and Dolakha districts. An initial case study has been performed in the village of Ratankot (Sindhupalchok). The technical investigation concentrated on the few buildings that were still standing, the techniques they employed and the damages they sustained. The social investigation included meetings with a number of key people in the village, as well as a survey among the local population and an up-close observation of the rebuilding process. Our findings of this case study have been validated in various other rural villages. The output of our research can be divided in four end-products: A technical damage evaluation, a social and educational representation of Nepal, a future-oriented approach to urban planning in these rural areas, and finally a strategic action-plan on how to integrate shock-safe solutions. The technical damage evaluation expands on the destruction that has directly been done by the earthquake, on what repairs are possible for the buildings and on the essentials a building should include in order to augment the safety of the houses regarding earthquakes. The social and educational representation elaborates on the working and interaction with local communities in rural Nepal. It discusses the best way to approach the local population in order to leave a lasting impression. The urban planning approach describes a long-term view of developing the rural settlements throughout Nepal. The team’s field experience in rural Nepal led to observations on internal strengths and weaknesses which are inherent to rural Nepal. The strategic action plan discusses a short-term, a mid-term, and a long-term strategy, recommended for implementing an earthquake safe environment in rural Nepal. The purpose of this research is to be a logical step in a series of research projects which will contribute to the reconstruction of an earthquake safe environment in Nepal. It can be used as consultation advice, guideline or as a base for in-depth follow up research on one of the included topics.","Social Assessment; Nepal; Earthquake; Damage Assessment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering / Construction, Management & Engineering","","Shock Safe Nepal, Multidisciplinary project","MP193","27.704700,85.823559"

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Chua, V.P. (mentor)","2016","The Guayas River estuary supports extensive socio-economic processes. It is formed at the confluence of the Babahoyo and Daule Rivers and runs for around 65 km before discharging into the Pacific Ocean. Its relevance within the national context is linked to the city of Guayaquil, the most populated city and commercial capital of Ecuador. Recently it was considered the main seaborne trading route for the country. Nowadays the estuary experiences a number of sedimentation related issues which hinder its navigability and increase the potential risk of flooding in the northern low lying areas of Guayaquil. Although these problems have been accentuating over the years, little is known about the estuary’s morphological evolution. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to provide a comprehensive explanation of the estuary's morphological development and the processes behind its evolution. In this regard, a morphodynamic numerical model was implemented using the software Delft3D Flexible Mesh. The estuary itself has not been the subject of many studies related to morphology. The lack of information was one of the major challenges for this research, especially in relation to bed topography. In order to cope with this, state of the art techniques were applied to derive the missing data. This is the basis to set up the model for the different scenarios that simulate natural events and anthropic interventions carried out within the estuary and that have been identified as some of the potential causes of sedimentation. A total of five events or so called 'interventions' were defined, namely: the reduction of intertidal areas due to mangrove deforestation and shrimp farms, El Ni{\~n}o phenomenon, the construction of the Daule-Peripa dam at the headwaters of the Daule River, the construction of the 'Puente de la Unidad Nacional' bridge over the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers near their confluence and finally the sediment overload due to deforestation of the upstream basin. The final analysis of the different cases determined that the changes in tidal asymmetry are the main causes of sedimentation and the overall estuary morphological evolution. Amongst others, the leading contributors to this tidal variability can be attributed to the discharge of the Daule and Babahoyo Rives and the decimation of intertidal areas. Depending on the magnitude of the discharges, the predominant flood dominant character of the estuary is either reduced or even shifted towards ebb dominance. This is verified when the hydrographs peak during the wet season particularly in the higher regions near the confluence of the rivers. The intertidal flats, on the other hand, have been severely reduced due to increased shrimp farming practices and the sequential loss of mangrove forests along the estuary banks. This has principally reduced hydraulic friction and natural wave damping effects which has ultimately enhanced flood dominance. It was also concluded that events such as the bridge construction over the Daule and Babahoyo Rivers as well as the sediment overload related to deforestation of the upstream basin are of minor importance. In view of the above, in order to control the sedimentation in the estuary and especially around Guayaquil, three alternatives are proposed (or a combination of them) as potential mitigating measures. The first is to control the discharge of the Daule River through the operation of the Daule-Peripa dam. The second is to recover some of the intertidal flats which have been decimated by aquaculture practices. The third is to dredge the area of the estuary close to Guayaquil. The final solution requires a more detailed study. However it will involve a compromise between the cost of dredging and the decreased profit from hydro power generation and aquaculture.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-2.185760,-79.865316"

The relative new techniques of additive manufacturing are becoming more mature and beneficial for businesses. One of the latest developments is Direct Metal Laser Sintering of titanium-alloy: Ti-6Al-4V, a material widely used in high-tech, high performance, medical, and flexure based applications. Flexures are beam shaped appliances that allow small displacements by bending the material, while constraining movement in other directions. In this project, Mechanical properties of the material are studied on the level of research and development. In particular the influence of build orientation is investigated by means of testing samples printed at 0° , 45° and 90°. Results should indicate the mechanical properties and whether build orientation should be considered during design of flexure based products. It was found that samples deviate in dimension from the design, and high surface roughness values were measured mainly in the 90° and 45° build orientation. Ultimate tensile strength shows small differences in between build orientations. Also the fatigue limit estimations according to Dixon-Mood shows difference in between build orientations and both show that the 0° build orientation is the strongest and most fatigue resistant. The results clearly show that build orientation should be accounted for when designing flexure based products for production with DMLS of Ti-6Al-4V. As the tests were performed on the level of research and development and also some inconsistency is found in the test results and further testing for reliability is recommended.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering and Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Verburg, R.M. (mentor); Van der Voort, H. (mentor)","2016","Since Bourgeois III and Eisenhardt (1988) have introduced their ground breaking study discussing the concept of environmental velocity, which describes how fast and continuous/discontinuous the organizational environment of a company changes in all the relevant dimensions which affect the company i.e. the dimensions of technology, demand, regulation and competition, much research has followed on this topic. However the research has come up short in several ways. First of it has assumed the industry to have the same type of speed for every dimension and thus termed industries as high or low velocity industries without taking into account that dimensions can differ in terms of their speed which makes it unjustified to term an industry merely as a high or low velocity industry. An example for this is the reference of the biotechnology industry as a high velocity industry even though product development times are around 10-20 years in this industry. Secondly the research only takes into account the speed of change, and mostly neglected the continuity of change measured though the concept of direction of change. However the direction of change is an important concept which can help characterize the environment and in turn enable researchers and managers alike to understand the industry in which a company is operating in better. Furthermore most of the research has been done on a conceptual level and neglected actual operationalisations and measurements of the velocities of the industries. There are only few studies that have operationalized and measured the environmental velocity, and those that have done so have neglected the direction of change. Alignment literature has found that matching internal processes and capabilities to the external environment has positive performance implications for the firm. Regarding a temporal dimension previous studies have found that matching the internal rates of change to the external rates of change is beneficial for the company and should be strived for (Kwee 2009, Ben-Menahem, Kwee et al. 2013). We aim to bring together these two research streams and build upon the theory of environmental velocity as well as the alignment literature. One research objective is to advance research about environmental velocity by taking into account the discontinuity through the concept of direction of change and operationalizing and measuring it in a comprehensive way. Another one is to challenge the predominant view in existing literature that an environment can be described with one single velocity which sums up all dimensions. This is done with the help of velocity homology, a concept which assesses how dis(similar) the different dimensions of the industry are to each other. Thus the fact that dimensions have different speeds and continuities is taken into account which results in a multidimensional conceptualization of the environmental velocity concept. In order to get a better understanding of the performance of companies in different velocity conditions this concept will then be used to see how companies have managed to align their internal actions to the environment. Furthermore an objective is to test the interrelationship of the alignment of internal and external rates and directions of change and the performance of the companies in the aircraft and the semiconductor industries, two industries which are both high technology industries and have been previously described as low and high velocity industries respectively. In order fulfil the research objective several different steps were taken. First a thorough literature review was conducted on the topic of environmental velocity with the aim of finding all possible relevant dimensions which were deemed to be product, technology, demand, regulation and competition. Subsequently the possible operationalisations and measurements for the speed and continuity of the five dimensions was assessed and the difficulties that have limited previous research highlighted. One of the main findings is that the continuity of an industry (direction of change) must be assessed through qualitative analysis which limits the possibility of researching this concept due to the required time of assessing it. Furthermore literature review on alignment theory with a temporal context revealed that alignment of internal processes and capabilities to the external environment was found to be positively related to performance and that positive misalignment is superior to negative misalignment which built the propositions for our analysis. Followingly a short introduction and informative background about the two industries and the focal companies, namely Intel and Boeing were given. Then each measure for the rate of change (speed characteristic) and direction of change (continuity characteristic) for the three chosen dimensions, namely product, technology and demand was discussed and analysed in detail. Whereas for both the aircraft and semiconductor industry the rate of changes were measured through equal indicators, namely change in number of new product generations (product), change in number of new patents (technology), change in sales (demand), the direction of change was different and customized for each industry except for the demand dimension (change in trend in sales). For the semiconductor industry this was the minimum feature size (technology) the ratio of clock speed to price (product), whereas for the aircraft industry it was the range, capacity and fuel efficiency per seat (product). For the technology dimension a purely qualitative study was undertaken which indicated that no discontinuous change had taken place over the last 25 years. As the operationalization of the direction of change requires an in depth case study of the industries it becomes clear why there has almost been no study measuring the concept of direction of change despite its relevance when analyzing an industry in terms of its velocity. On the basis of this analysis the velocity homologies of the industries were assessed. It was found that there were considerable heterogeneity in between the dimensions for both industries. Nonetheless we find that the semiconductor industry has rather high rates and directions of change in comparison with the aircraft industry. Finally the interrelation between aligning the internal rates and directions of change and the performance of the firm are assessed. For the rate of change closer alignment is connected to higher performance in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore positive misalignment is associated with better performance than negative misalignment which is in line with our expectations. For the aircraft industry at first no effect of alignment on performance could be detected. However after controlling for the extreme high fluctuations in the product dimension results are in line with the propositions. Even though further research is needed to confirm our findings we can say that in general our results show that alignment is beneficial for the company. We thus find that it is crucial for a manager to understand the environment the company is operating in taking into account all the different dimensions and then try to align the company to the external conditions. This however is connected to some challenges. If the velocities associated with the different environmental dimensions are similar (high homology environment) all organizational activities should be aligned to this uniform environmental velocity. This is rather straightforward and simpler to manage. If, on the other hand, the velocity dimensions differ significantly (low-homology environment), the firm will have to align its internal activities to these dissimilar rates and directions of change, which will lead to heterogeneous sets of paces and directions of activities within the firm. This situation can pose a real challenge since it will bring about potential incoherence among subunits. A possible solution to this are modular and flexible structures which allow room for experimentation. This can possibly help the company to be more open and flexible to change and operate at the necessary speed at all levels. Further studies should take into account the other dimensions of the environmental velocity concept. Furthermore more industries or the same industries with more data points should be studied and other factors influencing the performance should be controlled for.","Environmental velocity; Alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics & Finance","","Management of Technology","",""

In order to support design efforts to increase the performance of a SCWG process setup, a model library for a steady-state one-dimensional thermo-?uid system model assuming non-reacting pure water as ?uid medium for the relevant process components (heat exchanger, ?uidized bed reactor and heater) was developed in Dymola modeling environment using Modelica language. The models include different heat transfer and hydrodynamics phenomena while they also account for the in?uence of biomass conversion on the thermal behavior of the system using enthalpy corrections provided by a kinetic AspenPlus® model. The range of investigated process operating conditions includes temperature levels of 20-600 °C, pressure levels of 220-300 bar and mass ?ow rates of 35-1000 kg/h. To validate the model, experiments have been performed with a research dedicated setup (SCWG-100) developed by Gensos B.V.. The acquired data allowed for a qualitative and quantitative validation of the preheater section, heat exchanger operating at supercritical pressure and trans-critical temperature conditions. Moreover, one data-set of the novel scaled-up gasi?cation unit (SCWG-500) with patented ?uidized bed reactor and advanced heat recovery was used for further model validation. The main focus for the validation was on the various preselected heat transfer correlations for supercritical water of which the correlation of Yamagata et al. caused the best alignment with the measured data predicting the inlet-outlet temperatures with a mean error of 1.9 K. The validation of the enthalpy correction approach showed good agreements with the measurement data. It was concluded that 1D modeling is found to well-predict the thermal heat transfer behavior at given conditions on system level. Subsequently, an extensive heat exchanger sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to the resulting heat exchanger effectiveness. A similarly comprehensive study on the heat exchanger behavior at supercritical pressure and trans-critical temperature levels is not available in literature. Furthermore, simulations of the SCWG-100 and SCWG-500 setups were performed in system con?guration at multiple relevant operating conditions. The expected effect of heat transfer enhancement in the reactor due to the presence of bed particles was successfully investigated by introducing a heat transfer coef?cient enhancement factor. The results provide essential information on potential design changes to further optimize the thermal behavior with respect to conversion condition criteria. The heating rates of both setups showed good results compared to other studies concluding heating rates constraints in order to avoid tar/char formation and therefore increase the carbon gasi?cation ef?ciency. The residence times predicted by the models indicate potential for further optimization which has to be experimentally con?rmed for the variety of different biomass feedstock and concentration.","supercritical water gasi?cation; supercritical heat transfer; Modelica; heat recovery; supercritical ?uidized bed; biomass","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2016","CONTEXT With the rise of smart connected products the user will have more and more products to monitor and control directly (and remotely). Although these products bring us new benefits, these products also have downsides. Connected products are significantly more complex. Not only installing a connected product requires more steps, but also the daily use differs because these products are able to notify its users any time and thereby demand attention. Connected products require the user to invest the time and energy in understanding them. Because of these flaws, we need smart connected products that we can use in intuitive ways, so that the benefits can be experienced without having to understand a lot of complex information. A solution is to allow smart connected products to act autonomously. An artificial intelligence changes the interaction with a smart connected product from ‘using it’ to ‘collaborating with it’. For interaction designers, the question then is how to shift the emphasis from designing ‘products’ to designing ‘intelligent collaborations between humans and non-humans’. In his current research at the Connected Everyday Lab Marco Rozendaal calls this new type of products that can sense, respond to and cooperate in human activity in an autonomous manner ‘Objects with Intent’. To design Objects with Intent, designers must learn how to position objects in human activity as collaborative partners; how to design for shared control between people and objects; and how to design the expressiveness of objects that are mundane, and yet intelligent as they can reason and act autonomously. PROJECT GOAL The aim of this project was to investigate Objects with Intent and formulate guidelines for designing them. This was done by designing an Object with Intent that users can learn to trust to operate and manage smart technology in their homes. This object should decentralise the user in the network of the Internet of Things. The object should prevent the user from being overwhelmed with unnecessary information, but more importantly, it should relieve the user from certain tasks without giving the user the feeling that he/she is losing control. A promising strategy for creating a perception of life, intention and personality is Van Allen’s Animism. During the project I applied this strategy to every activity, so not only to the design of the Object with Intent, but also when analysing the current connected products. “When you look at any lifeless product as a character you see it does have a personality.” CONCEPT: DIEM Diem is a smart lighting controller that helps the user fall asleep in order to have a good night’s rest. Thereby Diem creates a healthy balance between day and night. Diem knows when you need to go to bed and automatically adjusts lighting conditions by dimming the light gradually. The user can adjust the light setting as well. However, this is not without consequences. The prototype has a clear mind on what the best setting is. It will ‘protest’ if the user raises the light setting above the maximum allowed setting for that time and it will make sure that the proper light setting is maintained, and will become stricter, the later it gets. OUTCOME Aspects of the Object with Intent the designer should focus on, avoid and keep in mind. Focus The Object with Intent should have a clear purpose. The Object with Intent should show clarity in behaviour. There should be a common ground for the user and the Object with Intent to meet in order to communicate. Avoid Avoid letting the Object with Intent be too bossy -> In the end, who calls out the shots? Don’t go too high-tech. Keep in mind When using Animism as a design-strategy, define the character of the Object with Intent. The right amount of complexity of the artificial intelligence gives it character. The Object with Intent will confront the user and will therefore evoke strong reactions from the user.","Object with Intent; Research through design; Internet of Things; smart technology; smart product; connected product; interaction design; animism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor); Lemen, P.L.A. (mentor); Ahammout, M. (mentor)","2016","Dealing with waste in a proper way is part of the shift from a linear to a circular economy. Sorting waste is an essential step in the recycling process. Making households sort their waste is a challenge. Rotterdam is one of the lesser performing municipalities of the Netherlands. In general, high-rise households sort their waste below average, but have also less extensive services from the government. Therefore, this group gets special attention. Household waste in Rotterdam consists mainly of organic waste, plastic, paper, glass and textile. Plastic is the most important fraction in this case, since it covers almost half of the volume and has the largest negative environmental impact. Sorting more plastic will also result in less financial costs. On the one hand it saves incineration costs, on the other hand the government receives a compensation. Less costs is translated into a lower waste levy. A user research was conducted with 17 participants living in Rotterdam. In this research all participants were interviewed, they did a sorting assignment and their current waste storage was photographed. Most of the 17 participants think sorting waste is good, but only 5 are sorting plastic. Literature research conducted by Cees Midden shows that in general sorting habits are hard to change, even when the person is willing to start sorting. Getting rid of waste is experienced as a routine, and not something to reconsider. The action of actually buying a bin for sorting is a big mental step. The solution lies in two different area’s; ‘raising awareness’, and ‘activation’. In both area’s the government of Rotterdam plays a key role. Raising awareness can be done by an extensive and very visual waste glossy. Activation can be done by giving away attractive recycle bins for free, or for a very low price.","circular; household waste; recycling; sorting; waste bin; waste glossy; Rotterdam; high-rise households","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Sustainability","","52.001541, 4.369808"

(mentor); Jacobs, J.G.C.C. (mentor)","2016","Roll motion damping has been an important issue since mankind started building ships. Naval architects have always tried to reduce the roll motion as much as possible for comfort, structural strength and operational limits. In this thesis the effects of using ballast water as active or passive roll damping system are investigated. The goal is to improve the motion behavior of barge shaped vessels owned by Boskalis, such as the Taklift 6. These vessels are used extensively on the North Sea. The roll behavior in waves is quite critical for the operational limits, so being able to reduce those motions with a damping system could improve the workability. The North Sea is a region where the most common wave frequency and the eigenfrequency of most barge shaped vessels owned by Boskalis are very close to each other, which may cause severe roll motion even with relative low waves. In this thesis the vessel 'Taklift 6' has been simulated with an active and passive damping system. The time domain simulations have been performed using the software 'OrcaFlex', while the damping system is programmed as an extension to OrcaFlex in the programming language Python. Both the active and passive system show improvement in motion behavior; the spectral density for the roll motion decreases. As a result the operational limits and thus the workability of the vessel can be increased. The increase in operational limits is not very significant though. The increase in operational limit is theoretically interesting, but in reality the improvement is probably not significant enough to make an actual difference in workability. The active system performs only slightly better than the passive system in some simulated cases, and performs worse in other cases. This might be an optimization error as the controller has only been tuned manually. The advantage of an active system would be to be able to compensate for small motions and to be able to respond earlier to vessel motions, but a passive system might be a better fit, as it damps the roll behavior while the complexity of a passive system is simpler compared to an active system and no external power is required. Within the passive system, the motion of the mass could be limited by using air valves on top of each tank to create a semi-passive system. The semi-passive system is not researched within this thesis report. Further model tests should be performed to test the best setup for a damping system. The location and space required might be an issue on some vessels and the effect of different location for the damping system should be researched. Overall a damping system can give a reduction for the roll motion of barge shaped vessels, but the inprovement in operational limts is not significant. Further research into the design and costs aspects is required to make a decision whether a damping system would be beneficial to use in barge shaped vessels. The damping controller should also be improved to optimize the damping behavior and include sloshing effects in the simulations.","Barge; Heavy lift; Roll damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Floating offshore structures","","52.0023574, 4.3720259"

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor); Ronner, E. (mentor); Van Leengoed, M. (mentor); Raijmakers, J. (mentor)","2016","This project presents the result of a new proposal to improve telemonitoring and self-management for heart failure patients: The Health Dashboard. The Health Dashboard is designed for Philips in collaboration with the Reinier the Graaf hospital in Delft. It aims to reduce the chance on readmissions, to reassure heart failure patients about their health, to increase adherence in daily monitoring and to provide reliable insights about patient’s health to the medical team. It is used in the bathroom of the patient and is provided during the 30 days after a hospital admission. An integrated design process is executed from a strategic start towards a feasibility study in the end. Exploring opportunities. Studies towards the effect of telemonitoring show many contradictions, however well implemented with a multi-pronged approach it can have positive influences on reducing readmissions and improving quality of life. Literature is analysed to define strengths and weaknesses of telemonitoring systems and compared with promising health care trends. Two search areas are chosen to focus on: (1)“Enriching measurements with context information to reduce false alarms” and (2)“Tailoring telemonitoring systems to individual preferences to improve adherence and to reassure patients” Discover Three researchers are performed to gain insights in patient profiles, communication between stakeholders and increasing monitoring adherence. Patient profiles: the project combines the patient profiles defined by Philips with the insights model. This resulted in four profiles: Analyst (involved in treatment and relies on doctors advice), Fighter (involved in treatment and follows own path), Sensitive (passive in treatment and relies on doctors advice) and Optimist (passive in treatment and follows own path). Communication between stakeholders: The medical team wants to have insights in the amount of fluid retention from the patient. Therefore the patient needs to weigh himself every morning and watch for symptoms such as breathlessness. Increasing adherence: The behaviour change theory from Jonathan Haidt about the rider, elephant and environment is used to improve adherence in monitoring behaviour. Next reminders are provided according the Fogg model that describes that motivation and ability should be increased to let these reminders succeed. The content of these reminders is based on the six persuasive techniques from Cialdini: Authority, Consensus, Consistency and commitment, Scarcity, Liking and Reciprocity. Define & Develop After a comprehensive ideation and conceptualisation phase, the Health Dashboard has been developed. It has four main functions: (1) Prepare (increasing motivation and ability), (2) Trigger (Providing reminders with the right content on the right time) , (3) Measure (measuring weight and respiration rate with use of a weight scale and bed sensor) and (4) Feedback (reassuring patients and adding context information to measurements). Design The Health Dashboard tailors its behaviour towards individual patients with use of both explicit and implicit profiling. It can be described by its main functions: 1. Prepare: An external application increases motivation by providing education and the ability to set own goals. The health dashboard itself increases motivation by providing rewards after measurements. 2. Trigger: A passive motion sensor detects when the patient enters the bathroom. The Health Dashboard illuminates with a blue colour and shows, depending on patients adherence and patient profile, a message based on the principles of Cialdini. 3. Measure: The system of Health Dashboard contains a connected bed sensor and weight scale. These measurements are used to define a health score that ranges from 1 to 5. A health-score 5 means that all measurements are stable. Patients can add context information to measurements by answering questions on the device. 4. Reassure: The Health Dashboard reassures patients in a tailored way, and illuminates in a green colour if the health status is stable. Patients with a fighter profile will only see the green colour whereas patient with a sensitive profile will see a reassuring message. The hypothesis is that patients will be reassured more by showing a health score instead of rough measurement data, which will result in a lower chance on readmissions and better quality of life. This project can be a start of further research towards a new innovative approach in telemonitoring cardiac patients.","Health Dashboard; Heart Failure; Reducing Readmissions; Patient profiles; Behaviour change; Telemonitoring; Self-management; Medical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""
